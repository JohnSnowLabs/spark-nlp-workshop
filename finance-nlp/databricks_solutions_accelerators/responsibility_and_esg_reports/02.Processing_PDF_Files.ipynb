Over this same time \n","frame, we have made a business of selling ammonia \n","and other derivative fertilizer products such as urea \n","and urea ammonium nitrate (UAN) for the energy \n","that the nitrogen component of ammonia provides to \n","plants, which increases crop yields. \n","Humankind’s ability to produce nitrogen fertilizer has \n","had an undeniably positive effect on the world. Along \n","with advancements in seed technology and farming \n","practices, the use of nitrogen fertilizer and other \n","nutrients dramatically increased food production \n","in the second half of the 1900s. Food security and \n","quality of life around the world improved as well. The \n","annual rate of people dying due to a famine globally \n","per decade declined nearly 99 percent from the 1960s \n","to the 2010s. At the same time, fertilizer allows more \n","food to be grown on fewer acres. This reduces the \n","amount of land cleared for agriculture, preserving \n","carbon sequestering forests and important wildlife \n","ecosystems as well as enhancing biodiversity.\n","Ammonia and its derivative fertilizer products are \n","commodities. Given this, our first order of business \n","is to focus on achieving the lowest delivered cost \n","per ton. At CF Industries, we do this by leveraging \n","our unique capabilities – an outstanding operational \n","capability and disciplined capital and corporate \n","stewardship. In practice, this means access to low \n","feedstock costs, high asset utilization and productivity, \n","an extensive multimode distribution network to lower \n","logistics costs, maximizing margins by optimizing \n","customer locations and product type, and a constant \n","focus on cost management.\n","The clear benefits of ammonia and its derivative \n","fertilizers in providing energy to crops to increase \n","their yield come with a trade-off. While our plants are \n","among the most efficient in the global industry, the \n","ammonia production process is nevertheless energy-\n","intensive and therefore results in significant carbon \n","emissions. We regularly engage stakeholders about \n","this challenge.  \n","At the same time, some energy-intensive industries \n","looking to reduce their own carbon footprints \n","have identified ammonia as a potential source of \n","clean energy. This is due to ammonia’s hydrogen \n","component, which is widely viewed as a scalable \n","source of clean energy. Ammonia can be a clean fuel \n","itself as it does not release any carbon when used \n","as an energy source. Ammonia also could serve as a \n","medium to store and transport hydrogen. In essence, \n","these industries are exploring purchasing ammonia \n","for the hydrogen value of the molecule – a value that \n","is enhanced if the ammonia production process is \n","decarbonized.\n","Our need to reduce our carbon footprint and the \n","need to decarbonize the global economy intersect. \n","As a result, our strategy is to leverage our unique \n","capabilities to accelerate the world’s transition to \n","clean energy.\n","This approach builds on our existing business. We will \n","still provide energy to agriculture end-users in the \n","form of ammonia and derivative nitrogen fertilizers. \n","But we are also pursuing the growth opportunities \n","available from providing clean energy for power \n","generation in the form of ammonia. \n","Alongside these efforts, we will decarbonize our \n","ammonia production network, including producing \n","ammonia from carbon-free sources (green ammonia) \n","and ammonia produced conventionally with the CO2 \n","byproduct captured and permanently sequestered \n","(blue ammonia). These are more than promises: we \n","have committed $385 million in capital through 2025 \n","to advance these initiatives.  \n"," \n"," \n"," \n"," \n","“Our need to reduce our carbon \n","footprint and the need to \n","decarbonize the global economy \n","intersect. As a result, our strategy is \n","to leverage our unique capabilities \n","to accelerate the world’s transition \n","to clean energy.”\n","Message from CEO About this Report About the Company Energy, Emissions  \n","& Climate Change\n","Our Workplace & \n","Communities \n","Food Security &  \n","Product Stewardship \n","Ethics & Governance Coalitions, Partnerships \n","& Policy Engagement\n","Approach to ESG & \n","Sustainability\n","Reporting & Data \n","3CF INDUSTRIES  |  2021 ESG REPORT \n","</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th id=\"T_d3cf7_level0_row3\" class=\"row_heading level0 row3\" >3</th>\n","      <td id=\"T_d3cf7_row3_col0\" class=\"data row3 col0\" >ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY\n","Our strategy of accelerating the world’s transition \n","to clean energy is linked to a comprehensive set of \n","ESG goals.
