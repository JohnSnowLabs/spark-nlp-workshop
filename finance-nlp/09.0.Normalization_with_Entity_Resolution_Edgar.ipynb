For example, in a news article discussing the performance of a company's stock, accurately identifying and disambiguating the company's name is crucial for accurately tracking the stock's performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "📜An NLP use case in financial or legal applications is identifying financial entities' presence in a given text. One of those entities could be `Company Name`. We can carry out NER to extract different chunks of information, but in real financial and legal use cases, the company name is usually not useful as it is mentioned in the text. Sometimes we need the _official_ name of the company (instead of `Amazon`, `Amazon.com INC`, as registered in Edgar, Crunchbase and Nasdaq). We have pre-trained sentence entity resolver models for these purposes shown below with the examples."
