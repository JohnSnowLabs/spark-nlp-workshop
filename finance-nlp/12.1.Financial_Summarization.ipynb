        "\n",
        " For long document summarization, the following steps can be taken:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.   **Splitting the Document**: The initial step is to split the long document into smaller chunks. This is done to ensure that each chunk stays within the token limit imposed by the model and tokenizer. The document can be divided into paragraphs, sections, or any logical divisions based on the content.\n",
        "2.   **Token Limit**:  We split the text into sentences,  The initial text is divided into separate sentences. Starting with an empty container, the sentences are added to it one by one, in the order they appear in the original text. As each sentence is added, the total number of characters in the accumulated text is calculated and monitored. After adding each sentence, the accumulated character count is compared to the specified limit of 400 characters. The process continues until the total character count reaches or exceeds the specified limit. At this point, the process stops, and the accumulated text, consisting of all the sentences added so far, is considered the final output.\n",
        "3.   **Applying Summarization**: After the document is divided into manageable chunks, summarization is applied to each chunk independently. This can be done using the chosen summarization model or technique. The aim is to generate concise summaries for each chunk, capturing the essential information within the given constraints.\n",
        "4.   **Merging and Refining**: Once summaries are generated for each individual chunk, they can be merged and refined to form a coherent and comprehensive summary of the entire long document. This can involve removing redundant information, resolving inconsistencies, and ensuring smooth transitions between different chunks.\n",
        "5.   **Iterative Process:** If the summary generated from the merged chunks exceeds the desired length or does not meet the desired quality, the process can be iterated. This might involve adjusting the splitting strategy, revising the summarization model parameters, or applying additional techniques to improve the summary.\n",

        "Our Community Intelligence capability, which extends across our BSM platform, provides information to Coupa customers by applying artificial intelligence-powered analysis to the structured, normalized data collected from the comprehensive set of business spend transactions that have occurred on the Coupa platform. This innovative analysis provides Coupa customers with prescriptive recommendations to optimize their spend decisions, improve operational efficiency, and reduce risk based on best practices from the Coupa community. Participating customers are able to contribute to and benefit from Community Intelligence, with use cases spanning various areas of spend management, including: Supplier Insights and Supplier Risk Management which help companies evaluate and reduce the risk levels of suppliers; operational insights which help businesses measure their own performance on key operational metrics against other Coupa customers and follow best practices to drive efficiency and savings, Commodity and Procurable Insights which help companies identify spend consolidation and savings opportunities, and Spend Guard, which leverages artificial intelligence on behavior patterns to automatically surface potential errors and fraud across all business spend. Rapid time to value through fast deployment cycles and low cost of ownership of a cloud-based model. Opportunity to achieve significant and sustainable savings that can translate into improved profitability. High employee adoption of our easy-to-use BSM platform, which enables better visibility into spend, allowing both procurement and sourcing professionals to better manage their time. Strong supplier adoption as suppliers are motivated to join our network due to ease of enablement, flexibility, and lack of supplier fees. Access to extensive spending data in real-time, which leads to superior decision-making that can result in significant cost savings. Ability to stay agile and adapt to changes in operating and regulatory environments with our easily configurable platform. Process efficiency improvements that allow businesses to free up valuable resources and staff who can be deployed effectively elsewhere in the organization. Enhanced compliance with governmental regulations through greater auditability, documentation and control of spending activity. Intuitive and simple user experience that shields users from complexity and enables adoption of our platform with minimal training. Efficiency improvements as employees are more rapidly able to procure the goods and services they need to fulfill their job responsibilities. Convenience to employees, as our platform gathers data on historical activity and leverages the insights to help populate requests and minimize data entry. Participating in our Coupa Open Business Network, which allows suppliers to display their information and catalog of products and services on our platform for existing and prospective customers. Fast registration process and flexibility to interact with customers through the Coupa Supplier Portal, direct integration or simply by use of direct email. Elimination of manual processes and efficiency improvements through electronic invoicing and streamlined procurement and payment processes. Real-time visibility into invoice status, often through direct push notifications without having to log in to a portal. Seamless audit, documentation and archiving of electronic purchase orders and invoices that helps suppliers comply with changing government regulations, as well as avoid risks. We sell our software applications through our direct sales organization and our partner program, Coupa Partner Connect. Our direct sales team is global and comprised of inside sales and field sales personnel who are organized by geography, account size, and application type. We generate customer leads, accelerate sales opportunities, and build brand awareness through our marketing programs, including such programs with our strategic relationships. For example, we have joint marketing programs and sponsorship agreements with KPMG, Deloitte, and Accenture. our annual Coupa Inspire conferences which are held in multiple jurisdictions and over multiple days to connect customers, disseminate best practices, and reinforce our brand among existing and new customers. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we replaced our 2020 in-person Inspire conference with web-based events for our customers, prospects, and partners; development of our ideal customer profile (ICP), which helps identify the accounts with the highest propensity to buy, for each of our sales segments; programmatic account-based marketing and field efforts in close partnership with sales to target the ICP accounts in our respective sales segments; territory development representatives who respond to incoming leads to convert them into new sales opportunities; participation in, and sponsorship of, user conferences, executive events, trade shows, and industry events; integrated marketing campaigns, including direct e-mail, online web advertising, blogs, and webinars; cooperative marketing efforts with partners, including joint press announcements, joint trade show activities, channel marketing campaigns, and joint seminars; use of our website to provide application and company information, as well as learning opportunities for potential customers. In May 2020, we acquired all of the equity interest in ConnXus, Inc. (“ConnXus”), a cloud-based supplier relationship management platform that enables enterprises, health systems and government agencies to monitor all aspects of their supplier diversity compliance programs. The purchase consideration was approximately $10.0 million in cash of which approximately $1.4 million In June 2020, we acquired all of the equity interest in Bellin Treasury International GmbH (“Bellin”), a cloud-based treasury management software platform that improves visibility and control over cash and optimizes treasury processes. The purchase consideration was approximately $121.0 million, comprised of $79.1 million in cash (of which $8.0 million is being held in escrow for eighteen months after the transaction closing date) and 186,300 shares of our common stock with a fair value of approximately $41.8 million as of the transaction close date. In September 2020, we acquired all of the equity interest in Much-Net GmbH (\"Much-Net\"), a financial instrument software and service provider that specializes in risk management. The purchase consideration was approximately $4.3 million in cash, which is net of $1.8 million in cash acquired. In November 2020, we completed the acquisition of Laurel Parent Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries (\"LLamasoft\"), a supply chain design and analysis software and solutions company. The acquisition strengthens Coupa’s supply chain capabilities, enabling businesses to drive greater value through Business Spend Management. In connection with the acquisition, we issued approximately 2.4 million shares of our common stock and paid aggregate cash of approximately $791.5 million. Approximately $15.0 million of the cash paid is being held in escrow for fifteen months after the transaction closing date as security for the former LLamasoft stockholders' indemnification obligations, and approximately $7.5 million of the cash paid is being held in escrow until the completion of final adjustment on the purchase consideration. In February 2021, we completed the acquisition of Pana Industries, Inc. (\"Pana\"), a corporate travel booking solution company that puts an emphasis on the traveler experience. In connection with the completion of the acquisition, we paid aggregate cash of approximately $48.5 million, and issued 23,822 shares of our common stock. As a core part of our strategy, we have developed an ecosystem of partners to extend our sales capabilities and coverage, to broaden and complement our application offerings, and to provide a broad array of services that lie outside of our primary areas of focus. Our partnerships increase our ability to grow and scale quickly and efficiently and allow us to maintain greater focus on executing against our strategy. Our referral partners provide global, national and regional expertise in business spend management, procurement and expense management. They help organizations through operational transformation by leveraging process, best practices and new technology. These partners may refer customer prospects to us and assist us in selling to them. In return, we typically pay these partners a percentage of the first-year subscription revenue generated by the customers they refer. In order to offer the full breadth of implementation services, change management, and strategic consulting services to our customers, we work with leading global systems integrators such as Accenture, Deloitte and KPMG, as well as boutique and regional consulting firms. Our strategy is to enable the majority of our projects to be led by implementation partners with additional specialized support from us. Our implementation partners are highly skilled and trained by our team. When working with implementation partners, we are typically in a “co-sell” arrangement where we will sell our subscription directly to the customer and our partner will sell its implementation services directly to the customer.\n",
