Welcome to the Aon plc's third quarter 2022 conference call. [Operator instructions] I would also like to remind all parties of this call is being recorded. If anyone has an objection, you may disconnect your line at this time. It is important to note that some of the comments in today's call may constitute certain statements that are forward-looking in nature as defined by the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated. Information concerning risk factors that could cause such differences are described in the press release covering our third quarter 2022 results as well as having been posted on our website. Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg Case, CEO of Aon plc.

Greg Case -- Chief Executive Officer



 Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter conference call. I'm joined by Christa Davies, our CFO, and Eric Andersen, our president. As in previous quarters, we posted a detailed financial presentation on our website. We begin by thanking our Aon colleagues for delivering another strong quarter of top and bottom line growth. Our recently concluded all colleague engagement survey reinforces the resilience and commitment of our team as we continue to receive and benefit from exceptional colleague feedback with overall engagement, ways of working and brand strength all at 80% or greater. More than ever, colleagues understand the power of our Aon United strategy and have embraced the smart working approach we develop to preserve flexibility in how and where we work, while enabling them to be better connected and more capable of helping clients make better decisions to support their businesses. The importance of the support and the exceptional nature of our response is illustrated by our recently released executive risk survey and the tremendous leadership of our team on Hurricane Ian.Taken together, these two data points reinforce the relevance and return on our Aon United strategy. First, our 2022 executive risk survey, which surveyed 800 C-suite executives from global companies, underscores the volatility facing living organizations and offers a window into their mindset and needs. A majority survey, 79%, the increased volatility on the horizon, but only a third, just 35% feel fully prepared to manage the impact of that volatility. Most important, those that feel very prepared share three fundamental leadership attributes that reinforce the relevance of our capabilities. First, they see embracing risk as a source of potential competitive advantage. 62% of very prepared leaders agree that their company's appetite for risk has increased in response to the current economic conditions. Second, we're willing to invest in new approaches to address emerging risks. These leaders focus on long-tail risks and call out concerns around disruptive categories like cyber and supply chain.



 And third, they value expert insight and are looking for partners to help them make better business decisions. Prepared leaders are nearly twice as likely to look to counsel from an external advisor that can provide a more holistic enterprise perspective on decisions to protect and grow their businesses. And all these survey findings reinforce the relevance of our strategy, Hurricane Ian highlighted an excellent example of that value in action. To begin, we want to extend our deepest sympathies to those impacted by this event. In these times of challenge, as communities endure the tragic loss of life and tremendous damage, we believe that our actions as a firm to help businesses and communities respond and recover. As always, our team took a holistic Aon United view toward serving our clients before, during, and after the event. Pre-event, we used our resource development models to ensure that our 1,800 commercial risk claims colleagues around the world were prepared to respond to a surge in client need. This was a collaborative global effort possible only because of our mindset and single P&L approach. In addition, we are able to use impact forecasting models from our reinsurance team to game out potential hurricane pads and share those insights with our commercial risk colleagues so they could alert clients to potential exposures, allowing for early activation of business continuity plans. During the event, we provided real-time insight on actual harm by leveraging satellite and drone imagery provided through technology partnerships enabled by our Aon Business Services team. This is another example of how our emphasis on technology-driven innovation is reshaping client service at scale. Post event, we obviously focused on accelerating claims resolution while we're also stepping back with clients and taking an enterprise view of what the hurricane means for the benefit plan, leveraging our health solutions team and beginning new conversations around how they think about return to work, exploring how our human capital solutions colleagues can apply learnings from our own smart working strategy to their workforce management. This is Aon United in action and only possible because of the decade-plus investment we've made to break down barriers across our business and build Aon Business Services into an engine that provides us the insights and scale necessary to meet client needs. Turning to performance. In the third quarter, our colleagues delivered excellent results demonstrating continued momentum and year-to-date progress against our key financial metrics. For Q3, organic revenue growth was 5% on top of 12% in the prior year quarter, adjusted operating margin was up 100 basis points and adjusted EPS was up 16%.



 These results are consistent with our full year ongoing financial guidance, and we would note that Q3 is our seasonally smallest quarter for revenue. Year-to-date, we delivered 7% organic revenue growth, adjusted operating margin expansion of 80 basis points, adjusted EPS growth of 14% and generated over $2 billion of free cash flow. Turning to Solution Lines. Finical risk delivered 5% organic revenue growth this quarter on top of 13% in the prior year quarter, contributed 7% organic revenue growth year-to-date, driven by ongoing strong retention, new business generation and renewals, highlighting the resilience of our core business as we continue to help clients protect and grow their businesses. As we previously mentioned, the significant increase in M&A volume impacted our Transaction Solutions business, especially compared to last year's result, which was particularly strong in Q3 and Q4. Reinsurance delivered 7% organic revenue growth in the quarter was 7% year to date. As our team continues to help clients in the current market, while bringing new solutions and capabilities. For instance, our newly established strategy and technology group provides our clients with strategic advice, data-driven consulting, analytics, and modeling tools and has further strengthened the capability we gained through our acquisition of Tyche. This is all this time in driving growth, efficiency and resilience have never been more important. Health Solutions delivered 5% organic revenue growth in Q3 on top of 16% in the prior year quarter contributed to 8% year-to-date growth with particularly strong growth in human capital solutions. Across Health, we see clients assessing their people strategies to optimize for workforce skill and organizational structure while making sure those employees feel valued and engaged. Finally, Wealth Solutions delivered 2% organic growth on top of 4% in Q3 last year and 2% year to date as our team continues to help clients address market volatility, talk about regulatory challenges, and execute ongoing pension risk transfers. In two exciting milestones, our team has advised over $200 billion of pension risk transfer transactions in the U.S. and U.K. as pension plans continue to derisk and take advantage of market conditions. And we reached the $1 billion mark in planned assets and commitments for our approval employer plan, which helps cover and helps lower cost and enhance retirement security for employees at smaller organizations. Overall, our strong performance in Q3 and year to date reflects the strength of Aon United strategy and Aon Business Services platform delivered for clients across regions and solution lines. For the full year, we remain confident in our commitment to mid-single digit or greater organic revenue growth, margin improvement and double-digit free cash flow growth. As our clients assess the impact of increased economic volatility on their businesses, many are looking to improve their own working capital and liquidity, often by accessing new sources of capital. In one recent example, an Aon United example, our client based in Asia was awarded a multibillion-dollar construction contract in Latin America for a manufacturing facility that incorporates innovative carbon reduction technologies. The client had a regulatory and contractual requirement that they provide a financial performance guarantees, essentially drawing on their own credit facility. To address, our local commercial risk team, who has a deep understanding of our clients' strategy and financial position, collaborated closely with our local credit experts in LatAm to design a bespoke surety bond solution for our clients. Rather than using a bank guarantee facility, our client was able to access capital at a lower cost and more attractive terms while maintaining their own balance sheet strength and flexibility. Just as we've done with intellectual property lending, and pension risk transfer solutions, this is another example of how we help clients access new capital to reduce risk and drive their own growth adjusts. In summary, we delivered a strong quarter of top and bottom line results contributing to our year-to-date progress against key metrics. We continue to be strongly positioned to deliver on our full year financial commitments of mid-single digit or greater organic revenue growth, margin expansion and double-digit free cash flow growth. We see increasing opportunity to help our clients and the steps we've taken to operationalize Aon United and our Aon Business Services platform gives us confidence in our ability to address our clients' existing and emerging needs that they continue to protect and grow their businesses. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Christa for her thoughts on our performance in the quarter and year to date as well as our long-term outlook for continued shareholder value creation. Christa?

 Christa Davies -- Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President of Global Finance Thanks so much, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As Greg highlighted, we delivered continued progress on our key financial metrics for both the quarter and year to date. Through the first nine months of the year, we translated 7% organic revenue growth into 80 basis points of adjusted margin expansion and 14% growth in adjusted earnings per share and generated over $2 billion in free cash flow. We look forward to building on this momentum as we head into the last quarter of 2022. As I reflect on our performance year to date, as Greg noted, organic revenue growth was 5% in the third quarter and 7% year to date. We continue to expect mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth for the full year 2022 and over the long term. I would also note that flat reported revenue growth in Q3 and 3% year to date includes an unfavorable impact from changes in FX of 5% for Q3 and 4% year to date primarily driven by a stronger U.S. dollar versus most currencies. And I'd highlight fiduciary investment income, which is not included in our organic revenue growth calculation was $26 million in Q3 and $35 million year to date. Moving to operating performance. We delivered strong operational improvement through the first nine months of the year with adjusted operating margins of 30%, an increase of 80 basis points driven by organic revenue growth and efficiencies from Aon Business Services. Overcoming expense growth, including investment in colleagues and technology to drive long-term growth and some ongoing resumption of T&E. Looking forward, we expect to deliver margin expansion in 2022 and over the long term as we continue our track record of cost discipline and managing investments in long-term growth on an ROIC basis. As we've previously communicated, we think about margins over the course of a full year, and we expect continued investment in colleagues and ongoing reduction of T&E as well as ongoing investments in long-term growth like technology throughout the year. Aon Business Services is a key contributor to margin expansion and represents a competitive advantage, especially in a highly inflationary market. Our Aon Business Services platform continues to drive efficiency gains, improved quality and service and increased innovation at scale. Let me share one fantastic example of how Aon Business Services platform supports ongoing improvement as we automate day-to-day processes around the firm. Reinsurance has operated on a single global broking platform and client service model since 2017. Over the past five years, the team has digitized processes, automated workflows and moved work to low-cost locations. 64% of transactions are now processed digitally, increasing speed and accuracy which has helped reduce the average number of days it takes to get claims from carriers paid to our clients by 22% from 38 to 30 days. Increasing capacity enabled 27% more throughput while costs were up just 9% over five years, a particularly impressive outcome when considering recent cost and wage inflation trends. And the platform enables the team to provide enhanced services while dealing with more complex transactions and Aon United outcome that allows our colleagues to better support each other and our clients. We continue to find and capture efficiency opportunities like this around the firm and expect Aon Business Services will continue to be a driver of ongoing efficiency improvements, quality and service improvements and increased innovation for clients. We translated strong operating income growth into double-digit adjusted EPS growth of 16% in Q3 and 14% year to date. As noted in our earnings material, FX translation was an unfavorable impact of approximately $0.05 per share in Q3 and $0.34 per share year to date. If currency to remain stable at today's rates, we would expect an unfavorable impact of approximately $0.11 per share or approximately $33 million decrease in operating income in the fourth quarter of 2022. Turning to free cash flow and capital allocation. Free cash flow increased 79% year to date to $2.051 billion, reflecting an increase in cash flow from operations due primarily to the $1 billion termination fee payment in the prior year period. As we've communicated before, free cash flow can be lumpy quarter-to-quarter. And I'd note, Q4 is our seasonally strongest for free cash flow generation. We continue to expect to deliver double-digit free cash flow growth for the full year and over the long term, driven by operating income growth and working capital improvements. Given our strong outlook for free cash flow growth in 2022 and beyond, we expect share repurchase to continue to remain our highest return on capital opportunity for capital allocation. We believe we are significantly undervalued in the market today, highlighted by the approximately 1.2 billion of share repurchase in the quarter and 2.5 billion year to date. We also expect to continue to invest organically and inorganically in content and capabilities to address unmet client needs. We've invested in expertise and content in our retirement business, where we're helping clients navigate regulatory changes such as GMP in the U.K. and utilizing higher interest rates to drive record levels of pension risk transfers. Our M&A pipeline continues to be focused on our priority areas that will bring scalable solutions to our clients' growing and evolving challenges. We'll continue to actively manage the portfolio and assess all capital allocation decisions on a return on capital balance basis. Now turning to our balance sheet and debt capacity. We remain confident in the strength of our balance sheet and manage liquidity risk through a well-laddered debt maturity profile. We issued $500 million of 10-year senior notes in Q3 and as we've said before, we'll continue to add debt as EBITDA grows while maintaining our current investment-grade credit ratings. With respect to interest rates, I'd note that our term debt is all fixed rate. with a weighted average interest rate of approximately 3.8% and a weighted average maturity to be approximately 12 years. I'd also note that our pension liability improves as interest rates increase. And historically, we've taken steps to derisk this liability and reduce volatility. In summary, our strong financial results in the quarter and year to date demonstrate continued momentum and progress against our key financial metrics. While we're seeing signs of economic uncertainty, we remain confident in the strength of our firm and our financial guidance for 2022. Overall, our business is resilient, and our Aon United strategy gives us confidence in our ability to deliver results in any economic scenario. With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator, and we'd be delighted to take your questions. Questions & Answers: Operator[Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with J.P. Morgan.

Jimmy Bhullar --

 JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst So first, I just had a question on the commercial risk business. Your organic growth slowed sequentially. Obviously, comps were more difficult as well. But you mentioned that Asia, Latin America and U.K. grew at a pretty strong pace and there is a slowdown in U.S. retail business because of lower transaction volumes. Can you sort of elaborate on that and what you're seeing in the U.S. business?

Greg Case -- Chief Executive Officer Yes, Jimmy, thanks for the question. Listen, as we've highlighted again on commercial specifically, but it really plays off of the firm overall, 7% organic year to date, 11% year to date last year and then 13% in the quarter as you highlight and really just strong across the board, across all geographies and real strength in core P&C and affinity and we really would to highlight that. The only thing we highlighted that was a little different was obviously, the M&A transaction levels last year were extraordinary, and our capability there is just exceptional. And Eric, maybe you can talk a little bit about that. And that'

s really what -- it's not going to repeat this year, but overall, very, very strong momentum as we finish the year this year and move into next year. But Eric, any thoughts on that?

Eric Andersen -- President Sure, Greg. And a great question. I would say from an overall perspective, commercial risk in the U.S. is very solid. New business numbers, very solid retention and rollover numbers, Greg, as you mentioned in your prepared remarks. And I would just say, look, on transaction services, we are serving the private equity industry and the corporate industry as they make acquisitions and divestitures. And so during a period like this where it's a little bit slower, we are spending time with the markets, with the reinsurance markets, with the clients, building out our strategy for when it ultimately comes back and feel like the team that we have today is fantastic, but they're also working very hard with their clients, making sure we've got the next generation of product ready when the economic environment changes.

Jimmy Bhullar --

 JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst OK. And I think you mentioned modestly positive benefit from pricing the last few quarters and this quarter as well. And if we think about the reinsurance business, there's obviously a lot of dislocation there. Can you talk about how do you expect that to affect your results? And should there be a greater tailwind from pricing at least on the reinsurance side?

Greg Case -- Chief Executive Officer Maybe I'll start the overall and Eric just to pick up on the reinsurance front in particular. Overall, Jimmy, as you highlighted, we look at market impact. That's how we think about it. Obviously, it includes insured values and price. We highlight modest impact sort of in the quarter and expect for the year. Over time, you can expect ensure value will begin to creep up. That will actually have a sustained lasting impact over time. And we'll see how the pricing piece changes out, but overall market impact kind of modest as we think about the impact of the year. The reinsurance dynamic is important and is involving, Eric, do you want to pick up on that?

Eric Andersen -- President Sure, Greg. And maybe just one comment on the just general pricing environment on the primary side. I think you laid it out right. But also, I think we've talked about this before, we spent a lot of time with our clients using data and analytics to kind of understand the choices they need to make, so while inflation and while pricing may be moving against them from this perspective, they don't sit still. They're looking at whether it's captive utilization, whether it's retentions, deductibles, limits, all those tools, and we try and help them think through what's best for them as they're navigating their sort of economic changes that they're facing in their business. So while the market is, as you said, Greg, there is effect of inflation and pricing, we're certainly working with them as the clients as they make those decisions. Certainly, on the reinsurance, I think it's worth just stepping back there is a lot going on right now on the reinsurance side. And our primary mission continues to be to help our insurance company clients match risk with capital. And remember, this is a global business like few in terms of where the capital is sourced from and how it's deployed and it shows it very differently in different parts of the world. And I think as we move away from Hurricane Ian, we start to get a little more clarity around what the ultimate losses look like and who's holding those losses. But if you step back and you think about it geographically, the European clients, I think, are expecting to have the supply of property cat that they need, albeit with a pricing and structure negotiation that takes into account the effects of inflation that's happening in Europe but also the losses that have happened in that region over the last three years, whether it's German floods, French Hail, etc., they've got certain dynamics that have affected the European marketplace. And I think for North America, the property cat market is going to be more challenging. Managing the effects of inflation, supply challenges,

 some remaining uncertainty around Aon -- will create difficulties. But ultimately, we're focused on creating capital for them, capital options. So they can get the protection that they need going forward. I would also say, it also has an effect on facultative reinsurance and other tools that we have because as those insurers are forced to take higher retention, they certainly are going to continue to look to derisk. They just do it with different tools, right? They actually then will look at specific clients that they've got on their primary portfolio that they want help on, they'll use facultative instead of treaty. So while the market does shift, there are levers out there that we bring to bear for our clients that can actually help them derisk and get the protection that they need.

Greg Case -- Chief Executive Officer And last thing I just want to highlight on this for you to leave this point. This is tremendous for us. I mean this is where we live. There is more activity going on with the set of capabilities that are unique in the world today. What our colleagues who built on the reinsurance side is extraordinary. And we've just added to it with data and analytics and all that we've done with our strategy and technology effort now added with Tyche that I mentioned before. So Eric described the market perfectly, but boy, this is our wheel house. We love it. It creates tremendous opportunity to support clients and we're bringing all the solutions to bear and in any respect, helping our clients and a challenging time for us, it's a great opportunity for the next 12 to 24 months.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.

Elyse Greenspan --

 Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst My first question is on the margin side. So in the quarter, you guys saw 100 basis points of margin improvement. If I assume that all the fiduciary investment income fell to the bottom line, that could give you a tailwind of 90 basis points. So I'm just trying to get a sense of that 100, can you give us a sense of the split between how much of the margin improvement came from the pickup in fiduciary investment income versus core margin improvement and operating leverage?

Christa Davies -- Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President of Global Finance Sure. Thanks for the question, Elyse. And look, what we would say is we think about this in terms of year to date. And year to date, we had a $35 million benefit from investment income. So it was about a 20 basis point impact on full year margins. And so it's not nearly as big as the numbers you highlighted, Elyse. And so for us, as we think about growing margin expansion for the full year, which we are completely committed to doing, it's really about continuing to drive organic revenue growth, the portfolio mix in higher revenue growth, higher-margin areas and the productivity benefits we're getting from Aon Business Services. And so we're fully on track to deliver full year margin expansion.

Elyse Greenspan --

 Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst As we think about rates continuing to rise, right, so that fiduciary investment income should go higher from here? So we're not just thinking Q4 but '23 as well. Do you think most of the benefits will fall to the bottom line? Or how do you balance flooding evolve versus looking to take some extra dollars to invest internally?

Christa Davies -- Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President of Global Finance Yes. So first of all, Elyse, what I would say is we manage $6 billion of fiduciary investment income and every 100 basis points of increase is $60 million top line and bottom line. But Elyse we're doing a lot of work for clients to actually manage that. We're actually doing all the insurance accounting and transaction processing in the middle on paying premiums on the way in and then paying claims on the way out. Just one correction, Elyse, the impact of fiduciary investment income in the quarter is 70 basis points, not 90.

Elyse Greenspan --

 Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst OK. And then my last question was going back to the comment on transactions within commercial risk any but highlighted over transaction volume. Was the third quarter of last year heavier for that business? Or will we also potentially see that impact the growth there in the fourth quarter as well?

Greg Case -- Chief Executive Officer Yes. Elyse, if we take a step back, again, I just emphasize literally look at the quarter overall for us sort of year to date, team has just done a tremendous job year to date, 7% overall, over 9% last year, really strength across the board. The M&A activity that we described and talked about was really Q3 and Q4 both levels of activity exceptionally strong. But it didn'

t -- hasn't any in any way, shape or form, as Christa described, exactly where we are now as we think about mid-single digit or greater for the year, margin expansion and double-digit free cash flow growth. And I just would highlight Eric's points around the strength of our team. It's really extraordinary and what they've been able to do and how that's evolved over time. So they're exceptionally well positioned as market as the market comes back.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski with BMO Capital Markets.

Mike Zaremski --

 BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst Good morning. Happy Friday. Maybe thinking about free cash flow. Last year, as you guys helped us out with, there's clearly a good amount of noise. This year, are there any items that you feel you want to call out maybe on the working capital improvement side? You mentioned, Christa, the 4Q is usually a pretty strong quarter. So from looking at free cash flow this year as a percentage of revenues, for example, it's a very healthy level. I just want to make sure I'm not missing something.

Christa Davies -- Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President of Global Finance Mike, I don't think you're missing anything. So free cash flow, $2.051 billion year to date, up 79%. Nothing particularly unusual. We did mention in Q1 and Q2 that we had lower levels of free cash flow because of higher incentive comp based on extraordinary performance in 2021. That's the only thing I would note. And then I would say, in general, we're going to continue to drive free cash flow growth double digits based on continued acceleration in revenue growth, margin expansion and then working capital improvements. You did see, if you look at the external receivables divided by revenue on the balance sheet, that DSO improved by two days from Q3 '21 to Q3 '22. It went from 91 days down to 89 days. And so we're very pleased with our continued progress in working capital.

Mike Zaremski --

 BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst And have you stated as the goal to get down well below 89 over time?

 Or is that the main lever for the -- for working capital over the next few years?

Christa Davies -- Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President of Global Finance Yes. So what we have said, Mike, is that we have essentially $500 million of excess receivables sitting on our balance sheet and that over time, we will continue to improve DSO to get that $500 million to 0. And so that is a big upside in free cash flow growth over the coming years.

Mike Zaremski --

 BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst OK. Great. That's helpful. And maybe switching gears. Curious if a cyber insurance, you guys are one of the leaders in the marketplace that clearly rates are up a lot, but clients are still buying just as much or more. And maybe you could comment on the cyber market, but I'd also be curious to hear about whether the intellectual property market, which I think you guys are one of the pioneers of is gaining any traction?

Eric Andersen -- President Sure. This is Eric. And maybe I'll take a shot at it. So on the cyber market, we continue to see great growth in the business. And I would say what has changed, if anything, over the last several months is really the renewed focus on quality underwriting. And so if you remember at the very beginning of that product, it was all about risk management, risk identification, risk management, and then risk transfer. I think what happened to the market is they went immediately to risk transfer without enough focus on the quality of the risk mitigation and the risk management. As the market has reacted due to losses, they essentially went back to basics. And I think ultimately, the market will be healthier for it. So we continue to see great growth. We invest globally in our capability there and really like our position and the work that we're doing for clients. I would say an intellectual property, very similar. I couldn't be more excited about where we are with that, continue to see great deal flow, getting markets to join the product. We actually did our first IP reinsurance treaty this quarter, certainly not big dollars, but a real symbol on how we're bringing a broader market to bear on supporting that product has developed. So really excited about both of them and think we've got a great lead in the market with our capability, and we're going to continue to invest and push to develop those markets in a broader way.

Greg Case -- Chief Executive Officer I do call out the IP progression has been, as Eric said, extraordinary to go back four years ago, we bringing 25, 30 colleagues in to sort of think about this. We're 200 strong now in this category. Now what it ever actually valued an IP stack essentially our patent stack, essentially it could actually be insured against a lot of loan borrower against it. Now we've done 15-plus deals. I think we talked about last quarter, we crossed $1 billion in lending on this front. And as Eric said, now we have multiple markets involved and even reinsurance at all. So this is a progression. It's still very, very early days. But man, the team has done a tremendous job sort of building out this opportunity.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of David Motemaden with Evercore ISI.

David Motemaden --

 Evercore ISI -- Analyst I just had a question on the Wealth business. Just on the AUM. The AUM based delegated investment management, that was cited as a headwind, could you give us an idea how much the AUM base was down and how we should think about that going forward as markets remain under pressure?

Christa Davies -- Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President of Global Finance It was down, David. We didn't give the impact of it. But you're absolutely right, the way in which we earn fees in that delegated business is a percentage on AUM. And so it really depends on how the markets go as to how we see that progressing going forward. But I would say offsetting that decline on the investment management side was fantastic growth on the retirement side, as Greg and I talked about in our prepared remarks. We've got enormous growth dealing with regulatory change, particularly GMP in the U.K., fantastic work going on there by the team. And then as global assets rise, it's one of the best environments to do pension risk transfers that have happened in the last 15 years, and we are the global leader in this. We're very, very excited about our position in that space. And then as we mentioned on the call, our PEPS product in the U.S. is doing exceptionally well. And so where there are so many areas on the Retirement side where we have great opportunities for growth. But Eric, I mean, what else would you add here?

Eric Andersen -- President No, because I think you covered all of it. We're just really excited about watching the retirement business, in particular, really add great value to our clients. The U.K. certainly has some great activity going on there, in the U.S. as well. But that pet product, which is the pooled employer plan really is a great expense solution for our smaller clients as they look to manage the retirement assets. So you covered it well and really a solid quarter for them.

David Motemaden --

 Evercore ISI -- Analyst Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe just going back to commercial risk. I guess I was just wondering if you could talk about I guess, maybe just say what the growth was if we were to just exclude that U.S. retail, that retail comp that was a bit tougher and how that compared versus last quarter? Did we see any slowdown there sequentially? Or was it really just all driven by the U.S. retail tougher comp?

Greg Case -- Chief Executive Officer Yes, David. As we described, listen, we would step back really tremendous progress across the board. And if you think about sort of what's happening on the commercial risk front, we highlighted that really is an opportunity where we see over time, it's going to be tremendous on the transaction solutions side. But overall, really strong across the board and just continues to build momentum as we described before.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields with KBW.

Meyer Shields -- Keefe,

 Bruyette and Woods -- Analyst Two quick questions, if I can. First, Eric, I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about capacity shortfalls in the U.S. in the context of the impact of rising interest rates on capital? And how much more work does that actually entails for the reinsurance unit?

Eric Andersen --

 President So if you think about -- I'm assuming you're talking about property cat at this point. The casualty basis on the reinsurance, which people don't tend to talk about, but is a substantial part of the industry. They're continuing to battle their own inflation understanding as they price long-tail products. I do think that market, while it's challenged, it is more around price and structure, not about supply. So listen, I think as property cat in the U.S. continues to be challenged for a couple of reasons. One, you've got significant losses, both on the traditional things like hurricane, but also as you think about wildfire, storms, the secondary perils, have been a substantial hit to reinsurers over the last five years. So there is certainly a crisis of confidence in underwriting and how they deploy their capital for our clients. And so models have to be better. We really have to focus hard on making sure risk identification. They understand exactly what they're offering and what the sort of return scenarios are for them over time. The effects of interest rates really affect the ILS market, which has two headwinds right now. One is there's some trapped capital with Ian, as people are trying to figure out exactly where the losses are, what the damage is, and there's also the relative investment question. As interest rates go up, their ability to find other assets that don't risk their capital is something that essentially just creates a repricing, I think, of the ILS market, which is happening. And so for us, I think it doesn't necessarily create work. It creates understanding of the market dynamics and the returns. But we're in the middle of that right now as we lead up to the big 1/1 renewal season. And then again in April and July.

Greg Case -- Chief Executive Officer Meyer, I know you've got another question, I don't come to that, but this really does, as Eric described, reimports the opportunity. When you can take a part of the market the way Eric just described and have the analytics to really do something about it, drive solutions on behalf of clients. This is what puts us in such a unique position against the rest of the world on this topic. So again, a lot going on out there, and we love it every day because it puts us in a very, very unique position.

Meyer Shields -- Keefe,

 Bruyette and Woods -- Analyst No. That's very helpful. I understand that. And then I guess a question for Christa, maybe. So you talked about how there's more pension risk transfer going on. You also mentioned how higher interest rates benefit Aon's pension funding. And I'm wondering, I understand that there's more willingness to take pension liabilities from people in the higher interest rate environment, but wouldn't there be less demand for transfer if interest rates are higher?

Christa Davies -- Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President of Global Finance So there's always been capacity. The real challenge, Meyer is the economics have made it make sense to actually be able to buy out because we haven't been able to execute the transfers without being able to add the cash given to get to fully funded. And so the increase in interest rates is getting planned to fully funded, which means that they can actually do this transfer. So the capacity has always been there. It's more that the pension plans haven't been funded enough to be able to make this work. And I would say we're seeing more demand from this for buy-ins and buyouts from clients than we have in the last 10-plus years, and we have done substantial numbers of pension risk transfer in the U.S. and the U.K. and are very, very well positioned to do it. So it's a very exciting growth area for us.OperatorLadies and gentlemen, our final question this morning comes from the line of Josh Shanker with Bank of America.

Josh Shanker --

 Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Yes. Thank you for getting at the end here. You spoke in the prepared remarks about higher expenses from T&E resumption, both as a consultant and a protector of the risk of your clients as well as internally. Can you talk about the shape that's happening where we are relative to where we were two and a half years ago? And if we go into a recession, whether we're topping out here on T&E and whatnot?

Christa Davies -- Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President of Global Finance Yes. Thanks for the question, Josh. So I would say T&E is obviously up from 2020 and 2021 levels. It's not that 2019 levels. Really because we're actually very thoughtful about how we do the work. And we've implemented smart working, which I know Greg talked about in relation to our engagement survey, it's one of the things that's driving employee engagement for the highest levels in our history. Because we're very thoughtful about where is the best place. And there are a number of areas and Eric, you might want to talk about them where we're doing work in different ways, and it has a higher impact on clients, Eric?

Eric Andersen -- President Yes, Christa, I think that's great. And I think it drives productivity of our colleagues. It drives engagement, as you said, really being able to use the technology that we've been investing in through our Aon Business Services model over a number of years. And just there'

s one -- something that happened a week or two ago that just came to mind as you were talking, Christa. We do these insight series across the world with our clients. And normally, historically, would have flown everybody in from around the world, and this one happened to be in Australia. So it would have been a week off time for the team of basically off the grid as they went to present an hour slot for whatever topic they were asking for. And so on this one, in particular, we had our climate team, which is based in London, that's been working on building a climate strategy for us essentially. WebEx into the Insight Series meeting. Did the question and answer actually gave a great presentation. And then when they were finished, they were home, and they were back on to the next topic and continuing to work. So we were able to bring that capability without the big expense of travel and entertainment. We were able to deliver the capability and we gain the hours that we would have lost to the flights and the jet lag and everything else that we all know about in a way that drives more productivity. So that's just one example. There's many of them that follow the similar path. We just did a big renewal meeting, for example, for a big U.S. client where we use the immersion room in our New York office and brought in the European insurers and reinsurers and the London European insurers and reinsurers and essentially did what would have been a three-week trip turned it into a five-hour session in one location. And so again, saves time, saves money, but more importantly, the clients are finding value in it. They actually feel like they're getting that connection with the markets that they want and our colleagues, it actually allows us to sell off our global colleagues in a way that you don't really get to do when you're traveling place to place and so focused on schedule. So we're really excited about it, and Christa said, it's driving engagement and more importantly, productivity. And I think the clients are really enjoying the time they get back as well.

Josh Shanker --

 Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst This has obviously been Aon's experience, is this similar to what your understanding is going on with your clients? Or is your clients' costs rising faster than your crack team of I guess, spend managers can manage for the company itself?

Eric Andersen -- President So I would say our human capital business spends a lot of time working with our clients on how to do smart working. And so I think as the pandemic is further and further in the rearview mirror, people are finding their new normal. And our teams are doing, I think, a great job helping them structure and engage with our clients in a way that they're able to do the same thing because our clients are also looking to get productivity. They're also looking to manage T&E. And they want to leverage the technology that we all use so much during the pandemic in ways that actually create the outcomes that they're looking for.

Greg Case -- Chief Executive Officer And really, Josh, as you think about it, the whole phenomena you're highlighting is really to be incredibly substantial and significant for us, but even more so for our clients. And Eric described it well, but you just combine the whole wellness issues and challenges it really connects with our health business ways that it hasn't before. It's a very integrated response cutting across multiple solution lines. It's the best example. Another example of Aon United in action as we help clients try to understand how they can really address the work environment, smart working, as we describe it, but even more broadly, how it impacts their own engagement and how they drive talent acquisition, talent retention, talent and enrichment and it's a real opportunity for us.

 And it really -- the meat of it is it connects across multiple solution lines, which is perfect Aon United from our standpoint.OperatorLadies and gentlemen, that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the floor back to Mr. Case for any final comments.

Greg Case -- Chief Executive Officer I just want to say thanks to everybody for joining us. We appreciate it and look forward to talking next quarter. Thanks very much.Operator[Operator signoff] Duration: 0 minutesCall participants:

 Thanks, John. We continue to see steady progress with the ORLADEYO launch and underlying growth trends remain strong. New patient starts are consistent with previous quarters, discontinuations appear to have stabilized, and we are investing more to keep this momentum going. Based on our expectations for continued growth in Q4, we plan to exit 2022, having more than doubled sales from the great start we had last year and will be a quarter of the way to our expected peak of $1 billion globally in just the second year of launch. We've shown you long-term data from our trial, and we will continue to show you real-world data that our drug works very well in many patients. The competitive landscape has changed too and is a reminder of how challenging it is to pursue a strategy of oral drugs in HAE. Right now, and perhaps for some time to come, ORLADEYO is the only direct-acting oral with once-daily dosing to prevent HAE attacks. With this unique offering and product profile, we believe this is a therapy every patient should have the opportunity to try to see if it works for them. Charlie will share more specifics on the ORLADEYO quarter performance in a minute. Our strategy of going after challenging targets, specifically serine proteases for patients suffering from rare diseases is rooted in our ability to discover potent, specific, and bioavailable molecules. In the case of HAE, we were able to do that, do what others haven't, develop an oral once-daily collection inhibitor. We believe this allows us to offer something unique to these patients and we believe HAE is just the start. In addition, because these are difficult targets, we don't stop at the first molecule we discover, we work on improved next-generation compounds. We saw that with the world stat in ORLADEYO. We believe we've done it again with Factor D. We are fortunate to have two molecules again, and that puts us in a position to potentially have the first Oral Factor D monotherapy molecule to market.



 In the next generation, that perhaps will be the best. While the future of 9930 is still to be determined, our expectation is we will get an answer to our hypothesis on data from the first 15 or so patients treated for 2 to 3 months by the middle of next year. We have also been working on additional next-generation complement inhibitors, including BCX10013. A potential once-daily Oral Factor D inhibitor that we have advanced into the clinic. In Q1 of next year, we plan to show you data in humans that support the potential of once-daily dosing. Our plan is to go into rare disease patients in dose-ranging proof of concept studies with 10013 next year as well. But we won't stop there. The complement system is complex and blocking more than one pathway allows us to go after more rare diseases, and may be necessary to successfully treat patients. So we also have a discovery effort, and we're making great progress on other targets in the complement system. If successful, we'll be able to go after other rare diseases and possibly combine molecules to make the best therapy in one capsule or tablet. We plan to show you more in an R&D day next year. So, the goal simply stated is to be the global leader in complement. Simple to state, but very challenging to do. We believe the strategy in our discovery platform allows us to do things others may not be able to do, and we look forward to showcasing it to you next year. So what does this mean for you as a shareholder? It starts with the evidence that we can successfully discover, develop, and launch an oral drug directed at a challenging target that offers something unique to patients. The result we expect is ORLADEYO will fill an unmet need for thousands of HAE patients and will reach $1 billion in global peak sales. That is a major accomplishment that sets us apart to create meaningful value for patients and shareholders. And we plan to do it again and complement, but not with one molecule or one pathway. Imagine many molecules from multiple pathways making the best and unique therapies others may not. That value is many, many more patients and potentially multiples of ORLADEYO peak sales. Now, I'll turn the call over to Charlie to go over the ORLADEYO performance.

Charlie Gayer -- Chief Commercial Officer Thanks, Jon. The core metrics for ORLADEYO were strong once again in the third quarter. New patient starts were right in line with our six-quarter running average. The absolute number of discontinuations was flat to slightly improved for the second quarter in a row, and we saw a 9% growth in patients on paid therapy. All these metrics point to what we have described previously, a pattern of consistent linear growth for ORLADEYO. I'll share more detail on what we saw in the quarter, and later, Anthony will provide context for how patient growth translated to revenue. We continued to add breadth and depth to the ORLADEYO prescriber base, and several facts point to our ability to expand ORLADEYO use. The overall prescriber base grew by another 11% in Q3, and we had the largest number of repeat prescribers in a quarter, as more physicians offer ORLADEYO to additional patients in their practices. Top 500 HAE treaters accounted for 54% of new ORLADEYO prescriptions, and about 25% of top 500 prescribers in Q3 were newly activated. We also have the largest number of tier-two prescribers in any quarter-to-date. These trends are consistent with another survey that we conducted with 60 allergists in September. As we have seen in prior surveys, physicians anticipated the percentage of their patients treated with ORLADEYO would grow more than any other HAE therapy over the next 12 months. They anticipate expanding use because they have seen our long-term clinical data. Many also have firsthand experience with our ORLADEYO, and our physician survey shows that ORLADEYO is the most requested HAE prophylaxis medication among patients. Next week at the American College of Asthma, Allergy, and Immunology Congress, we will have an oral presentation and a poster from large cohorts of patients who started on ORLADEYO after the launch. This real-world evidence confirms what physicians are seeing, regardless of baseline attack rate or prior therapy, patients experience excellent long-term control. Even with the success we've seen since launch, we constantly evaluate opportunities to invest, to do more. In Q3, we identified two such opportunities. The first is to add incrementally to our sales team to further accelerate impact in Top 500 position. The second is to add to our field market access team so that as we broaden our prescriber base, we can help practices that have less experience seeking payor authorization for HAE therapies. As we round out the second year on the market for ORLADEYO, we are excited about the future potential. One month into this quarter, our underlying metric remains strong. We expect to see a double-digit revenue growth percentage in the fourth quarter, with total ORLADEYO sales for the year ending at $255 million, more than doubling 2021 sales. Helen, I'll turn the call over to you.

Helen Thackray -- Chief Research and Development Officer Thanks, Charlie. Today, I'll discuss a few significant updates on our pipeline program, including progress with our current molecules, and our future goals for advancing multiple new drug candidates to treat complement-mediated diseases. As we continue to advance our pipeline, an important goal, which we believe is achievable, is to bring novel orally delivered products forward to treat many complement-mediated diseases. Our vision is to be the global leader in delivering medications, targeting dysfunction across the complement system. What's new with BioCryst today is some important progress we've made toward that vision. We have expanded our Factor D inhibitor program toward targeting the alternative pathway with a second potentially best-in-class molecule in the clinic. And we have identified several additional targets, where there is potential for oral drugs to address the other major pathways of the complement system. Our discovery team has already made progress toward generating molecules for each of these targets, giving us confidence that our unique discovery platform has the capability to produce oral drugs for these challenging targets. If successful, this would multiply our opportunities to treat diseases mediated by dysregulation of the complement cascade. So in total, we are not only adding a second Oral Factor D inhibitor to our portfolio for the alternative pathway, but also building the potential for multiple additional oral drugs to address diseases across the complement system, including those of the classical pathway, lectin pathway, and terminal pathway. We intend to invest in the development of a number of oral medicines for these targets. If we are successful in delivering world treatments for more than one pathway in the complement system, imagine also the possibility of addressing several pathways at once with combined oral drugs. This could expand treatment opportunities even further. With monotherapy single pathway approaches and with combination multiple pathway approaches for treatment of the most complex or serious diseases. Now we'll go into some of the specifics illustrating why we believe we can deliver both a first and then a best-in-class oral monotherapy Factor D inhibitor for a program targeting the alternative pathway. Overall, the goals of this program are twofold. One, to quickly bring a first molecule to market, putting BioCryst in a position to deliver the first, safe, and effective oral monotherapy Factor D inhibitor to patients across multiple complement-mediated diseases. BCX9930 has the potential to achieve this, and our near-term focus is on assessing swiftly and efficiently, whether we have successfully identified a safe and effective dose regimen that will keep us ready in pivotal trials in PNH on a path to registration. And two, to continue to produce and advance unique new molecules to achieve best-in-class outcomes for patients. By this, we mean molecules that bring some combination of improved potency, improved safety, or with longer exposure at therapeutic levels with oral delivery. And even more specifically, we mean a therapy that is differentiated in the field by delivering a safe and effective therapy in a once-daily dose. We did this with ORLADEYO, and we believe we can do it again. With BCX9930, we've made steady progress toward reinitiating enrollment with the pivotal program. We've begun screening new patients for enrollment and redeem trials and are gaining some initial experience at the lower dose in patients already on our studies. You will remember that we amended the Redeem and Renew protocols with a new dosing regimen of 400 milligrams twice daily with a brief step up at the start of dosing, in our effort to confirm a safe and effective dose for BCX9930. Our hypothesis is that this new dosing regimen, together with attention to simple hydration, may prevent the rise in serum creatinine observed in some patients previously at 500 milligrams twice daily. All patients who continue on BCX9930 have been switched from 500 milligrams to a lower dose. At this point, and with initial and limited experience, it is too early to draw any conclusions about the fact of these steps. Of course, if we observe something that warrants holding, we're just continuing the program, we will update you earlier as that occurs. Otherwise, our plan is to bring an update mid-2023 with more robust data from approximately 15 newly enrolled patients. If the new dosing regimen resolves the observations of renal injury, our plan would be to invest fully in the pivotal program and bring BCX9930 to market as quickly as possible. And if this is not demonstrated, we will discontinue the program. In addition, as I mentioned earlier, we are also advancing BCX10013 as the second unique molecule with the potential to be a differentiated product for the proximal alternative pathway of complement with once-daily dosing. BCX10013 has been moving at full speed for some time, and as a result is already in the clinic. We are reporting today the BCX10013 is being assessed in healthy volunteers at multiple dose levels, including at potentially therapeutic dose levels with single ascending doses and multiple ascending doses. Approximately 90 healthy volunteers have been dosed with BCX10013 at this point, and so far we have observed an initial safety tolerability and PK profile that's not only supportive advancing into evaluation in patients, but also looks promising for once-daily dosing. Our plan is to initiate patient studies to confirm the best dose level for advancement into a registration program. We'll have more to share with you about the data and the plan for this program in first quarter 2023. Finally, in other pipeline updates, I'll turn to BCX9250 and [inaudible]. Here, the competitive landscape for the ultra-rare disease, this ultra-rare disease is increasingly crowded, including with several late-stage programs assessing the same mechanism of action for the treatment of this disease as BCX9250 that of ALK two inhibition. We have concluded that it's increasingly likely the needs of patients here may be served by other products before BCX9250 can achieve registration. We are therefore discontinuing development BCX9250, and redirecting the investment of this program toward our many opportunities and complement. To conclude today's update on our pipeline, I'll repeat a theme you've heard from us before. We have succeeded with delivering orally administrated orally administered small molecules for challenging target. This capability gives us very high confidence that we can achieve our goal discussed today to deliver oral drugs across multiple, very different difficult targets in the complement system. Now, I'll pass it to Anthony.

Anthony Doyle -- Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Helen. With ORLADEYO on net revenue for the quarter coming in at $66 million, that puts the trailing 12-month revenue at around $227 million. That's already over $100 million more than our 2021 full year revenue. When comparing Q2 ORLADEYO revenue, which came in at $65.2 million to Q3 revenue at $66 million. There are a couple of things that we need to review to align to our comment on study growth. For Q2, we had a $2.2 million positive out-of-period reimbursement adjustment. We also had over $1 million of what would ordinarily have been July shipment a patients requested to ship in June due to the 4th of July holiday. For Q3, we also had a 500 K negative out-of-period reimbursement adjustment. Factoring in these elements, Q2 revenue would have come in at closer to $62 million, while Q3 revenue would have come in at $67.5 million. That's around 9% growth quarter-over-quarter. Even without taking into consideration these adjustments, the compounded quarterly growth rate from the end of last year where Q4 came in and around $46 million to Q3 of 2022 is over 9% growth quarter-over-quarter. The steady growth driven by the consistency of new starts and stabilizing DC rate, coupled with continued global expansion, gives us confidence that Q4 will deliver double-digit percentage growth over Q3, and as Charlie said, we are forecasting revenue for full year 2022 at $255 million. That's more than double our net revenue from last year and positions us well on our path to $1 billion of global peak sales. You can find our detailed third quarter financials in today's earnings press release, and I'd like to call your attention to a few items. Total revenue for the quarter was $75.8 million, outside of the $66 million from ORLADEYO, the remaining revenue came from a $6.9 million wrap of our stockpile order and $2.9 million from ramp-above API sales to our partners. Operating expenses, not including non-cash compensation for the quarter was $83.3 million, and cash at the end of the quarter was up $463 million, that includes the $75 million that we drew from the offering facility in July. Capital allocation is critical to growing biotechs like ours, and when 9930 enrollment was paused, our team did a great job of controlling both internal and external spend. At the same time as identifying a hypothesis to potentially remediate the issue, getting agreement from the FDA to lift the partial clinical hold, and ultimately getting the trials back up and running as quickly as they did. When we started the year, we guided ORLADEYO net revenue of no less than $250 million, and OpEx of between $440 and $480 million. Before the enrollment hole for 9930, we were definitely looking at being on the higher end of the [inaudible] We're now guiding to $255 million in revenue, and between $365 and $370 million of OpEx for full year 2022, which is more than $100 million less in OpEx than the higher end of that initial guidance. Net cash utilization is therefore significantly lower than we had anticipated coming into the year, which in the current macroeconomic environment is tremendously valuable. As Helen mentioned, we're also discontinuing BCX9250, which would have required more than $100 million of investment over the coming years. The disciplined approach to capital allocation, and our healthy balance sheet puts us in a strong position to invest in our future growth opportunities. Now, operator, we'll be happy to open up to Q&A. Questions & Answers: OperatorThank you, sir. [Operator instruction] And the first question in the queue comes from Ken Cacciatore with Cowen and Company. Sir, your line is open.

Ken Cacciatore --

 Cowen and Company -- Analyst Thanks so much. Great explanation on Q3, appreciate that on ORLADEYO. Just wondering, with the investments that you're making to continue to press the advantage you have with the commercial spend, do you want to give us a little bit of thoughts as we look into 2023? It seems like Q4 is on a nice trend already. Maybe any context you can provide for ORLADEYO, and maybe discuss when we should start seeing a little bit more ex-U.S. contribution. And I want to give a follow-up now because I know you want to limit it to one question. John, just in general, what do you think about the company, wonderful success commercially with ORLADEYO and on the pathway to $1 billion, but an earlier stage pipeline, we saw Biohaven take the opportunity to really maximize the value of their lead commercial asset with the pipeline that was trailing, as you kind of look at the company and how the value you've created in ORLADEY, plus kind of a little bit of an earlier stage pipeline albeit we hope 9930 continues to progress. Can you just talk about how the company is looking at maybe maximizing the value of these two? Would something like Biohaven's approach make sense to your organization? Thanks so much.

Jon Stonehouse -- Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Tell you what, I'll take the first one. Well, I actually.

Charlie Gayer -- Chief Commercial Officer You want to start with the last one and I'll come back to it.

Jon Stonehouse -- Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So Ken, the strategy I guess I look at it slightly differently, we have a pivotal program going on with 9930, and our expectation is if we find a safe and effective dose, we're off to the races with that molecule, and then competing with an oral drug in an injectable space. So I don't see a big gap there. And at the end of the day, it's steady revenue growth. So if we're not burning a lot of capital on the R&D side, the revenue catches up, and you saw that this year when Anthony's guidance I mean, we're a little more than what, $100 million apart for the year in terms of revenue and an expense. So, I mean, if you look at all the other biotech companies around our size, that is a unique position to be in. We'll always be open to other options, and other creative solutions like Biohaven has done. But for right now, we're building a pipeline and we're launching a drug that we believe is going to be $1 billion.

 CharlieCharlie Gayer -- Chief Commercial Officer Ken, and so on your other questions around the commercial investments, I think the first thing to say is and John mentioned this upfront, we still have all confidence in the world that this is a $1 billion peak sales drug. And so as we look to make other investments, it's really about being as efficient and accelerated in that process as possible. You're asking around 2023, I think we'll give guidance for 2023 in early next year. But we feel very good about our trajectory based on the underlying trends. And then as far as ex-U.S., eventually at some point we'll probably start to break that out. It's still for 2022, a small percentage of sales. But everything that we see in the underlying trends in Europe and beyond gives us confidence that that will contribute to hundred million plus at peak sales. So we're feeling really good about where we are.

Ken Cacciatore --

 Cowen and Company -- Analyst Great. Thanks so much.OperatorThank you. The next question to you comes from Chris Raymond with Piper Sandler.

Chris Raymond --

 Piper Sandler -- Analyst Hey, guys. Thanks. So a question, and also a follow-up. Just on ORLADEYO quarterly quarter-to-quarter dynamics. Appreciate the color and the puts and takes from Q2 and also Q3. But can you maybe provide some color on the timing for understanding this dynamic and recognizing that pull forward? I'm just curious because it wasn't mentioned last quarter and just getting hit by some investors wondering why. And then maybe as a follow-up, on the next generation molecule 10013, can you walk us through what you know, pretty clinically that gives you confidence that you won't run into the same sort of renal signal as 9930?

Jon Stonehouse -- Chief Executive Officer Yes. Maybe I'll take the first one, Anthony. If I go wrong direction you can correct me. But we did point out that there was $2.2 million of non-period accrual adjustment in the second quarter that made that higher than normal. And then, you don't know the differences between the two until you finish a quarter. Right. And so we had some our finish a month like July. And what happened in retrospect is July 4th landed on a Monday, I believe, this year and a bunch of shipments came in prior to that because I'm sure people weren't home. And as a result, it got shipped in June instead of July. So I don't know if there's anything else to add.

Anthony Doyle -- Chief Financial Officer Just I mean, will things like this happen? They will, right? I think what we're not going to do is solely focus on that quarter to quarter. But that's why we lean into the idea of the underlying strength. Right. We feel really good around where we are, where we're going from a growth perspective and that we're on that path to $1 billion. So in the future, will there be some kind of quarter over quarter as it relates to holidays or seasonality? Maybe? But I think hitting on that underlying growth factors, and how confident it makes us in terms of getting to the $255 for this year and $1 billion thereafter is our focus.

Jon Stonehouse -- Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Last thing I'd say on that front is we're the only ones with the data at the end of the day, no offense to those of you trying to guess. And so we think we're the most accurate guider. And we believe we're telling you right now that we believe we'll finish the year at $255. And that's a spectacular outcome given that we blew away the first year with 122 so more than doubling. Helen, you want to take the second part of Chris's question?

Helen Thackray -- Chief Research and Development Officer Yes. So it's BCX100013. We don't know yet that we will not see what we're seeing with 9930. However, we do know a number of things that give us confidence. One is it's a unique molecule, which means it has its own unique characteristic, and so we expect it to behave differently in the clinic, and we're seeing that. Two, as we know what we saw with 9930. With this year 9930, we've learned from that with applied that in our process with both preclinical and clinical data. And again, what we're seeing in the clinic with BCX10013 as supportive of proceeding and patient trials, and supportive of the potential for once-daily dosing.

Jon Stonehouse -- Chief Executive Officer And so some of it, you know, we've gathered data that gives us confidence that it could be different. And then there's some that's just not mature enough that we can't declare that it's that different, we won't see it. But we will be moving it forward if we thought there was a high risk here.

Chris Raymond --

 Piper Sandler -- Analyst So excellent. Thank you, guys.OperatorAnd the next question in the queue comes from Jessica Fye with J.P. Morgan.

Daniel Chen --

 JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst Morning, guys. Thanks for taking our question. This is Daniel for just for Jess. A couple of questions. First, I guess you've elaborated a little bit on this, but what were the inputs you considered when narrowing down the full-year guidance to the lower end of the prior numbers? And to understanding that we'll see detailed data in early 2023 for 10013. But maybe you can you elaborate on some. Of the early clinical details that have generated with that product? For example, in terms of AP hemolysis, that was a just a one-state oral therapy. If I can sneak one more is assuming that maybe assuming you're still in a position, assuming you still position 10013, similarly to you have been developing the 49930 before by targeting multiple oral indications. How are you thinking about the potential impact of an IRA, and how that might not encourage drug developers to develop more than one or an indication for the asset? Thanks.

Jon Stonehouse -- Chief Executive Officer You're referring to the Inflation Reduction Act and the multiple indications on one molecule?

Daniel Chen --

 JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst Yep. Yeah.

Jon Stonehouse -- Chief Executive Officer I'll come back to that. Helen, you can take the 10013. I'll take the lower end. And Anthony, again, help me here. So, I mean, it's real simple, Daniel, we have another quarter's worth of data, and we're into November now, and so we've said we would be the accurate guide here, and we believe we're going to be at $255. This is, I think one big difference in rare diseases versus mass markets is it doesn't take a lot of patients to have a movement one direction or another. So we're real confident in the $255. And that's a doubling or more than a doubling of the first year great start. Helen, you want to take the 10013?

Helen Thackray -- Chief Research and Development Officer Yeah, sure. So in terms of the early clinical data with 10013 and this is just to be clear, this is in healthy volunteers. So we have 90, about nine healthy volunteers who've been dosed with the drug. And so we have safety data and pharmacokinetics data for those individuals we have that, including dose levels that may be therapeutic in range, and we do not have data on patients at this point. So our plan is to move into patients next year to assess the potential for the complement activity.

Jon Stonehouse -- Chief Executive Officer And then on the Inflation Reduction Act, I think there's a lot of implementation, a lot of unknowns yet that have to occur before we can draw any conclusions. And maybe we are different than others, but we're not going to say we're not going to bring a molecule forward in a bunch of other indications when patients are in need. And we think that we can create real value for shareholders. So, it's certainly on our radar. But, one of the beauties I think in the complement system is single molecules can go after multiple diseases. And so that's our plan.OperatorThank you. The next question in the queue comes from Brian Abrahams with RBC Capital.

Joe Spak --

 RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst Hi, this is Joe, in for Brian. Thank you for taking our question. I just wanted to ask one question on ORLADEYO once again. If you can tell us anything about like any improvement you're seeing and patient retention rate and, if there were any specific types of patients that they tend to stay on longer ORLADEYO. And how is your education or awareness initiative impacting this retention rates as a break [inaudible] Thank you.

Charlie Gayer -- Chief Commercial Officer Sure. Yeah. So as I mentioned on the call, first of all, we've seen two quarters in a row now of flat patient retention or patient discontinuations even as our overall patient base has grown. So I think we're making a difference. What we see is the patient types that do absolutely the best are patients who sweat, who are controlled on other prophylactic therapies, and then switch over. And in particular, patients who had been on paid therapy, or as I've said previously about 70% of those patients stay on ORLADEYO for at least 12 months. And so that's what we're really focused on, is getting the right patient type to switch ORLADEYO. And then as any patient starts off, we really focus on setting expectations for both efficacy and any side effects that some patients may experience, and we see that that makes a difference. So we're pleased with where we are with patient retention, and we think that this is going to be pretty stable going forward.

Jon Stonehouse -- Chief Executive Officer And Charlie mentioned this point around the college meeting, and I would just encourage people to watch the presentation and look at the poster because there's some real-world data in there that's incredibly encouraging around, as Charlie described, the best switches are the ones that are on controlled on prophy, injectable prophy. So, you know, our view remains that if you can be controlled on our drug on a once-daily capsule, why on earth would you not try it and see if it works for you? Right. And so that's our goal. We're continuing to chip away at this, and we believe we're making really good progress on our way to many thousands of patients and, peak sales of $1 billion.

Joe Spak --

 RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst Thank you for the insight.OperatorAnd the next question in the queue comes from Jon Wolleben with JMP Securities.

Jon Wolleben --

 JMP Securities -- Analyst Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Two for me, I was hoping you could comment a bit on what you're seeing on growth net adjustment. As we're moving forward, you gave some comments on paid patient growth, which is helpful. And then also when you talk about the 15 patients from 9930 from what you want to see data to make the [inaudible] decision. I just want to check, is this strictly a PNH patient, or is it the real patients, as well or some combination? How are you thinking about what makes up that go no go population? Thanks.

Jon Stonehouse -- Chief Executive Officer Yeah, I'll take. There's been no major movements in gross, and you know we talked about in Q1 the impact that we had there. But for Q2, 3, and 4, our expectation has been that it would be stable on reimbursed patients. Again, we said around 15% to 20%. Charlie talked previously around what we did from a PBM coverage, and insurance or payer coverage perspective at north of 80%. So, Jon, I don't think there's any kind of big drivers we will continue to see from a percentage numerator versus denominator perspective, including free product that get toward the 15% to 20%. We still feel good about that, but no major movements from Q2. And then the 15 patients Helen?

Helen Thackray -- Chief Research and Development Officer Yeah. So the 15 patients we're looking for, first of all, approximately 15 patients, that's the right number for us to be able to have confidence in the data to continue to advance the program. Secondly, it's likely to be patients mostly from the Redeem Studies with PNH, if that's a program where we have more sites, two global pivotal trials, and we're likely to see enrollment faster there. In the Renew program, we will continue to enroll in that program. There's also a Brennan period built in, and so it may take longer for patients to be dosed and proceed to an outcome. So we assume it's going to be mostly PNH.

Jon Stonehouse -- Chief Executive Officer Yeah, remember, Jon, that they've got to have a biopsy to make sure that they truly have disease in the [inaudible] so that just takes long.

Jon Wolleben --

 JMP Securities -- Analyst Thank you.OperatorThe next question in the queue comes from Gena Wang with Barclays. Your line is open, ma'am.

Gena Wang --

 Barclays -- Analyst Thank you for taking my question. I have a question regarding ORLADEYO launch. So give me your prior comment, just wondering, is retention rate now maintained at the middle 60? And then my next question is regarding 2022, and your guidance $255. I just did a quick math. You know, that will translate to $74.5 million for 4Q. And if we use like $67.5 million for 3Q, that we have a $7 million growth. And we are only one month into 4Q, and also we have holidays in 4Q. Just wondering what makes you confident you can achieve or Q numbers.

Anthony Doyle -- Chief Financial Officer Charlie, you want to take the retention?

Charlie Gayer -- Chief Commercial Officer Sure. Yeah. So Gena, the one-year retention overall. Yes, in the mid 60 percentage. And then what we're really seeing is that, and we've talked about this before is where we lose the majority of patients is in the first few months then up to six months. Once patients get out to a year, they're doing well on or they're only going to stay on if they're doing well. And so those patients are much more likely to stay on for the long term.

Anthony Doyle -- Chief Financial Officer You want to take it?

Jon Stonehouse -- Chief Executive Officer Sure. 

Anthony Doyle -- Chief Financial Officer Fourth quarter?

Jon Stonehouse -- Chief Executive Officer No. You know what? I think for Q4, Charlie talked about steady growth. That is Gena, from an underlying perspective, what we're seeing. And so I think getting to those numbers that you're talking about, right, to get to the $255. Given where we are coming into November out of October, I think we feel really good that we feel really confident about heading out to $255.

Charlie Gayer -- Chief Commercial Officer Yeah. And we don't guide quarterly, but by the fact that we say $255 giving you three-quarters worth of revenue, we are basically guiding you in the fourth quarter. Yes.OperatorThank you. And the next question comes from Justin Kim with Oppenheimer and Company.

Justin Kim --

 Oppenheimer and Company -- Analyst Hi, and good morning. Thanks for taking the question. You know, as you think about sort of full speed ahead for the Redeem Studies later next year, could you describe how much separation you see between 9930 and 10013 program? Just from a timing perspective and any sort of progress with 10013 that might just incentivize commercialization of the next generation inhibitor.

Helen Thackray -- Chief Research and Development Officer Yeah, I'm sure, I can take that. So the regime studies it, just to be clear, we are going quickly with redeem studies, and the question is whether we continue that. So they are advancing, this is a pivotal program. We expected to be the first program to read out. We expect to be the first program to market. Should we have successfully addressed the dose for safe and effective drug. So that is the in position to be the first market. And we have a file, a second-generation molecule that is also in a position to get to market. It's early, it's in phase one, we have healthy volunteer data, but we think it has the potential to be best in class, and so we're bringing it through behind.

Anthony Doyle -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah, I mean, it's about two years at the end of the day between the two, but one of them is in a pivotal study, and one of those in a phase one. And so if we find the safe and effective dose, we've got something that creates real value for patients in this market. And so, of course, we would invest in it if we have a safe and effective dose. I think the more important question is how do we allocate what we go after with each molecule, in our view, is probably a skinnier set of indications for 9930. That's how we see it today. And then because we believe 10013 has the potential to be best, maybe a broader set of indications for that one. But that's, you know, we'll see how the programs unfold over time and give you more clarity on that later.

Justin Kim --

 Oppenheimer and Company -- Analyst Thank you.OperatorThe next question in the queue comes from Tazeen Ahmad from Bank of America. Your line is open.

Tazeen Ahmad --

 Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I think most of them have been answered. For 4Q now that you have some experience calendar-wise with the launch, do you expect in general any kind of seasonality? And then secondly, on the subject of pricing, you know, historically rare drugs have been able to take at least annual price increases as you talk to insurers payers, has there been any change in tone on that? Obviously not asking you to guide, but just in terms of any kind of sentiment shift that you may or may not be seeing from payers. And then lastly, as you think about 2023 sales for ORLADEYO, where do you think your biggest area of untapped demand lies going forward? Thanks.

Jon Stonehouse -- Chief Executive Officer So who wants to take the seasonality piece?

Charlie Gayer -- Chief Commercial Officer OK. I can. So, Tazeen, I think, you know, looking forward into the new year, I think we'll see the same kind of seasonality that we saw last year kind of going into Q1. As we talked about, That's always a time when the majority or a good portion of the patients have to go through prior authorization. So I think we'll comment more on that next quarter, but you can anticipate that. As far as pricing, we don't obviously, we don't comment on general pricing, but payer sensitivity, no, I think, you know, payers are always sensitive to high-priced therapies for rare diseases like HAE. But we're not seeing anything notable about that.

Jon Stonehouse -- Chief Executive Officer And there was one of the 2023 untapped potential market that let me start then you can add, you know, I think this further investment that Charlie talked about, we'll see the bulk of the value that come in in 2023 for sure. But the message has been consistent quarter after quarter after quarter. The best patients that we get are ones that are controlled on injectable pro-fee that switch over to ORLADEYO, and again I'd encourage you to to pay attention to what we're presenting at the college meeting. So continuing to pick away, and chip away at that I think is the key. And then you've heard me comment today and many times over over the quarters around our top 500 versus Tier two, and recall for everyone the top 500 is about half the HAE market, and then there's tier two and we had 54% of our new prescriptions come from the top 500, so really great balance. And we see opportunities in both hands kind of at the top of the market and then expanding the market. And so as we've expanded our team a little bit, it's to take advantage of both of those segments.

Tazeen Ahmad --

 Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Thank you.OperatorAnd the next question the queue comes from [inaudible] with Needham and Company.Unknown speaker Hi, this is [inaudible] Thanks for taking my question. You just talk about how the recent setbacks with other oral HAE prophylactic products in development changes your long-term outlook for ORLADEYO, and how do you see the competitive landscape playing out? Thanks.

Jon Stonehouse -- Chief Executive Officer Yeah, I think I said it in my comments. It's just a reminder of how challenging it is to make a potent, specific orally bioavailable drug. I think there are now five companies, including us, with a world stat that had programs that had to be stopped. So, you know, these are really hard. What the flipside of that is, it means we may be the only one at the end of the day. And so that puts us in a spectacular position because we know that patients really want an oral, they want a decreased burden of disease and a decreased burden of therapy. And you can offer that with one capsule once a day with ORLADEYO. So I don't think it dramatically changes. The other piece I would say to the question, too, is we're absolutely in our competitors that are in the market that are have profit drugs are seeing this as well, is the market is definitely moving more and more and more to the prophy, and away from on demand. And I think on demand is going to be a tiny, tiny piece of the market ultimately, and then we'll be battling out with injectables for the prophy.Unknown speaker OK. Thanks.

Jon Stonehouse -- Chief Executive Officer Yep.OperatorThank you. And our last question comes from Maury Raycroft with Jefferies.

Maury Raycroft --

 Jefferies -- Analyst Hi. Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. I'm just wondering if you can elaborate more on the comment about investing more to keep the ORLADEYO momentum going. You mentioned the increase in sales team in addition to field market teams. Is that the further investment you're referring to? And will you continue to add to these teams, or are you at a status quo at this point heading into 2023?

Jon Stonehouse -- Chief Executive Officer Surely, it might be good to just talk about one of the keys to the success of the launch so far has been your agility, right? Look at that data, understand what the data is telling you, and then making adjustments.

Charlie Gayer -- Chief Commercial Officer Yeah. So more to Jon's points, we have always looked where we can do more, and we when we built the launch when we built the team, we felt and we did have a great team that was ready to compete in the space, and I think we've seen that. Then what we're always doing is looking where we can do just a little bit more at the margins. And so previously have talked about how we added some additional field-based patient-facing members of the team because that's a need that we saw. And now we saw an opportunity just to add a little more to our sales team and a market access team. So we'll continue to look for these opportunities. We feel good about where we're at right now, but at some point in the future I may come back and say we've invested a little bit more because we've had other opportunities, but that's the approach we take.

Maury Raycroft --

 Jefferies -- Analyst Got it. Make sense. Thank you.OperatorWe have no further questions at the queue at this time, so I will now the call over to Mr. Stonehouse for closing remarks.

Jon Stonehouse -- Chief Executive Officer Thank you, and thanks for your interest in BioCryst. I was recently shown some data from one of the banks around the number of publicly traded biotech companies. It's a really, really crowded space and what was an eye-popping was the number of companies that are trading below cash. You know, it's a really tough time and you guys know that better than anybody. But what I think what's interesting is how do you differentiate yourself when there are so many companies with gene editing, gene therapy, you know, you name it. And I think at BioCryst, the way we see it is we've shown you that we have a discovery engine that can do things perhaps that others can't. Right. In making an oral, potent specific once-a-day Caltrine inhibitor, we've shown you that we can file in the U.S., Europe, and Japan and get approvals all within four months of each other. That's even hard for a big company to do. And we've shown you that we can successfully launch a drug. Right? I think the initial consensus was $30 million this year, I think it was $218, and we've consistently beat that. Right. And why? Because we look at the data objectively, we develop a plan, and then we figure out how to how to get the business. And so that puts us in a different category, I think than a lot of other companies. And then the last point is we have access to capital, whether it's revenue or other sources of capital. We're not solely dependent on our shares to bring an additional capital into the market. So you add all those things together and then you have a team that, you know, I think your job is really hard, and do you believe what you hear? And I hope we're convincing you that we're trying to be objective in what we see and what we do, that we're disciplined around how we allocate capital and what decisions we make. It's hard to make decisions to stop programs. It's hard to make decisions in this business in general. But we're not afraid of that. And hopefully, we're showing you that we're trust trustworthy and that we're disciplined in how we do it. So we think we stand out and we look forward to talking to you more and sharing more with you about how that is and hopefully get you more interested in their company. So have a great day, and thanks for your interest in BioCryst.Operator[Operator signoff] Duration: 0 minutesCall participants:

Phillips 66 (PSX 2.96%)Q3 2022 Earnings CallNov 01, 2022, 12:00 p.m. ETContents:  Prepared Remarks Questions and Answers Call Participants  Prepared Remarks:  OperatorWelcome to the third quarter 2022 Phillips 66 earnings conference call. My name is Sylvie and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Jeff Dietert, vice president, investor relations. Jeff, you may begin.

Jeff Dietert -- Vice President, Investor Relations



 Good morning and welcome to Phillips 66 third quarter earnings conference call. Participants on today's call include Mark Lashier, president and CEO; Kevin Mitchell, EVP and CFO; Brian Mandell, EVP, Marketing and Commercial; Tim Roberts, EVP, Midstream and Chemicals; and Rich Harbison, SVP, Refining. Today's presentation material can be found on the investor relations section of the Phillips 66 website, along with supplemental financial and operating information. We provided supplemental information this morning for Chemicals, Refining and Marketing and Midstream. The remaining supplemental information will be available with the 10-Q filing. We'll return to the normal supplemental release next quarter. Slide 2 contains our safe harbor statement. We will be making forward-looking statements during today's call.Actual results may differ materially from today's comments. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included here as well as in our SEC filings. Before we begin our discussion, I would like to highlight that we will be hosting an investor day in New York on November 9. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mark.

 Mark Lashier -- President and Chief Executive Officer



 Thanks, Jeff. Our third quarter results reflect the continued favorable market environment and our strong operating performance. We ran at high rates during the summer driving season to meet peak demand for critical transportation fuel. Our Refining business delivered improved market capture this quarter, supported by strong distillate cracks and wider discounts for heavy sour crudes. In the third quarter, we had adjusted earnings of $3.1 billion or $6.46 per share. We generated $3.1 billion in operating cash flow. We're committed to strong shareholder distributions. During the quarter, we ramped up share repurchases in a meaningful way, purchasing almost $700 million of common stock. Including dividends, we returned $1.2 billion to shareholders. During the quarter, we continued to focus on operating excellence and advancing our strategic priorities. Our enterprisewide business transformation is underway. The team is implementing key initiatives to deliver results. We look forward to providing more details at our investor day next week. In Midstream, we realigned our economic and governance interest in DCP Midstream, LP and Gray Oak Pipeline, LLC. Our economic interest in DCP Midstream increased to 43%, and our economic interest in Gray Oak Pipeline decreased to 6.5%. At the same time, we made an offer to acquire all publicly held common units of DCP Midstream, LP.



 Our increased interest in DCP Midstream allows for further integration and optimization across our NGL business. The wellhead to market value chain structure will allow us to capture new commercial opportunities and optimize costs. Additionally, we started up Frac 4 at the Sweeny Hub on time and under budget. In October, Frac 4 achieved full run rates, bringing our total Sweeny Hub fractionation capacity to 550,000 barrels per day. CPChem is pursuing a portfolio of high-return projects, enhancing its asset base as well as optimizing its existing operations. This includes growing its normal alpha olefins business with a second world-scale unit to produce one-hexene, a critical component in high-performance polyethylene. The unit is being constructed at CPChem's Old Ocean, Texas facility and will produce 586 million pounds per year. CPChem is also building a new propylene splitter at its Cedar Bayou facility, which will expand its capacity by one billion pounds per year. Both the one-hexene and propylene splitter projects are expected to start up in the second half of 2023. CPChem continues to develop two world-scale petrochemical facilities on the U.S. Gulf Coast and in Ras Laffan, Qatar. A final investment decision for the U.S. Gulf Coast project is expected before the end of this year. In Refining, we're converting our San Francisco refinery into one of the world's largest renewable fuels facilities. The Rodeo Renewed project is expected to cost approximately $850 million and begin commercial operations in the first quarter of 2024. Upon completion, Rodeo will have over 50,000 barrels per day of renewable fuels production capacity. Now I'll turn the call over to Kevin to review the financial results.

Kevin Mitchell -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Thank you, Mark, and hello, everyone. Before I talk about the financials, let me begin by summarizing the accounting impacts of DCP Midstream. On August 17, we completed the merger of DCP Midstream, LLC and Gray Oak Pipeline, LLC. In connection with the transaction, we were delegated governance rights over DCP Midstream, LP and its general partner entities as well as DCP Sand Hills Pipeline, LLC and DCP Southern Hills Pipeline, LLC. Effective August 18, our financial results reflect the consolidation of these entities. So starting with an overview on Slide 4, we summarize these financial results. We reported third quarter earnings of $5.4 billion. We had special items amounting to an after-tax gain of $2.3 billion, including the net gain related to the consolidation of DCP Midstream, Sand Hills Pipeline and Southern Hills Pipeline and the transfer of interest in Gray Oak Pipeline. Excluding special items, adjusted earnings were $3.1 billion or $6.46 per share. The $33 million decrease in the fair value of our investment in NOVONIX reduced earnings per share by $0.05. We generated $3.1 billion of operating cash flow. Capital spending for the quarter was $735 million, including the company's $306 million investment in DCP Midstream, LLC associated with the merger, net of cash acquired. We returned $1.2 billion to shareholders through $466 million of dividends and $694 million of share repurchases. We ended the quarter with 473 million shares outstanding. Moving to Slide 5. This slide highlights the change in adjusted results by segment from the second quarter to the third quarter, including the impact of consolidating DCP Midstream, Sand Hills Pipeline and Southern Hills Pipeline effective August 18. The Midstream segment, Corporate and Other, income taxes and noncontrolling interests are impacted by the consolidations. The higher noncontrolling interest reflects the portion of these entities not owned by Phillips 66. During the period, adjusted earnings decreased $163 million, mostly due to lower results in Refining and Chemicals, partially offset by higher Midstream and Marketing and Specialties results. Slide 6 shows our Midstream results. Third quarter adjusted pre-tax income was $645 million compared with $292 million in the previous quarter. The consolidation of DCP Midstream results are now reported within NGL and Other. Transportation contributed adjusted pre-tax income of $229 million, down $21 million from the prior quarter. The decrease was mainly due to lower equity earnings from the Gray Oak Pipeline resulting from the merger. NGL and Other adjusted pre-tax income was $449 million compared with $282 million in the second quarter. The increase was primarily due to the consolidation of DCP Midstream, Sand Hills Pipeline and Southern Hills Pipeline effective August 18. The fractionators at the Sweeny Hub averaged 429,000 barrels per day, and the Freeport LPG Export facility loaded 249,000 barrels per day in the third quarter. Our NOVONIX investment is marked-to-market at the end of each reporting period. The fair value of the investment, including foreign exchange impacts, decreased $33 million in the third quarter compared with a decrease of $240 million in the second quarter. Turning to Chemicals on Slide 7. Chemicals had third quarter adjusted pre-tax income of $135 million compared with $273 million in the previous quarter. Olefins and Polyolefins adjusted pre-tax income was $105 million. The $111 million decrease from the previous quarter was primarily due to lower margins resulting from a sharp decline in polyethylene prices. This was partially offset by lower turnaround costs. Global O&P utilization was 90% for the quarter. Adjusted pre-tax income for SA&S was $60 million, in line with the second quarter. The higher costs in Other mainly reflect legal contingencies. During the third quarter, we received $41 million in cash distributions from CPChem. Turning to Refining on Slide 8. Refining third quarter adjusted pre-tax income was $2.8 billion, down from $3.1 billion in the second quarter. The decrease was primarily due to lower realized margins, partially offset by higher volumes. Our realized margins decreased by 6% to $26.58 per barrel, while the composite global 3:2:1 market crack decreased by 22%. Pretax turnaround costs were $225 million, in line with the previous quarter. Crude utilization was 91% in the third quarter and clean product yield was 85%. Slide 9 covers market capture. Our composite global 3:2:1 market crack for the third quarter was $36.29 per barrel compared to $46.72 per barrel in the second quarter. Realized margin was $26.58 per barrel and resulted in an overall market capture of 73%. Market capture in the previous quarter was 61%. Market capture is impacted by the configuration of our refineries. We have a higher distillate yield and lower gasoline yield than the 3:2:1 market indicator. During the third quarter, the distillate crack decreased $8.14 per barrel, and the gasoline crack decreased $11.84 per barrel. Losses from secondary products of $3.50 per barrel or $0.47 per barrel higher than the previous quarter. Our feedstock loss of $1.48 per barrel was in line with the previous quarter. Feedstock advantage from widening heavy sour crude differentials was offset by the impact of higher feedstock costs relative to dated Brent in the Atlantic Basin. The Other category reduced realized margins by $1.29 per barrel. This category includes RINs, freight costs, clean product realizations and inventory impacts. Moving to Marketing and Specialties on Slide 10. Adjusted third quarter pre-tax income was $847 million compared with $765 million in the prior quarter. Marketing and Other adjusted pre-tax income was $717 million, up $61 million from the second quarter. The improvement reflects higher international margins, partially offset by lower domestic results, including inventory impacts. Specialties generated third quarter adjusted pre-tax income of $130 million. The $21 million increase was largely due to improved base oil margins. On Slide 12, the Corporate and Other segment had adjusted pre-tax costs of $246 million, $11 million higher than the prior quarter. The increase was mainly due to consolidating DCP Midstream interest expense of $34 million, partially offset by higher interest income. Slide 12 shows the change in cash during the third quarter. We started the quarter with a $2.8 billion cash balance. Cash from operations was $3.1 billion. During the quarter, we funded $735 million of capital spending, including the company's $306 million investment in DCP Midstream, LLC associated with the merger, net of cash acquired. We returned $1.2 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Our ending cash balance was $3.7 billion. We ended the quarter with a net debt-to-capital ratio of 29%, including the consolidation of DCP Midstream. This concludes my review of the financial and operating results. Next, I'll cover a few outlook items. In Chemicals, we expect the fourth quarter global O&P utilization rate to be in the mid-90s. In Refining, we expect the fourth quarter worldwide crude utilization rate to be in the low to mid-90s and pre-tax turnaround expenses to be between $180 million and $220 million. As a result of strong turnaround execution and timing, we expect full year turnaround expenses to be lower than our original $800 million to $900 million of guidance. We anticipate fourth quarter Corporate and Other costs to come in between $300 million and $325 million pre-tax, reflecting a full quarter of DCP Midstream interest expense. Now we will open the line for questions. Questions & Answers: OperatorThank you, sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] And your first question will be from Doug Leggate at Bank of America. Please go ahead.

Doug Leggate --

 Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. Kevin, I wonder if I could just ask you about your thoughts on the balance sheet going forward. I mean, clearly, you're back to, I guess on a capitalization basis, you're back to pre-COVID levels pretty much. But the absolute debt, now you have DCP is still about 30% up on where it was before the downturn. So how are you thinking about where you want the balance sheet to be going forward and how that might play into your cash return strategy?

Kevin Mitchell -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yes, Doug. Thanks. It's a good question. So we feel pretty good that even with consolidation of DCP, the debt-to-capital ratio, net of cash, is sub-30%. So we feel good about the metric from that standpoint. And also, if you just look at debt-to-EBITDA metrics, they're still very strong. But the reality is it's $17.8 billion, circa $18 billion of debt on a fully consolidated basis. And so I think given the overall financial position we're in, the cash generation that we have, you'll see us continue to do some debt reduction. Bear in mind, we haven't yet funded the buy-in of the public, so that puts more pressure on the balance sheet regardless of how we actually execute on that funding between debt and cash. And so we'll continue to want to make some debt reductions. But the difference now between where we were over the last couple of years, where we're trying to get rid of the pandemic debt that we had added is, we don't need to make debt reduction the No. 1 priority for discretionary cash. Cash generation, cash balances are sufficient that we'

ll be able to do some -- gradually chip away at the debt balance and, at the same time, continue to return a healthy amount of cash to shareholders.

Doug Leggate --

 Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst I'm trying hard, Kevin, not to ask anything that I know you won't answer, given that you've got the analyst day. So I'm avoiding some of the obvious things,

 but I do want to try one that really came up in the last -- the call that preceded this one with Marathon. And it's the issue about the industry or senior management's view of mid-cycle. And Marathon, we're quite clear to say, look, they think mid-cycle has moved up. You guys used to talk about, I guess, $6 billion to $7 billion of mid-cycle cash flow. Again, not pre-empting next week, but can you maybe offer, whether Mark or anyone else, how you feel about the go-forward outlook for mid-cycle earnings for this business, for the Refining business?

Mark Lashier -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yes, Doug, we are going to cover that a bit next week. I think that there's two things to take into consideration there. Has the market mid-cycle moved, it has our ability to generate EBITDA move. And certainly, the piece that we control, we know we'll be moving, and we'll provide details next week. And as far as the market, we're still watching that to see how that evolves. But we'll be more focused on what we're doing to drive our mid-cycle going forward.

Doug Leggate --

 Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst I understand. We'll wait until next week. Thank you, guys.OperatorNext question will be from Neil Mehta at Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Neil Mehta --

 Goldman Sachs -- Analyst Yeah. Good morning, team. I wanted to start off on the waterfall on Slide 20 of the deck in the Central Corridor. Really exceptional capture rates in that region. And I was wondering if there's anything unusual in there if there's something structural that we should capitalize, as I know that other bucket can move around a bunch. And how much did WCS help this quarter? Or given the fact that it typically comes in at a lag, is that more of a 4Q tailwind?

Mark Lashier -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yes, Neil. We're very pleased with the Central Corridor performance. There are a number of factors that differentiated the second quarter to the third quarter and a number of things that happened in the third quarter. I'll let Rich dive into the details around that.

Rich Harbison -- Senior Vice President, Refining OK, Mark. Neil, good question. And yes, the Mid-Con Central Corridor had a very good quarter. Let me start by resetting the basis for the second quarter. Second quarter for us was a heavy turnaround in this region. So a lot of the difference you're seeing is the lack of turnarounds in the third quarter. Our mechanical availability during the third quarter was very good. We had high utilizations sitting at around 93% and strong clean product yields sitting at 88% for the Corridor. So good performance on both of those. Of course, those directly relate to increased volumes. And with the lack of turnarounds, we had a lot lower operating expense for the quarter as well. As you indicated as well, Neil, the market conditions were quite favorable for our kit. We saw widening Canadian spreads, which are quite favorable for us as well as a very strong distillate crack in the region. And that also plays well for our kit, which is a strong distillate producer. So I think what you're seeing here is a strong operating performance in favorable market conditions playing out for us in the third quarter.

Neil Mehta --

 Goldman Sachs -- Analyst Yes. And maybe we could stay on that point around Western Canadian crude. It has been pretty wide here, and it's widened out in the curve for '23 as well. So would love your guys' perspective on what you think is going on there. And given it does tend to come in at a lag, should we see a disproportionate impact of that tailwind in Q4?

Brian Mandell -- Executive Vice President, Marketing and Commercial Neil, this is Brian. I'll start by saying that WCS started weakening with PADD 2 unplanned maintenance. WCS was forced into the Gulf Coast and then forced to compete with SPR barrels. We've released about 180 million barrels of SPR crude. Most of that has been sour so we competed with WCS. High sulfur fuel oil has also been weak, and it competes as well, given weaker bunker demand and the end of summer utility burn. And also, generally, the WCS is purchased by Asia and India, and they were out buying euros, Russian crude so they weren't buying as much. And finally, WCS has a high naphtha cut, and that naphtha has been very, very weak because of the Chemicals business. So that was also caused some pressure. So currently, WCS is at about $30 differential. Q4, if you look at the forward curve is at $26 off and next year is about $23 off. So we assume that it will continue to be weak, and the market players also feel the same way.

Neil Mehta --

 Goldman Sachs -- Analyst OK. Thanks, guys.OperatorThank you. Next question is from Roger Read at Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Roger Read --

 Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst Yeah. Thank you. Good morning. I guess I'd like to maybe take a shot here at the Chemicals side of things. So obviously, kind of the softer results and coming off what was an impressive sort of '21, early '22 run. You mentioned FID for the Gulf Coast and then also the Ras Laffan opportunity. Does the weakness in Chemicals here at all imperil your timing on decision of FID? Or does it have any impact whatsoever?

Mark Lashier -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Roger. That's a great question. I think that CPChem has a long history of focusing on the long-term fundamentals. And they never tried to time any particular cyclic movements to drive their growth plans. They've always focused on capturing advantaged feedstocks and maintain their global market presence. And that's what they're doing here as well. Frankly, if you look back in history, the projects that have just happened to be countercyclical, where the investments made when there was a downturn, they tend to come online when things are turning back up and that's beneficial to the economics, then it looks like that may be the case here. You can never predict when things will turn around, but it will take about four years to execute each of those projects. And so yes, it will be what does the crystal ball say in that time frame. But we focus on those long-term fundamentals and what we see as kind of a mid-cycle margin for those opportunities.

Roger Read --

 Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst That makes sense. And then my other question on the Marketing business. You had an exceptional Q2 and now in an even more exceptional Q3, any kind of background on what's going on there? And are the fundamentals that created the last two quarters showing any signs of reversing here?

Brian Mandell -- Executive Vice President, Marketing and Commercial Sure, Roger. Brian again. Maybe I'll start by saying that our diverse geographic portfolio with business both here in the U.S. and in Western Europe and our diverse channels of trade, we have unbranded, branded and retail help us when we think about our Marketing business. But Q3, a number of things that we saw that helped the business. In Germany, it was a tax holiday starting in January 1 and ending at the end of August. Also overseas, the refinery down actually helped us and generally helps us. We have alternative supply at MiRO Refinery there in the south of Germany, which helps us particularly in the south of Germany. And our exchange agreement terms also give us a competitive advantage. We had the general falling of spot prices, which helped us. Shortage of Russian distillate in the market as well helped us internationally. And then I would say, conversely, in the U.S., we actually saw margins come off in Q3 from Q2. But overall, we had a very good quarter.

Roger Read --

 Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst OK. Great. Thank you.OperatorThank you. Next question will be from Ryan Todd at Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Ryan Todd --

 Piper Sandler -- Analyst Thanks. Maybe if I could ask one on kind of Atlantic Basin dynamics. European refining, you're exposed to European refining, spent a lot of volatility in recent months there with natural gas prices. The systems have had to adjust and have adjusted a decent amount. Looking forward, you've got a crude import ban that's about to go into effect and then potentially a product import ban early next year. Any thoughts as you look forward to how these dynamics play out both for your asset and the region overall and how this may impact Atlantic Basin balances over the next six months?

Mark Lashier -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yes. This is Mark. I'll comment at a high level then I'll let Rich and Brian follow up. But I think generally, those are constructive for us. I think it could strengthen our position, particularly around distillates and it's going from strength to strength. But I will let Brian and Rich comment on the details.

Brian Mandell -- Executive Vice President, Marketing and Commercial Maybe I'll start with the macro and Rich can talk more about our assets. But clearly, the market around the world is tight, particularly on distillates. In the U.S., we're under 2015 to 2019 ranges by 22% inventories. That was a very, very weak inventories, given that we're starting to go into the winter season. Refineries around the world are making diesel over gasoline currently. So there are a lot of things that may take some of the edge off and alleviate some of the stress on the market. First around the world, we're coming back from turnarounds here in the U.S. and elsewhere. The Chinese have increased their quotas, so you'll see more gasoline and diesel on the market in Asia. The French refinery strikes are coming to an end, so those refineries will be back up. And then we're seeing kind of moderate weather forecast for both the U.S. and for Europe. So why we'd expect the margins to remain strong, and I think the ultimate moderator for those margins will be demand.

Rich Harbison -- Senior Vice President, Refining This is Rich. I really don't have much to add to that other than from a Refining perspective, of course, the natural gas price will drive up our operating expenses. And we will see higher feedstock costs as this market evolves here into the future and these sanctions go into play. So how that all sells out will be interesting.

Ryan Todd --

 Piper Sandler -- Analyst Great. And then this may step into what you plan on talking about next week, but regarding the buy-in of the remainder of DCP, I don't know if you have any comment on potential timing for closure deal there. But beyond that, maybe a reminder of how you're thinking about the incremental benefits of the kind of the consolidated position there, either from a financial free cash flow point of view or operational synergies that come along with closure of that deal? And how that may impact your ability to buy back stock in the near term and the longer term?

Mark Lashier -- President and Chief Executive Officer At a high level, Ryan, the process is underway. We are negotiating with independent directors that represent the unitholders. And I will just say that we need to let that process play out. It's better to get the right number than to get a quick number. And as far as the strategic dynamics, Tim can talk more about that, but it really is about driving this wellhead to market strategy that we really believe will create a lot of long-term value and opportunity for Phillips 66. Tim, do you want to comment on that?

Tim Roberts -- Executive Vice President, Midstream Yes, I think that's right. Mark, thanks. Exactly right. I think there's a couple of things and I want to make a point is that we do believe in integration, no different than what we see in our integration on our Refining, Marketing, Commercial business, and Midstream. We see the same thing in the NGL, natural gas space. So this allows us to set up that framework to do that, especially in key basins, namely the Permian and DJ. So we really like that, but I think it's probably also worth commenting on that, yes, we want to get the buy-in done and get that behind us and really capture that full value. Really the important part for us, and we've already started the integration, so we are starting the integration, and we are pushing down the road as well to identify what the opportunities are going to be that really are going to position this both from a cost standpoint as well as the ability to compete and create more value. As soon as we get the buy-in done, we can talk a lot more about what that potential is going to be.

Ryan Todd --

 Piper Sandler -- Analyst Thank you.OperatorThank you. Next question will be from John Royall at J. P. Morgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

John Royall --

 JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So on the buyback, I think we'll probably have to wait until post DCP to have a real kind of go-forward framework. But for now, you did have a pretty big number in 3Q that I think surprised some people. And so can you talk about the short-term kind of push-pull between the buyback and then maybe conserving cash for the upcoming deal with DCP and how you think about that?

Mark Lashier -- President and Chief Executive Officer At a high level, John, we are committed to buybacks. We had to hold back in the second quarter due to a blackout period. And so that kind of held us back for a bit. But what you saw last quarter is just a signal that we are serious about buybacks. And I'll let Kevin talk about the balance between what it will require to execute the roll-up of DCP versus share repurchases. But we have got a solid plan. And like a broken record, I'll say you'll hear more about it at investor day.

Kevin Mitchell -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yes, John. So in terms of the DCP roll-up, our expectation is that will be a combination of debt issuance and cash on hand we'll use to fund that. And to my earlier comments, I feel pretty confident that with where the balance sheet sits with the cash position we have, with the cash generation we have, we'll be able to manage that in terms of, yes, we will want to subsequently reduce debt. But with the overall cash position, we should be in a position to continue to return significant amounts of cash to shareholders. So I'm not too concerned that the DCP transaction is going to negatively impact our ability to buy back shares.

John Royall --

 JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst OK. Thank you. And then apologies to repeat a prior question, but I was just thinking through your commentary on the strength in Central Corridor. And correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm not sure if the things you guys talked about necessarily address the Other bar, flipping from negative eight to positive 450 going from 2Q to 3Q. So apologies if I missed this, but if you could go through the dynamics in that Other bar specifically, that would be really helpful.

Tim Roberts -- Executive Vice President, Midstream OK. Let's see. In the Other bar in the Atlantic or in the Central Coast area, we're really looking at some RIN costs in there and some inventory timing issues are the two primary drivers of that, that bar there, John.

John Royall --

 JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst OK. Thank you.OperatorThank you. Next question will be from Matthew Blair at TPH. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Matt Blair -- Tudor, Pickering,

 Holt and Company -- Analyst Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Your Chems results came down, but they really outperformed peers in the third quarter. Is this just as simple as you don't have Europe exposure and pretty much all your peers do? Was there anything else that we should look at? And I guess what's your outlook for Q4?

Mark Lashier -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yes. Thanks, Matt. That's a great question. We've talked to the folks at CPChem about that. I think part of it is that lack of European capacity though. Though we do, the Middle East assets do supply a lot of volume into Europe, but they continue to perform well. The interesting thing is others have had to cut back production in North America, CPChem continued strong production. They had some unplanned outage, but no intentional cutbacks. And I think that reflects their cost position. They didn't have to cut back to contain inventory. They didn't have to cut back due to economics. They ran strong and were profitable. And part of that is they're heavy into high-density polyethylene and the dynamics there are a little different than linear low-density polyethylene. And those that were cutting back were more exposed to that segment of the market. So I think while no one's having any fun in that environment right now, they are positioned to be a little more productive during this difficult time. And then as far as the fourth quarter, fourth quarter is typically soft, and we continue to see this new capacity that's coming online being digested. Margins have gone down. Marker margins have gone down to just about the breakpoint. So I think as you see people that have cut back, as you see them signaling to the market that they need prices to go up and polyethylene to continue to provide what is needed in the marketplace, it's sounding feeling like it's kind of hit bottom. We'll probably see it hit bottom in the fourth quarter and then slowly recover. It will take a couple more quarters to see a lot of movement upward, but I think you're seeing those signs of bottoming out.

Matt Blair -- Tudor, Pickering,

 Holt and Company -- Analyst Sounds good. And then could you talk about octane spreads? They have been really quite strong recently. Is this just a function of Tier 3 impacts rolling through the market? And could you also remind me on what Phillips' exposure to premium gasoline is?

Brian Mandell -- Executive Vice President, Marketing and Commercial Yes. Generally, when you have weak naphtha, Matt, you have high or large octane spreads, and naphtha's been very, very weak. So gasoline blenders need the octane to blend into the gasoline to make finished grade. And I would say that like most marketers, we're about 11% or 12% on our premium in our Marketing business.

Matt Blair -- Tudor, Pickering,

 Holt and Company -- Analyst Great. Thank you.OperatorThank you. Next question will be from Paul Cheng at Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Paul Cheng --

 Scotiabank -- Analyst Hi. Good morning. Two questions, please. First, with the latest news from Biden talking about the oil industry with the windfall profit tax, just wondering that your people in D.C., when they talk to the senator, what's your guess is whether there will be sufficient vote in the Senate for them that to pass that, if the President does propose one? The second question is that I want to see what is your RD strategy, renewable diesel strategy beyond the retail conversion that you're currently doing? I mean, the first phase will come onstream soon and then full completion probably in 2024. And so that I want to see that beyond that, if that is going to be one-off or let's say, more maybe that strategy going forward on that?

Mark Lashier -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yes. Thanks, Paul. This is Mark. Your first question, we've been, along with the rest of our peers in the industry, engaged with the Biden administration around the challenges that they see in the marketplace. And it's earnings season, a lot of integrated oils are coming out with very, very solid results. And I think that's the target of the President's latest comments. Our view is when we get off of the public rhetoric and engage with them to address the issues of inventories and supply and cost and price, it's been constructive. And they know that they have to proceed with caution because things that they try to do could disrupt the markets even more. And they are listening, and they are taking into account the advice that we've been giving them along with our peers. You have to remember that there's an election next week, and I think that there's going to be a lot of rhetoric right up to that point in time.OperatorThank you. Next question will be...

Mark Lashier -- President and Chief Executive Officer I'm sorry, Paul. I was so focused on that first question, I forgot to answer your second question, Paul. Renewable diesel strategy. Yes. Obviously, the first step is the successful execution and commissioning of the Rodeo Renewed project. We put our toe in the water there with a small unit at the San Francisco refinery. We call it Unit 250. That's been quite successful in the marketplace. We are involved in aggregating feedstocks, both in preparation for Rodeo as well as our Humber facility. We're producing renewable fuels there, including sustainable aviation fuel. Rodeo will provide some sustainable aviation fuel as well. And so we kind of look at that business as renewable fuels, not just renewable diesel. And we're taking a hard look at options around sustainable aviation fuel. Certainly, the RA Act was supportive of SAF. And we've got some thoughts there that we're looking at. Bottom line is whatever we do, we're going to be incredibly disciplined, and we've got to ensure that we've got a competitive advantage when we go off in these directions, that we've got line of sight on feedstocks and that we've got the right capital cost when we execute these projects. So that's the primary focus, not just getting bigger but being better in every one of those things that we do.OperatorThank you, sir. Our last question is from Jason Gabelman at Cowen. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Jason Gabelman --

 Cowen and Company -- Analyst Hey. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to ask on the cash flow since you didn't provide some of the detail that you typically do on the cash flow walk. Can you just discuss some of the items that impacted your cash from operations, working capital and otherwise that could have impacted cash conversion? And then secondly,

 there were some -- and this maybe front-running something that you may discuss next week. But there were some reports about reducing headcount and optimizing the workforce. Can you just discuss any plans that you have around doing that and improvement in cost as a result?

Mark Lashier -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yes. Kevin will touch on the cash flow detail. I'll talk about those reports on headcount.

Kevin Mitchell -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yes, Jason. In terms of operating cash flow,

 that detail will be available next week at the time -- early next week when we file the 10-Q. But what I would say, I know there's a lot of interest in working capital and we're still finalizing that level of detail. But what I would say is, based on everything we've seen to date, we don't think that working capital was a very significant component of operating cash flow. So there'll be a working capital impact, but it will be pretty minor relative to some of the other numbers that you have seen out there. And I'll just leave it at that.

Mark Lashier -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yes. Jason, on the headcount issue, yes, we've been focused on our business transformation for well over a year now, and this is a facet of that work, and we've been executing that portion of the work. It's material. We will provide more details next week at investor day. I think though it's a clear signal of our commitment to lower our cost, to eliminate unnecessary work, to have an optimal organization to go forward in what is an ever-changing volatile environment that we did execution reduction in force during the best two quarters in our history.

Jason Gabelman --

 Cowen and Company -- Analyst Great. Thanks.OperatorThank you. This does conclude today'

s conference -- sorry, question-and-answer session. At this time, I will turn the call back over to Jeff.

Pfizer (PFE 3.14%)Q3 2022 Earnings CallNov 01, 2022, 10:00 a.m. ETContents:  Prepared Remarks Questions and Answers Call Participants  Prepared Remarks:  OperatorGood day, everyone, and welcome to Pfizer's third quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Chris Stevo, senior vice president and chief investor relations officer. Please go ahead, sir.

Chris Stevo -- Senior Vice President and Chief Investor Relations Officer



 Good morning. Welcome to Pfizer's third-quarter earnings call. We anticipate that this call will last 60 minutes. I'm joined today by Dr. Albert Bourla, our chairman and CEO; Dave Denton, our CFO; and Dr. Mikael Dolsten, president of worldwide research and development and medical. Joining for the Q&A session, we will also have Angela Hwang, chief commercial officer and president, global biopharmaceuticals business; Aamir Malik, our chief business innovation officer; Dr. William Pao, our chief development officer; and Doug Lankler, our general counsel.Before we begin the call, I'm also happy to announce that we will host an Analyst Day in New York City on the afternoon of December 12. Members of our executive team and other leaders of Pfizer will share information on our rich slate of potential near-term product launches and the R&D readouts which will drive the next wave of product launches after that, both of which will support our 2030 revenues and beyond. In-person attendance will be by invitation, but we will also be webcasting the event. While we're not going to talk more about the agenda today, we look forward to providing more details as we get closer to December 12. Materials for this call and other earnings-related materials are on the Investor Relations section of pfizer.com. Please see our forward-looking statements disclaimer on Slide 4. And additional information regarding these statements and our non-GAAP financial measures is available in our earnings release and in our SEC forms 10-K and 10-Q under Risk Factors and Forward-looking Information and Factors That May Affect Future Results. Forward-looking statements on the call are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties, speak only as of the call's original date, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any of these statements.



 With that, I will turn the call over to Albert.

 Albert Bourla -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Chris. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I will briefly touch on some recent highlights. I will then spend the bulk of my time speaking to our expectations for what we feel will be a promising and prosperous future for Pfizer and the patients we serve. In addition to generating a stellar financial performance, since our last earnings call, we reported positive pivotal data for several exciting pipeline programs, including our RSV vaccine candidate for older adults, Prevnar 20 for children, the potential combination of treatment of Talzenna and Xtandi in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, our pentavalent meningococcal vaccine candidate for adolescents and young adults as well as exciting progress for our GLP-1 program in type 2 diabetes and obesity. Just this morning, we announced positive top-line data from the Phase 3 clinical trial investigating our bivalent RSV vaccine candidate when administered to pregnant participants to help protect their infants from RSV disease after birth. We established a new commercial structure within our global biopharmaceutical business that is focused on three broad therapeutic areas: primary care, specialty care, and oncology. We believe this new structure will enable us to maximize the commercial success of the multiple exciting product launches, including several potential blockbusters that are poised to emerge from our scientific pipeline over the next few years.



 We have continued to advance potentially game-changing vaccines in the fight against respiratory disease by entering into a Phase 3 study for our mRNA flu vaccine candidate and initiating a Phase 1 study for a vaccine candidate that combines our mRNA flu and COVID-19 vaccine in one sort. We completed the acquisitions of Biohaven Pharmaceuticals and Global Blood Therapeutics, giving us market-leading franchises in both migraine and sickle cell disease, respectively. Less than six months ago after launching in Accor for a healthier world, a breakthrough initiative designed to close the health equity gap for 1.2 billion people living in 45 lower-income countries, I'm proud to say that the first shipments of our products have arrived to these countries, and we are working with governments on health system improvements that can help make sure these products reach those in need. And of course, we continue to lead the fight against COVID-19. Most notably, our omicron-adapted bivalent COVID-19 vaccine has been authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, by the European Medicines Agency and several other regulatory bodies. And as part of Pfizer's commitment to providing equitable access to COVID-19 oral treatments, we agreed to supply at the non-for-profit price up to 6 million Paxlovid treatment courses to the Global Fund for low and lower middle income countries. An exciting quarter for sure, but in our company and our industry, it's all about what's next. The next breakthrough medicine or vaccine, the next game-ending technology, the next solution to an unmet patient. This continued pursuit of what's next is embedded in Pfizer's DNA and the foundational driver of our purpose: Breakthroughs that change patients' lives. It's also why we have confidence that Pfizer story is a story of growth. We recognize that some are questioning Pfizer's longer-term growth projects, particularly in the '25 to '30 time frame, but understandable given that we currently expect a negative impact of approximately $70 billion in revenues from losses of exclusivity during that period based on our internal calculations. We believe we not only can overcome these expected declines but also can potentially generate strong growth through the end of the decade. Let's take a closer look on how we expect to accomplish this. Our strong capital position has given us the ability to pursue business development opportunities with the potential, if successful of course, to add at least $25 billion of risk-adjusted revenues to our 2030 top-line expectations. We believe the deals we have already done for Arena, Biohaven, Global Blood Therapeutics, and ReViral has the potential to get us more than one-third of the way there and that we have more than enough capital to invest in the additional opportunities needed to meet or exceed this target. Perhaps even more exciting is the way the potential growth drivers emerging from our R&D pipeline in the near term. Over the next 18 months, we expect to have up to 19 new products or indications in the market, including the five for which we have already begun co-pro promotions or commercialization earlier this year. You can find the list of these launches in the appendix of the presentation we posted today for this earnings call. If successful, these 19 launches, of which more than two-thirds have the potential to be blockbusters, will be the most ever in Pfizer's history. The 15 in-house developed projects alone could potentially represent approximately $20 billion in 2030 sales which would more than offset the expected LOE impact. Many of these programs are already largely derisked from a clinical perspective. The majority of them were discovered in-house and nearly all of them would be for indications outside of COVID-19. If approved, we expect each of these to be key contributors to our growth aspirations through 2025 and beyond. And of course, we have many more potential vaccines and medicines in our pipeline with numerous launches expected in the '24 to '30 time line. These include gene therapy candidates for hemophilia A, B, and Duchenne muscular dystrophy; our oral GLP-1 for diabetes and obesity; a potential combo vaccine that would cover flu and COVID-19 in one shot and many, many more. With regard to our COVID-19 products, while their sales may fall from our expected 2022 levels of approximately combined $55 billion, we believe our COVID-19 franchises will remain multibillion-dollar revenue generators for the foreseeable future which should serve as a buffer for any unforeseen challenges with other products in our portfolio. Our confidence to execute this plan stems from the depth of our financial resources and the firepower it gives us to pursue business development opportunities, the power brand equity we have built up over the past 170 years and further enhanced in the past two years. According to a recent survey, our brand awareness now stands at an impressive 82% and our favorability stands at 61%, compared with 42% for the industry as a whole, results that were obtained just a couple of months ago. And of course, the strength of the three foundational pillars of our company, our world-class scientific, our world-class commercial and our world-class manufacturing engines, and you will see on this slide some highlights of each one of them. Let me now briefly highlight three potential blockbusters that we expect to contribute to our long-term growth. RSV is an area of significant unmet need, particularly in older adults and infants. Each year, it is estimated more than 177,000 older adults are hospitalized and 14,000 of them die in the U.S. alone due to RSV. That is fulfilled by a diagnostic test. We believe we have the potential to be a leader in this space and have a real impact on public health. On March 24 of this year, the FDA granted breakthrough designation for our RSV vaccine candidate for the prevention of lower respiratory tract disease caused by RSV in individuals 60 years of age or older. We are excited to report positive top-line data from the Phase 3 Renoir trial in late August, with the recent presentation of detailed results at ID week 22. A pre-planned interim analysis showed vaccine efficacy of 67% against RSV-associated lower respiratory tract illness, defined by two or more symptoms. And vaccine efficacy of 85.7% was observed in participants with more severe disease, presenting three or more RSV-associated symptoms of lower respiratory tract illness. We are also excited about the potential for our maternal RSV vaccine candidate. Globally, each year, RSV [Inaudible] more than 6.5 million infants under six months old and kills approximately 45,000. As announced this morning, our maternal RSV study met the success criterion for one of the two primary endpoints. Vaccine efficacy of 81.8% was observed against severe medically attended lower respiratory tract illness due to RSV in infant's birth through the first 90 days of life. And high efficacy of 69.4% was demonstrated through the first six months of life. So there is the potential that, subject to regulatory approval, by late 2023, early 2024, we could have the only RSV maternal vaccine in the market, along with an RSV vaccine for older adults, that has high efficacy, and it is well tolerated with no safety concerns. Combined, the two indications represent a potential multibillion-dollar peak revenue opportunity if approved, especially with our high-respected primary care sales force executing these launches. Including the RSV antiviral investigational candidates we acquired with ReViral, we aim to have end-to-end solutions with both preventative vaccines and therapeutics to treat those infected with RSV. Ulcerative colitis or UC is a chronic and often debilitating inflammatory bowel disease that affects an estimated 1 million people in the U.S. alone. Many patients living with this disease never achieve or maintain remission, and physicians are seeking effective, proven oral therapies with a favorable benefit-risk profile that can be an attractive first-line advanced therapy option. As a result, we expect the market opportunity to grow by about 50% over the next five years. The positive Phase 3 data from the Elevate UC 12 and 52 trials reinforce our belief that etrasimod has a differentiated clinical profile and can be an important treatment option if approved. We believe that etrasimod can be a multibillion-dollar blockbuster product. We expect to launch the product in the U.S. as soon as the second half of 2023, pending regulatory approval, through our specialty care sales force, which already has strong relationships in the UC market, thanks to its work with Xeljanz biosimilar specifically. Lastly, let's look at migraine. Following our acquisition of Biohaven in early October, we are now aiming to build the world's leading global migraine franchise with the potential to impact 1 billion patients around the world. Migraine is a debilitating disease and has 11.6% prevalence worldwide. In the U.S. alone, there are 40 million patients with migraine, and one out of five women are migraine sufferers right now. The economic burden is significant at $36 billion per year. We believe our portfolio, including Nurtec ODT, Vydura, and zavegepant could meet the range of needs in the market, allowing physicians and patients to decide how to appropriately monitor migraine treatment and prevention. As a result, we see the potential to reach more than $6 billion in peak revenue altogether. In the U.S., Nurtec is growing very well, including the impact of Pfizer's co-promoting, which began in August pre-close. Nurtec has further strengthened its No. 1 market share position in the oral CGRP market, and we expect even stronger growth as we deliver on our promise to further enhance our commercial efforts behind this program. Outside the U.S., it has been approved in the EU, U.K., Israel, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates and we have filed for registration in an additional 10 markets. While this is not a new product launch, we believe this is a great example of how we can take this portfolio to new heights by leveraging the full strength of Pfizer's global commercial engine, including in primary care physicians. Moving over to zavegepant. We recently expect to launch zavegepant intranasal in the U.S. next year, pending FDA approval, and we plan to globally commercialize. Lastly, the oral prevention Phase 3 trial is ongoing with a data readout that is expected in the third quarter. So with that, I turn it over to Dave to update you on the results and outlook for the financials. After Dave, Mikael will speak about the progression of our pipeline.

Dave Denton -- Chief Financial Officer Thank you, Albert, and good morning. I'll begin this morning with a few comments regarding how the company continues to deploy capital in a disciplined manner in support of long-term growth and, importantly, enhanced shareholder returns. As you know, Pfizer's cash generation capabilities has expanded significantly over the past several years and the efficient deployment of this capital is more critical than ever. During the first nine months of 2020, the company has deployed and committed capital in three main areas: First, we've invested $7.8 billion in internal R&D as we continue to support our growing pipeline of innovative medicines. These investments are squarely focused on driving revenue growth through 2030. Secondly, in the first three quarters of this year, we have invested approximately $8 billion in completed business transactions. Additionally, early in the fourth quarter, the company completed investments for more than $18 billion in transactions, including both Biohaven and GBT, which brings us to approximately $26 billion in capital deployed for business development transactions thus far in 2022 alone. These transactions illustrate our progress toward the goal of adding $25 billion in risk-adjusted 2030 revenues through BD. And finally, we have returned nearly $9 billion of capital to shareholders through a combination of both dividends and value-enhancing share repurchases. Clearly, maximizing shareholder value through prudent capital allocation will continue to be a major focus for Pfizer. So with that, let me briefly review our financial results for the quarter. I'll limit my remarks largely to adjusted and operating growth figures. Third-quarter revenues demonstrated strength across many areas of the business, but much of that strength was somewhat obscured by our incredibly strong performance in the third quarter of 2021. Given the strength in the prior year, revenues this quarter decreased 2% operationally. However, looking at it on a two-year basis, revenues this quarter were up more than 120% compared to the third quarter of 2020. The slight decrease compared to last year was in line with our expectations given the phasing of scheduled deliveries of Comirnaty, which we discussed in our earnings call last quarter. Also underlying our results this quarter was the strong performance of Paxlovid as well as continued strength from a number of our other key products. Excluding direct sales and alliance revenues related to the COVID products, Pfizer's revenues grew 2% operationally in the quarter. Gross margins expanded by 1,450 basis points versus the third quarter of LY. This improvement is largely due to increased sales of higher-margin Paxlovid and decreased sales of lower gross margin Comirnaty compared to last year. These improvements were partially offset by the impact of a $400 million charge related to excess raw materials for Paxlovid. Given the unpredictable nature of the virus, we intentionally chose to order additional stock to ensure we can meet any global health demand if an extreme need were to arise. Adjusted SI&A expenses in the third quarter grew 23% operationally. The increase was primarily driven by spending for Paxlovid and Comirnaty and higher healthcare reform fees. The 2% operational increase in adjusted R&D expense in Q3 was primarily driven by increased costs to develop recently acquired assets as well as investments for certain oncology and non-COVID-19 vaccines programs. This was partially offset by lower spending on programs to prevent and treat COVID-19 and various late-stage clinical programs. The effective tax rate on adjusted income in the quarter was 4.4%, significantly lower than typical, driven by tax benefits related to global income tax resolutions in multiple tax jurisdictions spanning several tax years. Excluding these tax resolutions, the underlying tax rate was consistent with historical trends. As a result, reported diluted earnings per share of $1.51 grew by 6%, while adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.78 grew 44% on an operational basis for the quarter. Now foreign exchange movements continue to dampen our results, negatively impacting revenues by approximately $950 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share by $0.05 this quarter. Now let me move to our updated 2022 guidance. Given our strong third-quarter performance and our improving outlook for the year, we are increasing our operational expectations for revenues by $1.7 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share by $0.19. This operational increase on the bottom line would have been even higher if not for an incremental $0.06 negative impact due to higher acquired IPR&D expenses. Partially offsetting these operational increases is the impact of additional strengthening of the U.S. dollar since the last updated guidance in late July. Incremental foreign exchange movements negatively impacted our expectations for 2022 revenues and adjusted diluted earnings per share by $700 million and $0.09, respectively. The net impact of these cross-currents result in increases to the midpoint of our revenue and adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance ranges. These revised ranges reflect operational growth rates of 31% for revenues and 70% for adjusted diluted earnings per share at the midpoint compared to 2021. And this was up from our previous operational growth expectations for revenues and adjusted diluted earnings per share of 29% and 65%, respectively. Regarding our COVID-19-related revenues, we now expect the vaccine revenue for the year to be approximately $34 billion, up by $2 billion compared to our prior guidance. For Paxlovid, we expect sales of approximately $22 billion, keeping the guidance range unchanged despite the negative incremental impact of changes in FX. You can see on this slide our updated costs and expense guidance which incorporates our performance to date, our recent acquisitions and our updated expectations for the remainder of the year. More information on each of these updates can be found in this morning's press release. 2022 guidance once again assumes no incremental share repurchases beyond the $2 billion of share repurchases we completed in March of 2022. In closing, it's an exciting time in the history of Pfizer. We believe that our strong financial performance in the quarter and our improving operational outlook for the year sets the stage for long-term shareholder value creation. With that, I'll now turn it over to Mikael.

Mikael Dolsten -- President of Worldwide Research and Development and Medical Thank you, Dave. Today, I will focus attention on high-value programs that will potentially deliver breakthroughs in areas of high unmet need and are expected to be key contributors to our growth aspiration through 2025 and beyond. With anchor products such as Comirnaty, Paxlovid, Ibrance, and Xtandi we are building out comprehensive franchises in several areas, including respiratory, metabolic disorders, genetic hematology and certain cancers. We have deep expertise in these areas, and there is exciting science emerging. I will share updates from three of these today, respiratory, metabolic and prostate cancer. Building on our success with Comirnaty and Paxlovid, we see enormous potential to help address major courses of respiratory disease through vaccines and therapeutics. Work on the next-generation vaccine candidates are well underway. And last week, we started a Phase 1 clinical trial of our second-generation oral therapeutic candidate. Our quadrivalent modRNA flu program has progressed into Phase 3, and we will start shortly A Phase 1 study of an mRNA-based vaccine candidate that combines our quadrivalent modRNA vaccine candidate with the omicron-adapted bivalent COVID-19 vaccine based on BA.4/BA.5. In RSV, we believe a dual focus on developing a vaccine and antivirals could make a significant impact globally. I will share new data with you shortly. Paxlovid continues to be important in helping to combat the impact of COVID-19. And secondary endpoints from the EPIC high-risk study as well as data from real-world evidence support the product's efficacy profile. In the EPIC HR study, Paxlovid reduced COVID-19-related death and ICU admissions by 100% and COVID-19-related hospitalization by 86% in unvaccinated, high-risk patients compared to placebo. It also reduced the duration of COVID-19 symptoms by two to three days compared to placebo. We are pleased to see Paxlovid leading the COVID-19 treatment landscape and remain confident in its safety and efficacy in treating patients and high risk for severe outcomes. We recently reported a positive interim analysis from our Phase 3 study in older adults of our novel RSV vaccine candidate which targets the pre-fusion F protein, on both RSV A and B, without need for an adjuvant. We saw a remarkable vaccine efficacy across the first RSV season. The vaccine was extremely well tolerated with favorable systemic tolerability, a key consideration for vaccines. We also are developing the RSV pre-F vaccine candidate for use in pregnant women so that protection may be conferred to newborns. And this morning, we announced exciting results from a free planned interim analysis of our Phase 3 trial. We observed vaccine efficacy of nearly 82% against severe medical-attended lower respiratory attractiveness illness or MALRTI due to RSV in infants from birth through the first 90 days of life and efficacy of more than 69% through the first six months of life. Success for them was not met for the second primary endpoint. However, clinical and meaningful efficacy was observed with MALRTI of 57% in infant from birth to 90 days of life and efficacy of 51% over the six months follow-up period. The Data Monitoring Committee indicated the vaccine was well tolerated with no safety concerns for either vaccinated women or their newborns. Given these impressive results, we look forward to filing BLA for both older adults and pregnant women with the U.S. FDA by year end with potential launches in '23. If approved, our maternal vaccine candidate, potentially would be the first available to help prevent its common and potentially life-threatening respiratory illness in young infants. Turning now to prostate cancer. We're building upon the standard of care set by Xtandi in castration-sensitive and castration-resistant population. The Phase 3 Embark study of Xtandi non-metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer is expected to read out first half of '23. And the Phase 3 of Talzenna and Xtandi is expected in '24. These trials may indicate benefit in up to 20% more patients than are currently treated and potentially prolong duration of use, subject to clinical success and regulatory approval. Now in Talapro-2, we observed the first clinical benefit of a PARP inhibitor plus Xtandi in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer with or without homologous recombination repair or HRR gene mutation. Irrespective of HRR gene mutation status, the study achieved its primary endpoint. The combination delivered a significant and clinically meaningful improvement in radiographic progression-free survival and appears to have resulted in the longest observed such survival in a randomized trial in this setting. We are encouraged by these results and believe that Talzenna in prostate cancer marry blockbuster potential, subject to regulatory approval. Turning to metabolic disorders. I previously shared that we are developing two oral GLP-1 receptor agonist, danuglipron and 1532. Recently presented Phase 1b data for 1532 show dose-dependent reduction from baseline at four to six weeks in new daily glucose, fasting plasma glucose, HbA1c, and body weight. Both candidates are potentially best-in-class and differentiated by offering a full agonist which may be required to achieve the same level of response as injectable GLP-1 receptor agonist while offering a convenient once-daily dose for 1532. Glucose effect plateau at lower doses, while body weight effects continue to improve at high dose. The planned Phase 2b study will evaluate 1532 versus both oral semaglutide and placebo in type 2 diabetes and separately versus placebo in obesity. Using semaglutide as a comparator in the type 2 diabetes arm should allow us to observe potential early signs of differentiation in efficacy tolerability and safety. We will evaluate doses up to 260 milligrams in this study, higher than the studies in the Phase 1b. We plan to begin dosing soon and anticipate the readout in first quarter 2024. The ongoing Phase 2b study of danuglipron in obesity with now once-monthly titration is expected to complete second half of 2023. Data from these studies will be available in relatively quick succession and, assuming clinical success, allow us to select one based on efficacy, tolerability and dosing to advance to Phase 3 in both type 2 diabetes and obesity. In closing, we are excited about the developing science within these franchisees and share recent and anticipated milestones in the next 18 months. We look forward to continue our development but for potential patient benefit and sustainable growth. Thank you. Let me turn over to Chris to start Q&A.

Chris Stevo -- Senior Vice President and Chief Investor Relations Officer Thanks, Mikael. With that, let's start the Q&A session. We have about 30 minutes for this session. We will answer as many questions as time permits. And Investor Relations will be available after the call to answer any follow-up questions. Chelsea, please go ahead and queue up the first question. Questions & Answers: Operator[Operator instructions] Our first question will come from Umer Raffat with Evercore ISI.

Chris Stevo -- Senior Vice President and Chief Investor Relations Officer Umer, are you there?OperatorUmer, your line is open, please make sure you are not muted. We'll go to our next question. Colin Bristow with UBS.

Colin Bristow --

 UBS -- Analyst On COVID expectations, should we expect anything from you here on the December 12 Investor event? And then just more broadly around this, how are you thinking conceptually about guiding to this? Will it be similar to last year? Are you thinking of more sort of scenario-based guiding? Anything that would be helpful. And then just a sort of temperature check on business development, if you could update us on your priorities and interests. And then from a deal perspective, just how big would you be willing to go?

Albert Bourla -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thank you. On December 12, what you should expect, it is a good overview of our very important new product launches in the coming 18 months, with more details about the science and the market potential of those launches as well as some of the most important pipeline potential, new medicines and vaccines, that they are not going to be launched in the next 18 months but will be launched in the period between '24 and '30. Now for the BD priorities, I would ask Aamir to reiterate once more our strategy when it comes to BD.

Aamir Malik -- Chief Business and Innovation Officer Thanks for the question, Colin. The BD priorities remain consistent with what we've articulated before. And principally, we are most excited about scientific substrate that has the potential for patient breakthroughs. That's going to continue to be our north star. We're looking for deals that accelerate our top-line growth in the back half of the decade. And importantly, we're focused on opportunities where we can add substantial value, and that can come in the form of either shaping the science or also accelerate in our commercial momentum. And if you look at the deals that we announced and closed in 2022 including Arena, Biohaven, Array, GBT, they would all be very consistent with those priorities. We've said that we are agnostic to size of transaction. But you've also heard us be very clear about the fact that cost synergy-driven deals is not where our focus is going to be. We're going to be focused on driving growth through our BD.

Albert Bourla -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Aamir. And also, Dave, maybe you can also address the question about guidance on COVID and are we going to provide it and when for '23, etc.

Dave Denton -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. Thank you, Albert. Maybe let me discuss the stage as it relates to COVID and the COVID franchise. I think if you look out longer term, the franchise is going to be a multibillion-dollar franchise in the respect that this is going to be somewhat like a flu, sustained flu, but actually more deadly than the flu. So, therefore, I think the products, both from a vaccine and the therapy perspective that Pfizer has developed, they're going to be quite relevant for many years to come. Having said that, when we provide guidance for 2023, when it's appropriate to do so, we will give investors a perspective on what our expectations are for the year. We will break out that guidance specifically so you can hold us accountable for delivering on those revenue promises when the time comes.OperatorNext, we have Louise Chen with Cantor.

Louise Chen --

 Cantor Fitzgerald -- Analyst So I wanted to ask you, first off,

 how you think about -- or maybe more color on how you think about the pushes and pulls in 2023. There's a lot of moving parts there. And then secondly, on your RSV franchise, there seems to be several players with drugs in development and they've all reported out positive data. So curious how you think about this market playing out over time?

Albert Bourla -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yes. Let me say a few words about the push and pull, then I will ask Angela to complement and speak about how we see the RSV market. Clearly, '23 is a very, very important year for us given the unprecedented number of new launches that we are going to have in the next 18 months. And most of them will happen in '23 and some beginning of the first quarter of '24. But we are launching products, not only a very big number of them, but only the internal ones, $20 billion, excluding the BD, Biohaven, and the Global Blood $20 billion of peak sales were expected, 2030 sales we are expecting from launches. So it's a very, very big number. And it's very important for us to do it well. So clearly that will bring our non-COVID business will be a significant boost for our non-COVID business. Now when we move to COVID, we expect '23 will be a transition year with likely in the U.S. moving from government model into a commercial model for vaccines and therapeutics. The timing is not certain. So we are ready to do either side, but will be phased over the years. And it likely will not be the same for Paxlovid or Comirnaty. And clearly also, there will be some stuff that will have to be depleted in '23. And clearly, there will be new price dynamics as we are moving to '23. So probably will be a little bit more of a transitional year in '23 until it will be established into more like flu volumes type of market, but of course, with different price points and different severity of the disease, that will bring both therapeutics and vaccines into a multibillion-dollar franchise, but we are not going to predict now what will be the number for the years out, but we will try to be as accurate as possible for our '23 numbers when we will provide guidance. Now under anything to add on the push and pulls, you are carrying a lot of the weight for the new launches and also speak about one of them, which is going to be the RSV maternal and adult.

Angela Hwang -- President, Pfizer Biopharmaceuticals Well, we're extremely excited about both the adult vaccine as well as the maternal vaccine. First and foremost, because it is in the sweet spot of what Pfizer does, respiratory vaccines, right? We have a lot of experience of this created through the legacy of our pneumococcal franchise and the strength we have there, but also recently from Comirnaty. I'll also add that Pfizer is the only company that has both the adult vaccine as well as the maternal vaccine. And it really does fit so extremely well into our existing commercial footprint. These are large populations, both the adult as well as maternal. Let me just start with adult and just sort of characterize that a bit. There Arena 61 million 65-year-olds, all of whom are eligible for the vaccination. It'

s actually a -- it's quite a devastating disease. The hospital costs from RSV for adults is over $1.2 billion. It is also underreported and underdiagnosed. And so we have a really great opportunity here to drive awareness of this disease, but also to use the commercial footprint that we already have to create awareness, to create education, and to bring this vaccine to those who need it. Equally, in the maternal space, a devastating disease. Most of the mortality and the morbidity is in infants that are under six months old and those that are preterm. And actually, over 102,000 deaths worldwide are resulting from instantiations of RSV. So again, we see a tremendous opportunity to make a difference here. As you know, through the work that we've done on Prevnar, we have a tremendous legacy in pediatric vaccines. And so that, coupled with our strength in women's health, and the commercial footprint we have there as well, is going to be perfectly suited for us to launch the maternal RSV vaccine. And so bringing all of this together, I think that we have the scientific knowledge, we have the technology, we have the relationships with the vaccinators and the sites of vaccinations. We are also very well versed in our work with the vaccine technical committees around the world, in bringing together a broad recommendation, which we believe is what's going to give us access to many, many infants as well as adults to these two tremendous breakthroughs. So I think we have the best-in-class capabilities to do a great job with this respiratory portfolio.

Albert Bourla -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Very well, Angela, and I agree with you.OperatorNext, we have Steve Scala with Cowen.

Steve Scala --

 Cowen and Company -- Analyst I have three questions, but they're all short. First, what impact on RSV-associated infant hospitalizations did Pfizer see in the Phase 3 Matisse trial? Second, can you tell us what Nurtec sales were in Q3? I know you didn't own Biohaven in Q3, but you likely know the number. And then lastly, all things considered, is it unrealistic to think that Comirnaty plus Paxlovid sales could be as much as $15 billion in 2030?

Albert Bourla -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thank you very much. Mikael, what about the RSV data?

Mikael Dolsten -- President of Worldwide Research and Development and Medical Thank you for the question. So as you have seen in our press release, we reported out very impressive data and two separate primary endpoints that were independent, it is sufficient to hit one for filing. And to our privilege and encouragement, we hit strongly on the most important. And that was defined as severe, medically attended lower tract respiratory infection, where we had close to 82% vaccine efficacy. That is defined by clinical features, such as the rate and the stress of respiration, oxygenation levels, etc., in the children and will include patients, whether they are hospitalized or not. We will later release data on secondary endpoints that include hospitalization. When you look at this dramatic effect on the severe infections, it seems very reasonable to project that we will have a dramatic impact in lowering hospitalization. I'm probably talking about tens of thousands of hospitalizations in the U.S. that may not happen if this vaccine is used to vaccinate maternal prior to delivering the children as appropriately studied in this vaccination. So we're very encouraged and optimistic about that type of value.

Albert Bourla -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Mikael. Before I turn to Dave to answer the question about the sales of Nurtec in the third quarter, let me make a comment on Comirnaty and Paxlovid and the franchise. Clearly, we said they will provide us a good picture of what we expect to be the sales for next year. Now you're asking about year 2030, which is even more challenging. But also, the way you are asking the question,

 is it unthinkable -- is it unreasonable to think that we could have a $15 billion franchise? Well, taken that it is 55 right now, it's not unreasonable to think that in year 2030 could be that. But it's not clear that it will be done. So that will depend on the virus and how it saves. Will depend on if it will become a standard practice to vaccinate together with flu. If we will have a combination product, clearly, that will enhance this direction. So I think it's a little bit too early, but no, it's not unreasonable to think given where we are right now. Now, what about Nurtec sales?

Dave Denton -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. Steve, this is Dave. As you said, we didn't own the business last quarter, but maybe just a little bit of color on how the product is performing. If you look at the volume last year, or last quarter, rather, Q3, if you compare it to last year, it was about a 45% growth rate in year-over-year script volume. And then if you look at it sequentially, which I think is really important, we saw about a 16% growth rate sequentially Q2 going into Q3. So I think this shows the promise of this product, number one. And number two, I think once we get it, now that we have it in the hands of our field force, and into our primary care force, we can really maximize the value of this needed medicine into the patient population here in the U.S. and abroad.OperatorOur next question will come from Robyn Karnauskas with Truist Securities.

Robyn Karnauskas --

 Truist Securities -- Analyst Great. On Paxlovid,

 I was just -- I'm sure you saw the recent publication citing how many people have died from not even getting an antiviral. Can you talk a little bit about the efforts you're making to educate physicians to give the drug. And do you think we'll ever get to a point where people will be more comfortable, doctors will be more comfortable taking it, given all the news around the Paxlovid rebound? And second question, can you talk a little bit about the opportunity for vitiligo in alopecia in your pipeline? And when should we hear the next readout?

Albert Bourla -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thank you very much. Both questions, I think, can be answered very nicely by Angela.

Angela Hwang -- President, Pfizer Biopharmaceuticals Well, thank you for the question. So let's talk a little bit about Paxlovid and how that's been going. I mean, first and foremost, we are under an EUA, so that means that we are working hand-in-hand with the U.S. government to ensure that we are providing the education to the public. The U.S. government and the state government, I think, have created a tremendous amount of education already using public service announcements and public campaigns. And equally, we have provided education to all the potential prescribers of Paxlovid. So if you think about where we are today, over 500,000 physicians have written Paxlovid. And what you have in addition to that is education that we've provided not only to doctors, but also to pharmacists. We've trained over 80,000 pharmacists in terms of how to write Paxlovid. And so I think the education is really firing off, both at a prescriber level but also at a consumer level where we have worked, again, also closely with state governments and local governments, to ensure that we're providing the right amount of education. I will say that the test-to-treat sites that the government has stood up federally, there's now 27,000 of those around the country, have also been great sources of education for Paxlovid. So I think that it'

s -- frankly, I think it's going well. I think that we're continuing to do more in anticipation of the fall. But the fact that you've had 500,000 physicians write this Paxlovid already is a great indicator of their confidence with this. And the fact that probably the one most important area of education that we need to continue to emphasize is just who are the eligible people for Paxlovid. And actually, if you look at the definition that the CDC provides, there are 22 risk factors for who should be eligible. And they include those who are over 65, right, age-related risks, but equally risks such as mental health illness, risks such as an inactive lifestyle, risks that you may not be aware of. And so I think that that's really where we want to focus now through this fall.

Albert Bourla -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer And what about vitiligo?

Angela Hwang -- President, Pfizer Biopharmaceuticals I think we're really excited about these new indications for ritlecitinib.

 I think probably the main theme here is that there are not effective -- there aren'

t any treatments for these highly -- very serious inflammatory conditions today. So huge unmet need, just a place where there's just no options today. So the fact that we're able to bring a treatment like this to market I think will have tremendous uptake by patients who up to now just are left with no options.

Albert Bourla -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer And, William,

 can you please address a little bit the issue about the Paxlovid rebound that was also --

William Pao -- Executive Vice President, Chief Development Officer Sure, Albert. Well, Mikael already mentioned that we gave updated data from our EPIC-HR study on the effect of Paxlovid versus placebo in patients with high risk for COVID-19. And we had additional end points there which we showed a 100% decrease in ICU admissions, a 100% decrease in mechanical ventilation among hospitalized patients. 100% who got tested at home versus 53% placebo. We also had 82% reduction in oxygen support, 86% of COVID-19-related hospitalization, 89% reduction in need days hospitalized versus 100 patients and also a 73% reduction in only COVID-19-related medical visits. Importantly, we also showed sustained time to symptom alleviation and sustain time to symptom resolution of an impact of two to three days of Paxlovid versus placebo. But most importantly, about rebounds, there's been several studies recently that have shown actually the rebound occurs with COVID in general. For example, there was a recent publication of 158 patients of patients who got placebo with COVID and actually a third of those had recurrent symptoms after the resolution of their symptoms, suggesting that it's a phenomenon associated with COVID and not with Paxlovid. Importantly, we also haven't seen any evidence of resistance that is clinically meaningful. Whereas with antibodies, for example, we have seen that we also can get symptom rebound, but that is associated with resistance. So again, Paxlovid not associated with resistance but the antibodies are. So we feel very confident that Paxlovid has a significant impact in the goal against COVID.OperatorNext, we have Andrew Baum with Citi.

Andrew Baum --

 Citi -- Analyst A couple of questions. Firstly, as it relates to the maternal RSV vaccine. Could you talk about reimbursement coverage in the U.S. I'm assuming you'll get an ACIP recommendation, and therefore there will be zero out of pocket which may differentiate it versus the monoclonal. And I'm sure on a cost basis, that will be material. And then secondly, could you talk to your efforts with your ER degrader with Arvinas in light of the evolving data on SERDs, thinking about Astra's recent positive trial and then the L1 subgroup. Do you believe that this is a function of defining the right patient population at the right stage of the disease rather than the potential risk development of the entire category?

Albert Bourla -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Drew, thank you. In the interest of time, let me give the first answer. Yes, you are right. As long as the product is recommended by CDC, and we believe with this part of efficacy will be recommended, there is zero co-pay. The relevance of the insurance, if it is commercial or if it is public, their obligation is zero co-pay from the payers, and they have to cover it. Mikael, what about the Arvinas molecule?

Mikael Dolsten -- President of Worldwide Research and Development and Medical Yes. Thank you for asking. Clearly, we think that there are two factors that will separate out the good drugs from the less good in this class of degraders. And we think the Protac, which is the mechanistic name of the 471, is more effective in down-regulating the receptor and selecting the right patients compared to standard of care, that includes selecting patients that have gene receptor mutations and need more powerful drugs and is related to the property of the drug itself. We look forward to advance that drug with Arvinas to pivotal studies in the relatively near future and also to soon reveal to you a lot of progress we had in our breast cancer franchise, including the CDK4 drug. And that may be part of what we consider to share in December at the investor update on launches and next wave.

Albert Bourla -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Mikael, another reason to attend this great event.OperatorNext, we have Evan Seigerman with BMO Capital Markets.

Evan Seigerman --

 BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst Congrats on the progress. Two questions for me. On BD, I want to be briefed here. But can you talk about what other therapeutic areas you might want to explore? I know you're in neurology with Biohaven, nonmalignant hematology with GBT and, of course, inflammation. Would you consider adding oncology? And on the same line, kind of, Albert, in some previous comments ahead of this call you had mentioned going alone with some of your mRNA technologies. What applications of mRNA do you see outside of COVID? I mean this personalized cancer vaccine is an area that you would explore.

Albert Bourla -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Maybe I'll pass that to Aamir.

Aamir Malik -- Chief Business and Innovation Officer Sure. I mean, thanks for the question. As far as our therapeutic areas of focus, as I mentioned before in our priorities, our focus is on where we can make a difference and shape the science. And the good news is we actually have distinctive capabilities across many different therapeutic areas. So you've seen us active in internal medicine, anti-infectives, INI, and, certainly, oncology. And our focus is going to be on where we have breakthrough science and the potential to shape it. And we feel very good about the breadth of our scientific capabilities to give us lots of flexibility to work in different BA.

Albert Bourla -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yes, we didn't answer the mRNA and how we think about it, Mikael.

Mikael Dolsten -- President of Worldwide Research and Development and Medical Yes. So I'm excited to share we're broadening that platform. You heard about advance of the mRNA flu vaccine successfully to the next stages. Albert mentioned plans that are going to combine it with COVID vaccine to build more broader respiratory vaccine with improved convenience in single administration, single-patient visits. We are on our way to the Phase 1 study, together with BioNTech, on our shingles vaccine that really aim to deliver the power of the mRNA, but remove what we've seen as a pretty significant issue with recognition of the current adjuvanted vaccine. We're looking at several other mRNA vaccine that we will share in further time, but also that we briefly alluded to, we have made progress in our alliance with Beam to really identify the first type of candidates that will move forward to genetic medicine in some of the important rare diseases. And we're looking at application, certain areas of in vivo cancer medications, where we think this technology can be more successful where compared to the past of cancer vaccines.

Albert Bourla -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thank you very much, Mikael.OperatorNext is Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo.

Mohit Bansal --

 Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst I almost wanted to ask, but this is not the court. So on RSV vaccine side, congress on the data in maternal vaccine. My question is, Sanofi has an antibody which you can give to infants directly and it shows good results. So in your opinion, I mean, the strategy there could be one strategy. You immunize moms, expecting moms versus infants directly. How do you think about the end market shaking out eventually?

Albert Bourla -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yes. Angela, do you want to say how we could compete potentially with an antibody in infants?

Angela Hwang -- President, Pfizer Biopharmaceuticals I mean, first of all,

 if you look at where the -- most of the morbidity and mortality is happening, it's really at the under six months, right, in that age group and also with preterm babies. And so you really need that protection from day one. And I think that's where we believe our differentiation is. From birth, literally from the moment of birth, you have protection. And you have duration of protection throughout the six months, which is what we've shown in our clinical trial.

 So I think while there -- I mean, obviously, it's great to have many different options. I think that the option that we have with our vaccine is truly a unique one and one that plays well to the situation with the infants.

Albert Bourla -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thank you very much. And of course, Andrew made also the point, with vaccines, we do not have co-pays. And antibodies are quite expensive, and you do have co-pays.OperatorNext, we have Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research.

Brian Tsang --

 Wolfe Research -- Analyst This is Brian on for Tim. Just two from us. What is Pfizer's current level of interest in Alzheimer's disease? And do you think there are compelling business development opportunities in the market? Or would the efforts likely to be homegrown? And then second, on the Prevnar 20 and the competition. Wondering if you can opine on Merck's strategy, which is to bifurcate the market between peds and adults and have a product tailored to each segment. They have strains in each and they will be going head-to-head against Prevnar. They said a tailored approach is better than a one-size-fits-all approach, which is what Prevnar is. wanted to get your thoughts on that.

Albert Bourla -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thank you very much. Clearly, as you know, Pfizer had externalized the neuroscience portfolio, and we have created a company that's working on that actually. And we have a very significant equity over there. We are monitoring how science is evolving. And apparently, there are a few things that are happening right now. I'm not referring only to the positive data of one study that we just saw, I'm more referring to earlier science that is emerging that seems to have a high promising for most clinical results. So we are monitoring that. And if we think that there is a good opportunity, we may reexamine entering. The reason why we actually want to exit because we felt the science is not ready at the time. Now I will move it to Angela to answer your second question.

Angela Hwang -- President, Pfizer Biopharmaceuticals We're really proud of our pneumococcal vaccine franchise. And I want to begin with just talking about the great successes that Prevnar 20 has had since its launch. Even though it'

s competing with other --

 with another pneumococcal -- or other pneumococcal vaccines, we have a 95% market share. We have 97% pulmonary access. And we just recently had an updated ACIP recommendation that is going to enable Prevnar 20 to be used for catch-up in the those that are 65 plus as well as 65 under. And so I think that, that is a great demonstration of the leadership and the legacy that Pfizer has in pneumococcal vaccine or respiratory vaccine and a tremendous relationships and knowledge that we have in the space. Equally, that plays out in the pediatric space. So even though we're obviously anticipating the launch of pediatric Prevnar 20, but in the meantime, Prevnar 13 is competing really well with the PCB 15. I think that, again, the relationships that we have,

 the deep trust and knowledge that physicians have of the --

 our pneumococcal vaccine is really standing -- it's really helping us competitively. And I think that there's great anticipation for the five additional serotypes that you're going to be able to get with Prevnar 20 over 15 in the pediatric space. So I think all in all, we're off to an extremely strong start and we look forward to bringing our next vaccine to the market.

Albert Bourla -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer OK. Thank you very, very much.OperatorNext, we have Chris Schott with J.P. Morgan.

Chris Schott --

 JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst I had kind of a qualitative question on how to think about opex dynamics going forward. It seems like we've seen some upward bias and spend at the company which has kind of coincided with the ramp in COVID sales. I guess for a position where that COVID market resets as we transition past the pandemic, is there an opportunity? Or should we think about a pullback in opex spend associated with that? Or should we think about these as more normalized levels of spend given all these growth initiatives that you're highlighting and investing behind at this point?

Albert Bourla -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Chris. Nice question. And our new CFO clearly has views on this. So Dave, what do you think?

Dave Denton -- Chief Financial Officer Chris, good question. Listen,

 before getting into -- it's probably a little too early for guidance for '23. But my expectation is that there would not be a pullback in expenses. I think if anything, what we're fortunate to have is a very robust launch schedule over the next 18 months. And we're really focused on investing to make sure that those launches are extremely successful and these medicines get in the hands of patients pretty quickly. And so if anything, our focus is to get behind these launches, make sure that we execute them flawlessly and that we see the ramp-up and drive our sales performance, particularly in the 2025 to 2030 time frame.OperatorNext is Geoff Meacham with Bank of America.

Geoff Meacham --

 Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Thanks for the question. Just had a few. The slide on long-term growth is really helpful. On the $20 billion on Slide 9 that you guys have highlighted, can you talk to the long-term contribution that has not COVID? I know there'

s some -- there's a long-term piece for COVID, but most investors are focused on kind of the non-COVID drivers. And then on II, looking to next year when we'll have many biosimilars launching for Humira, how much of market disruption do you think we'll see from higher buyers similar volumes and payer preferences, I'm thinking about the effect on Cibinqo and then the etrasimod launch specifically, but also Xeljanz and Inflectra.

Albert Bourla -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yes. I will ask Angela to answer the second question. On the first one, maybe I can give some clarifications. On the $20 billion, so we have included revenues from new launches. This is our estimation for 2030. New launches that are happening either started in '22, Cibinqo, for example, is there, because it started. And then we are getting claims or are about to happen. And we have the list in the appendix. And in this list, excluding the BD, which we do not count over there, we count on the previous bar, where we have the $25 billion of revenues are summing to $20 billion in our expectation. Just to clarify, this does not include Core. This is excluding COVID, excluding new things that may come from COVID, excluding new things that may come in antivirals or new vaccines or combination vaccines or any of them. These are not part of that. Now in the other pipeline, which are things that are not in the near, near short term and things that will launch after the 18 months period all the way to '30, clearly, a lot of these things maybe are not known to you yet. But among the things that they are known to you, and they should be included over there, should be the GLP-1, should be any combinations between flu and COVID or RSV, should be our interferon BIM. And the line vaccines, the Arenas should be the gene therapies that could come. All of that should count toward that bar that we haven't quantified yet publicly. Of course, we know what we expect ourselves. Thank you very much. Now, Angela.

Angela Hwang -- President,

 Pfizer Biopharmaceuticals So the way to think about it is the biologics market and the oral market is -- the way we think about it is that it's different. And the reason I say that is because there is, if you look at the treatment algorithms and how the biologics are used and how the orals are used, you picked Xeljanz as an example, right? Clearly, there, the label says that you have to have used anti-TNF before you move on to an oral JAK. And so I don't think that the competition is across biologics with orals. I think the competition is literally with Humira and the biosimilars of Humira, and then the orals have their role. So I use Xeljanz as one example. I'll use etrasimod as another example.

 There is the benefit of this is that you have an oral -- an oral therapy that actually can be used earlier line and actually pre-biologic. So again, there,

 you -- it's the different lines of treatment and the fact that I think there are distinct places where you would use an oral and a distinct place where you would use a biologic, and I don't think that's the crossover.

Albert Bourla -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Andrew. We're running a little bit later, we have many more questions, and we'll have to make to answer them very quickly.OperatorNext is Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley.

Terence Flynn --

 Morgan Stanley -- Analyst I was just wondering on Paxlovid, it looks like there's going to be some doses remaining on the current U.S. contract as we head into 2023. So just maybe, I know you talked about how Comirnaty would work as we move to a commercial market, but maybe just help us think about how that will work here in the U.S. as we transition out of the pandemic here. And the second question I had is just any more detail you can share on the Prevnar data in peds regarding the serotype coverage. I know that was a question that came out post the Phase 3 data.

Albert Bourla -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Very quickly on the Paxlovid, it is not very different than what is happening with the vaccine. There will be a transition period, we will have to announce this price, then we have to work with the U.S. government to transition so that when they stop distributing their, let's say, goods that they have, we will, let's say, start and we have a seamless transition. So the market will always become covered. But we will give more details given these dynamics, what happens and when this happens,

 the transition next -- in the guidance for next year. Mikael, anything you have to say on the pediatrics.

Mikael Dolsten -- President of Worldwide Research and Development and Medical Just very brief that we have had positive studies in U.S. three plus one schedule, European Union two plus one, after either four or three doses, which is the toddler complete schedule. We covered 20 serotypes in U.S. and 19 in the EU. But the totality of data for all endpoints, we believe, clearly speaks to that this is an important vaccine that adds coverage. And it's likely going to be the vaccine in the near term and for quite many years that have the broadest coverage.OperatorNext, we have Chris Shibutani with Goldman Sachs.

Chris Shibutani --

 Goldman Sachs -- Analyst In terms of RSV, if you could share some thoughts in terms of the velocity of the uptake that you're expecting? Is flu a good barometer? And how quickly do you think, if that's the case, that we could possibly reach through? And then with etrasimod, in the previous owner's hands, there were additional opportunities, I believe, Crohn's disease data Phase 2, atopic dermatitis Phase 3 were originally in the time lines for calendar 2022.

 Will we get some insights on that -- those clinical programs?

Albert Bourla -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yes. I will ask, actually for the clinical programs, William, to speak a little bit about that.

William Pao -- Executive Vice President, Chief Development Officer Yes. Sure. For etrasimod, there is nothing new to update at this time.

Albert Bourla -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer All right. And then for RSV, I would say, clearly, we think that could become like flu. I think all respiratory diseases eventually will have coverage like we have right now in flu. The question is how often that will happen. And that will depend on several factors. Education, of course, of the people and their physicians, but also the availability of combination programs and products that could significantly bring all three of them together, RSV, COVID, and flu.OperatorNext, we have Umer Raffat with Evercore ISI.

Umer Raffat --

 Evercore ISI -- Analyst I wanted to ask two questions on pricing today, if I may. Perhaps first one, Albert, I know the COVID vaccine repricing was a very bold decision. And I understand the dynamics around the value proposition, the pandemic versus endemic era pricing, etc. But I think the sheer magnitude of the increase is making a lot of investors ask questions around ESG implications, any political blowback, etc. I'm just curious how you guys thought about this very important decision and how you're thinking about the expectation on net pricing. And then separately, on Paxlovid. I know you're running a 10-day trial versus the five-day course that's currently approved. Does that mean Paxlovid will effectively become 2x the price once a 10-day course is approved?

Albert Bourla -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yes. I can answer both of them. Look, I think what was very bold and the right absolutely decision was to price the Paxlovid during the pandemic at a very, very, very low price. Clearly,

 the price that -- excuse me, the vaccine at a very, very low price. That was the right thing to do, and we did it and we maintained that for the years to come. Now that we are coming to the end of this period, and as we are moving to very different products, which is very different presentations,

 which are -- now we are moving to single instead of mass viral multi-dose vial, we are pricing the vaccine according to the cost effectiveness, and the cost effectiveness of the current vaccine. The way that CDC is pricing, it is way, way, way below than what the price that we have set [Inaudible] start. Also keep in mind that people will not see any difference and the system will get the benefit of a cost-effective product. And the people wouldn't see the difference because there's no copay. Now on the Paxlovid, I think it's too early to speak. We haven't announced any price. And we do not know what will be the outcome of the studies or the outcome of a new class that is coming following it actually.

 So now -- thank you very much.OperatorOur last question will come from David Risinger with SVB Securities.

David Risinger --

 SVB Securities -- Analyst So my two questions are regarding the core growth, which was 2% operationally in the third quarter, could you talk about what you're assuming and how we should think about growth prospects in the future, specifically in the fourth quarter since you've guided to that in your updated guidance. And then second, could you provide an update? And I might have missed this, if I did, I apologize. But could you provide an update on your next-gen oral antiviral for COVID?

Albert Bourla -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thank you. One, on the 2% operational excluding COVID, just to make a clarification, if you exclude also the contract manufacturing business that we have, that was really COVID-related. It has very increased revenues last year because we were contract manufacturing for BioNTech territories. That we don't have to do now, because BioNTech took over for their territories their own manufacturing. In fact, the growth was 4% of our pharmaceutical business, excluding COVID and excluding this piece of contract manufacturing. Now, Angela, based on that, what will we expect to be the growth trajectory?

Angela Hwang -- President, Pfizer Biopharmaceuticals Well, we've talked about our five-year CAGR, right, to be 6%. And just I want to reiterate that, that is exactly the track that we're on. Every year does not necessarily have to look identical. But over the five-year period, we're absolutely confident that we're going to deliver the 6% CAGR.

Albert Bourla -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer All right. So thank you very much. So with that, I think we are close to bring our call to a close. Please don't forget to attend our event on December 12, where we will provide details about our very important new product launches in the next 18 months and some of our most important pipeline potential, new medicines, and vaccines. Thank you for joining us today. Have a great rest of your day.Operator[Operator signoff] Duration: 0 minutesCall participants:

Yum China Holdings, Inc. (YUMC 4.13%)Q3 2022 Earnings CallNov 01, 2022, 8:00 p.m. ETContents:  Prepared Remarks Questions and Answers Call Participants  Prepared Remarks:  OperatorThank you for standing by, and welcome to the Yum China third quarter 2022 earnings conference call. All participants are in a listen-only mode. There will be a presentation followed by a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to Ms. Michelle Shen, director of investor relations. Please go ahead.

Michelle Shen -- Director, Investor Relations



 Thank you, Ashley. Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining Yum China's third quarter 2022 earnings conference call. On today's call are our CEO, Ms. Joey Wat; and our CFO, Mr. Andy Yeung. We are dialing in from different locations today. If we experience any technical difficulties during the call, please remain on the line as we reconnect.Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that our earnings call and investor materials contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to future events and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statements in our earnings release and the risk factors included in our filings with the SEC. This call also includes certain non-

GAAP financial measures -- you should carefully consider the comparable GAAP measures. Reconciliation of non-GAAP and GAAP measures is included in our earnings release. Today's call includes three sections. Joey will provide an update regarding our performance in the third quarter. Andy will then cover the financial performance and outlook in greater detail.



 Finally, we'll open the call to questions. You can find the webcast of this call and a PowerPoint presentation, which contains operational and financial information for the quarter on our IR website. Also on the site, you can find a video we prepared that showcases our latest stores, offers, and activities. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Joey Wat, CEO of Yum China. Joey?

 Joey Wat -- Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Michelle. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We achieved outstanding performance in the third quarter with fantastic growth, both top line and bottom line. This demonstrates our ability to operate in an uncertain environment by learning, adapting, and strengthening business fundamentals.



 During COVID time, our resilient business model and agility helped us manage the negative impact. As COVID conditions were relatively calmer in July and August. We capture sales opportunities during the peak summer season. System sales recovered with 5% year-over-year growth. Operating profit surged 77% year over year to 360 million, even higher than 2019 levels. Great teamwork makes this possible. Key elements in our winning formula includes our in-house and tailor-mix supply chain, industry-leading digital and delivery capabilities, cost restructuring, and solid execution. Let's move to KFC and Pizza Hut. We have been innovating new products to satisfy customer cravings. In the past two years, we have established strong presence in new categories such as beef burger, whole chicken, and durian pizza. This was enabled by a powerful supply chain by securing supply and scale, streamlining production, and optimizing costs. Let me share our success stories. At KFC, our extra juicy beef burger rapidly captured meaningful market share. Since adding them to the permanent menu in May 2021, we have sold over 100 million burgers. That's about five beef burgers every second. For the full year, we expect to generate close to 2 billion in sales from beef burgers. We cater to Chinese taste by making the patty super juicy using our specialty ovens. Customers love our burgers for their great taste and value for money. We source our wagyu beef [Inaudible] locally from Northeastern China and have signed a multiyear contract to secure a price enterprise. Our juicy whole chicken has also quickly gained popularity since its launched late last year. Year to date, we have sold over 18 million whole chickens. Whole chicken is a versatile product. good for both dine-in and take-home consumption. We use a different breed or smaller chicken with better cost that is the perfect size for an individual meal and particularly juicy. And it's good for sharing on the dining table at home as well. At Pizza Hut, durian pizza has become a customer favorite. In fact, during Q3's promotion, every four pizza we sold was a durian pizza. Our limited-time durian trio pizza, [Inaudible], with three types of durian, was especially popular with durian lovers. Customers are increasingly value-conscious, yet we do not compromise on quality. Last quarter, we shared about KFC's widely popular Crazy Thursday campaign, [Inaudible]. Since 2018, we have been offering delicious food, including the latest innovation at amazing value. The campaign continues to be a phenomenal event generating a significant boost in sales every Thursday. Our customers create witty and playful social media content using the Crazy Thursday theme. Many of these postings has gone viral, creating huge hype for us. Now, to drive weekend traffic for families and kids, we have introduced a Sunday Buy More, Save More, [Foreign language] campaign in July. Customers can get a bigger discount when they buy more, up to 50% off for eight items. This new promotion perform has built wonderful momentum with good value perception while protecting our ticket average. Apart from abundant value, we also launched a Golden Star chicken breast burger, [Foreign language]. This is our first successful chicken breast burger. We add an extra step in the preparation process to make the breast meat super juicy and tender. This entry-price burger widens our choices for customers. and is a great product for lower-tier cities. We try to keep our brands appealing to useful customers. In September, we transformed select Pizza Hut stores into social hubs for gamers, partnering with the popular RPG game, Genshin Impact, [Inaudible], with the great stores, updated restaurant crews, and exclusive gifts. The campaign generated extraordinary social hype. In just three minutes, we sold over 300,000 team combo mills. And our super app recorded its highest activity ever. I'm looking forward to more successful events with this partnership. Let's move to digital and delivery. We have been enhancing our delivery and digital ecosystem to make our business fundamentally stronger. Customers love coming in; delivery sales are growing fast, empowered by our dedicated delivery riders and leading digital capabilities. Delivery grew 19% year over year and reached 38% of sales mix in Quarter 3. Together with takeaway, off-premise sales were over 60%. Our ability to capture off-premise demand not only enable us to successfully serve customers but also pushing store closure impact due to COVID conditions. This 60% off-premise sales is so fundamental to our business model because it really prepares our downside in both sales and profit despite the fluid situation. We have been maximizing delivery coverage and flexibility using AI technology. Most recently, we launched Smart Delivery, [Foreign language], to dynamically adjust delivery coverage for each store by daypart, taking into account the operating hours of nearby stores. The upgrade system help us serve more customers more efficiently. Our digital capabilities serve as key touchpoints with customers. In Quarter 3, we reached two milestones in our digital ecosystem. One, our loyalty program reached 400 million members. And two, cumulatively since 2018, KFC sold over 100 million privileged subscriptions. Our privileged subscriptions offer great value for money and have been expected too in driving frequency and spending. Our digital capabilities are also crucial to streamlining restaurant efficiency. Digital orders optimize in-store labor efficiency and accounts for more than 90% of sales in the quarter. Pizza Hut's table sign mobile ordering sales have grown exponentially from just 2% at its launch in 2018 to 45% in Quarter 3 2022. This helps mitigate rising wage inflation and frees up the crew members to enhance customer service. To improve digital experience, we introduced intelligent order sequencing at KFC, [Foreign language], in the third quarter. This system automatically arranges ordered to shorten customer wait time. Now, let's move on to coffee, our third growth engine. Lavazza is making solid progress along its clear four-pillar strategy. The pillars include brand building, menu upgrades, expand digital and delivery capabilities, and store development. Here's how we build this out. Branding. Lavazza has a century-long reputation for coffee expertise. We will continue to accentuate its brand positioning as the leading Italian coffee brand offering and an Italian experience. Menu upgrade. We are broadening food and drink offerings with more unique Italian products, including coffee premium, single-origin beam in tigelle, which is an Italian flat bread with meat or except something like our Chinese [Inaudible]. We also launched localized products such as coconut latte, [Inaudible] milk latte, and even [Inaudible] is a very lovely fragrant flower used in many Chinese desserts. These new products capture the latest coffee trend and have been well received by our customers. Digital and delivery. We are building our membership program and digital fundamentals to improve customer experience and attract online traffic. Delivery reached almost 40% of sales mix in Quarter 3. Store development. Now, with 78 stores, we have further refined our store models, paving the way for growth. We have made great progress so far, but work remains. But things do take time. We want to grow this brand right with every step at the right time. In close partnership with Lavazza Group, we are confident to build a successful Lavazza business in China. We decided to wind down our COFFii & Joy operation from branding to site selection to operation and more. We learned a lot with COFFii & Joy. This invaluable learning experience will help us capture growing opportunities in the coffee market. Going forward, we will grow our coffee business with two distinct market positions: take coffee, focused on value and convenience; and Lavazza focused on authentic Italian coffee. To summarize, our innovations and hard work in the pandemic years have made our business fundamentally stronger. We are confident in our team's ability to find opportunities in diversity and unlock further potential in China. We will continue to execute our GM, which stands for resiliency, growth, and moat framework to strengthen our competitive position and capture long-term growth. With that, I will turn the call over to Andy. Andy?

Andy Yeung -- Chief Financial Officer Thank you, Joey, and hello, everyone. Let me now go through the third quarter performance in detail. We saw sequential improvement in the third quarter. System sales returned to growth year over year and restaurant margin was highest since 2018, well above our expectations. We focus on driving sales through new products and compelling value. Same-store sales recover to the same level a year ago. From a timing perspective, the trend remains volatile impacted by frequent COVID outbreaks. In July and August, we saw a sequential recovery in same-store sales in August exceeding the prior year. This was mainly due to lapping the Delta variant outbreak in August 2021, which heavily impacted Eastern China. However, in September, same-store sales declined mid-single digits as COVID-related health measures tightened in many areas. Around 900 stores were temporarily closed or provided limited services in September compared to around 400 stores on average in July and August. On the margin side, we continue to identify cost-saving opportunities, drive labor productivity and we base our cost structure. Let me go through the financials and our cost control initiatives. Unless noted otherwise, all percentage changes are for the effect of foreign exchange. Foreign exchange had a negative impact of approximately 6% in the quarter. Third quarter total revenues increased 5% year over year in reported currency to $2.68 billion due to the contribution of new units and the consolidation of Hangzhou KFC. This was partially offset by temporary store closure and foreign exchange translation. In constant currency, total revenue grew 11%. System sales grew 5%. Same-store sales were flat year over year. By brand, KFC same-store sales were flat with same solid traffic at 93% of prior year's level. Ticket average grew 8% due to the increase in delivery mix, which has a higher ticket average than dine-in. Abundant value campaigns like the Family Bucket and Buy More, Save More, also strongly contributed to higher ticket. Pizza Hut same-store sales grew 2% year over year. Same-store traffic grew by 2%, while ticket average was flat. High delivery mix, which has a lower ticket average than dine-in was offset by discount management. [Inaudible] margin was 18.8%, 660 basis points higher than last year. The year-over-year increase was mainly due to high product activity, temporary relief, and sales leveraging. These were partially offset by inflation in commodity, wage, and utility costs, while costs also increased due to high delivery volume. Our team worked diligently to improve our cost structure, so let me next go through each expand line item and the actions we have taken. Cost of sales was 30.7%, 150 basis points lower than last year. We focused on the most effective campaign to drive traffic that allow us to be more cost-efficient while ensuring quick value for money. We also manage commodity price inflation to low single digits. Cost of labor was 23.5%, 210 basis points lower than last year. This was mainly due to improvement in labor productivity and release recognized in the third quarter of $17 million. These were partially offset by increasing costs from higher inventory sales mix and wage inflation of 2%. We improved labor productivity by, one, optimizing staff scheduling and hiring; two, sharing restaurant management teams across stores; and three, leveraging digital tools to automate processes, such as digital ordering and inventory management. There was also a lapping impact due to higher second levels in 2021 caused by the Southern Delta variant outbreak. Occupancy and others was 27%, 300 basis points lower than last year. This was mainly due to our cost savings initiatives and lower rental expense as a percentage of sales. In addition, we pulled back on marketing and advertising. Rental expenses were lower in the quarter due to, one, rental relief of $30 million; two, smaller store format with lower upfront investment and better store economics; and three, negotiating more rental relief with wearable components. G&A expenses increased 16% year over year mainly due to increased compensation and benefit expenses, consolidation of Hangzhou KFC, and incremental expenses from emerging brands. There were also one-time expenses associated with primary listing conversions in Hong Kong. Operating profit was $316 million, a 77% increase year over year. The net contribution from Hangzhou KFC consolidation was 6% of total operating profit in the quarter. It includes amortization of intangible assets acquired which was roughly $60 million per quarter. This will run through the end of this year. Below the operating line, we incurred a $13 million mark-to-market net loss on our equity investment in Meituan in the quarter. It was lower than $32 million net loss in the same period last year. Effective tax rate was 29.9%, 160 basis points higher than last year due to Hangzhou KFC consolidation. Prior to consolidation, the agri income from JVs was not subject to tax, resulting in a lower tax rate. We expect the full-year effective tax rate to come in around low 30s. Net income was $206 million, a 72% increase year over year. Diluted EPS was $0.49, more than double the prior-year period. The mark-to-market loss in Meituan negatively impacted our EPS by $0.03. We have returned around $560 million to shareholders in cash dividends and share repurchases year to date. We temporarily [Inaudible] purchase in the third quarter prior to the dual primary conversion. Helped by our strong balance sheet, we will continue to execute our disciplined and balanced capital allocation strategy. Our operating cash flow remains strong. In the third quarter, we generated free cash flow of $558 million. Let us take a look at the fourth quarter outlook. The external environment remains challenging. COVID-related preventive health measure [Inaudible] in October. In October, around 1,400 of our stores on average were temporarily closed or offered limited services. Downward pressures on the economy, cautious consumer spending, and inflationary environment are also happening that we continue to face. Our same-store sales in the third quarter were below the pre-pandemic level.

 We expect a full recovery of sales -- of same-store sales will take time, and the path to remain uneven and nonlinear. I would also like to remind everyone that, one, fourth quarter is seasonally a lower quarter in terms of sales and profit. So, sales volatilities could have a more potent impact on profitability. Two, there was around $30 million temporary relief in the third quarter, most of which is unlikely to repeat in the fourth quarter. Three, the appreciation of U.S. dollar against the yuan may negatively affect our product numbers. And four, we continue to dial back some austerity measures to balance cost reduction and service level. Now, despite the headwinds in the third quarter, we resumed the pace of store openings and opened 621 net new stores year to date. By relentlessly optimizing store economics with lower upfront investment, our new store performance continued to be strong. Store payback remained healthy at two years for KFC and three years for Pizza Hut. This gives us strong confidence for further expansion. We will continue to implement our disciplined and systematic store opening approach, opening new and profitable store at a robust pace. As the fourth quarter is usually the peak season for store openings, we are confident in reaching the full-year target of 1,000 to 1,200 net new stores. Lastly, let me touch on our primary listing conversion in Hong Kong. It became effective on October 24 along with our inclusion in the Southbound Stock Connect. We expect the new status will provide additional access to investors, [Inaudible] our shareholder base, and increase liquidity. To round up, we have learned to navigate through uncertainties and volatilities in the past two years. COVID conditions will continue to remain challenging, but we're adapting to the new normal. Our resilient business model and agility allow us to pivot quickly and effectively develop new strengths. When the market is mildly calmer, we are able to capture the upside and deliver strong results. In the third quarter, we have once again demonstrated our transformative fundamentals, cost control, and solid execution. We are confident in our ability to achieve long-term growth in China and generate sustainable returns to shareholders. With that, I will pass you back to Michelle to start the Q&A. Michelle?

Michelle Shen -- Director, Investor Relations Thank you, Andy. We'll now open the call for questions. In order to give more people the chance to ask questions, please limit your questions to one at a time. Ashley, please start the Q&A. Questions & Answers: OperatorThank you. [Operator instructions] Your first question comes from Chen Luo with Bank of America. Please go ahead.

Chen Luo --

 Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Hi, Joey, and congratulations on the very strong Q3 results. Given the very fluid situation amid the coat outbreak and restrictions in China, my question will focus on margins. We have seen very impressive margin expansion in Q3 results, and over the past three years, we also observed a pattern that usually during the first few quarters of a big COVID outbreak, such as the Wuhan one or the delta outbreak in Q3 last year and the omicron early this year, we might see a few quarters of margin erosion. But then after our very agile and quick adaptation in the following quarters,

 we actually -- we managed to achieve margins that could be even higher than the pre-pandemic level. And let's assume that next year, we are not going to see another big wave of outbreak that would lead to massive lockdowns in our core markets such as Eastern China. Is it fair to say that we can actually achieve a restaurant margin that is largely comparable to the pre-pandemic level, which is around mid-teens? So, this is my question. Thank you.

Andy Yeung -- Chief Financial Officer Thank you for your questions. You know, obviously, you know, our team has done a fantastic job to deliver solid margins amid a very difficult and challenging situation. Now, our margin improvement, obviously, some of these fundamental transformations that would last going forward. Some of this is more temporary and some of the outstanding measure maybe dial back as things returning to normal. Now, if you look at our margin improvement was largely contributed by high productivity, right, and also for the quarter, some temporary relief and sales leveraging, now so when we look at the initiatives that we have undertaken over the past couple of years, we have mentioned over the past few quarters, we have taken initiatives to rebase our cost structure and also to drive efficiency gain. So, you see a lot of new product innovation in terms of our assets, how we manage the pricing, and also the cost inflation and commodity prices. Also, our office and our supply chain team on our core strength in terms of managing supply and robustness of our supply chain. And also sort of mitigate partially some of those impacts, sometimes commodity prices, and allow us to continue to innovate and quickly to roll out new products that meet the consumer demand. The other one is, obviously, you look at the labor board activities, for example, we have deployed technologies. We have continued to invest in technologies to automate system processes to help improve labor positivity. As we have mentioned probably last quarter, we're beginning to roll out a management tool for our stores. So, our management team for the store can be used called multiple stores. And if you look at our rental, for example, obviously, we see some rental [Inaudible], but we also have over the past few years and especially over the past couple of years to work very hard to restructure the rental cost structure. We have landlord not only seeing lower rental cost but also more wearable and impactable rent structure. And so, those are both fundamental transformation we continue going forward. Same thing for our digital investment. Over the past few years, we have continued to invest heavily in digital that allow us to in, for example, during the pandemic, have direct outreach to our consumer mobile new products, new marketing campaign efficiently. And also allow us to if you look at our membership program, we continue to be a very strong foundation for ourselves, membership program now account for north of 60% of our sales. So, those will continue to help us going forward to maintain efficiencies and operating efficiency. However, as we mentioned before, some of this is temporary, for example, the rent lease, some of the relief in our labor costs, especially some of the government incentives or relief, as well as the delay in delay in rate increase in the market in the third quarter. Usually, we adjust wages in the third quarter for our market, maybe fourth. But because of the pandemic impact this year, many markets have delayed rate increase. So, some of this may come back, and also some of that program. So, all in all, I think looking forward, I think you can expect some of this fundamental change you would stay. And then some of these temporary measures may subside over time.

Joey Wat -- Chief Executive Officer I would like to just add some color in terms of our management team thinking and also the business model, why that helps protect the margin now in the future. Well, we do believe that this company and this team, this management team is an anti-fragile company. Whatever stone is thrown at us, we possibly could convert these stones into our stepping stones to go further and higher. That's what we believe and that's our team keeps trying to do the right thing. In terms of business model,

 as I mentioned in our -- in my presentation earlier, it's very important to recognize that our off-premise business right now is 60%. What does that mean? Well, if we look at by brand, KFC is actually 65% off-premise. And that is up from last year, which was 60%. Now, Pizza Hut tell even a more amazing story. Pizza Hut, the off-premise sales is 50%, 50. Before pandemic, it was only 30%. From 30% to 50%. So, our business, our off-premise business in Pizza Hut is much, much stronger and higher. Given the fluid situation in the pandemic, these are incredibly important number because when we are in sort of a more tougher situation in terms of lockdown, that 60% will become higher because there will be naturally some sales transfer from dine-in to additional off-premise business. So, with the 60% sort of the off-premise influence situation, that percent will go higher that naturally protect our business, ourselves. Because it's very difficult to have a strong margin when the sales leverage is not there. So, it's not only all the margin line that we prepare as Andy has comprehensively pointed out. But on the other side, the sales side that we have also put and that's a lot of hard work in the last three years, and the team has done a great job.

Chen Luo --

 Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Thank you. Your margin management capability is really impressive. Congratulations again.

Joey Wat -- Chief Executive Officer Thank you.OperatorThank you. Next question comes from Lillian Lou with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.

Lillian Lou --

 Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Thanks a lot. And then thanks for your very detailed explanation. My question is also a follow-up question on margin management, but maybe from different angle because Joey and Andy, you mentioned about the sales leverage and also the line items, management on cost side. So, maybe look at all the initiatives in the third quarter and also during the pandemic in these three years. You've been focusing on really kind of rejuvenize the menu and the new product launch and smaller stores, a very effective promotional campaign. So, when you out design this, what's your thinking behind, especially trying to understand that with our new stores now incrementally higher portion of small stores? Would that actually fundamentally change our margin profile going forward? And also, especially third quarter you have more promotional campaign, but in return, actually, it didn't suffer on margin instead on the offer side, they improved the margin. So, I'm trying to understand a little bit further how you achieve that from these efforts. Thank you.

Andy Yeung -- Chief Financial Officer Thank you, Lillian. I think, you know, in terms of margins, I think I want to emphasize, at least in the short term. Because of the COVID situations, we see fluctuations in our sales, impacted and high correlation with the situation. So, the biggest lever of deleveraging impact when things come down is actually sell, right? Higher store sales generally will drive higher restaurant margin. And we can see that even with a dynamic in a time, you'll see that margin fluctuate through the year during the first quarter and the third quarter of January is higher sales period for us, and we also see higher margins. And then in second quarter and especially the fourth quarter, January had lower sales season for us, and you'll also see lower margins. So, I want to emphasize and echo what Joey have mentioned earlier, sales is very important to us in terms of driving margins and to leverage. Now in terms of our store format, our store format remains very, very healthy so economics, probably be in the recent years. This is not just come naturally, but a lot of hard work to have put into the store, format design, operations, and then also the menu mix and etc., to make it work. Now, our store format, obviously, right now are geared to our two areas largely. One is on the greenfield, right? So, we still have a lot of cities and townships that we can serve. And then we have a format for that. We also have formatting to the urban area where we're increasing density and cater to the high mix of delivery and takeaway business. And so, but they all have one thing in common is that our store format in terms of open investment are turning lower. Compared to a few years ago, we're spending on average, you know, 2.5 million per store. Now, we are spending net less than $2 million, close to like maybe drawing down to like $1.6 million, $1.7 million per store. So, that helped us sort of be like more agile, more nimble, and reduce upward investment that allow us to continue to see the very strong unit economics for the new stores that we open. Now, as I mentioned on our prepared remarks, if you look at our payback period for KFC, it's still very healthy at two years. Obviously,

 there may be some fluctuations depending on the dynamics -- and for Pizza Hut, it's three years. If you look at the satellite store model, as we mentioned before, its performance is very close to what we can achieve with KFC already. And so, that's what still has confidence in terms of robust store expansion. And I don't think we're too concerned about at least from the economics that would have a material impact on our margin mix going forward. So, that's the store format and then also our store economics for new store. Joey, do you have anything to add to that?

Joey Wat -- Chief Executive Officer Yeah.

 Let me -- again, let me add some color in terms of the relation between promotion and margin management. As we mentioned earlier, we consolidate our promotion mechanism, and we focus on fewer and more impactful such as [indiscernible] Buy More Save More. They help drive our sales during weekend, which is quite effective. But at the same time, we are very, very careful to manage our products, for example, the whole chicken, right?

 The whole chicken -- I'll give you one example. You guys will get it. Sometimes, it's more detail to get it. We sell 80 million whole chicken, so far, this year. It's roast chicken, one whole fried chicken. Well, here is the reason why. Oil this year is very expensive. So, if we do roast chicken, it has two benefits. One, it's healthier; two, it costs less. Customers love it. So we go through every little detail, make sure that it has both great products but at good cost. And that work for not only them but at-home consumption. So, a small example to give a sense. And in terms of margin protection, I would like to share another belief which result in very good results. Back to Q2, it was a very difficult quarter. We reiterate our commitment to protect our staff's jobs, no layoff. We look at every single way to manage our cost structure, our margin, except layoffs. We want to prepare our employee jobs during the tough time. Everyone needs some sense of security during very fluid situation. And our staff, our 400,000 strong team, they appreciate it and everyone, everyone go for every single innovation that we can achieve to protect our company in that. I'll pause here. Let's move on to next question.OperatorYour next question comes from Xiaopo Wei with Citi. Please go ahead.

Xiaopo Wei --

 Citi -- Analyst Hi. Good morning, Joey, Andy. I will also ask a question about the margin, but I will take another approach maybe the bigger picture what happened in the past two years. If we look at what happened in the past two years since COVID. We are seeing to open more stores. But in the third quarter, the first time that we are seeing amazing restaurant margin with some very short window of rebound about all the consumption, etc. But you can see that you greatly capture that upside of the consumption rebound, should we say that actually, the new store opening, which works the investment for the future, starting working well in a situation for when the COVID is phasing out, actually, our new work contribution to our probability actually be more pronounced than before? Another question related to this is if we look at the delivery sales contribution, the KFC hit 37%, which is amazing, very close to Pizza Hut. I do remember years ago, when I first met Joey, I had the impression that with KFC have never been that high. In terms of delivery sales contribution for Pizza Hut. And now we are seeing Pizza Hut and KFC having a very close kind of delivery sales contribution. Shall we say that looking forward, KFC fundamentally has transformed? And we are expecting actually higher-than-expected delivery sales contribution looking forward, approaching 40%? Thank you.

Andy Yeung -- Chief Financial Officer So, I think there's a lot of question about margin today. Obviously, we're very pleased with our margin performance in the third quarter. As we mentioned, the sales leveraging when come a time we're not only able to capture both the only the sales upside, but also able to regain the sales leveraging. So, we obviously, as I mentioned before, there's a number of fundamental transformation that we have undergone. We base our cost structure in the form of initiative. But I think what you're asking about is about two things, right? One is the new store margins and probably the one is the delivery sales mix, what's the percentage going forward. Now, I think when we look at the new store economics, I think one thing to remember is that for any new store, generally take a couple of years for it to ramp up sales and margins to a truly mature level. So, the other part is that, obviously, we're very pleased as you mentioned, when we look at our new store performance, they continue to be very robust, very strong. If we look at the margin fund that I mentioned, the ramp-up period, but even for the store that we opened this year, a large majority of them turn to restaurant breakeven or better within three months of time, which is tracking on par or slightly better than the software level. And so, I mean, there's a couple of things that is happening there, right? One is, as we mentioned, we have worked very hard to find a way format, not just reducing the size of the size, it's obviously important, but also the operations, the total operating offering, and the menu mix. So, all these were in conjunction with that.

 We also -- as we mentioned, we have worked hard on changing the like restaurant management structure. We have developed a management labor pool that can share with the store to make it productivity improvement. So,

 I think -- and then also, if you look at the entire rental for a new U.S. store, obviously, we have worked very hard to lower the rental cost as per sales. But more importantly, to keep us with sale, we continue to work with [Inaudible] we want to develop a high proportion of web cost component. And so, that allows us to be more resilient over time. So, I think our approach to new store opening is very disciplined and systematic as I mentioned before, and we'll continue to drive that discipline so that when we open new stores as we continue at a very robust pace and might be accelerating during the fourth quarter, we will continue to open not only new store but [Inaudible] store. And so, I think the portfolio contribution for new stores is important layover time. But I think the economic sale, I think, is on par, as we mentioned, [Inaudible] peers, two-year for KFC, three-year for Pizza Hut, which is pretty consistent. So, that's the new store margin and possibly. In terms of sales mix, obviously, in the short term, you're going to be depending on COVID situation, tighter measures you're going to see higher delivery mix shift. And then you sometimes you see that things calmer and then dine-in traffic would come back. But all in all, I think you can see there's a big change in our business. Delivery mix right now and all premise right now come for a majority of our sales now. And so, that's why like when we're developing smart format, as we mentioned before, for the smaller urban format, we do dose more catering to away business. So, high growth, I think we depend on the consumer, if they want more, we'll deliver more and we have to format and how achieve that, especially on the digital side, like we have a whole app to drive traffic, we work a date. So, the consumer can audit whenever they want, and we have a small set.OperatorYour next question comes from Michelle Cheng with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.

Michelle Cheng --

 Goldman Sachs -- Analyst Hi, Joey, Andy. My question is about store expansion. So, given this very strong profit margin, do you have any initial thoughts on the expansion plan into 2023? Any chance we could further accelerate expansion given we know all the smaller players are suffering? And also, more specifically by brands, so aside from KFC, Pizza Hut maintaining a relatively stronger momentum on expansion. How do we think about other brands since we're actually reshuffling other brands quite aggressively in the past few quarters? Thank you.

Andy Yeung -- Chief Financial Officer Michelle, thank you for the question. So,

 about new store -- and as I mentioned, our new store performance continues to be strong. And also, as I mentioned before, I mean, each year, we set a target thing what is reasonable, but ultimately, it is for the market and the fundamentals that would try how many stores that will be open and then also sometimes get impacted by COVID. So, we will continue to maintain that discipline and systematic approach. So, when you see the economics are good, the system we're doing, you'll see some acceleration because more so we propose and more, so we approve. Obviously, when the market or like the economics are more moderate, impacted, then we see some deceleration in medical because it's doing to the model and the assumption itself will refresh that very regularly. So, we will maintain that very disciplined approach. Obviously, we'll continue to see very strong fundamentals for soft opening. We see, as I mentioned before, the greenfield. We have more KFC, we're only in a little bit more than 1,700 cities. We see probably another housing so that potentially we can enter Pizza Hut, like almost 1,000 stores that KFC already in, we don't have a Pizza Hut store. So, there's a greenfield opportunity. So, we see feel very good about install expansion, so network expansion and opportunity there. Now,

 in terms of -- obviously, we'll continue to have to work hard on the store format, right,

 because the consumer change -- and we see obviously opportunities right now. Our pipeline is very strong because we will feel very attractive tenants right now in the restaurant industry. After two, three years of pandemic,

 we continue to be -- perform very well, pay our rent on time and everything. So, we move them attractively even more attractive tenant, so we have more opportunity. But our emphasis, again, is on discipline and some approach to make sure that we not only open a new store but open new and profitable stores. And so, that's important. Now, as you mentioned, we did some portfolio management on our brand. As Joey mentioned earlier, we are winding down C&J to focus our resources on the coffee side on Lavazza, which we see very good opportunities, a lot of potential there. And so, that's an approach.

 We also -- a part this year, we also wind down the COFFii & JOY business. And, you know, starting –

 having a homegrown brand for more --  close to a decade now. Unfortunately, this market positioning is in the transportation and tourist locations. Now that business has been very, very challenging over the past three years, you can imagine. And currently, we don't see with the new normal improvement in any short time. So, we decided to wind that business down. So, again, back to that discipline and systematic approach be it in store expansion, be it in portfolio management. We are very disciplined about that. And so, we will continue that going forward about the brand development. So, thank you, Michelle.

Joey Wat -- Chief Executive Officer I'll just add a few comments about the store expansion. First, we certainly are opening even more smaller stores. So, for Pizza Hut alone, some 5% of the new store opened this year are either smaller or satellite store, and KFC is about half. And these small stores worked particularly well in lower-tier cities, and that's where we will continue our store expansion. And the result is pretty exciting and promising. So, that's comment number one.

 Comment number two is opening new -- the smaller stores also require focus on the product and operations side, and we are giving that support to the new smaller stores. For example, chicken breast burger, [Foreign language]. The price is very good. It's 9.9. It's brilliant. It's amazing for the lower-tier city new stores as introduction to our business. The other products like [Foreign language], we developed these products with lower price points, specifically for lower-tier cities and specifically for the introduction new stores. And at the same time, we also continue to innovate in terms of operating process within the small stores. Well, one example, smaller store we only can accommodate fewer number of staff, which is a great news for shareholders. But that also requires changes in terms of operating process, how to still make it work to protect our product quality for safety. You name it. So, not only just the cause of opening new stores but also the product and the operating process that we are focusing on. Thank you, Michelle. Next question.OperatorYour next question comes from Anne Ling with Jefferies. Please go ahead.

Anne Ling --

 Jefferies -- Analyst Hey, thank you. Thank you for giving me the opportunity for asking the question. Hi. Regarding the cost side,

 we look at like -- we track the chicken price, and which we saw a 20-odd percent increase. And also, at the same time, flow costs also increased. I understand that management has a really great way in terms of like making use of the whole to the chicken parts. But moving into like year 2023, when do you see this increase in terms of the cost, the checking costs, or the other commodity costs kicking into your P&L? Or maybe you can share with us what is your current agreement with your supplier. Thank you.

Andy Yeung -- Chief Financial Officer And thank you for your question. Joey,

 do you want to --

Joey Wat -- Chief Executive Officer No, no, go on.

Andy Yeung -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. OK. So, when we look at, you know, our [Inaudible], obviously, I think we do have to comment on how fantastic job product innovation team have done to help us manage that cost inflation. Commodity price inflation, as you mentioned, is very real and is globally and it's true also in China as well. Obvious in China, we see more moderate inflationary pressure. But still, we see the commodity price increase escalating over the past probably like a year. We see a very favorable pricing last year, 2021. We're beginning to see that commodity price pricing pressure building up. And right now, China is probably at mid- to high-quality commodity price increase. And as you mentioned,

 we all see poultry price increase -- so as I mentioned before, this is going to continue happening. And we'll continue to work hard to mitigate it. The other one I want to mention is that as we have mentioned before, our supply chain lock down most of the supply, you know, a quarter to half time. So, there will be some lagging impact on the inflationary side. And obviously, because we get an inflationary environment or supply thing also deploy long-term contracts at when it is possible to lock in pricing a little bit longer. For example, coffee, they have to talking in a longer-term pricing contract. But some of the commodity you can lock in for a longer time. So, we'll see some commodity pricing pressure building up in the coming quarter as well. Now, as you mentioned to you for pricing pressure besides of the supply chain and the efficiency there is also on product innovation, as Joey has mentioned. The team has done a fantastic job developing new products. That utilize given part of the resources that we already have, chicken, beef. For our folks in the U.S., like when people talk about chicken sandwich or chicken burger, generally that will refer to chicken breast. But as we have mentioned before for China consumer, generally, they like dark meat more than white meat because dark meat means they tend to be more tender and more flavorful. So,

 this -- for example, this quarter, as Joey mentioned, we have developed a fantastic chicken sandwich, chicken burger but that is very successful in what we see by consumer. Now like that kind of product innovation will satisfy consumer demand and also help us to manage commodity prices will be very key for long-term managing [Inaudible]. So, yes, so that relieve hyperinflation. And then also, obviously, how do we manage our marketing campaign? How do we manage other costs, waystation or that we also point for us in the long term to manage the till? Now, for labor inflation, as we mentioned before, generally bad time, good time, we will likely see labor cost increase. Sometimes you will delay sometimes it's more moderate. But in China, the long-term trend is mid- to high single digits. And so, in long term, we will continue to have to work hard to improve their productivity, invest in technology, IT, invest in infrastructure, and as Joey mentioned, continue to innovate, continue to improve our store operations, so that we can maintain labor efficiency of gain to offset that labor inflation. And that said, I like commodity price and labor inflation.

Joey Wat -- Chief Executive Officer Ann, I'll just add one comment on that one. We do use every part of chicken accept the chicken better. But I would also like to point out that we have our team, both the pricing team and then the product innovation team. We have been able to interview and use different protein, beef, pork, fish, and duck. We are selling duck burger right now as we speak right now, chicken and duck burger. So, we have a variety of proteins in our pipeline that we can use and we can promote, depending also on the price. I mean, the thinking is rather simple. A good chef, they look at what is the best in terms of quality, not only price, quality, and price available in the market. And then you turn this fantastic ingredient to great food. Same for us, just a much, much bigger scale, I guess. So, we have both the flexibility and the scale to deliver amazing food to our customers at very good price and very good value. Thank you, Ann.OperatorYour next question comes from Christine Peng with UBS. Please go ahead.

Christine Peng --

 UBS -- Analyst Thank you, management, for taking my question. So, my question is on the product side. So, I supported a very interesting new product, which Joey mentioned, which is the beef burger. So, I noticed that this product has been on the menu since May of 2021, which means that this is likely to be a long-standing product instead of LTO. So, if that is the case, Joey, can you share with the distinction behind this product in terms of the rationale, the supply chain management, and also future plan. for this product going forward. Because what I'm interested to understand is that will this be a burger potentially become a very important category for KFC going forward. And what's going to be the structural impact on KFC in terms of competition, in terms of margin trends, etc. So, anything you can share with us, that will be very much appreciated. Thank you.

Joey Wat -- Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Christine. Well, it's already a very important product in KFC portfolio. The speed and the support from the customer exceeds our expectation. To quantify the sales of beef burger, I mean, we talk about it already. They already contribute meaningful sales mix to our business. It's about 3% to 4% of KFC sales mix, but that is a lot already because for original recipe after all these years, it's about 6%, 7%. So, it's half of our original recipe chicken sales already. So, that's the number side. In terms of product side, for those who are in China, if you have a chance to try, I do strongly encourage you try it, then you can form the opinion yourself about the future of this product. I know it's rather unusual for a company selling chicken to sell beef burger, but once you try it, you will understand why. We have good range of product choice there from entry-price burger, which pays amazing, to beef burger all the way to what will the Angus beef burger. You know, as Andy mentioned, it's hard to imagine. But it says amazing. What we did, you can't write what will be focused. And the price is still very good value. I want to say it's low price. I mean, it's the fantastic value. So, the choice of product is fantastic. Third is the flavor, the taste. There are plenty of customer – customer-made video comparing our burger versus other competitors. One thing very distinct about our beef burger is the burger is it's very juicy, and this is our focus. Because while some traditional beef burger lover might love the barbecue flavor, for Chinese taste, they prefer the juicy burgers. And that has been our focus. And we are uniquely positioned to do that because we have very high-quality ovens in our kitchen each of our KFC kitchen to produce the beef burger. So, the burger patty is cooked in an oven, not on grill. So, I hope that gives you some flavor of this amazing product that I love myself.

Andy Yeung -- Chief Financial Officer Joey, let me add a little bit here because I'm self-proclaimed No. 1 fan of KFC often.

 And like -- but still sometimes I do need variety beside chicken, right,

 and rice -- so I think the beer is fantastic. The before we have one local program, but now we have a range of further that pre-border that can appeal to different pricing points.

 I myself increase my frequency go and give a store because I now have -- like when I want to be, I have fantastic choice for the KFC beef burger program. So, from a customer standpoint, I think it's fantastic because greater right you mentioned great variety, different proteins, different choices. And so, I love it anyway. Thank you.OperatorYour next question comes from Veronica Song with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.

Veronica Song --

 Credit Suisse -- Analyst Thank you, management, for taking my question, and congratulations on a very strong set of results. I have a question regarding the cost business. So, as Joey mentioned, we're going to wind down the COFFii & Joy business and focus more on the K-Coffee and Lavazza. So, could you share more color on the current situation or achievement of Lavazza, especially in terms of store expansion, and any color on store economics? So how can we adopt the valuable experience we learned from COFFii & Joy and KFC to drive Lavazza's success? Thank you.

Andy Yeung -- Chief Financial Officer OK. So, I think first of all, I think it's a repeated quickly, which is we wind down the C&J business so that we can focus more our resources the cab resources on abate and give, obviously, the team more focus, more laser-focused on the market. And as you mentioned, currently, our coffee strategy have two key brands. One is take coffee, which is served the value and convenience segments. And for Lavazza, refocusing on offer authentic wonderful Italian coffee and experience. So, from obviously, C&J with the homegrown brand over the past four years, we'll learn a lot. And this is one thing that we have keep saying, we have held respect when we enter into a new business segment. Comp business is very different, obviously, from fried chicken and Pizza Hut business. So, there's learning there and how to give our product, coffee, water, milk, the whole process to make good coffee in selection, obviously, is also very critical. And then obviously, for coffee too, the store format, I think trying to figure out what the right format at different trade and economics and whatnot. And then also in terms of the Chinese customer, coffee is still a volatile new market segment. A lot of Chinese consumer are still very new to coffee to take a coffee and what their presence are also make time for us to develop and learn and apply to our product development. So, a lot of this learning, I think, a wonderful learning that we did with C&J would help us to obviously apply to rebase and flow out and expand its business. And for Lavazza, continue to recover from, obviously, from a franchise time because a lot of store in Shanghai early part of this year. And we see recently, a business has rebounded. I think in terms of the product, the team they continue to be on the right track. I think we don'

t -- I don't think we can say like we're there yet, but building a new brand, a new business is going to take time,

 but they have done a great job in terms of putting the wide -- organizing the right team,

 putting the -- continue to innovate in the product. You've seen a lot of new product innovations, right, where the [Inaudible]

 make and train -- we also see the [Inaudible] latte, and all that have been wonderful success with the consumer. That sort like offer that Italian experience, but also favorite that here to a Chinese consumer. And then we'll continue to do more, I think, like in terms of training and innovation. Software is the same thing. You see that they continue to experiment and roll out. And overall, you see the unit economics improve. But I think for them to reach obviously, the consumer awareness, the sales level, and also the profitability I think people have to be a little bit more patient on that. They have quite a bit of thought this year, almost double, right on now, we have 78 stores, and we continue to open more stores. And then we also continue to develop its capability. They continue to develop its digital and do very capability. So, if you look at sales mix now, you can see that the membership program and also the go volume continue to increase delivery now almost like 40% of the sales mix now. So, that's a great improvement, especially given the challenging environment with COVID. In terms of store development, as I mentioned, like to improvement, increased from a year ago to 78 stores.

 There will be more and --

 but you should not -- felt like COVID obviously will have some impact. I think last year, we mentioned 1,000 stores and we're very much committed to that. But obviously, the timing of that is going to be depending on some market conditions, especially with COVID. As we mentioned, we have a very systematic and disciplined approach even with the new coffee brand in Lavazza. But I think we're pretty confident as the economics improve, you will see more store open. So, that's the update on Lavazza.OperatorThere are no further questions at this time.
