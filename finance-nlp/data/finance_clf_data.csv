In June 2016 the FASB issued ASU 2016 13 Financial Instruments Credit Losses Topic 326 referred to herein as ASU 2016 13 which significantly changes how entities will account for credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments that are not measured at fair value through net income ASU 2016 13 replaces the existing incurred loss model with an expected credit loss model that requires entities to estimate an expected lifetime credit loss on most financial assets and certain other instruments Under ASU 2016 13 credit impairment is recognized as an allowance for credit losses rather than as a direct write down of the amortized cost basis of a financial asset The impairment allowance is a valuation account deducted from the amortized cost basis of financial assets to present the net amount expected to be collected on the financial asset Once the new pronouncement is adopted by the Company the allowance for credit losses must be adjusted for management s current estimate at each reporting date The new guidance provides no threshold for recognition of impairment allowance Therefore entities must also measure expected credit losses on assets that have a low risk of loss For instance trade receivables that are either current or not yet due may not require an allowance reserve under currently generally accepted accounting principles but under the new standard the Company will have to estimate an allowance for expected credit losses on trade receivables under ASU 2016 13 ASU 2016 13 is effective for annual periods including interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15 2022 for smaller reporting companies Early adoption is permitted The Company is currently assessing the impact ASU 2016 13 will have on its consolidated financial statements

 Pursuant to ASC Subtopic 470 20 issuers of certain convertible debt instruments such as the Notes that have a net settlement feature and may be settled wholly or partially in cash upon conversion are required to separately account for the liability debt and equity conversion option components of the instrument The carrying amount of the liability component of the instrument is computed by estimating the fair value of a similar liability without the conversion option using a market based approach The amount of the equity component is then calculated by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the principal amount of the instrument The difference between the principal amount and the liability component represents a debt discount that is amortized to interest expense over the respective term of the Notes using the effective interest rate method The equity component is not remeasured as long as it continues to meet the conditions for equity classification In accounting for the issuance costs related to the Notes the allocation of issuance costs incurred between the liability and equity components was based on their relative values

"Risks Related to Intellectual Property and Technology Licensing
Claims by others that we infringe their proprietary technology or other rights could harm our business 
Technology companies frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights In addition patent holding companies seek to monetize patents they have purchased or otherwise obtained As we face increasing competition and gain an increasingly higher profile the possibility of intellectual property rights claims against us grows From time to time third parties have asserted and we expect that third parties will continue to assert claims of infringement of intellectual property rights against us For example on December 29 2017 we executed Confidential Patent License Agreements with Finjan Holdings Inc Finjan whereby we resolved all pending litigation matters Under the terms of the settlement agreement we paid Finjan a one time net cash settlement amount of 12 5 million in December 2017 in exchange for the resolution and settlement of all claims between FireEye and Finjan and for cross licenses between the companies of certain issued patents and patent applications Other security companies have paid amounts to the same plaintiff to license some of the patents asserted against us Third parties may in the future also assert claims against our customers or channel partners whom our standard license and other agreements obligate us to indemnify against claims that our products infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties Many of our competitors and others may now and in the future have significantly larger and more mature patent portfolios than we have In addition future litigation may involve patent holding companies or other patent owners who have no relevant product offerings or revenue and against whom our own patents may therefore provide little or no deterrence or protection Any claim of intellectual property infringement by a third party even a claim without merit could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against such claim could distract our management from our business and could require us to cease use of such intellectual property Furthermore because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by the discovery process

We account for stock based compensation by applying a fair value based measurement method to account for stock based payment transactions with employees non employees and directors We record compensation costs associated with the vesting of unvested options on a straight line basis over the vesting period Stock based compensation is a non cash expense because we settle these obligations by issuing shares of our common stock instead of settling such obligations with cash payments We use the Black Scholes model to estimate the fair value of each option grant on the date of grant This model requires the use of estimates for expected term of the options and expected volatility of the price of our common stock We recognize forfeitures as they occur rather than estimating them at the time of the grant

Sales to enterprise customers typically involve higher customer acquisition costs and longer sales cycles The historical sales cycle and conversion rate trends associated with our existing mid market customers may not apply to larger enterprise businesses for whom purchasing decisions may require the approval of more technical personnel and management levels In addition larger customers may demand more integration services and customization and our standard pricing model may be less attractive to certain customers with very high volumes of transactions As a result sales opportunities to larger businesses may require us to devote greater research and development sales support and professional services resources to individual prospective customers resulting in increased acquisition costs and strains on our limited resources Moreover these larger transactions may require us to delay recognizing the associated revenue we derive from these prospective customers until all revenue requirements have been met

 d Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures and Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Our management including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud A control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met Further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake Additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate Due to inherent limitations in a cost effective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected

As described in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements on October 1 2020 the Company completed the acquisition of Rundeck Inc which was accounted for as a business combination for consideration of 95 5 million 
Auditing the Company s accounting for the acquisition was complex 
due to the significant estimation uncertainty in determining the fair value of the identified intangible asset related to customer relationships of 21 8 million The significant estimation uncertainty was primarily due to the sensitivity of the respective fair value to underlying assumptions about the future performance of the acquired business and because there is relatively limited historical data on which to base those assumptions The significant assumptions used to estimate the value of the intangible asset included revenue growth rates which are forward looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions

As we continue to expand internationally we will become more exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates A portion of our operating expenses are incurred outside of the United States and denominated in foreign currencies The strengthening of the U S dollar relative to foreign currencies increases the real cost of our platform for our customers outside of the United States which could lead to the lengthening of our sales cycle or reduced demand for our platform As we continue our international expansion increased international sales may result in foreign currency denominated sales increasing our foreign currency risk Moreover this continued expansion will increase operating expenses incurred outside the United States and denominated in foreign currencies If we are not able to successfully hedge against the risks associated with currency fluctuations our financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected To date we have not entered into any hedging transactions in an effort to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk While we may decide to enter into hedging transactions in the future the availability and effectiveness of these hedging transactions may be limited and we may not be able to successfully hedge our exposure which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations
