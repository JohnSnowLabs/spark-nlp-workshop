As of December 31 2020 the fair value estimates for intangible assets and goodwill are labeled provisional as the valuation
reports have not been finalized as of December 31 2020 We identified the estimation of the fair value of the assets acquired
and liabilities assumed in the acquisition of Solofire as a critical audit matter 
 
The
principal considerations for our determination that the estimation of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed
in the acquisition of Solofire was a critical audit matter are that there was a high estimation uncertainty due to significant
judgements with respect to the selection of the valuation methodologies applied by the third party valuation firm the assumptions
used to estimate the future revenues and cash flows including revenue growth rates royalty rates attrition rates forecasted
costs weighted average costs of capital and future market conditions in the determination of the fair value of the intangible
assets acquired In addition the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge 
 
Our
audit procedures responsive to the estimation of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition

F 4
maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements

The critical audit matter communicated below is a
matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to
the audit committee and that 1 relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and 2 involved
our especially challenging subjective or complex judgments The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in
any way our opinion on the financial statements taken as a whole and we are not by communicating the critical audit matter below 
providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matters or on the account or disclosure to which it relates 
 
We identified the assessment of capitalized
 technology costs incurred on software development projects as a critical audit matter Specifically assessing if the costs incurred
 on the software development project have met the capitalization criteria required a higher degree of auditor judgment This included
 applying procedures to determine that the costs related to a project that had entered the application development stage resulted
 in additional functionality and for which it was probable that the project would be completed and used to perform the function
 intended Evaluating these criteria required the assessment of the technical aspects of each individual project to which the capitalized
 costs are related

an acquisition may negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition because it may require us to incur charges or assume substantial debt or other liabilities may cause adverse tax consequences or unfavorable accounting treatment may expose us to claims and disputes by third parties including intellectual property claims and disputes or may not generate sufficient financial return to offset additional costs and expenses related to the acquisition 
 
we may encounter difficulties or unforeseen expenditures in integrating the business technologies products personnel or operations of any company that we acquire particularly if key personnel of the acquired company decide not to work for us 
 
an acquisition may disrupt our ongoing business divert resources increase our expenses or distract our management 
 
an acquisition may result in a delay or reduction of customer purchases for both us and the company we acquired due to customer uncertainty about continuity and effectiveness of service from either company

Through a Mexican subsidiary company, they also own the Cerro San Pedro gold-silver mine in San Luis Potosí, Mexico, which ceased operation in 2017. While New Gold was founded in 1980 for the purposes of mineral exploration, the company became a mine operator with its merger of Peak Gold and Metallica Resources in 2008. A fourth company, Western Goldfields, joined in 2009. Together they operated the Peak mine in Australia and Mesquite Mine in California but sold both in 2018.

Operating mines As of 2020, New Gold operates two mines:New Afton - The New Afton gold-silver-copper mine is an underground (block cave) mine located within the footprint of the Afton mine, 10 km west of Kamloops, British Columbia, Canada. That original Afton mine was an open pit mine that was operated by Teck Corporation (later Teck Cominco) between 1977 and 1997. In targeting a specific mineral deposit, New Gold constructed underground tunnels, along with a new concentrator and tailings facility. They achieved commercial production in July 2012 at which time the mine had an expected 12 year life.

Business Combinations
We use all available information to estimate fair values We typically engage outside appraisal firms to assist in the fair value determination of identifiable assets such as customer contracts and any other significant assets or liabilities and contingent consideration We adjust the preliminary purchase price allocation as necessary up to one year after the acquisition closing date if we obtain more information regarding asset valuation and liabilities assumed 
Our purchase price allocation methodology contains uncertainties because it requires assumptions and management s judgment to estimate the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date Management estimates the fair value of assets and liabilities based upon quoted market prices the carrying value of the acquired assets and widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flows and market multiple analyses Our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement Unanticipated events or circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy of our fair value estimates including assumptions regarding industry economic factors and business strategies

"Eckerö Line is a Finnish shipping company owned by the Åland-based Rederiaktiebolaget Eckerö.  Eckerö Line operates one ferry between Helsinki (Finland) and Tallinn (Estonia). Eckerö Line should not be confused with the similarly named Eckerö Linjen, also owned by Rederiaktiebolaget Eckerö, which operates ferry services between Berghamn in the Åland Islands and Grisslehamn in Sweden. History In 1992 Rederiaktiebolaget Eckerö and Birka Line founded a jointly-owned subsidiary Eestin Linjat to operate MS Alandia on the fast-growing route between Helsinki and Tallinn. The name of the company was reportedly selected for practical reasons as it required the change of only a few letters to re-paint Eckerölinjen into Eestin Linjat (or vice versa). Similarly the livery of Eestin Linjat was very similar to that of Eckerö Linjen. However, due to the use of the word Eesti (Estonian for ""Estonia"") instead of the Finnish word Viro, the Finnish public presumed the new company was an Estonian one. This was made worse after the Estonia-disaster in 1994 when many people in Finland began associating Eestin Linjat with EstLine, owners of the ill-fated MS Estonia. As a result of this Eestin Linjat changed its name into Eckerö Line in 1995 (with the livery of the ships made identical to those of Eckerö Linjen). At the same time a second ship, MS Apollo (a sister ship the Alandia and Eckerö Linjen's Roslagen) was added to the route.In 1998 Eckerö Line acquired its first (and only) genuine cruiseferry, MS Nordlandia which replaced both of the previous ships sailing on the route.",other

Net Benefit Eligible Lives
Part of our growth strategy is to expand our customer base This includes driving revenue growth from adding lives to our platform and driving incremental transaction revenue We believe the number of net benefit eligible lives is a key indicator of our market penetration growth and future revenue opportunity We believe net benefit eligible lives is the foundation of our platform revenue opportunity We define a net benefit eligible life as a person with access to a benefits enrollment subscription under standard contracting or a freelancer with access to benefits enrollment plus their estimated dependents as of the measurement date This definition excludes lives from other subscription related contracts 
We expect the number net benefit eligible lives will decrease during 2021 We expect that some health plan customers will renew their agreements in 2021 at lower minimum counts as the result of higher unemployment rates decreasing the number covered employees Additionally we expect the number of net benefit eligible lives to be negatively impacted by the termination of a contract with an entity with a substantial number of freelancers

Software Services Revenue Retention Rate 
We believe that our ability to retain our customers and expand the revenue they generate for us over time is an important component of our growth strategy and reflects the long term value of our customer relationships We measure our performance on this basis using a metric we refer to as our software services revenue retention rate We calculate this metric for a particular period by establishing the group of our customers that had active contracts for a given period We then calculate our software services revenue retention rate by taking the amount of software services revenue we recognized for this group in the subsequent comparable period for which we are reporting the rate and dividing it by the software services revenue we recognized for the group in the prior period

Our software services revenue retention rate was greater than 90 for year ended December 31 2020 compared to being greater than 95 for the years ended December 31 2019 and 2018 The reduction in the rate was primarily the result of the impact on 2020 revenue from the renegotiation of a customer contract Excluding this cu",other

In 2020 we determined that certain performance targets for this acquisition would not be met As a result we reduced the contingent consideration liability plus accrued interest associated with this acquisition by 3 105 and recorded this as a reduction to general and administration expenses Future changes to the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration if any will be recognized in our earnings

"Odwalla Inc. () was an American food product company selling fruit juices, smoothies and food bars founded in Santa Cruz, California in 1980 and from 1995–2020 was headquartered in Half Moon Bay, California. Odwalla's products included juices, smoothies, soy milk, bottled water, organic beverages, and several types of energy bars, known as ""food bars"".The company experienced strong growth after its incorporation in 1985, expanding its distribution network from California to most of North America, and went public in 1993. A period of decline occurred as the result of a fatal outbreak of E. coli O157:H7 in 1996 that was caused by using bruised fruit that had been contaminated. Odwalla originally sold unpasteurized juices, claiming that the process of pasteurization altered the flavor of the juice. Following the E. coli outbreak and the death of at least one child, Odwalla adopted flash pasteurization and other sanitization procedures. Odwalla recalled its juices and experienced a 90% reduction in sales following the event. The company gradually recovered and, the following year, became profitable again.In 2001, Odwalla was acquired by The Coca-Cola Company for US$181 million and became a wholly owned subsidiary.",other
