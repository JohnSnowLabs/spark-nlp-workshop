"which requires the assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be recorded
at fair value as of the transaction date for which the Company utilized a valuation report from a third party valuation firm 
As of December 31 2020 the fair value estimates for intangible assets and goodwill are labeled provisional as the valuation
reports have not been finalized as of December 31 2020 We identified the estimation of the fair value of the assets acquired
and liabilities assumed in the acquisition of Solofire as a critical audit matter 
 
The
principal considerations for our determination that the estimation of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed
in the acquisition of Solofire was a critical audit matter are that there was a high estimation uncertainty due to significant
judgements with respect to the selection of the valuation methodologies applied by the third party valuation firm the assumptions
used to estimate the future revenues and cash flows including revenue growth rates royalty rates attrition rates forecasted
costs weighted average costs of capital and future market conditions in the determination of the fair value of the intangible
assets acquired In addition the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge 
 
Our
audit procedures responsive to the estimation of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition
of Solofire included the following procedures among others

The critical audit matter communicated below is a
matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to
the audit committee and that 1 relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and 2 involved
our especially challenging subjective or complex judgments The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in
any way our opinion on the financial statements taken as a whole and we are not by communicating the critical audit matter below 
providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matters or on the account or disclosure to which it relates 
 
We identified the assessment of capitalized
 technology costs incurred on software development projects as a critical audit matter Specifically assessing if the costs incurred
 on the software development project have met the capitalization criteria required a higher degree of auditor judgment This included
 applying procedures to determine that the costs related to a project that had entered the application development stage resulted
 in additional functionality and for which it was probable that the project would be completed and used to perform the function
 intended Evaluating these criteria required the assessment of the technical aspects of each individual project to which the capitalized
 costs are related

We define customers with annualized subscription revenue above 100 000 as the total number of customers that contributed subscription revenues in excess of 25 000 during the relevant fiscal quarter which corresponds to 100 000 on an annualized basis For purposes of this metric we generally define a customer as a separate and distinct entity such as a company or an educational or government institution a distinct business unit of a large corporation or a partner organization in each case that has an active contract with us to access our services Most of the subscription revenue we recognize each quarter is attributable to customers that accounted for more than 25 000 of that revenue during the quarter and our sales and marketing strategy focuses heavily on the acquisition of customers that have the potential to contribute at least 100 000 in subscription revenues annually Accordingly we believe that this metric is a useful tool to aid investors in understanding a key factor that drives changes in our subscription revenues from period to period and in assessing trends in our growth penetration of our core customer market and our overall performance Because the dollar threshold is tied to the actual revenue recognized during a particular quarter customers that we acquired midway through or at the end of the quarter may not yet be included in this count even if they have placed orders representing more than 100 000 in annual subscription revenue ",other

an acquisition may disrupt our ongoing business divert resources increase our expenses or distract our management

Our success will depend in part on our ability to manage this growth effectively while retaining personnel To manage the expected growth of our operations and personnel we will need to continue to improve our operational financial and management controls and our reporting systems and procedures Failure to effectively manage growth could result in difficulty or delays in adding new clients declines in quality or client satisfaction increases in costs system failures difficulties in introducing new features or solutions the need for more capital than we anticipate or other operational difficulties and any of these difficulties could harm our business performance and results of operations 
The expected addition of new employees and the capital investments that we anticipate will be necessary to help us grow and to manage that growth will make it more difficult for us to generate earnings or offset any future revenue shortfalls by reducing costs and expenses in the short term If we fail to manage our anticipated growth we will be unable to execute our business plan successfully

"Eckerö Line is a Finnish shipping company owned by the Åland-based Rederiaktiebolaget Eckerö.  Eckerö Line operates one ferry between Helsinki (Finland) and Tallinn (Estonia). Eckerö Line should not be confused with the similarly named Eckerö Linjen, also owned by Rederiaktiebolaget Eckerö, which operates ferry services between Berghamn in the Åland Islands and Grisslehamn in Sweden. History In 1992 Rederiaktiebolaget Eckerö and Birka Line founded a jointly-owned subsidiary Eestin Linjat to operate MS Alandia on the fast-growing route between Helsinki and Tallinn. The name of the company was reportedly selected for practical reasons as it required the change of only a few letters to re-paint Eckerölinjen into Eestin Linjat (or vice versa). Similarly the livery of Eestin Linjat was very similar to that of Eckerö Linjen. However, due to the use of the word Eesti (Estonian for ""Estonia"") instead of the Finnish word Viro, the Finnish public presumed the new company was an Estonian one. This was made worse after the Estonia-disaster in 1994 when many people in Finland began associating Eestin Linjat with EstLine, owners of the ill-fated MS Estonia. As a result of this Eestin Linjat changed its name into Eckerö Line in 1995 (with the livery of the ships made identical to those of Eckerö Linjen). At the same time a second ship, MS Apollo (a sister ship the Alandia and Eckerö Linjen's Roslagen) was added to the route.In 1998 Eckerö Line acquired its first (and only) genuine cruiseferry, MS Nordlandia which replaced both of the previous ships sailing on the route.",other

We expect the number net benefit eligible lives will decrease during 2021 We expect that some health plan customers will renew their agreements in 2021 at lower minimum counts as the result of higher unemployment rates decreasing the number covered employees Additionally we expect the number of net benefit eligible lives to be negatively impacted by the termination of a contract with an entity with a substantial number of freelancers

"Odwalla Inc. () was an American food product company selling fruit juices, smoothies and food bars founded in Santa Cruz, California in 1980 and from 1995–2020 was headquartered in Half Moon Bay, California. Odwalla's products included juices, smoothies, soy milk, bottled water, organic beverages, and several types of energy bars, known as ""food bars"".The company experienced strong growth after its incorporation in 1985, expanding its distribution network from California to most of North America, and went public in 1993. A period of decline occurred as the result of a fatal outbreak of E. coli O157:H7 in 1996 that was caused by using bruised fruit that had been contaminated. Odwalla originally sold unpasteurized juices, claiming that the process of pasteurization altered the flavor of the juice. Following the E. coli outbreak and the death of at least one child, Odwalla adopted flash pasteurization and other sanitization procedures. Odwalla recalled its juices and experienced a 90% reduction in sales following the event. The company gradually recovered and, the following year, became profitable again.In 2001, Odwalla was acquired by The Coca-Cola Company for US$181 million and became a wholly owned subsidiary.",other

Franchise acquisitions 
 In 2021 and 2020 we acquired 20 and 8 franchise restaurants respectively In 2019 we did not acquire any franchise restaurants Of the 20 restaurants acquired in 2021 we took over 16 restaurants as a result of an agreement with an underperforming franchisee who was in violation of franchise and lease agreements with the Company Under this agreement the franchisee voluntarily agreed to turn over the restaurants The acquisition of the additional 4 restaurants in 2021 was the result of exercising our right of first refusal 
We account for the acquisition of franchised restaurants using the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations The purchase price allocations were based on fair value estimates determined using significant unobservable inputs Level 3 The goodwill recorded primarily relates to the sales growth potential of the market acquired and is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes
