"I called Huntington Bank to close my account, and they refused to close my account over the phone. They told me I HAD to go into a branch to close it. I do not want the account anymore, and it has a monthly fee. I can not make it to a branch during business hours, which I told the lady on the phone, but she refused to make an exception. I asked several more times to no avail. It seems very unethical to me that they are making it so difficult to close my account with them. I don't even know how I will do it.",Accounts
I opened an citi account since day 1 i started having problems. I wired transfered all my money to my other account and closed my account. I asked the representative if my wire transfer will be affected from closure they said no so i went thru closing. Out of 2 wire transfer one didnt go thru. I called at least 6 times and customer service either putting me on hold or giving me another number to call. My 13 k is lost and now my account is closed. Ill call again in the morning but i know nothing will be resolved. I regret to even come close to citi bank. I want my money,Accounts

"I noticed an article today about Bank of Omaha, and their illegal credit card practices. I am so glad you nailed these guys. They basically ruined my life when they added me to my wife 's credit card account. When the strain of the fees and charges broke her, it took me down as well, causing us both to lose our house, bankruptcy, and nearly our marriage. This was about 7 years ago or so. Any discomfort you cause them, know they deserve all of it, and probably a lot more.",Debt Collection

The account was taken off the report and then has reappeared on my consumer credit report hurting me further in these uncertain times. this negative report is stopping me from having a actual relationship with this bank if i choose and stagnating my report.,Debt Collection
I was contacted via postal mail to apply for an installment loan. I was approved for a loan of {$500.00}.

I've already paid 7 payments but according to them I still owe over {$400.00} and when I went to see the payment history only tiny payments are going toward the principal and larger payments towards finance fees ( It looks ridiculous ) i took a screenshot to provide you for evidence,Loans
"My husband recently became very ill and was hospitalized until death. During this time, our family members took over control of our finances and misappropriated our funds in our bank accounts.

"PayPal holds funds for items sold using their services. PayPal is not the seller, but they receive the benefit of the funds in their possession for items sold long after the items are delivered to the buyer when they should be in the hands of the seller. They refuse to relinquish the funds claiming you need to prove that you are a good seller to be removed from the program which assumes guilt or criminal intent. I was told I would be removed from the program after a phone call, but now they refuse and can not find record of such a promise.",Money Transfers
We have requested Covid 19 help and got approval from Carrington mortgage. Just to find out that the company is doing nothing for us. They have posted bad credit for us also. This is wrong!!! Carrington does not follow financial legal practices. We have called in many times for help. Carrington always says they will help with given current pandemic and has damaged our credit. Congress is funding them and they are not helping people. We have sent in all requested information multiple times with no help!!! Carrington seems to misplace a lot of documents just to request them again.,Mortgage
