Welcome to the Aon plc's third quarter 2022 conference call. [Operator instructions] I would also like to remind all parties of this call is being recorded. If anyone has an objection, you may disconnect your line at this time. It is important to note that some of the comments in today's call may constitute certain statements that are forward-looking in nature as defined by the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated. Information concerning risk factors that could cause such differences are described in the press release covering our third quarter 2022 results as well as having been posted on our website. Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg Case, CEO of Aon plc."
"Greg Case -- Chief Executive Officer   Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter conference call. I'm joined by Christa Davies, our CFO, and Eric Andersen, our president. As in previous quarters, we posted a detailed financial presentation on our website. We begin by thanking our Aon colleagues for delivering another strong quarter of top and bottom line growth. Our recently concluded all colleague engagement survey reinforces the resilience and commitment of our team as we continue to receive and benefit from exceptional colleague feedback with overall engagement, ways of working and brand strength all at 80% or greater. More than ever, colleagues understand the power of our Aon United strategy and have embraced the smart working approach we develop to preserve flexibility in how and where we work, while enabling them to be better connected and more capable of helping clients make better decisions to support their businesses. The importance of the support and the exceptional nature of our response is illustrated by our recently released executive risk survey and the tremendous leadership of our team on Hurricane Ian.Taken together, these two data points reinforce the relevance and return on our Aon United strategy. First, our 2022 executive risk survey, which surveyed 800 C-suite executives from global companies, underscores the volatility facing living organizations and offers a window into their mindset and needs. A majority survey, 79%, the increased volatility on the horizon, but only a third, just 35% feel fully prepared to manage the impact of that volatility. Most important, those that feel very prepared share three fundamental leadership attributes that reinforce the relevance of our capabilities. First, they see embracing risk as a source of potential competitive advantage. 62% of very prepared leaders agree that their company's appetite for risk has increased in response to the current economic conditions. Second, we're willing to invest in new approaches to address emerging risks. These leaders focus on long-tail risks and call out concerns around disruptive categories like cyber and supply chain."
"  And third, they value expert insight and are looking for partners to help them make better business decisions. Prepared leaders are nearly twice as likely to look to counsel from an external advisor that can provide a more holistic enterprise perspective on decisions to protect and grow their businesses. And all these survey findings reinforce the relevance of our strategy, Hurricane Ian highlighted an excellent example of that value in action. To begin, we want to extend our deepest sympathies to those impacted by this event. In these times of challenge, as communities endure the tragic loss of life and tremendous damage, we believe that our actions as a firm to help businesses and communities respond and recover. As always, our team took a holistic Aon United view toward serving our clients before, during, and after the event. Pre-event, we used our resource development models to ensure that our 1,800 commercial risk claims colleagues around the world were prepared to respond to a surge in client need. This was a collaborative global effort possible only because of our mindset and single P&L approach. In addition, we are able to use impact forecasting models from our reinsurance team to game out potential hurricane pads and share those insights with our commercial risk colleagues so they could alert clients to potential exposures, allowing for early activation of business continuity plans. During the event, we provided real-time insight on actual harm by leveraging satellite and drone imagery provided through technology partnerships enabled by our Aon Business Services team. This is another example of how our emphasis on technology-driven innovation is reshaping client service at scale. Post event, we obviously focused on accelerating claims resolution while we're also stepping back with clients and taking an enterprise view of what the hurricane means for the benefit plan, leveraging our health solutions team and beginning new conversations around how they think about return to work, exploring how our human capital solutions colleagues can apply learnings from our own smart working strategy to their workforce management. This is Aon United in action and only possible because of the decade-plus investment we've made to break down barriers across our business and build Aon Business Services into an engine that provides us the insights and scale necessary to meet client needs. Turning to performance. In the third quarter, our colleagues delivered excellent results demonstrating continued momentum and year-to-date progress against our key financial metrics. For Q3, organic revenue growth was 5% on top of 12% in the prior year quarter, adjusted operating margin was up 100 basis points and adjusted EPS was up 16%."
"  These results are consistent with our full year ongoing financial guidance, and we would note that Q3 is our seasonally smallest quarter for revenue. Year-to-date, we delivered 7% organic revenue growth, adjusted operating margin expansion of 80 basis points, adjusted EPS growth of 14% and generated over $2 billion of free cash flow. Turning to Solution Lines. Finical risk delivered 5% organic revenue growth this quarter on top of 13% in the prior year quarter, contributed 7% organic revenue growth year-t"
" Christa Davies -- Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President of Global Finance Thanks so much, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As Greg highlighted, we delivered continued progress on our key financial metrics for both the quarter and year to date. Through the first nine months of the year, we translated 7% organic revenue growth into 80 basis points of adjusted margin expansion and 14% growth in adjusted earnings per share and generated over $2 billion in free cash flow. We look forward to buil"
"Jimmy Bhullar --  JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst So first, I just had a question on the commercial risk business. Your organic growth slowed sequentially. Obviously, comps were more difficult as well. But you mentioned that Asia, Latin America and U.K. grew at a pretty strong pace and there is a slowdown in U.S. retail business because of lower transaction volumes. Can you sort of elaborate on that and what you're seeing in the U.S. business? Greg Case -- Chief Executive Officer Yes, Jimmy, thanks for the question. Listen, as we've highlighted again on commercial specifically, but it really plays off of the firm overall, 7% organic year to date, 11% year to date last year and then 13% in the quarter as you highlight and really just strong across the board, across all geographies and real strength in core P&C and affinity and we really would to highlight that. The only thing we highlighted that was a little different was obviously, the M&A transaction levels last year were extraordinary, and our capability there is just exceptional. And Eric, maybe you can talk a little bit about that. And that'"
"s really what -- it's not going to repeat this year, but overall, very, very strong momentum as we finish the year this year and move into next year. But Eric, any thoughts on that? Eric Andersen -- President Sure, Greg. And a great question. I would say from an overall perspective, commercial risk in the U.S. is very solid. New business numbers, very solid retention and rollover numbers, Greg, as you mentioned in your prepared remarks. And I would just say, look, on transaction services, we are serving the private equity industry and the corporate industry as they make acquisitions and divestitures. And so during a period like this where it's a little bit slower, we are spending time with the markets, with the reinsurance markets, with the clients, building out our strategy for when it ultimately comes back and feel like the team that we have today is fantastic, but they're also working very hard with their clients, making sure we've got the next generation of product ready when the economic environment changes."
"Jimmy Bhullar --  JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst OK. And I think you mentioned modestly positive benefit from pricing the last few quarters and this quarter as well. And if we think about the reinsurance business, there's obviously a lot of dislocation there. Can you talk about how do you expect that to affect your results? And should there be a greater tailwind from pricing at least on the reinsurance side? Greg Case -- Chief Executive Officer Maybe I'll start the overall and Eric just to pick up on the reinsurance front in particular. Overall, Jimmy, as you highlighted, we look at market impact. That's how we think about it. Obviously, it includes insured values and price. We highlight modest impact sort of in the quarter and expect for the year. Over time, you can expect ensure value will begin to creep up. That will actually have a sustained lasting impact over time. And we'll see how the pricing piece changes out, but overall market impact kind of modest as we think about the impact of the year. The reinsurance dynamic is important and is involving, Eric, do you want to pick up on that?"
"Eric Andersen -- President Sure, Greg. And maybe just one comment on the just general pricing environment on the primary side. I think you laid it out right. But also, I think we've talked about this before, we spent a lot of time with our clients using data and analytics to kind of understand the choices they need to make, so while inflation and while pricing may be moving against them from this perspective, they don't sit still. They're looking at whether it's captive utilization, whether it's retentions, deductibles, limits, all those tools, and we try and help them think through what's best for them as they're navigating their sort of economic changes that they're facing in their business. So while the market is, as you said, Greg, there is effect of inflation and pricing, we're certainly working with them as the clients as they make those decisions. Certainly, on the reinsurance, I think it's worth just stepping back there is a lot going on right now on the reinsurance side. And our primary mission continues to be to help our insurance company clients match risk with capital. And remember, this is a global business like few in terms of where the capital is sourced from and how it's deployed and it shows it very differently in different parts of the world. And I think as we move away from Hurricane Ian, we start to get a little more clarity around what the ultimate losses look like and who's holding those losses. But if you step back and you think about it geographically, the European clients, I think, are expecting to have the supply of property cat that they need, albeit with a pricing and structure negotiation that takes into account the effects of inflation that's happening in Europe but also the losses that have happened in that region over the last three years, whether it's German floods, French Hail, etc., they've got certain dynamics that have affected the European marketplace. And I think for North America, the property cat market is going to be more challenging. Managing the effects of inflation, supply challenges,"
" some remaining uncertainty around Aon -- will create difficulties. But ultimately, we're focused on creating capital for them, capital options. So they can get the protection that they need going forward. I would also say, it also has an effect on facultative reinsurance and other tools that we have because as those insurers are forced to take higher retention, they certainly are going to continue to look to derisk. They just do it with different tools, right? They actually then will look at specific clients that they've got on their primary portfolio that they want help on, they'll use facultative instead of treaty. So while the market does shift, there are levers out there that we bring to bear for our clients that can actually help them derisk and get the protection that they need."
"Greg Case -- Chief Executive Officer And last thing I just want to highlight on this for you to leave this point. This is tremendous for us. I mean this is where we live. There is more activity going on with the set of capabilities that are unique in the world today. What our colleagues who built on the reinsurance side is extraordinary. And we've just added to it with data and analytics and all that we've done with our strategy and technology effort now added with Tyche that I mentioned before. So Eric described the market perfectly, but boy, this is our wheel house. We love it. It creates tremendous opportunity to support clients and we're bringing all the solutions to bear and in any respect, helping our clients and a challenging time for us, it's a great opportunity for the next 12 to 24 months.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo."
"Elyse Greenspan --  Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst My first question is on the margin side. So in the quarter, you guys saw 100 basis points of margin improvement. If I assume that all the fiduciary investment income fell to the bottom line, that could give you a tailwind of 90 basis points. So I'm just trying to get a sense of that 100, can you give us a sense of the split between how much of the margin improvement came from the pickup in fiduciary investment income versus core margin improvement and operating leverage? Christa Davies -- Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President of Global Finance Sure. Thanks for the question, Elyse. And look, what we would say is we think about this in terms of year to date. And year to date, we had a $35 million benefit from investment income. So it was about a 20 basis point impact on full year margins. And so it's not nearly as big as the numbers you highlighted, Elyse. And so for us, as we think about growing margin expansion for the full year, which we are completely committed to doing, it's really about continuing to drive organic revenue growth, the portfolio mix in higher revenue growth, higher-margin areas and the productivity benefits we're getting from Aon Business Services. And so we're fully on track to deliver full year margin expansion."
"Elyse Greenspan --  Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst As we think about rates continuing to rise, right, so that fiduciary investment income should go higher from here? So we're not just thinking Q4 but '23 as well. Do you think most of the benefits will fall to the bottom line? Or how do you balance flooding evolve versus looking to take some extra dollars to invest internally? Christa Davies -- Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President of Global Finance Yes. So first of all, Elyse, what I would say is we manage $6 billion of fiduciary investment income and every 100 basis points of increase is $60 million top line and bottom line. But Elyse we're doing a lot of work for clients to actually manage that. We're actually doing all the insurance accounting and transaction processing in the middle on paying premiums on the way in and then paying claims on the way out. Just one correction, Elyse, the impact of fiduciary investment income in the quarter is 70 basis points, not 90."
"Elyse Greenspan --  Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst OK. And then my last question was going back to the comment on transactions within commercial risk any but highlighted over transaction volume. Was the third quarter of last year heavier for that business? Or will we also potentially see that impact the growth there in the fourth quarter as well? Greg Case -- Chief Executive Officer Yes. Elyse, if we take a step back, again, I just emphasize literally look at the quarter overall for us sort of year to date, team has just done a tremendous job year to date, 7% overall, over 9% last year, really strength across the board. The M&A activity that we described and talked about was really Q3 and Q4 both levels of activity exceptionally strong. But it didn' t -- hasn't any in any way, shape or form, as Christa described, exactly where we are now as we think about mid-single digit or greater for the year, margin expansion and double-digit free cash flow growth. And I just would highlight Eric's points around the strength of our team. It's really extraordinary and what they've been able to do and how that's evolved over time. So they're exceptionally well positioned as market as the market comes back.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski with BMO Capital Markets. Mike Zaremski --  BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst Good morning. Happy Friday. Maybe thinking about free cash flow. Last year, as you guys helped us out with, there's clearly a good amount of noise. This year, are there any items that you feel you want to call out maybe on the working capital improvement side? You mentioned, Christa, the 4Q is usually a pretty strong quarter. So from looking at free cash flow this year as a percentage of revenues, for example, it's a very healthy level. I just want to make sure I'm not missing something. Christa Davies -- Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President of Global Finance Mike, I don't think you're missing anything. So free cash flow, $2.051 billion year to date, up 79%. Nothing particularly unusual. We did mention in Q1 and Q2 that we had lower levels of free cash flow because of higher incentive comp based on extraordinary performance in 2021. That's the only thing I would note. And then I would say, in general, we're going to continue to drive free cash flow growth double digits based on continued acceleration in revenue growth, margin expansion and then working capital improvements. You did see, if you look at the external receivables divided by revenue on the balance sheet, that DSO improved by two days from Q3 '21 to Q3 '22. It went from 91 days down to 89 days. And so we're very pleased with our continued progress in working capital."
"Mike Zaremski --  BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst And have you stated as the goal to get down well below 89 over time?  Or is that the main lever for the -- for working capital over the next few years? Christa Davies -- Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President of Global Finance Yes. So what we have said, Mike, is that we have essentially $500 million of excess receivables sitting on our balance sheet and that over time, we will continue to improve DSO to get that $500 million to 0. And so that is a big upside in free cash flow growth over the coming years. Mike Zaremski --  BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst OK. Great. That's helpful. And maybe switching gears. Curious if a cyber insurance, you guys are one of the leaders in the marketplace that clearly rates are up a lot, but clients are still buying just as much or more. And maybe you could comment on the cyber market, but I'd also be curious to hear about whether the intellectual property market, which I think you guys are one of the pioneers of is gaining any traction? Eric Andersen -- President Sure. This is Eric. And maybe I'll take a shot at it. So on the cyber market, we continue to see great growth in the business. And I would say what has changed, if anything, over the last several months is really the renewed focus on quality underwriting. And so if you remember at the very beginning of that product, it was all about risk management, risk identification, risk management, and then risk transfer. I think what happened to the market is they went immediately to risk transfer without enough focus on the quality of the risk mitigation and the risk management. As the market has reacted due to losses, they essentially went back to basics. And I think ultimately, the market will be healthier for it. So we continue to see great growth. We invest globally in our capability there and really like our position and the work that we're doing for clients. I would say an intellectual property, very similar. I couldn't be more excited about where we are with that, continue to see great deal flow, getting markets to join the product. We actually did our first IP reinsurance treaty this quarter, certainly not big dollars, but a real symbol on how we're bringing a broader market to bear on supporting that product has developed. So really excited about both of them and think we've got a great lead in the market with our capability, and we're going to continue to invest and push to develop those markets in a broader way."
"Greg Case -- Chief Executive Officer I do call out the IP progression has been, as Eric said, extraordinary to go back four years ago, we bringing 25, 30 colleagues in to sort of think about this. We're 200 strong now in this category. Now what it ever actually valued an IP stack essentially our patent stack, essentially it could actually be insured against a lot of loan borrower against it. Now we've done 15-plus deals. I think we talked about last quarter, we crossed $1 billion in lending on this front. And as Eric said, now we have multiple markets involved and even reinsurance at all. So this is a progression. It's still very, very early days. But man, the team has done a tremendous job sort of building out this opportunity.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of David Motemaden with Evercore ISI."
"David Motemaden --  Evercore ISI -- Analyst I just had a question on the Wealth business. Just on the AUM. The AUM based delegated investment management, that was cited as a headwind, could you give us an idea how much the AUM base was down and how we should think about that going forward as markets remain under pressure? Christa Davies -- Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President of Global Finance It was down, David. We didn't give the impact of it. But you're absolutely right, the way in which we earn fees in that delegated business is a percentage on AUM. And so it really depends on how the markets go as to how we see that progressing going forward. But I would say offsetting that decline on the investment management side was fantastic growth on the retirement side, as Greg and I talked about in our prepared remarks. We've got enormous growth dealing with regulatory change, particularly GMP in the U.K., fantastic work going on there by the team. And then as global assets rise, it's one of the best environments to do pension risk transfers that have happened in the last 15 years, and we are the global leader in this. We're very, very excited about our position in that space. And then as we mentioned on the call, our PEPS product in the U.S. is doing exceptionally well. And so where there are so many areas on the Retirement side where we have great opportunities for growth. But Eric, I mean, what else would you add here?"
"Eric Andersen -- President No, because I think you covered all of it. We're just really excited about watching the retirement business, in particular, really add great value to our clients. The U.K. certainly has some great activity going on there, in the U.S. as well. But that pet product, which is the pooled employer plan really is a great expense solution for our smaller clients as they look to manage the retirement assets. So you covered it well and really a solid quarter for them. David Motemaden --  E"
"Greg Case -- Chief Executive Officer Meyer, I know you've got another question, I don't come to that, but this really does, as Eric described, reimports the opportunity. When you can take a part of the market the way Eric just described and have the analytics to really do something about it, drive solutions on behalf of clients. This is what puts us in such a unique position against the rest of the world on this topic. So again, a lot going on out there, and we love it every day because it puts us in a very, very unique position."
"Meyer Shields -- Keefe,  Bruyette and Woods -- Analyst No. That's very helpful. I understand that. And then I guess a question for Christa, maybe. So you talked about how there's more pension risk transfer going on. You also mentioned how higher interest rates benefit Aon's pension funding. And I'm wondering, I understand that there's more willingness to take pension liabilities from people in the higher interest rate environment, but wouldn't there be less demand for transfer if interest rates are higher? Christa Davies -- Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President of Global Finance So there's always been capacity. The real challenge, Meyer is the economics have made it make sense to actually be able to buy out because we haven't been able to execute the transfers without being able to add the cash given to get to fully funded. And so the increase in interest rates is getting planned to fully funded, which means that they can actually do this transfer. So the capacity has always been there. It's more that the pension plans haven't been funded enough to be able to make this work. And I would say we're seeing more demand from this for buy-ins and buyouts from clients than we have in the last 10-plus years, and we have done substantial numbers of pension risk transfer in the U.S. and the U.K. and are very, very well positioned to do it. So it's a very exciting growth area for us.OperatorLadies and gentlemen, our final question this morning comes from the line of Josh Shanker with Bank of America."
"Josh Shanker --  Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Yes. Thank you for getting at the end here. You spoke in the prepared remarks about higher expenses from T&E resumption, both as a consultant and a protector of the risk of your clients as well as internally. Can you talk about the shape that's happening where we are relative to where we were two and a half years ago? And if we go into a recession, whether we're topping out here on T&E and whatnot? Christa Davies -- Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President of Global Finance Yes. Thanks for the question, Josh. So I would say T&E is obviously up from 2020 and 2021 levels. It's not that 2019 levels. Really because we're actually very thoughtful about how we do the work. And we've implemented smart working, which I know Greg talked about in relation to our engagement survey, it's one of the things that's driving employee engagement for the highest levels in our history. Because we're very thoughtful about where is the best place. And there are a number of areas and Eric, you might want to talk about them where we're doing work in different ways, and it has a higher impact on clients, Eric?"
"Eric Andersen -- President Yes, Christa, I think that's great. And I think it drives productivity of our colleagues. It drives engagement, as you said, really being able to use the technology that we've been investing in through our Aon Business Services model over a number of years. And just there' s one -- something that happened a week or two ago that just came to mind as you were talking, Christa. We do these insight series across the world with our clients. And normally, historically, would have flown everybody in from around the world, and this one happened to be in Australia. So it would have been a week off time for the team of basically off the grid as they went to present an hour slot for whatever topic they were asking for. And so on this one, in particular, we had our climate team, which is based in London, that's been working on building a climate strategy for us essentially. WebEx into the Insight Series meeting. Did the question and answer actually gave a great presentation. And then when they were finished, they were home, and they were back on to the next topic and continuing to work. So we were able to bring that capability without the big expense of travel and entertainment. We were able to deliver the capability and we gain the hours that we would have lost to the flights and the jet lag and everything else that we all know about in a way that drives more productivity. So that's just one example. There's many of them that follow the similar path. We just did a big renewal meeting, for example, for a big U.S. client where we use the immersion room in our New York office and brought in the European insurers and reinsurers and the London European insurers and reinsurers and essentially did what would have been a three-week trip turned it into a five-hour session in one location. And so again, saves time, saves money, but more importantly, the clients are finding value in it. They actually feel like they're getting that connection with the markets that they want and our colleagues, it actually allows us to sell off our global colleagues in a way that you don't really get to do when you're traveling place to place and so focused on schedule. So we're really excited about it, and Christa said, it's driving engagement and more importantly, productivity. And I think the clients are really enjoying the time they get back as well."
"Josh Shanker --  Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst This has obviously been Aon's experience, is this similar to what your understanding is going on with your clients? Or is your clients' costs rising faster than your crack team of I guess, spend managers can manage for the company itself? Eric Andersen -- President So I would say our human capital business spends a lot of time working with our clients on how to do smart working. And so I think as the pandemic is further and further in the rearview mirror, people are finding their new normal. And our teams are doing, I think, a great job helping them structure and engage with our clients in a way that they're able to do the same thing because our clients are also looking to get productivity. They're also looking to manage T&E. And they want to leverage the technology that we all use so much during the pandemic in ways that actually create the outcomes that they're looking for."
"Greg Case -- Chief Executive Officer And really, Josh, as you think about it, the whole phenomena you're highlighting is really to be incredibly substantial and significant for us, but even more so for our clients. And Eric described it well, but you just combine the whole wellness issues and challenges it really connects with our health business ways that it hasn't before. It's a very integrated response cutting across multiple solution lines. It's the best example. Another example of Aon United in action as we help clients try to understand how they can really address the work environment, smart working, as we describe it, but even more broadly, how it impacts their own engagement and how they drive talent acquisition, talent retention, talent and enrichment and it's a real opportunity for us."

" Jon Stonehouse -- Chief Executive Officer   Thanks, John. We continue to see steady progress with the ORLADEYO launch and underlying growth trends remain strong. New patient starts are consistent with previous quarters, discontinuations appear to have stabilized, and we are investing more to keep this momentum going. Based on our expectations for continued growth in Q4, we plan to exit 2022, having more than doubled sales from the great start we had last year and will be a quarter of the way to our expected peak of $1 billion globally in just the second year of launch. We've shown you long-term data from our trial, and we will continue to show you real-world data that our drug works very well in many patients. The competitive landscape has changed too and is a reminder of how challenging it is to pursue a strategy of oral drugs in HAE. Right now, and perhaps for some time to come, ORLADEYO is the only direct-acting oral with once-daily dosing to prevent HAE attacks. With this unique offering and product profile, we believe this is a therapy every patient should have the opportunity to try to see if it works for them. Charlie will share more specifics on the ORLADEYO quarter performance in a minute. Our strategy of going after challenging targets, specifically serine proteases for patients suffering from rare diseases is rooted in our ability to discover potent, specific, and bioavailable molecules. In the case of HAE, we were able to do that, do what others haven't, develop an oral once-daily collection inhibitor. We believe this allows us to offer something unique to these patients and we believe HAE is just the start. In addition, because these are difficult targets, we don't stop at the first molecule we discover, we work on improved next-generation compounds. We saw that with the world stat in ORLADEYO. We believe we've done it again with Factor D. We are fortunate to have two molecules again, and that puts us in a position to potentially have the first Oral Factor D monotherapy molecule to market."
"  In the next generation, that perhaps will be the best. While the future of 9930 is still to be determined, our expectation is we will get an answer to our hypothesis on data from the first 15 or so patients treated for 2 to 3 months by the middle of next year. We have also been working on additional next-generation complement inhibitors, including BCX10013. A potential once-daily Oral Factor D inhibitor that we have advanced into the clinic. In Q1 of next year, we plan to show you data in humans that support the potential of once-daily dosing. Our plan is to go into rare disease patients in dose-ranging proof of concept studies with 10013 next year as well. But we won't stop there. The complement system is complex and blocking more than one pathway allows us to go after more rare diseases, and may be necessary to successfully treat patients. So we also have a discovery effort, and we're making great progress on other targets in the complement system. If successful, we'll be able to go after other rare diseases and possibly combine molecules to make the best therapy in one capsule or tablet. We plan to show you more in an R&D day next year. So, the goal simply stated is to be the global leader in complement. Simple to state, but very challenging to do. We believe the strategy in our discovery platform allows us to do things others may not be able to do, and we look forward to showcasing it to you next year. So what does this mean for you as a shareholder? It starts with the evidence that we can successfully discover, develop, and launch an oral drug directed at a challenging target that offers something unique to patients. The result we expect is ORLADEYO will fill an unmet need for thousands of HAE patients and will reach $1 billion in global peak sales. That is a major accomplishment that sets us apart to create meaningful value for patients and shareholders. And we plan to do it again and complement, but not with one molecule or one pathway. Imagine many molecules from multiple pathways making the best and unique therapies others may not. That value is many, many more patients and potentially multiples of ORLADEYO peak sales. Now, I'll turn the call over to Charlie to go over the ORLADEYO performance."
"Charlie Gayer -- Chief Commercial Officer Thanks, Jon. The core metrics for ORLADEYO were strong once again in the third quarter. New patient starts were right in line with our six-quarter running average. The absolute number of discontinuations was flat to slightly improved for the second quarter in a row, and we saw a 9% growth in patients on paid therapy. All these metrics point to what we have described previously, a pattern of consistent linear growth for ORLADEYO. I'll share more detail on what we saw in the quarter, and later, Anthony will provide context for how patient growth translated to revenue. We continued to add breadth and depth to the ORLADEYO prescriber base, and several facts point to our ability to expand ORLADEYO use. The overall prescriber base grew by another 11% in Q3, and we had the largest number of repeat prescribers in a quarter, as more physicians offer ORLADEYO to additional patients in their practices. Top 500 HAE treaters accounted for 54% of new ORLADEYO prescriptions, and about 25% of top 500 prescribers in Q3 were newly activated. We also have the largest number of tier-two prescribers in any quarter-to-date. These trends are consistent with another survey that we conducted with 60 allergists in September. As we have seen in prior surveys, physicians anticipated the percentage of their patients treated with ORLADEYO would grow more than any other HAE therapy over the next 12 months. They anticipate expanding use because they have seen our long-term clinical data. Many also have firsthand experience with our ORLADEYO, and our physician survey shows that ORLADEYO is the most requested HAE prophylaxis medication among patients. Next week at the American College of Asthma, Allergy, and Immunology Congress, we will have an oral presentation and a poster from large cohorts of patients who started on ORLADEYO after the launch. This real-world evidence confirms what physicians are seeing, regardless of baseline attack rate or prior therapy, patients experience excellent long-term control. Even with the success we've seen since launch, we constantly evaluate opportunities to invest, to do more. In Q3, we identified two such opportunities. The first is to add incrementally to our sales team to further accelerate impact in Top 500 position. The second is to add to our field market access team so that as we broaden our prescriber base, we can help practices that have less experience seeking payor authorization for HAE therapies. As we round out the second year on the market for ORLADEYO, we are excited about the future potential. One month into this quarter, our underlying metric remains strong. We expect to see a double-digit revenue growth percentage in the fourth quarter, with total ORLADEYO sales for the year ending at $255 million, more than doubling 2021 sales. Helen, I'll turn the call over to you."
"Helen Thackray -- Chief Research and Development Officer Thanks, Charlie. Today, I'll discuss a few significant updates on our pipeline program, including progress with our current molecules, and our future goals for advancing multiple new drug candidates to treat complement-mediated diseases. As we continue to advance our pipeline, an important goal, which we believe is achievable, is to bring novel orally delivered products forward to treat many complement-mediated diseases. Our vision is to be the global"
"Anthony Doyle -- Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Helen. With ORLADEYO on net revenue for the quarter coming in at $66 million, that puts the trailing 12-month revenue at around $227 million. That's already over $100 million more than our 2021 full year revenue. When comparing Q2 ORLADEYO revenue, which came in at $65.2 million to Q3 revenue at $66 million. There are a couple of things that we need to review to align to our comment on study growth. For Q2, we had a $2.2 million positive out-of-period reimbur"
"Ken Cacciatore --  Cowen and Company -- Analyst Thanks so much. Great explanation on Q3, appreciate that on ORLADEYO. Just wondering, with the investments that you're making to continue to press the advantage you have with the commercial spend, do you want to give us a little bit of thoughts as we look into 2023? It seems like Q4 is on a nice trend already. Maybe any context you can provide for ORLADEYO, and maybe discuss when we should start seeing a little bit more ex-U.S. contribution. And I want to give a follow-up now because I know you want to limit it to one question. John, just in general, what do you think about the company, wonderful success commercially with ORLADEYO and on the pathway to $1 billion, but an earlier stage pipeline, we saw Biohaven take the opportunity to really maximize the value of their lead commercial asset with the pipeline that was trailing, as you kind of look at the company and how the value you've created in ORLADEY, plus kind of a little bit of an earlier stage pipeline albeit we hope 9930 continues to progress. Can you just talk about how the company is looking at maybe maximizing the value of these two? Would something like Biohaven's approach make sense to your organization? Thanks so much."
"Jon Stonehouse -- Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Tell you what, I'll take the first one. Well, I actually. Charlie Gayer -- Chief Commercial Officer You want to start with the last one and I'll come back to it. Jon Stonehouse -- Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So Ken, the strategy I guess I look at it slightly differently, we have a pivotal program going on with 9930, and our expectation is if we find a safe and effective dose, we're off to the races with that molecule, and then competing with an oral drug in an injectable space. So I don't see a big gap there. And at the end of the day, it's steady revenue growth. So if we're not burning a lot of capital on the R&D side, the revenue catches up, and you saw that this year when Anthony's guidance I mean, we're a little more than what, $100 million apart for the year in terms of revenue and an expense. So, I mean, if you look at all the other biotech companies around our size, that is a unique position to be in. We'll always be open to other options, and other creative solutions like Biohaven has done. But for right now, we're building a pipeline and we're launching a drug that we believe is going to be $1 billion."
" CharlieCharlie Gayer -- Chief Commercial Officer Ken, and so on your other questions around the commercial investments, I think the first thing to say is and John mentioned this upfront, we still have all confidence in the world that this is a $1 billion peak sales drug. And so as we look to make other investments, it's really about being as efficient and accelerated in that process as possible. You're asking around 2023, I think we'll give guidance for 2023 in early next year. But we feel very good about our trajectory based on the underlying trends. And then as far as ex-U.S., eventually at some point we'll probably start to break that out. It's still for 2022, a small percentage of sales. But everything that we see in the underlying trends in Europe and beyond gives us confidence that that will contribute to hundred million plus at peak sales. So we're feeling really good about where we are."
"Ken Cacciatore --  Cowen and Company -- Analyst Great. Thanks so much.OperatorThank you. The next question to you comes from Chris Raymond with Piper Sandler. Chris Raymond --  Piper Sandler -- Analyst Hey, guys. Thanks. So a question, and also a follow-up. Just on ORLADEYO quarterly quarter-to-quarter dynamics. Appreciate the color and the puts and takes from Q2 and also Q3. But can you maybe provide some color on the timing for understanding this dynamic and recognizing that pull forward? I'm just curious because it wasn't mentioned last quarter and just getting hit by some investors wondering why. And then maybe as a follow-up, on the next generation molecule 10013, can you walk us through what you know, pretty clinically that gives you confidence that you won't run into the same sort of renal signal as 9930?"
"Jon Stonehouse -- Chief Executive Officer Yes. Maybe I'll take the first one, Anthony. If I go wrong direction you can correct me. But we did point out that there was $2.2 million of non-period accrual adjustment in the second quarter that made that higher than normal. And then, you don't know the differences between the two until you finish a quarter. Right. And so we had some our finish a month like July. And what happened in retrospect is July 4th landed on a Monday, I believe, this year and a bunch of shipments came in prior to that because I'm sure people weren't home. And as a result, it got shipped in June instead of July. So I don't know if there's anything else to add."
"Anthony Doyle -- Chief Financial Officer Just I mean, will things like this happen? They will, right? I think what we're not going to do is solely focus on that quarter to quarter. But that's why we lean into the idea of the underlying strength. Right. We feel really good around where we are, where we're going from a growth perspective and that we're on that path to $1 billion. So in the future, will there be some kind of quarter over quarter as it relates to holidays or seasonality? Maybe? But I think hitting on that underlying growth factors, and how confident it makes us in terms of getting to the $255 for this year and $1 billion thereafter is our focus."
"Jon Stonehouse -- Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Last thing I'd say on that front is we're the only ones with the data at the end of the day, no offense to those of you trying to guess. And so we think we're the most accurate guider. And we believe we're telling you right now that we believe we'll finish the year at $255. And that's a spectacular outcome given that we blew away the first year with 122 so more than doubling. Helen, you want to take the second part of Chris's question? Helen Thackray -- Chief Research and Development Officer Yes. So it's BCX100013. We don't know yet that we will not see what we're seeing with 9930. However, we do know a number of things that give us confidence. One is it's a unique molecule, which means it has its own unique characteristic, and so we expect it to behave differently in the clinic, and we're seeing that. Two, as we know what we saw with 9930. With this year 9930, we've learned from that with applied that in our process with both preclinical and clinical data. And again, what we're seeing in the clinic with BCX10013 as supportive of proceeding and patient trials, and supportive of the potential for once-daily dosing."
"Jon Stonehouse -- Chief Executive Officer And so some of it, you know, we've gathered data that gives us confidence that it could be different. And then there's some that's just not mature enough that we can't declare that it's that different, we won't see it. But we will be moving it forward if we thought there was a high risk here. Chris Raymond --  Piper Sandler -- Analyst So excellent. Thank you, guys.OperatorAnd the next question in the queue comes from Jessica Fye with J.P. Morgan. Daniel Chen --  JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst Morning, guys. Thanks for taking our question. This is Daniel for just for Jess. A couple of questions. First, I guess you've elaborated a little bit on this, but what were the inputs you considered when narrowing down the full-year guidance to the lower end of the prior numbers? And to understanding that we'll see detailed data in early 2023 for 10013. But maybe you can you elaborate on some. Of the early clinical details that have generated with that product? For example, in terms of AP hemolysis, that was a just a one-state oral therapy. If I can sneak one more is assuming that maybe assuming you're still in a position, assuming you still position 10013, similarly to you have been developing the 49930 before by targeting multiple oral indications. How are you thinking about the potential impact of an IRA, and how that might not encourage drug developers to develop more than one or an indication for the asset? Thanks."
"Jon Stonehouse -- Chief Executive Officer You're referring to the Inflation Reduction Act and the multiple indications on one molecule? Daniel Chen --  JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst Yep. Yeah. Jon Stonehouse -- Chief Executive Officer I'll come back to that. Helen, you can take the 10013. I'll take the lower end. And Anthony, again, help me here. So, I mean, it's real simple, Daniel, we have another quarter's worth of data, and we're into November now, and so we've said we would be the accurate guide here, and we believe we're going to be at $255. This is, I think one big difference in rare diseases versus mass markets is it doesn't take a lot of patients to have a movement one direction or another. So we're real confident in the $255. And that's a doubling or more than a doubling of the first year great start. Helen, you want to take the 10013?"
"Helen Thackray -- Chief Research and Development Officer Yeah, sure. So in terms of the early clinical data with 10013 and this is just to be clear, this is in healthy volunteers. So we have 90, about nine healthy volunteers who've been dosed with the drug. And so we have safety data and pharmacokinetics data for those individuals we have that, including dose levels that may be therapeutic in range, and we do not have data on patients at this point. So our plan is to move into patients next year to assess the potential for the complement activity. Jon Stonehouse -- Chief Executive Officer And then on the Inflation Reduction Act, I think there's a lot of implementation, a lot of unknowns yet that have to occur before we can draw any conclusions. And maybe we are different than others, but we're not going to say we're not going to bring a molecule forward in a bunch of other indications when patients are in need. And we think that we can create real value for shareholders. So, it's certainly on our radar. But, one of the beauties I think in the complement system is single molecules can go after multiple diseases. And so that's our plan.OperatorThank you. The next question in the queue comes from Brian Abrahams with RBC Capital."
"Joe Spak --  RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst Hi, this is Joe, in for Brian. Thank you for taking our question. I just wanted to ask one question on ORLADEYO once again. If you can tell us anything about like any improvement you're seeing and patient retention rate and, if there were any specific types of patients that they tend to stay on longer ORLADEYO. And how is your education or awareness initiative impacting this retention rates as a break [inaudible] Thank you. Charlie Gayer -- Chief Commercial Officer Sure. Yeah. So as I mentioned on the call, first of all, we've seen two quarters in a row now of flat patient retention or patient discontinuations even as our overall patient base has grown. So I think we're making a difference. What we see is the patient types that do absolutely the best are patients who sweat, who are controlled on other prophylactic therapies, and then switch over. And in particular, patients who had been on paid therapy, or as I've said previously about 70% of those patients stay on ORLADEYO for at least 12 months. And so that's what we're really focused on, is getting the right patient type to switch ORLADEYO. And then as any patient starts off, we really focus on setting expectations for both efficacy and any side effects that some patients may experience, and we see that that makes a difference. So we're pleased with where we are with patient retention, and we think that this is going to be pretty stable going forward."
"Jon Stonehouse -- Chief Executive Officer And Charlie mentioned this point around the college meeting, and I would just encourage people to watch the presentation and look at the poster because there's some real-world data in there that's incredibly encouraging around, as Charlie described, the best switches are the ones that are on controlled on prophy, injectable prophy. So, you know, our view remains that if you can be controlled on our drug on a once-daily capsule, why on earth would you not try it and see if it works for you? Right. And so that's our goal. We're continuing to chip away at this, and we believe we're making really good progress on our way to many thousands of patients and, peak sales of $1 billion."
"Joe Spak --  RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst Thank you for the insight.OperatorAnd the next question in the queue comes from Jon Wolleben with JMP Securities. Jon Wolleben --  JMP Securities -- Analyst Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Two for me, I was hoping you could comment a bit on what you're seeing on growth net adjustment. As we're moving forward, you gave some comments on paid patient growth, which is helpful. And then also when you talk about the 15 patients from 9930 from what you want to see data to make the [inaudible] decision. I just want to check, is this strictly a PNH patient, or is it the real patients, as well or some combination? How are you thinking about what makes up that go no go population? Thanks."
"Jon Stonehouse -- Chief Executive Officer Yeah, I'll take. There's been no major movements in gross, and you know we talked about in Q1 the impact that we had there. But for Q2, 3, and 4, our expectation has been that it would be stable on reimbursed patients. Again, we said around 15% to 20%. Charlie talked previously around what we did from a PBM coverage, and insurance or payer coverage perspective at north of 80%. So, Jon, I don't think there's any kind of big drivers we will continue to see from a percentage numerator versus denominator perspective, including free product that get toward the 15% to 20%. We still feel good about that, but no major movements from Q2. And then the 15 patients Helen?"
"Helen Thackray -- Chief Research and Development Officer Yeah. So the 15 patients we're looking for, first of all, approximately 15 patients, that's the right number for us to be able to have confidence in the data to continue to advance the program. Secondly, it's likely to be patients mostly from the Redeem Studies with PNH, if that's a program where we have more sites, two global pivotal trials, and we're likely to see enrollment faster there. In the Renew program, we will continue to enroll in that program. There's also a Brennan period built in, and so it may take longer for patients to be dosed and proceed to an outcome. So we assume it's going to be mostly PNH."
"Jon Stonehouse -- Chief Executive Officer Yeah, remember, Jon, that they've got to have a biopsy to make sure that they truly have disease in the [inaudible] so that just takes long. Jon Wolleben --  JMP Securities -- Analyst Thank you.OperatorThe next question in the queue comes from Gena Wang with Barclays. Your line is open, ma'am. Gena Wang --  Barclays -- Analyst Thank you for taking my question. I have a question regarding ORLADEYO launch. So give me your prior comment, just wondering, is retention rate now maintained at the middle 60? And then my next question is regarding 2022, and your guidance $255. I just did a quick math. You know, that will translate to $74.5 million for 4Q. And if we use like $67.5 million for 3Q, that we have a $7 million growth. And we are only one month into 4Q, and also we have holidays in 4Q. Just wondering what makes you confident you can achieve or Q numbers."
"Anthony Doyle -- Chief Financial Officer Charlie, you want to take the retention? Charlie Gayer -- Chief Commercial Officer Sure. Yeah. So Gena, the one-year retention overall. Yes, in the mid 60 percentage. And then what we're really seeing is that, and we've talked about this before is where we lose the majority of patients is in the first few months then up to six months. Once patients get out to a year, they're doing well on or they're only going to stay on if they're doing well. And so those patients are much more likely to stay on for the long term. Anthony Doyle -- Chief Financial Officer You want to take it? Jon Stonehouse -- Chief Executive Officer Sure.  Anthony Doyle -- Chief Financial Officer Fourth quarter? Jon Stonehouse -- Chief Executive Officer No. You know what? I think for Q4, Charlie talked about steady growth. That is Gena, from an underlying perspective, what we're seeing. And so I think getting to those numbers that you're talking about, right, to get to the $255. Given where we are coming into November out of October, I think we feel really good that we feel really confident about heading out to $255. Charlie Gayer -- Chief Commercial Officer Yeah. And we don't guide quarterly, but by the fact that we say $255 giving you three-quarters worth of revenue, we are basically guiding you in the fourth quarter. Yes.OperatorThank you. And the next question comes from Justin Kim with Oppenheimer and Company. Justin Kim --  Oppenheimer and Company -- Analyst Hi, and good morning. Thanks for taking the question. You know, as you think about sort of full speed ahead for the Redeem Studies later next year, could you describe how much separation you see between 9930 and 10013 program? Just from a timing perspective and any sort of progress with 10013 that might just incentivize commercialization of the next generation inhibitor. Helen Thackray -- Chief Research and Development Officer Yeah, I'm sure, I can take that. So the regime studies it, just to be clear, we are going quickly with redeem studies, and the question is whether we continue that. So they are advancing, this is a pivotal program. We expected to be the first program to read out. We expect to be the first program to market. Should we have successfully addressed the dose for safe and effective drug. So that is the in position to be the first market. And we have a file, a second-generation molecule that is also in a position to get to market. It's early, it's in phase one, we have healthy volunteer data, but we think it has the potential to be best in class, and so we're bringing it through behind."
"Anthony Doyle -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah, I mean, it's about two years at the end of the day between the two, but one of them is in a pivotal study, and one of those in a phase one. And so if we find the safe and effective dose, we've got something that creates real value for patients in this market. And so, of course, we would invest in it if we have a safe and effective dose. I think the more important question is how do we allocate what we go after with each molecule, in our view, is probably a skinnier set of indications for 9930. That's how we see it today. And then because we believe 10013 has the potential to be best, maybe a broader set of indications for that one. But that's, you know, we'll see how the programs unfold over time and give you more clarity on that later."
"Justin Kim --  Oppenheimer and Company -- Analyst Thank you.OperatorThe next question in the queue comes from Tazeen Ahmad from Bank of America. Your line is open. Tazeen Ahmad --  Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I think most of them have been answered. For 4Q now that you have some experience calendar-wise with the launch, do you expect in general any kind of seasonality? And then secondly, on the subject of pricing, you know, historically rare drugs have been able to take at least annual price increases as you talk to insurers payers, has there been any change in tone on that? Obviously not asking you to guide, but just in terms of any kind of sentiment shift that you may or may not be seeing from payers. And then lastly, as you think about 2023 sales for ORLADEYO, where do you think your biggest area of untapped demand lies going forward? Thanks."
"Jon Stonehouse -- Chief Executive Officer So who wants to take the seasonality piece? Charlie Gayer -- Chief Commercial Officer OK. I can. So, Tazeen, I think, you know, looking forward into the new year, I think we'll see the same kind of seasonality that we saw last year kind of going into Q1. As we talked about, That's always a time when the majority or a good portion of the patients have to go through prior authorization. So I think we'll comment more on that next quarter, but you can anticipate that. As far as pricing, we don't obviously, we don't comment on general pricing, but payer sensitivity, no, I think, you know, payers are always sensitive to high-priced therapies for rare diseases like HAE. But we're not seeing anything notable about that."
"Jon Stonehouse -- Chief Executive Officer And there was one of the 2023 untapped potential market that let me start then you can add, you know, I think this further investment that Charlie talked about, we'll see the bulk of the value that come in in 2023 for sure. But the message has been consistent quarter after quarter after quarter. The best patients that we get are ones that are controlled on injectable pro-fee that switch over to ORLADEYO, and again I'd encourage you to to pay attention to what we're presenting at the college meeting. So continuing to pick away, and chip away at that I think is the key. And then you've heard me comment today and many times over over the quarters around our top 500 versus Tier two, and recall for everyone the top 500 is about half the HAE market, and then there's tier two and we had 54% of our new prescriptions come from the top 500, so really great balance. And we see opportunities in both hands kind of at the top of the market and then expanding the market. And so as we've expanded our team a little bit, it's to take advantage of both of those segments."
"Tazeen Ahmad --  Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Thank you.OperatorAnd the next question the queue comes from [inaudible] with Needham and Company.Unknown speaker Hi, this is [inaudible] Thanks for taking my question. You just talk about how the recent setbacks with other oral HAE prophylactic products in development changes your long-term outlook for ORLADEYO, and how do you see the competitive landscape playing out? Thanks. Jon Stonehouse -- Chief Executive Officer Yeah, I think I said it in my comments. It's just a reminder of how challenging it is to make a potent, specific orally bioavailable drug. I think there are now five companies, including us, with a world stat that had programs that had to be stopped. So, you know, these are really hard. What the flipside of that is, it means we may be the only one at the end of the day. And so that puts us in a spectacular position because we know that patients really want an oral, they want a decreased burden of disease and a decreased burden of therapy. And you can offer that with one capsule once a day with ORLADEYO. So I don't think it dramatically changes. The other piece I would say to the question, too, is we're absolutely in our competitors that are in the market that are have profit drugs are seeing this as well, is the market is definitely moving more and more and more to the prophy, and away from on demand. And I think on demand is going to be a tiny, tiny piece of the market ultimately, and then we'll be battling out with injectables for the prophy.Unknown speaker OK. Thanks."
"Jon Stonehouse -- Chief Executive Officer Yep.OperatorThank you. And our last question comes from Maury Raycroft with Jefferies. Maury Raycroft --  Jefferies -- Analyst Hi. Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. I'm just wondering if you can elaborate more on the comment about investing more to keep the ORLADEYO momentum going. You mentioned the increase in sales team in addition to field market teams. Is that the further investment you're referring to? And will you continue to add to these teams, or are you at a status quo at this point heading into 2023? Jon Stonehouse -- Chief Executive Officer Surely, it might be good to just talk about one of the keys to the success of the launch so far has been your agility, right? Look at that data, understand what the data is telling you, and then making adjustments. Charlie Gayer -- Chief Commercial Officer Yeah. So more to Jon's points, we have always looked where we can do more, and we when we built the launch when we built the team, we felt and we did have a great team that was ready to compete in the space, and I think we've seen that. Then what we're always doing is looking where we can do just a little bit more at the margins. And so previously have talked about how we added some additional field-based patient-facing members of the team because that's a need that we saw. And now we saw an opportunity just to add a little more to our sales team and a market access team. So we'll continue to look for these opportunities. We feel good about where we're at right now, but at some point in the future I may come back and say we've invested a little bit more because we've had other opportunities, but that's the approach we take."
"Maury Raycroft --  Jefferies -- Analyst Got it. Make sense. Thank you.OperatorWe have no further questions at the queue at this time, so I will now the call over to Mr. Stonehouse for closing remarks. Jon Stonehouse -- Chief Executive Officer Thank you, and thanks for your interest in BioCryst. I was recently shown some data from one of the banks around the number of publicly traded biotech companies. It's a really, really crowded space and what was an eye-popping was the number of companies that are trading below cash. You know, it's a really tough time and you guys know that better than anybody. But what I think what's interesting is how do you differentiate yourself when there are so many companies with gene editing, gene therapy, you know, you name it. And I think at BioCryst, the way we see it is we've shown you that we have a discovery engine that can do things perhaps that others can't. Right. In making an oral, potent specific once-a-day Caltrine inhibitor, we've shown you that we can file in the U.S., Europe, and Japan and get approvals all within four months of each other. That's even hard for a big company to do. And we've shown you that we can successfully launch a drug. Right? I think the initial consensus was $30 million this year, I think it was $218, and we've consistently beat that. Right. And why? Because we look at the data objectively, we develop a plan, and then we figure out how to how to get the business. And so that puts us in a different category, I think than a lot of other companies. And then the last point is we have access to capital, whether it's revenue or other sources of capital. We're not solely dependent on our shares to bring an additional capital into the market. So you add all those things together and then you have a team that, you know, I think your job is really hard, and do you believe what you hear? And I hope we're convincing you that we're trying to be objective in what we see and what we do, that we're disciplined around how we allocate capital and what decisions we make. It's hard to make decisions to stop programs. It's hard to make decisions in this business in general. But we're not afraid of that. And hopefully, we're showing you that we're trust trustworthy and that we're disciplined in how we do it.

Phillips 66 (PSX 2.96%)Q3 2022 Earnings CallNov 01, 2022, 12:00 p.m. ETContents:  Prepared Remarks Questions and Answers Call Participants  Prepared Remarks:  OperatorWelcome to the third quarter 2022 Phillips 66 earnings conference call. My name is Sylvie and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Jeff Dietert, vice president, investor relations. Jeff, you may begin. Jeff Dietert -- Vice President, Investor Relations   Good morning and welcome to Phillips 66 third quarter earnings conference call. Participants on today's call include Mark Lashier, president and CEO; Kevin Mitchell, EVP and CFO; Brian Mandell, EVP, Marketing and Commercial; Tim Roberts, EVP, Midstream and Chemicals; and Rich Harbison, SVP, Refining. Today's presentation material can be found on the investor relations section of the Phillips 66 website, along with supplemental financial and operating information. We provided supplemental information this morning for Chemicals, Refining and Marketing and Midstream. The remaining supplemental information will be available with the 10-Q filing. We'll return to the normal supplemental release next quarter. Slide 2 contains our safe harbor statement. We will be making forward-looking statements during today's call.Actual results may differ materially from today's comments. Factors that could cause actual results to differ are included here as well as in our SEC filings. Before we begin our discussion, I would like to highlight that we will be hosting an investor day in New York on November 9. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mark."
" Mark Lashier -- President and Chief Executive Officer   Thanks, Jeff. Our third quarter results reflect the continued favorable market environment and our strong operating performance. We ran at high rates during the summer driving season to meet peak demand for critical transportation fuel. Our Refining business delivered improved market capture this quarter, supported by strong distillate cracks and wider discounts for heavy sour crudes. In the third quarter, we had adjusted earnings of $3.1 billion or $6.46 per share. We generated $3.1 billion in operating cash flow. We're committed to strong shareholder distributions. During the quarter, we ramped up share repurchases in a meaningful way, purchasing almost $700 million of common stock. Including dividends, we returned $1.2 billion to shareholders. During the quarter, we continued to focus on operating excellence and advancing our strategic priorities. Our enterprisewide business transformation is underway. The team is implementing key initiatives to deliver results. We look forward to providing more details at our investor day next week. In Midstream, we realigned our economic and governance interest in DCP Midstream, LP and Gray Oak Pipeline, LLC. Our economic interest in DCP Midstream increased to 43%, and our economic interest in Gray Oak Pipeline decreased to 6.5%. At the same time, we made an offer to acquire all publicly held common units of DCP Midstream, LP."
"  Our increased interest in DCP Midstream allows for further integration and optimization across our NGL business. The wellhead to market value chain structure will allow us to capture new commercial opportunities and optimize costs. Additionally, we started up Frac 4 at the Sweeny Hub on time and under budget. In October, Frac 4 achieved full run rates, bringing our total Sweeny Hub fractionation capacity to 550,000 barrels per day. CPChem is pursuing a portfolio of high-return projects, enhancing its asset base as well as optimizing its existing operations. This includes growing its normal alpha olefins business with a second world-scale unit to produce one-hexene, a critical component in high-performance polyethylene. The unit is being constructed at CPChem's Old Ocean, Texas facility and will produce 586 million pounds per year. CPChem is also building a new propylene splitter at its Cedar Bayou facility, which will expand its capacity by one billion pounds per year. Both the one-hexene and propylene splitter projects are expected to start up in the second half of 2023. CPChem continues to develop two world-scale petrochemical facilities on the U.S. Gulf Coast and in Ras Laffan, Qatar. A final investment decision for the U.S. Gulf Coast project is expected before the end of this year. In Refining, we're converting our San Francisco refinery into one of the world's largest renewable fuels facilities. The Rodeo Renewed project is expected to cost approximately $850 million and begin commercial operations in the first quarter of 2024. Upon completion, Rodeo will have over 50,000 barrels per day of renewable fuels production capacity. Now I'll turn the call over to Kevin to review the financial results."
"Kevin Mitchell -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Thank you, Mark, and hello, everyone. Before I talk about the financials, let me begin by summarizing the accounting impacts of DCP Midstream. On August 17, we completed the merger of DCP Midstream, LLC and Gray Oak Pipeline, LLC. In connection with the transaction, we were delegated governance rights over DCP Midstream, LP and its general partner entities as well as DCP Sand Hills Pipeline, LLC and DCP Southern Hills Pipeline, LLC. Effe"
"Doug Leggate --  Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. Kevin, I wonder if I could just ask you about your thoughts on the balance sheet going forward. I mean, clearly, you're back to, I guess on a capitalization basis, you're back to pre-COVID levels pretty much. But the absolute debt, now you have DCP is still about 30% up on where it was before the downturn. So how are you thinking about where you want the balance sheet to be going forward and how that might play into your cash return strategy?"
"Kevin Mitchell -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yes, Doug. Thanks. It's a good question. So we feel pretty good that even with consolidation of DCP, the debt-to-capital ratio, net of cash, is sub-30%. So we feel good about the metric from that standpoint. And also, if you just look at debt-to-EBITDA metrics, they're still very strong. But the reality is it's $17.8 billion, circa $18 billion of debt on a fully consolidated basis. And so I think given the overall financial position we're in, the cash generation that we have, you'll see us continue to do some debt reduction. Bear in mind, we haven't yet funded the buy-in of the public, so that puts more pressure on the balance sheet regardless of how we actually execute on that funding between debt and cash. And so we'll continue to want to make some debt reductions. But the difference now between where we were over the last couple of years, where we're trying to get rid of the pandemic debt that we had added is, we don't need to make debt reduction the No. 1 priority for discretionary cash. Cash generation, cash balances are sufficient that we'"
"ll be able to do some -- gradually chip away at the debt balance and, at the same time, continue to return a healthy amount of cash to shareholders. Doug Leggate --  Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst I'm trying hard, Kevin, not to ask anything that I know you won't answer, given that you've got the analyst day. So I'm avoiding some of the obvious things,  but I do want to try one that really came up in the last -- the call that preceded this one with Marathon. And it's the issue about the industry or senior management's view of mid-cycle. And Marathon, we're quite clear to say, look, they think mid-cycle has moved up. You guys used to talk about, I guess, $6 billion to $7 billion of mid-cycle cash flow. Again, not pre-empting next week, but can you maybe offer, whether Mark or anyone else, how you feel about the go-forward outlook for mid-cycle earnings for this business, for the Refining business?"
"Mark Lashier -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yes, Doug, we are going to cover that a bit next week. I think that there's two things to take into consideration there. Has the market mid-cycle moved, it has our ability to generate EBITDA move. And certainly, the piece that we control, we know we'll be moving, and we'll provide details next week. And as far as the market, we're still watching that to see how that evolves. But we'll be more focused on what we're doing to drive our mid-cycle going forward. Doug Leggate --  Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst I understand. We'll wait until next week. Thank you, guys.OperatorNext question will be from Neil Mehta at Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Neil Mehta --  Goldman Sachs -- Analyst Yeah. Good morning, team. I wanted to start off on the waterfall on Slide 20 of the deck in the Central Corridor. Really exceptional capture rates in that region. And I was wondering if there's anything unusual in there if there's something structural that we should capitalize, as I know that other bucket can move around a bunch. And how much did WCS help this quarter? Or given the fact that it typically comes in at a lag, is that more of a 4Q tailwind? Mark Lashier -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yes, Neil. We're very pleased with the Central Corridor performance. There are a number of factors that differentiated the second quarter to the third quarter and a number of things that happened in the third quarter. I'll let Rich dive into the details around that. Rich Harbison -- Senior Vice President, Refining OK, Mark. Neil, good question. And yes, the Mid-Con Central Corridor had a very good quarter. Let me start by resetting the basis for the second quarter. Second quarter for us was a heavy turnaround in this region. So a lot of the difference you're seeing is the lack of turnarounds in the third quarter. Our mechanical availability during the third quarter was very good. We had high utilizations sitting at around 93% and strong clean product yields sitting at 88% for the Corridor. So good performance on both of those. Of course, those directly relate to increased volumes. And with the lack of turnarounds, we had a lot lower operating expense for the quarter as well. As you indicated as well, Neil, the market conditions were quite favorable for our kit. We saw widening Canadian spreads, which are quite favorable for us as well as a very strong distillate crack in the region. And that also plays well for our kit, which is a strong distillate producer. So I think what you're seeing here is a strong operating performance in favorable market conditions playing out for us in the third quarter."
"Neil Mehta --  Goldman Sachs -- Analyst Yes. And maybe we could stay on that point around Western Canadian crude. It has been pretty wide here, and it's widened out in the curve for '23 as well. So would love your guys' perspective on what you think is going on there. And given it does tend to come in at a lag, should we see a disproportionate impact of that tailwind in Q4? Brian Mandell -- Executive Vice President, Marketing and Commercial Neil, this is Brian. I'll start by saying that WCS started weakening with PADD 2 unplanned maintenance. WCS was forced into the Gulf Coast and then forced to compete with SPR barrels. We've released about 180 million barrels of SPR crude. Most of that has been sour so we competed with WCS. High sulfur fuel oil has also been weak, and it competes as well, given weaker bunker demand and the end of summer utility burn. And also, generally, the WCS is purchased by Asia and India, and they were out buying euros, Russian crude so they weren't buying as much. And finally, WCS has a high naphtha cut, and that naphtha has been very, very weak because of the Chemicals business. So that was also caused some pressure. So currently, WCS is at about $30 differential. Q4, if you look at the forward curve is at $26 off and next year is about $23 off. So we assume that it will continue to be weak, and the market players also feel the same way."
"Neil Mehta --  Goldman Sachs -- Analyst OK. Thanks, guys.OperatorThank you. Next question is from Roger Read at Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Roger Read --  Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst Yeah. Thank you. Good morning. I guess I'd like to maybe take a shot here at the Chemicals side of things. So obviously, kind of the softer results and coming off what was an impressive sort of '21, early '22 run. You mentioned FID for the Gulf Coast and then also the Ras Laffan opportunity. Does the weakness in Chemicals here at all imperil your timing on decision of FID? Or does it have any impact whatsoever? Mark Lashier -- President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks, Roger. That's a great question. I think that CPChem has a long history of focusing on the long-term fundamentals. And they never tried to time any particular cyclic movements to drive their growth plans. They've always focused on capturing advantaged feedstocks and maintain their global market presence. And that's what they're doing here as well. Frankly, if you look back in history, the projects that have just happened to be countercyclical, where the investments made when there was a downturn, they tend to come online when things are turning back up and that's beneficial to the economics, then it looks like that may be the case here. You can never predict when things will turn around, but it will take about four years to execute each of those projects. And so yes, it will be what does the crystal ball say in that time frame. But we focus on those long-term fundamentals and what we see as kind of a mid-cycle margin for those opportunities."
"Roger Read --  Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst That makes sense. And then my other question on the Marketing business. You had an exceptional Q2 and now in an even more exceptional Q3, any kind of background on what's going on there? And are the fundamentals that created the last two quarters showing any signs of reversing here? Brian Mandell -- Executive Vice President, Marketing and Commercial Sure, Roger. Brian again. Maybe I'll start by saying that our diverse geographic portfolio with business both here in the U.S. and in Western Europe and our diverse channels of trade, we have unbranded, branded and retail help us when we think about our Marketing business. But Q3, a number of things that we saw that helped the business. In Germany, it was a tax holiday starting in January 1 and ending at the end of August. Also overseas, the refinery down actually helped us and generally helps us. We have alternative supply at MiRO Refinery there in the south of Germany, which helps us particularly in the south of Germany. And our exchange agreement terms also give us a competitive advantage. We had the general falling of spot prices, which helped us. Shortage of Russian distillate in the market as well helped us internationally. And then I would say, conversely, in the U.S., we actually saw margins come off in Q3 from Q2. But overall, we had a very good quarter."
"Roger Read --  Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst OK. Great. Thank you.OperatorThank you. Next question will be from Ryan Todd at Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Ryan Todd --  Piper Sandler -- Analyst Thanks. Maybe if I could ask one on kind of Atlantic Basin dynamics. European refining, you're exposed to European refining, spent a lot of volatility in recent months there with natural gas prices. The systems have had to adjust and have adjusted a decent amount. Looking forward, you've got a crude import ban that's about to go into effect and then potentially a product import ban early next year. Any thoughts as you look forward to how these dynamics play out both for your asset and the region overall and how this may impact Atlantic Basin balances over the next six months?"
"Mark Lashier -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yes. This is Mark. I'll comment at a high level then I'll let Rich and Brian follow up. But I think generally, those are constructive for us. I think it could strengthen our position, particularly around distillates and it's going from strength to strength. But I will let Brian and Rich comment on the details. Brian Mandell -- Executive Vice President, Marketing and Commercial Maybe I'll start with the macro and Rich can talk more about our assets. But clearly, the market around the world is tight, particularly on distillates. In the U.S., we're under 2015 to 2019 ranges by 22% inventories. That was a very, very weak inventories, given that we're starting to go into the winter season. Refineries around the world are making diesel over gasoline currently. So there are a lot of things that may take some of the edge off and alleviate some of the stress on the market. First around the world, we're coming back from turnarounds here in the U.S. and elsewhere. The Chinese have increased their quotas, so you'll see more gasoline and diesel on the market in Asia. The French refinery strikes are coming to an end, so those refineries will be back up. And then we're seeing kind of moderate weather forecast for both the U.S. and for Europe. So why we'd expect the margins to remain strong, and I think the ultimate moderator for those margins will be demand."
"Rich Harbison -- Senior Vice President, Refining This is Rich. I really don't have much to add to that other than from a Refining perspective, of course, the natural gas price will drive up our operating expenses. And we will see higher feedstock costs as this market evolves here into the future and these sanctions go into play. So how that all sells out will be interesting. Ryan Todd --  Piper Sandler -- Analyst Great. And then this may step into what you plan on talking about next week, but regarding the buy-in of the remainder of DCP, I don't know if you have any comment on potential timing for closure deal there. But beyond that, maybe a reminder of how you're thinking about the incremental benefits of the kind of the consolidated position there, either from a financial free cash flow point of view or operational synergies that come along with closure of that deal? And how that may impact your ability to buy back stock in the near term and the longer term?"
"Mark Lashier -- President and Chief Executive Officer At a high level, Ryan, the process is underway. We are negotiating with independent directors that represent the unitholders. And I will just say that we need to let that process play out. It's better to get the right number than to get a quick number. And as far as the strategic dynamics, Tim can talk more about that, but it really is about driving this wellhead to market strategy that we really believe will create a lot of long-term value and opportunity for Phillips 66. Tim, do you want to comment on that?"
"Tim Roberts -- Executive Vice President, Midstream Yes, I think that's right. Mark, thanks. Exactly right. I think there's a couple of things and I want to make a point is that we do believe in integration, no different than what we see in our integration on our Refining, Marketing, Commercial business, and Midstream. We see the same thing in the NGL, natural gas space. So this allows us to set up that framework to do that, especially in key basins, namely the Permian and DJ. So we really like that, but I think it's probably also worth commenting on that, yes, we want to get the buy-in done and get that behind us and really capture that full value. Really the important part for us, and we've already started the integration, so we are starting the integration, and we are pushing down the road as well to identify what the opportunities are going to be that really are going to position this both from a cost standpoint as well as the ability to compete and create more value. As soon as we get the buy-in done, we can talk a lot more about what that potential is going to be."
"Ryan Todd --  Piper Sandler -- Analyst Thank you.OperatorThank you. Next question will be from John Royall at J. P. Morgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open. John Royall --  JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So on the buyback, I think we'll probably have to wait until post DCP to have a real kind of go-forward framework. But for now, you did have a pretty big number in 3Q that I think surprised some people. And so can you talk about the short-term kind of push-pull between the buyback and then maybe conserving cash for the upcoming deal with DCP and how you think about that? Mark Lashier -- President and Chief Executive Officer At a high level, John, we are committed to buybacks. We had to hold back in the second quarter due to a blackout period. And so that kind of held us back for a bit. But what you saw last quarter is just a signal that we are serious about buybacks. And I'll let Kevin talk about the balance between what it will require to execute the roll-up of DCP versus share repurchases. But we have got a solid plan. And like a broken record, I'll say you'll hear more about it at investor day."
"Kevin Mitchell -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yes, John. So in terms of the DCP roll-up, our expectation is that will be a combination of debt issuance and cash on hand we'll use to fund that. And to my earlier comments, I feel pretty confident that with where the balance sheet sits with the cash position we have, with the cash generation we have, we'll be able to manage that in terms of, yes, we will want to subsequently reduce debt. But with the overall cash position, we should be in a position to continue to return significant amounts of cash to shareholders. So I'm not too concerned that the DCP transaction is going to negatively impact our ability to buy back shares."
"John Royall --  JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst OK. Thank you. And then apologies to repeat a prior question, but I was just thinking through your commentary on the strength in Central Corridor. And correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm not sure if the things you guys talked about necessarily address the Other bar, flipping from negative eight to positive 450 going from 2Q to 3Q. So apologies if I missed this, but if you could go through the dynamics in that Other bar specifically, that would be really hel"
"Matt Blair -- Tudor, Pickering,  Holt and Company -- Analyst Sounds good. And then could you talk about octane spreads? They have been really quite strong recently. Is this just a function of Tier 3 impacts rolling through the market? And could you also remind me on what Phillips' exposure to premium gasoline is? Brian Mandell -- Executive Vice President, Marketing and Commercial Yes. Generally, when you have weak naphtha, Matt, you have high or large octane spreads, and naphtha's been very, very weak. So gasoline blenders need the octane to blend into the gasoline to make finished grade. And I would say that like most marketers, we're about 11% or 12% on our premium in our Marketing business. Matt Blair -- Tudor, Pickering,  Holt and Company -- Analyst Great. Thank you.OperatorThank you. Next question will be from Paul Cheng at Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Paul Cheng --  Scotiabank -- Analyst Hi. Good morning. Two questions, please. First, with the latest news from Biden talking about the oil industry with the windfall profit tax, just wondering that your people in D.C., when they talk to the senator, what's your guess is whether there will be sufficient vote in the Senate for them that to pass that, if the President does propose one? The second question is that I want to see what is your RD strategy, renewable diesel strategy beyond the retail conversion that you're currently doing? I mean, the first phase will come onstream soon and then full completion probably in 2024. And so that I want to see that beyond that, if that is going to be one-off or let's say, more maybe that strategy going forward on that?"
"Mark Lashier -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yes. Thanks, Paul. This is Mark. Your first question, we've been, along with the rest of our peers in the industry, engaged with the Biden administration around the challenges that they see in the marketplace. And it's earnings season, a lot of integrated oils are coming out with very, very solid results. And I think that's the target of the President's latest comments. Our view is when we get off of the public rhetoric and engage with them to address the issues of inventories and supply and cost and price, it's been constructive. And they know that they have to proceed with caution because things that they try to do could disrupt the markets even more. And they are listening, and they are taking into account the advice that we've been giving them along with our peers. You have to remember that there's an election next week, and I think that there's going to be a lot of rhetoric right up to that point in time.OperatorThank you. Next question will be..."
"Mark Lashier -- President and Chief Executive Officer I'm sorry, Paul. I was so focused on that first question, I forgot to answer your second question, Paul. Renewable diesel strategy. Yes. Obviously, the first step is the successful execution and commissioning of the Rodeo Renewed project. We put our toe in the water there with a small unit at the San Francisco refinery. We call it Unit 250. That's been quite successful in the marketplace. We are involved in aggregating feedstocks, both in preparation for Rodeo as well as our Humber facility. We're producing renewable fuels there, including sustainable aviation fuel. Rodeo will provide some sustainable aviation fuel as well. And so we kind of look at that business as renewable fuels, not just renewable diesel. And we're taking a hard look at options around sustainable aviation fuel. Certainly, the RA Act was supportive of SAF. And we've got some thoughts there that we're looking at. Bottom line is whatever we do, we're going to be incredibly disciplined, and we've got to ensure that we've got a competitive advantage when we go off in these directions, that we've got line of sight on feedstocks and that we've got the right capital cost when we execute these projects. So that's the primary focus, not just getting bigger but being better in every one of those things that we do.OperatorThank you, sir. Our last question is from Jason Gabelman at Cowen. Please go ahead. Your line is open."
"Jason Gabelman --  Cowen and Company -- Analyst Hey. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to ask on the cash flow since you didn't provide some of the detail that you typically do on the cash flow walk. Can you just discuss some of the items that impacted your cash from operations, working capital and otherwise that could have impacted cash conversion? And then secondly,  there were some -- and this maybe front-running something that you may discuss next week. But there were some reports about reducing headcount and optimizing the workforce. Can you just discuss any plans that you have around doing that and improvement in cost as a result? Mark Lashier -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yes. Kevin will touch on the cash flow detail. I'll talk about those reports on headcount. Kevin Mitchell -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yes, Jason. In terms of operating cash flow,  that detail will be available next week at the time -- early next week when we file the 10-Q. But what I would say, I know there's a lot of interest in working capital and we're still finalizing that level of detail. But what I would say is, based on everything we've seen to date, we don't think that working capital was a very significant component of operating cash flow. So there'll be a working capital impact, but it will be pretty minor relative to some of the other numbers that you have seen out there. And I'll just leave it at that."
"Mark Lashier -- President and Chief Executive Officer Yes. Jason, on the headcount issue, yes, we've been focused on our business transformation for well over a year now, and this is a facet of that work, and we've been executing that portion of the work. It's material. We will provide more details next week at investor day. I think though it's a clear signal of our commitment to lower our cost, to eliminate unnecessary work, to have an optimal organization to go forward in what is an ever-changing volatile environment that we did execution reduction in force during the best two quarters in our history."

"  With that, I will turn the call over to Albert.  Albert Bourla -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Chris. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I will briefly touch on some recent highlights. I will then spend the bulk of my time speaking to our expectations for what we feel will be a promising and prosperous future for Pfizer and the patients we serve. In addition to generating a stellar financial performance, since our last earnings call, we reported positive pivotal data for several exciting pipeline programs, including our RSV vaccine candidate for older adults, Prevnar 20 for children, the potential combination of treatment of Talzenna and Xtandi in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, our pentavalent meningococcal vaccine candidate for adolescents and young adults as well as exciting progress for our GLP-1 program in type 2 diabetes and obesity. Just this morning, we announced positive top-line data from the Phase 3 clinical trial investigating our bivalent RSV vaccine candidate when administered to pregnant participants to help protect their infants from RSV disease after birth. We established a new commercial structure within our global biopharmaceutical business that is focused on three broad therapeutic areas: primary care, specialty care, and oncology. We believe this new structure will enable us to maximize the commercial success of the multiple exciting product launches, including several potential blockbusters that are poised to emerge from our scientific pipeline over the next few years."
"  We have continued to advance potentially game-changing vaccines in the fight against respiratory disease by entering into a Phase 3 study for our mRNA flu vaccine candidate and initiating a Phase 1 study for a vaccine candidate that combines our mRNA flu and COVID-19 vaccine in one sort. We completed the acquisitions of Biohaven Pharmaceuticals and Global Blood Therapeutics, giving us market-leading franchises in both migraine and sickle cell disease, respectively. Less than six months ago after launching"
"Dave Denton -- Chief Financial Officer Thank you, Albert, and good morning. I'll begin this morning with a few comments regarding how the company continues to deploy capital in a disciplined manner in support of long-term growth and, importantly, enhanced shareholder returns. As you know, Pfizer's cash generation capabilities has expanded significantly over the past several years and the efficient deployment of this capital is more critical than ever. During the first nine months of 2020, the company has de"
"Mikael Dolsten -- President of Worldwide Research and Development and Medical Thank you, Dave. Today, I will focus attention on high-value programs that will potentially deliver breakthroughs in areas of high unmet need and are expected to be key contributors to our growth aspiration through 2025 and beyond. With anchor products such as Comirnaty, Paxlovid, Ibrance, and Xtandi we are building out comprehensive franchises in several areas, including respiratory, metabolic disorders, genetic hematology and ce"
"Chris Stevo -- Senior Vice President and Chief Investor Relations Officer Thanks, Mikael. With that, let's start the Q&A session. We have about 30 minutes for this session. We will answer as many questions as time permits. And Investor Relations will be available after the call to answer any follow-up questions. Chelsea, please go ahead and queue up the first question. Questions & Answers: Operator[Operator instructions] Our first question will come from Umer Raffat with Evercore ISI. Chris Stevo -- Senior Vice President and Chief Investor Relations Officer Umer, are you there?OperatorUmer, your line is open, please make sure you are not muted. We'll go to our next question. Colin Bristow with UBS. Colin Bristow --  UBS -- Analyst On COVID expectations, should we expect anything from you here on the December 12 Investor event? And then just more broadly around this, how are you thinking conceptually about guiding to this? Will it be similar to last year? Are you thinking of more sort of scenario-based guiding? Anything that would be helpful. And then just a sort of temperature check on business development, if you could update us on your priorities and interests. And then from a deal perspective, just how big would you be willing to go? Albert Bourla -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thank you. On December 12, what you should expect, it is a good overview of our very important new product launches in the coming 18 months, with more details about the science and the market potential of those launches as well as some of the most important pipeline potential, new medicines and vaccines, that they are not going to be launched in the next 18 months but will be launched in the period between '24 and '30. Now for the BD priorities, I would ask Aamir to reiterate once more our strategy when it comes to BD."
"Aamir Malik -- Chief Business and Innovation Officer Thanks for the question, Colin. The BD priorities remain consistent with what we've articulated before. And principally, we are most excited about scientific substrate that has the potential for patient breakthroughs. That's going to continue to be our north star. We're looking for deals that accelerate our top-line growth in the back half of the decade. And importantly, we're focused on opportunities where we can add substantial value, and that can come in the form of either shaping the science or also accelerate in our commercial momentum. And if you look at the deals that we announced and closed in 2022 including Arena, Biohaven, Array, GBT, they would all be very consistent with those priorities. We've said that we are agnostic to size of transaction. But you've also heard us be very clear about the fact that cost synergy-driven deals is not where our focus is going to be. We're going to be focused on driving growth through our BD."
"Albert Bourla -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Aamir. And also, Dave, maybe you can also address the question about guidance on COVID and are we going to provide it and when for '23, etc. Dave Denton -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. Thank you, Albert. Maybe let me discuss the stage as it relates to COVID and the COVID franchise. I think if you look out longer term, the franchise is going to be a multibillion-dollar franchise in the respect that this is going to be somewhat like a flu, sustained flu, but actually more deadly than the flu. So, therefore, I think the products, both from a vaccine and the therapy perspective that Pfizer has developed, they're going to be quite relevant for many years to come. Having said that, when we provide guidance for 2023, when it's appropriate to do so, we will give investors a perspective on what our expectations are for the year. We will break out that guidance specifically so you can hold us accountable for delivering on those revenue promises when the time comes.OperatorNext, we have Louise Chen with Cantor."
"Louise Chen --  Cantor Fitzgerald -- Analyst So I wanted to ask you, first off,  how you think about -- or maybe more color on how you think about the pushes and pulls in 2023. There's a lot of moving parts there. And then secondly, on your RSV franchise, there seems to be several players with drugs in development and they've all reported out positive data. So curious how you think about this market playing out over time? Albert Bourla -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yes. Let me say a few words about the push and pull, then I will ask Angela to complement and speak about how we see the RSV market. Clearly, '23 is a very, very important year for us given the unprecedented number of new launches that we are going to have in the next 18 months. And most of them will happen in '23 and some beginning of the first quarter of '24. But we are launching products, not only a very big number of them, but only the internal ones, $20 billion, excluding the BD, Biohaven, and the Global Blood $20 billion of peak sales were expected, 2030 sales we are expecting from launches. So it's a very, very big number. And it's very important for us to do it well. So clearly that will bring our non-COVID business will be a significant boost for our non-COVID business. Now when we move to COVID, we expect '23 will be a transition year with likely in the U.S. moving from government model into a commercial model for vaccines and therapeutics. The timing is not certain. So we are ready to do either side, but will be phased over the years. And it likely will not be the same for Paxlovid or Comirnaty. And clearly also, there will be some stuff that will have to be depleted in '23. And clearly, there will be new price dynamics as we are moving to '23. So probably will be a little bit more of a transitional year in '23 until it will be established into more like flu volumes type of market, but of course, with different price points and different severity of the disease, that will bring both therapeutics and vaccines into a multibillion-dollar franchise, but we are not going to predict now what will be the number for the years out, but we will try to be as accurate as possible for our '23 numbers when we will provide guidance. Now under anything to add on the push and pulls, you are carrying a lot of the weight for the new launches and also speak about one of them, which is going to be the RSV maternal and adult."
"Angela Hwang -- President, Pfizer Biopharmaceuticals Well, we're extremely excited about both the adult vaccine as well as the maternal vaccine. First and foremost, because it is in the sweet spot of what Pfizer does, respiratory vaccines, right? We have a lot of experience of this created through the legacy of our pneumococcal franchise and the strength we have there, but also recently from Comirnaty. I'll also add that Pfizer is the only company that has both the adult vaccine as well as the maternal vaccine. And it really does fit so extremely well into our existing commercial footprint. These are large populations, both the adult as well as maternal. Let me just start with adult and just sort of characterize that a bit. There Arena 61 million 65-year-olds, all of whom are eligible for the vaccination. It'"
"s actually a -- it's quite a devastating disease. The hospital costs from RSV for adults is over $1.2 billion. It is also underreported and underdiagnosed. And so we have a really great opportunity here to drive awareness of this disease, but also to use the commercial footprint that we already have to create awareness, to create education, and to bring this vaccine to those who need it. Equally, in the maternal space, a devastating disease. Most of the mortality and the morbidity is in infants that are under six months old and those that are preterm. And actually, over 102,000 deaths worldwide are resulting from instantiations of RSV. So again, we see a tremendous opportunity to make a difference here. As you know, through the work that we've done on Prevnar, we have a tremendous legacy in pediatric vaccines. And so that, coupled with our strength in women's health, and the commercial footprint we have there as well, is going to be perfectly suited for us to launch the maternal RSV vaccine. And so bringing all of this together, I think that we have the scientific knowledge, we have the technology, we have the relationships with the vaccinators and the sites of vaccinations. We are also very well versed in our work with the vaccine technical committees around the world, in bringing together a broad recommendation, which we believe is what's going to give us access to many, many infants as well as adults to these two tremendous breakthroughs. So I think we have the best-in-class capabilities to do a great job with this respiratory portfolio."
"Albert Bourla -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Very well, Angela, and I agree with you.OperatorNext, we have Steve Scala with Cowen. Steve Scala --  Cowen and Company -- Analyst I have three questions, but they're all short. First, what impact on RSV-associated infant hospitalizations did Pfizer see in the Phase 3 Matisse trial? Second, can you tell us what Nurtec sales were in Q3? I know you didn't own Biohaven in Q3, but you likely know the number. And then lastly, all things considered, is it unrealistic to think that Comirnaty plus Paxlovid sales could be as much as $15 billion in 2030? Albert Bourla -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thank you very much. Mikael, what about the RSV data? Mikael Dolsten -- President of Worldwide Research and Development and Medical Thank you for the question. So as you have seen in our press release, we reported out very impressive data and two separate primary endpoints that were independent, it is sufficient to hit one for filing. And to our privilege and encouragement, we hit strongly on the most important. And that was defined as severe, medically attended lower tract respiratory infection, where we had close to 82% vaccine efficacy. That is defined by clinical features, such as the rate and the stress of respiration, oxygenation levels, etc., in the children and will include patients, whether they are hospitalized or not. We will later release data on secondary endpoints that include hospitalization. When you look at this dramatic effect on the severe infections, it seems very reasonable to project that we will have a dramatic impact in lowering hospitalization. I'm probably talking about tens of thousands of hospitalizations in the U.S. that may not happen if this vaccine is used to vaccinate maternal prior to delivering the children as appropriately studied in this vaccination. So we're very encouraged and optimistic about that type of value."
"Albert Bourla -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Mikael. Before I turn to Dave to answer the question about the sales of Nurtec in the third quarter, let me make a comment on Comirnaty and Paxlovid and the franchise. Clearly, we said they will provide us a good picture of what we expect to be the sales for next year. Now you're asking about year 2030, which is even more challenging. But also, the way you are asking the question,  is it unthinkable -- is it unreasonable to think that we could have a $15 billion franchise? Well, taken that it is 55 right now, it's not unreasonable to think that in year 2030 could be that. But it's not clear that it will be done. So that will depend on the virus and how it saves. Will depend on if it will become a standard practice to vaccinate together with flu. If we will have a combination product, clearly, that will enhance this direction. So I think it's a little bit too early, but no, it's not unreasonable to think given where we are right now. Now, what about Nurtec sales?"
"Dave Denton -- Chief Financial Officer Yes. Steve, this is Dave. As you said, we didn't own the business last quarter, but maybe just a little bit of color on how the product is performing. If you look at the volume last year, or last quarter, rather, Q3, if you compare it to last year, it was about a 45% growth rate in year-over-year script volume. And then if you look at it sequentially, which I think is really important, we saw about a 16% growth rate sequentially Q2 going into Q3. So I think this shows the promise of this product, number one. And number two, I think once we get it, now that we have it in the hands of our field force, and into our primary care force, we can really maximize the value of this needed medicine into the patient population here in the U.S. and abroad.OperatorOur next question will come from Robyn Karnauskas with Truist Securities."
"Robyn Karnauskas --  Truist Securities -- Analyst Great. On Paxlovid,  I was just -- I'm sure you saw the recent publication citing how many people have died from not even getting an antiviral. Can you talk a little bit about the efforts you're making to educate physicians to give the drug. And do you think we'll ever get to a point where people will be more comfortable, doctors will be more comfortable taking it, given all the news around the Paxlovid rebound? And second question, can you talk a little bit about the opportunity for vitiligo in alopecia in your pipeline? And when should we hear the next readout?"
"Albert Bourla -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thank you very much. Both questions, I think, can be answered very nicely by Angela. Angela Hwang -- President, Pfizer Biopharmaceuticals Well, thank you for the question. So let's talk a little bit about Paxlovid and how that's been going. I mean, first and foremost, we are under an EUA, so that means that we are working hand-in-hand with the U.S. government to ensure that we are providing the education to the public. The U.S. government and the state government, I think, have created a tremendous amount of education already using public service announcements and public campaigns. And equally, we have provided education to all the potential prescribers of Paxlovid. So if you think about where we are today, over 500,000 physicians have written Paxlovid. And what you have in addition to that is education that we've provided not only to doctors, but also to pharmacists. We've trained over 80,000 pharmacists in terms of how to write Paxlovid. And so I think the education is really firing off, both at a prescriber level but also at a consumer level where we have worked, again, also closely with state governments and local governments, to ensure that we're providing the right amount of education. I will say that the test-to-treat sites that the government has stood up federally, there's now 27,000 of those around the country, have also been great sources of education for Paxlovid. So I think that it'"
"s -- frankly, I think it's going well. I think that we're continuing to do more in anticipation of the fall. But the fact that you've had 500,000 physicians write this Paxlovid already is a great indicator of their confidence with this. And the fact that probably the one most important area of education that we need to continue to emphasize is just who are the eligible people for Paxlovid. And actually, if you look at the definition that the CDC provides, there are 22 risk factors for who should be eligible. And they include those who are over 65, right, age-related risks, but equally risks such as mental health illness, risks such as an inactive lifestyle, risks that you may not be aware of. And so I think that that's really where we want to focus now through this fall."
"Albert Bourla -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer And what about vitiligo? Angela Hwang -- President, Pfizer Biopharmaceuticals I think we're really excited about these new indications for ritlecitinib.  I think probably the main theme here is that there are not effective -- there aren' t any treatments for these highly -- very serious inflammatory conditions today. So huge unmet need, just a place where there's just no options today. So the fact that we're able to bring a treatment like this to market I think will have tremendous uptake by patients who up to now just are left with no options. Albert Bourla -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer And, William,  can you please address a little bit the issue about the Paxlovid rebound that was also -- William Pao -- Executive Vice President, Chief Development Officer Sure, Albert. Well, Mikael already mentioned that we gave updated data from our EPIC-HR study on the effect of Paxlovid versus placebo in patients with high risk for COVID-19. And we had additional end points there which we showed a 100% decrease in ICU admissions, a 100% decrease in mechanical ventilation among hospitalized patients. 100% who got tested at home versus 53% placebo. We also had 82% reduction in oxygen support, 86% of COVID-19-related hospitalization, 89% reduction in need days hospitalized versus 100 patients and also a 73% reduction in only COVID-19-related medical visits. Importantly, we also showed sustained time to symptom alleviation and sustain time to symptom resolution of an impact of two to three days of Paxlovid versus placebo. But most importantly, about rebounds, there's been several studies recently that have shown actually the rebound occurs with COVID in general. For example, there was a recent publication of 158 patients of patients who got placebo with COVID and actually a third of those had recurrent symptoms after the resolution of their symptoms, suggesting that it's a phenomenon associated with COVID and not with Paxlovid. Importantly, we also haven't seen any evidence of resistance that is clinically meaningful. Whereas with antibodies, for example, we have seen that we also can get symptom rebound, but that is associated with resistance. So again, Paxlovid not associated with resistance but the antibodies are. So we feel very confident that Paxlovid has a significant impact in the goal against COVID.OperatorNext, we have Andrew Baum with Citi."
"Andrew Baum --  Citi -- Analyst A couple of questions. Firstly, as it relates to the maternal RSV vaccine. Could you talk about reimbursement coverage in the U.S. I'm assuming you'll get an ACIP recommendation, and therefore there will be zero out of pocket which may differentiate it versus the monoclonal. And I'm sure on a cost basis, that will be material. And then secondly, could you talk to your efforts with your ER degrader with Arvinas in light of the evolving data on SERDs, thinking about Astra's recent positive trial and then the L1 subgroup. Do you believe that this is a function of defining the right patient population at the right stage of the disease rather than the potential risk development of the entire category?"
"Albert Bourla -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Drew, thank you. In the interest of time, let me give the first answer. Yes, you are right. As long as the product is recommended by CDC, and we believe with this part of efficacy will be recommended, there is zero co-pay. The relevance of the insurance, if it is commercial or if it is public, their obligation is zero co-pay from the payers, and they have to cover it. Mikael, what about the Arvinas molecule? Mikael Dolsten -- President of Worldwide Research and Development and Medical Yes. Thank you for asking. Clearly, we think that there are two factors that will separate out the good drugs from the less good in this class of degraders. And we think the Protac, which is the mechanistic name of the 471, is more effective in down-regulating the receptor and selecting the right patients compared to standard of care, that includes selecting patients that have gene receptor mutations and need more powerful drugs and is related to the property of the drug itself. We look forward to advance that drug with Arvinas to pivotal studies in the relatively near future and also to soon reveal to you a lot of progress we had in our breast cancer franchise, including the CDK4 drug. And that may be part of what we consider to share in December at the investor update on launches and next wave."
"Albert Bourla -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Mikael, another reason to attend this great event.OperatorNext, we have Evan Seigerman with BMO Capital Markets. Evan Seigerman --  BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst Congrats on the progress. Two questions for me. On BD, I want to be briefed here. But can you talk about what other therapeutic areas you might want to explore? I know you're in neurology with Biohaven, nonmalignant hematology with GBT and, of course, inflammation. Would you consider adding oncology? And on the same line, kind of, Albert, in some previous comments ahead of this call you had mentioned going alone with some of your mRNA technologies. What applications of mRNA do you see outside of COVID? I mean this personalized cancer vaccine is an area that you would explore."
"Albert Bourla -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Maybe I'll pass that to Aamir. Aamir Malik -- Chief Business and Innovation Officer Sure. I mean, thanks for the question. As far as our therapeutic areas of focus, as I mentioned before in our priorities, our focus is on where we can make a difference and shape the science. And the good news is we actually have distinctive capabilities across many different therapeutic areas. So you've seen us active in internal medicine, anti-infectives, INI, and, certainly, oncology. And our focus is going to be on where we have breakthrough science and the potential to shape it. And we feel very good about the breadth of our scientific capabilities to give us lots of flexibility to work in different BA."
