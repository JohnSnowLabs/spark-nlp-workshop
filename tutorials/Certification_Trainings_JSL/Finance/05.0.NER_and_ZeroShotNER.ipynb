It is a neural network architecture that automatically detects word and character-level features using a hybrid bidirectional LSTM and CNN architecture, eliminating the need for most feature engineering steps.\n","  \n","  In the original framework, the CNN extracts a fixed length feature vector from character-level features. For each word, these vectors are concatenated and fed to the BLSTM network and then to the output layers. They employed a stacked bi-directional recurrent neural network with long short-term memory units to transform word features into named entity tag scores. The extracted features of each word are fed into a forward LSTM network and a backward LSTM network. The output of each network at each time step is decoded by a linear layer and a log-softmax layer into log-probabilities for each tag category. These two vectors are then simply added together to produce the final output. In the architecture of the proposed framework in the original paper, 50-dimensional pretrained word embeddings is used for word features, 25-dimension character embeddings is used for char features, and capitalization features (allCaps, upperInitial, lowercase, mixedCaps, noinfo) are used for case features."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"bee4b28c-dda1-4708-9240-edb6fe105013","metadata":{"id":"bee4b28c-dda1-4708-9240-edb6fe105013"},"source":["### Finance SEC NER Model\n","\n","This model detects Organizations (ORG), People (PER) and Locations (LOC) in financial texts.

Getting Result with LightPipeline\n","\n","LightPipelines are Spark NLP specific Pipelines, equivalent to Spark ML Pipeline, but meant to deal with smaller amounts of data. They’re useful working with small datasets, debugging results, or when running either training or prediction from an API that serves one-off requests.\n","\n","Spark NLP LightPipelines are Spark ML pipelines converted into a single machine but the multi-threaded task, becoming more than 10x times faster for smaller amounts of data (small is relative, but 50k sentences are roughly a good maximum). To use them, we simply plug in a trained (fitted) pipeline and then annotate a plain text. We don't even need to convert the input text to DataFrame in order to feed it into a pipeline that's accepting DataFrame as an input in the first place. This feature would be quite useful when it comes to getting a prediction for a few lines of text from a trained ML model.\n","\n"," **It is nearly 10x faster than using Spark ML
