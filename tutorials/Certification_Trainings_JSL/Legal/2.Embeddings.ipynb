For sentences, paragraph, document classification - we use Sentence Embeddings.\n","\n","In this notebook, we use Spark NLP Legal Word (**roberta_embeddings_legal_roberta_base**) and Sentence (**sent_bert_base_uncased_legal**) Embeddings to get those numerical representations of the semantics of the texts. The result is a 768 embeddings matrix, impossible to process by the human eye.\n","\n","There are many techniques we can use to visualize those embeddings. We are using one of them - Principal Component Analysis, a dimensionality reduction process, carried out by Spark MLLib.
