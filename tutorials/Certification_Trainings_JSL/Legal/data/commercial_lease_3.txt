2.         PREMISES. 
2.1         Premises.    Subject to the terms, covenants and conditions set forth in this Lease, Landlord hereby leases the Premises to Tenant and Tenant hereby leases the Premises from Landlord. The approximate total Rentable Area of the Premises is specified in Article 1. Landlord and Tenant hereby agree that such approximation is reasonable, is not subject to adjustment by either party, and no terms based thereon shall be subject to revision whether or the not the actual Rentable Area is more or less than as set forth in this Lease. The building in which the Premises will be located is sometimes referred to herein as the “Building”. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Lease, Landlord hereby reserves the exclusive right to the exterior side walls, rear walls and roof of the Building, but expressly grants to Tenant exclusive use of the “mezzanine space” below the roof. Together, the Premises, the Building, the legal parcel upon which the Building now stands, and the Common Area (as defined below) are sometimes referred to in this Lease as the “Property.” 
2.2         Common Area.     Landlord hereby grants to Tenant and its officers, employees, agents, contractors, invitees, permitted subtenants and any additional permitted occupants of the Premises (collectively, “Tenant’s Agents”) an exclusive license to reasonably use the landscape areas, sidewalks, driveways, Parking Areas (as defined in Section 2.3) and other public amenities (the “Common Area”) associated with the Premises during the Term. Tenant’s rights to the Common Area shall be subject to the Rules and Regulations described in Section 23.1, to Landlord’s reserved rights described in Article 16 and to other applicable provisions of this Lease. 
2.3         Parking.     Provided that an Event of Default by Tenant is not in existence, Tenant and Tenant’s Agents shall have the exclusive right to use any parking areas now on the Property and designated by Landlord for tenant use (the “Parking Area”) for parking operable motor vehicles and for ingress to and egress from the Property in connection with Tenant’s use of the Premises, subject to the following terms and conditions: 
(a)         Tenant and Tenant’s Agents shall have the right to use the entire Parking Area, as specified in Article 1. 
 
- 3 -  

(b)         Tenant’s license shall not be assigned, sublet or otherwise transferred separately from the Premises. 
(c)         Tenant shall not at any time park, or permit the parking of the trucks or vehicles of Tenant or Tenant’s Agents in any portion of the Parking Areas or Common Area not designated by Landlord for such use by Tenant. Tenant shall not park nor permit to be parked any inoperative vehicles or store any materials or equipment on any portion of the Parking Area or other areas of the Common Area. 
(d)         Tenant agrees to assume responsibility for compliance by Tenant’s Agents with the parking provisions contained in this Section. Tenant hereby authorizes Landlord at Tenant’s expense to attach violation stickers or notices to such vehicles not parked in compliance with this Section and to tow away any such vehicles, in addition, one or more specific section of the Parking Area may be set aside by Landlord from time to time for visitor parking for the Property, for loading purposes, for car or van pool parking, or for other specific uses as designated by Landlord. 
3.         ACCEPTANCE. 
(a)         Prior to entering into this Lease, Tenant has occupied approximately 8,442 square feet the Premises pursuant to the Prior Lease, which space is identified on the attached Exhibit B (the “Pre-Occupied Space”), and Tenant has made a thorough and independent examination of the remainder of the Premises (the “New Space”) and all matters related to Tenant’s decision to enter into this Lease. Tenant is thoroughly familiar with all aspects of the Property and its construction and is satisfied that it is in an acceptable condition and meets Tenant’s needs. Tenant acknowledges and agrees that Landlord has not been in possession of the Premises nor operated the Premises prior to the Commencement Date. Tenant does not rely on, and Landlord does not make, any express or implied representations or warranties as to any matters including, without limitation, (a) the physical condition of the Property, the Building Structure, or the Building Systems (including, without limitation, the indoor air quality), (b) the existence, quality, adequacy or availability of utilities serving the Property, (c) the size of the Premises, the Building or the Property, (d) the use, habitability, merchantability, fitness or suitability of the Premises for Tenant’s intended use, (e) the likelihood of deriving business from Tenant’s location or the economic feasibility of Tenant’s business, (f) Hazardous Materials in the Premises, or on, in under or around the Property, (g) zoning, entitlements or any Applicable Laws which may apply to Tenant’s use of the Premises or business operations, or the Property’s compliance with Applicable Laws, or (h) any other matter. Tenant has satisfied itself as to such suitability and other pertinent matters by Tenant’s own inquiries and tests into all matters relevant in determining whether to enter into this Lease, Tenant accepts the Premises in their existing “as-is” condition. Tenant shall, by entering into and occupying the Premises pursuant to this Lease, be deemed to have accepted the Premises and to have acknowledged that the same are in good order, condition and repair. 
4.         TERM. 
4.1         Term. The Premises are leased for a term (the “Term”) commencing on the Commencement Date and ending on the Expiration Date. The Term shall end on the 
 
- 4 -  

Expiration Date, or such earlier date on which this Lease terminates pursuant to its terms. The date upon which this Lease actually terminates, whether by expiration of the Term or earlier termination pursuant to the terms of this Lease, is sometimes referred to in this Lease as the “Termination Date”. 
4.2         Failure to Deliver Possession.   If for any reason Landlord cannot deliver possession all or any portion of the Premises to Tenant on the Commencement Date, then (a) the validity of this Lease and the obligations of Tenant under this Lease shall not be affected by any such delay in delivery, nor shall any such delay result in any extension of the Expiration Date, and (b) Tenant shall have no claim against Landlord arising out of Landlord’s failure to deliver possession of the Premises on the Commencement Date. If Landlord is unable to deliver the New Space to Tenant on the Commencement Date, the Commencement Date for the Pre-Occupied Space shall be deemed to occur on the Commencement Date set forth in Article 1, and the Commencement Date for the New Space shall be deemed to occur on the date the New Space is delivered to Tenant. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the Expiration Date be changed or extended as a result of any delay in the delivery of possession of the Premises or any portion thereof. 
4.3         No Renewal Option.   Landlord shall have no obligation to extend or renew this Lease upon expiration or termination of this Lease, or to enter into a new lease of the Premises with Tenant upon the expiration or termination of this Lease. Tenant has no option to extend the Term of this Lease and Landlord reserves the right to lease the Premises to any other person or entity after the end of the Term. 
5.         RENT. 
5.1         Base Rent. Subject to the terms of Section 5.5 below, commencing upon the Commencement Date, and thereafter during the Term, Tenant shall pay to Landlord the monthly Base Rent specified in Article 1 on or before the first day of each month, in advance, without any prior notice or demand and without any deductions or setoff whatsoever (except as otherwise expressly provided in this Lease). Base Rent shall be paid by wire transfer pursuant to the instructions set forth in Article 1 or, if requested by Landlord, at the address specified for Landlord in Article 1 or at such other place as Landlord designates in writing. If the Commencement Date occurs on a day other than the first day of a calendar month, or the Termination Date occurs on a day other than the last day of a calendar month, then the Base Rent for such fractional month wilt be prorated on the basis of the actual number of days in such month. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, Tenant shall commence paying Rent for the PreOccupied Space on the Commencement Date and the Base Rent for the New Space shall be abated for the first four (4) months of the Term commencing on the Commencement Date of the New Space, as determined in accordance with Section 4.2 above. Tenant shall pay Operating Expenses for the New Space during such four (4) month period, commencing on the Commencement Date of the New Space, in accordance with the terms of Article 7 below, 
5.2         Additional Rent.   All sums due from Tenant to Landlord or to any third party under the terms of this Lease (other than Base Rent) shall be additional rent (“Additional Rent”), including without (imitation the charges for Operating Expenses (described in Article 7) and all sums incurred by Landlord due to Tenant’s failure to perform its obligations under this 
 
- 5 -  

Lease. All Additional Rent that is payable to Landlord shall be paid at the time and place that Base Rent is paid, unless otherwise specifically provided in this Lease. Landlord will have the same remedies for a default in the payment of any Additional Rent as for a default in the payment of Base Rent. Together, Base Rent and Additional Rent are sometimes collectively referred to in this Lease as “Rent”. 
5.3         Late Payment.   Any unpaid Rent shall bear interest from the date due until paid at the interest Rate. In addition, Tenant recognizes that late payment of any Rent will result in administrative expense to Landlord, the extent of which expense is difficult and economically impracticable to determine. Therefore, Tenant agrees that if Tenant fails to pay any Rent within five (5) days after its due date, an additional late charge of five percent (5%) of the sums so overdue shall become immediately due and payable. Tenant agrees that the late payment charge is a reasonable estimate of the additional administrative costs and detriment that will be incurred by Landlord as a result of such failure by Tenant. In the event of nonpayment of interest or late charges on overdue Rent, Landlord shall have, in addition to all other rights and remedies, the rights and remedies provided in this Lease and by law for nonpayment of Rent. 
5.4         Security Deposit.   On or before the Commencement Date, Tenant shall deliver to Landlord the Security Deposit described in Article 1 in the form of cash. The Security Deposit shall be held by Landlord as security for the faithful performance of this Lease by Tenant of all of the terms, covenants and conditions of this Lease. If there is an Event of Default by Tenant with respect to any provisions of this Lease (including but not limited to the payment of Rent); if Tenant files a petition in bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, dissolution or liquidation under any law; makes an assignment for the benefit of its creditors; consents to or acquiesces in the appointment of a receiver of itself or the Premises, or if a court of competent jurisdiction enters an order or judgment appointing a receiver of Tenant or the Premises; or if a court of competent jurisdiction enters an order or judgment approving a petition filed against Tenant under any bankruptcy, insolvency or liquidation law, then in any such case Landlord may, without waiving any of Landlord’s other rights or remedies under this Lease, apply the Security Deposit in whole or in part to remedy any failure by Tenant to pay any sums due under this Lease, to repair or maintain the Premises, to perform any other terms, covenants or conditions contained in this Lease, to compensate Landlord for any loss or damages which Landlord may suffer as a result thereof, including without limitation any lost rent to which Landlord is entitled in the event the Lease terminates or is rejected as a result of any of the foregoing. Should Landlord so apply any portion of the Security Deposit, Tenant shall replenish the Security Deposit to the original amount within ten (10) days after written demand by Landlord, Landlord shall not be required to keep the Security Deposit separate from its general funds, and Tenant shall not be entitled to interest on the Security Deposit. If Tenant has fully complied with all of the terms, covenants and conditions of this Lease, the Security Deposit (less any amount applied to cleaning, repairing damage to the Premises caused by Tenant or otherwise applied in accordance with the provisions of this Lease) shall be returned to Tenant after the Expiration Date and after delivery of possession of the Premises to Landlord in the manner required by this Lease. In the event of any Assignment of this Lease by Tenant, such Assignment shall be deemed to include an assignment of Tenant’s rights to recover the Security Deposit, and Landlord’s agreement to return the Security Deposit shall run only to Tenant’s assignee and not to the original Tenant. Tenant hereby expressly waives the provisions of 
 
- 6 -  

California Civil Code Section 1950.7 or under any similar law, statute or ordinance now or hereafter in effect. 
6.         USE OF PREMISES AND CONDUCT OF BUSINESS.

Tenant may use and occupy the Premises during the Term solely for the uses specified and permitted in Article 1 and for no other purpose without the prior written consent of Landlord, such consent to be granted or withheld in Landlord’s sole and unfettered discretion. Tenant’s use of the Property shall in all respects comply with all Applicable Laws. 
6.2         Prohibited Uses.     Tenant shall not use the Premises or allow the Premises to be used for any illegal or immoral purpose, or so as to create waste, or constitute a private or public nuisance.

No loudspeaker or other device, system or apparatus which can be heard outside the Premises shall be used in or at the Premises without the prior written consent of Landlord. No explosives or firearms shall be brought into the Premises. Landlord shall have the right to enter and conduct an inspection of the Premises, at any reasonable time and upon reasonable advance notice (of not less than 24 hours, except in the case of an emergency in which event no prior notice shall be required, but Landlord shall give Tenant prompt notice following such emergency entry), to determine whether Tenant is complying with the terms of this Section 6.2. In the event such inspection identifies any deficiencies in Tenant’s compliance with the terms of this Section 6.2, Tenant shall promptly correct such deficiency and shall reimburse Landlord within thirty (30) days after written demand as Additional Rent for any costs incurred by Landlord in connection with such inspection. 
7.         OPERATING EXPENSES. 
7.1         Net Lease. This Lease is intended to be a net lease, and the Base Rent and all Additional Rent are to be paid by Tenant absolutely net of all costs and expenses relating to Landlord’s ownership, operation and maintenance of the Property, except as specifically provided in this Lease. The provisions of this Article 7 for the payment of Operating Expenses are intended to pass on to Tenant all such costs and expenses that are incurred by Landlord in connection with the ownership, operation and maintenance of the Property. 
7.2         Operating Expenses. “Operating Expenses” means the total costs and expenses paid or incurred by Landlord in connection with the ownership, management, operation, maintenance, repair and replacement of the Property, including, without limitation, all costs of:

Real Estate Taxes shall not include franchise, transfer, succession, gift, inheritance, gross receipts or capital stock taxes or income taxes measured by the net income of Landlord unless, due to a change in the method of taxation, any of such taxes is levied or assessed against Landlord as a substitute for, or as an addition to, in whole or in part, any other tax that would otherwise constitute a Real Estate Tax.

- 10 -  

7.3         Payment of Operating Expenses.     Commencing on the Commencement Date, Tenant shall pay to Landlord as Additional Rent one twelfth (1/12) of the Operating Expenses for each calendar year or portion thereof during the Term, in advance, on or before the first day of each month in an amount estimated by Landlord as stated in a written notice to Tenant; provided, further, that with respect to the Real Estate Taxes, in addition to the right to have Tenant billed directly by the County of Santa Clara for the Real Estate Taxes pursuant to Section 7.2(a), Landlord shall have the right to bill Tenant for, and require Tenant to pay to the Landlord the entire amount of each installment of the Real Estate Taxes not more than thirty (30) before the due date of such installment, or send any bill for Real Estate Taxes to Tenant and require that Tenant pay such Real Estate Taxes to the County of Santa Clara’s tax collector no later than the due date. Landlord may by written notice to Tenant revise such estimates from time to time and Tenant shall thereafter make payments on the basis of such revised estimates. With reasonable promptness after the expiration of each calendar year, and in any event not later than May 1st of each year, Landlord will furnish Tenant with a statement (“Landlord’s Expense Statement”) setting forth in reasonable detail the actual Operating Expenses for the prior calendar year. If the actual Operating Expenses for such year exceed the estimated Operating Expenses paid by Tenant for such year, Tenant shall pay to Landlord (whether or not this Lease has terminated) the difference between the amount of estimated Operating Expenses paid by Tenant and the actual Operating Expenses within thirty (30) days after the receipt of Landlord’s Expense Statement. If the total amount paid by Tenant for any year exceeds the actual Operating Expenses for that year, the excess shall be credited against the next installments of Base Rent due from Tenant to Landlord, or, if after the Termination Date, the excess shall first be credited against any unpaid Base Rent or Additional Rent due and any remaining excess shall be refunded to Tenant concurrently with the furnishing of Landlord’s Expense Statement. 
7.4         Proration.     If either the Commencement Date or the Termination Date occurs on a date other than the first or last day, respectively, of a calendar year, Operating Expenses for the year in which the Commencement Date or Termination Date occurs shall be prorated based on a 365-day year. 
7.5         Taxes on Tenant’s Property and Business.     Tenant shall pay prior to delinquency all taxes levied or assessed by any local, state or federal authority upon the conduct of Tenant’s business in the Premises or upon Tenant’s Property and shall deliver satisfactory evidence of such payment to Landlord. If the assessed value of the Property is increased by the inclusion of a value placed upon Tenant’s Property, Tenant shall pay to Landlord, upon written demand, the taxes so levied against Landlord, or the portion of Landlord’s taxes resulting from said increase in assessment, as determined from time to time by Landlord. 
7.6         Transit Fees.     Tenant shall pay as Additional Rent under this Lease its proportionate share of the cost of any transit services or traffic mitigation programs that Landlord implements in the Stanford Research Park, including without limitation charges for service and surcharges imposed directly or indirectly on the Property by any governmental agencies on or with respect to transit (including transit services which may be provided in the future to occupants of the Stanford Research Park) or automobile usage or parking facilities (collectively, “Transit Fees”). The share of Transit Fees allocated to the Building shall be assessed pro rata and on a non-discriminatory basis, based on a reasonable standard applied in a non-discriminatory manner by Landlord (for example, based on the rentable area of the Building as

(a)      The right to terminate this Lease upon written notice to Tenant, in which event Tenant shall immediately surrender possession of the Premises in accordance with Article 20. 
(b)      The right to bring a summary action for possession of the Premises. 
(c)      The rights and remedies described in California Civil Code Section 1951.2, pursuant to which Landlord may recover from Tenant upon a termination of the Lease, (i) the worth at the time of award of the unpaid rent which has been earned at the time of termination; (ii) the worth at the time of award of the amount by which the unpaid rent which would have been earned after termination until the time of award exceeds the amount of such rental loss that Tenant proves could have been reasonably avoided; (iii) the worth at the time of the award of the amount by which the unpaid rent for the balance of the term after the time of award exceeds the amount of such rental loss that Tenant proves could be reasonably avoided; and (iv) any other amount necessary to compensate Landlord for all the detriment proximately caused by Tenant’s failure to perform its obligations under this Lease or which in the ordinary course of events would be likely to result therefrom.

The “worth at the time of award” of the amount referred to in (iii) above shall be computed by discounting such amount at the discount rate of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco at the time of award plus one percent (1%). The detriment proximately caused by Tenant’s failure to perform its obligations under this Lease or which in the ordinary course of events would be likely to result therefrom includes, without limitation, (1) the unamortized portion of any brokerage or real estate agent’s commissions paid in connection with the execution of this Lease, (2) any direct costs or expenses incurred by Landlord in recovering possession of the Premises, maintaining or preserving the Premises after such default, (3) preparing the Premises for reletting to a new tenant, (4) any repairs or alterations to the Premises for such reletting, (5) leasing commissions, architect’s fees and any other costs necessary or appropriate either to relet the Premises or, if reasonably necessary in order to relet the Premises, to adapt them to another beneficial use by Landlord and (6) such amounts in addition to or in lieu of the foregoing as may be permitted from time to time by Applicable Law to the extent that such payment would not result in a duplicative recovery. 
(d)      The rights and remedies described in California Civil Code Section 1951.4 which allow Landlord to continue this Lease in effect and to enforce all of Landlord’s rights and remedies under this Lease, including the right to recover Base Rent, Additional Rent and other charges payable hereunder as they become due. Acts of maintenance or preservation, 
 
- 31 -  

efforts to relet the Premises or the appointment of a receiver upon Landlord’s initiative to protect its interest under this Lease shall not constitute a termination of Tenant’s right to possession. 
(e)      The right and power, as attorney-in-fact for Tenant, to sublet the Premises, to collect rents from all subtenants and to provide or arrange for the provision of all services and fulfill all obligations of Tenant under any permitted subleases. Landlord is hereby authorized on behalf of Tenant, but shall have absolutely no obligation, to provide such services and fulfill such obligations and to incur all such expenses and costs as Landlord deems necessary. Landlord is hereby authorized, but not obligated, to relet the Premises or any part thereof on behalf of Tenant, to incur such expenses as may be necessary to effect a relet and make said relet for such term or terms, upon such conditions and at such rental as Landlord in its reasonable discretion may deem proper. Tenant shall be liable immediately to Landlord for all costs and expenses Landlord incurs in reletting the Premises including, without limitation, brokers’ commissions, expenses of remodeling the Premises required by the reletting, and the cost of collecting rents and fulfilling the obligations of Tenant to any subtenant. If Landlord relets the Premises or any portion thereof, such reletting shall not relieve Tenant of any obligation hereunder, except that Landlord shall apply the rent or other proceeds actually collected by it as a result of such reletting against any amounts due from Tenant hereunder to the extent that such rent or other proceeds compensate Landlord for the nonperformance of any obligation of Tenant hereunder. Such payments by Tenant shall be due at such times as are provided elsewhere in this Lease, and Landlord need not wait until the termination of this Lease, by expiration of the Term or otherwise, to recover them by legal action or in any other manner. Landlord may execute any sublease made pursuant to this Section in its own name, and the tenant thereunder shall be under no obligation to see to the application by Landlord of any rent or other proceeds, nor shall Tenant have any right to collect any such rent or other proceeds. Landlord shall not by any reentry or other act be deemed to have accepted any surrender by Tenant of the Premises or Tenant’s interest therein, or be deemed to have otherwise terminated this Lease, or to have relieved Tenant of any obligation hereunder, unless Landlord shall have given Tenant express written notice of Landlord’s election to do so as set forth herein. 
(f)      The right to enjoin, and any other remedy or right now or hereafter available to a Landlord against a defaulting tenant under the laws of the State of California or the equitable powers of its courts, and not otherwise specifically reserved herein. 
(g)      if this Lease provides for a postponement of deferral of any Rent, or for commencement of payment of Rent to a date later than the Commencement Date, or for a period of “free” Rent or any other Rent concession (collectively, “Abated Rent”), the right upon an Event of Default to demand immediate payment of the value of the Abated Rent. 
15.3      Cumulative Remedies.     The various rights and remedies reserved to Landlord, including those not specifically described herein, shall, to the extent that the exercise of such right and/or remedy does not result in a duplicative recovery, be cumulative and shall be in addition to every other right or remedy provided for in this Lease or now or hereafter existing at law or In equity and the exercise of the rights or remedies provided for in this Lease or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity shall not preclude the simultaneous or later exercise by Landlord of any or all other rights and remedies.

If Tenant shall fail or neglect to do or perform any covenant or condition required under this Lease and such failure shall not be cured within any applicable grace period, Landlord may, on five (5) days notice to Tenant, but shall not be required to, make any payment payable by Tenant hereunder, discharge any lien, take out, pay for and maintain any insurance required hereunder, or do or perform or cause to be done or performed any such other act or thing (entering upon the Premises for such purposes, if Landlord shall so elect), and Landlord shall not be or be held liable or in any way responsible for any loss, disturbance, inconvenience, annoyance or damage resulting to Tenant on account thereof. Tenant shall repay to Landlord within twenty (20) days after demand the entire out-of-pocket cost and expense incurred by Landlord in connection with the cure, including, without limitation, compensation to the agents, consultants and contractors of Landlord and reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses.

Landlord shall not be required to inquire into the correctness of the amount of validity or any tax or lien that may be paid by Landlord and Landlord shall be duly protected in paying the amount of any such tax or lien claimed and in such event Landlord also shall have the full authority, in Landlord’s sole judgment and discretion and without prior notice to or approval by Tenant, to settle or compromise any such lien or tax. Any act or thing done by Landlord pursuant to the provisions of this Section shall not be or be construed as a waiver of any such failure by Tenant, or as a waiver of any term, covenant, agreement or condition herein contained or of the performance thereof. 
15.6      Landlord’s Default.     Landlord shall be in default under this Lease if Landlord fails to perform obligations required of Landlord within thirty (30) days after written notice by Tenant to Landlord and to the holder of any first mortgage or deed of trust covering the Property whose name and address shall have heretofore been furnished to Tenant in writing, specifying wherein Landlord has failed to perform such obligations; provided, however, that if the nature of Landlord’s obligations is such that more than thirty (30) days are required for performance, then Landlord shall not be in default if Landlord commences performance within such thirty (30) day period and thereafter diligently prosecutes the same to completion.

Landlord shall at all times during the Term have the sole and exclusive control of the Building Systems, Building Structure and the Common Area, and may at any time and from time to time during the Term restrain any use or occupancy of the Common Area except as authorized by this Lease.

All locks for all of the doors in, upon and about the Premises, excluding Tenant’s vaults and safes or special security areas (designated in advance in writing by Tenant) shall at all times be keyed to a master system and Landlord shall at all times have and retain a key with which to unlock all of said doors. Landlord shall have the right to use any and all means that Landlord may deem necessary or proper to open said doors in an emergency in order to obtain entry to any portion of the Premises, and any such entry to the Premises or portions thereof obtained by Landlord by any of said means, or otherwise, shall not under any circumstances be construed or deemed to be a forcible or unlawful entry into, or a detainer of, the Premises, or an eviction, actual or constructive, of Tenant from the Premises or any portion thereof, 
16.3      Easements.   Landlord reserves the right to grant or relocate all easements and rights of way which Landlord in its sole discretion may deem necessary or appropriate; provided that Tenant’s rights to use the Property is not materially impeded.

In the event that any ground lease or underlying lease terminates for any reason or any mortgage or deed of trust is foreclosed or a conveyance in lieu of foreclosure is made for any reason, (i) no person or entity which as a result of the foregoing succeeds to the interest of Landlord under this Lease, (a “Successor”) shall be liable for any default by Landlord or any other matter that occurred prior to the date the Successor succeeded to Landlord’s interest in this Lease, and (ii) Tenant shall, notwithstanding any subordination, attorn to and become the tenant of the Successor, at the option of the Successor. Tenant covenants and agrees, however, to execute and deliver, upon demand by Landlord and in the form reasonably requested by Landlord, any additional documents evidencing the priority or subordination of this Lease with respect to any such ground leases, underlying leases, reciprocal easement agreements or similar documents or instruments, or with respect to the lien of any such mortgage or deed of trust and Tenant’s failure to execute and deliver any such document within ten (10) Business Days after such demand by Landlord shall constitute an Event of Default without further notice. Landlord shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the written agreement of the mortgagee or trustee named in any mortgage, deed of trust or other encumbrance, and any landlord under any ground lease or underlying lease, that so long as an Event of Default by Tenant is not in existence, neither this Lease nor any of Tenant’s rights hereunder shall be terminated or modified, nor shall Tenant’s possession of the Premises be disturbed or interfered with, by any trustee’s sale or by an action or proceeding to foreclose said mortgage, deed of trust or other encumbrance.

Landlord shall not be responsible for or liable to Tenant and Tenant hereby releases Landlord, waives all claims against Landlord and assumes the risk for any injury, loss or damage to any person or property in or about the Property by or from any cause whatsoever (other than Landlord’s gross negligence or willful misconduct or breach of this Lease) including, without limitation, (a) acts or omissions of persons occupying adjoining premises, (b) theft or vandalism, (c) burst, stopped or leaking water, gas, sewer or steam pipes, (d) loss of utility service, (e) accident, fire or casualty, (f) nuisance, and (g) work done by Landlord in the Property.

- 35 -  

business at the Premises for a period of more than five (5) days, then Tenant shall be entitled to an abatement of Rent commencing on the sixth (6th) business day Tenant is unable to operate and continuing until the Premises are again available for operation of Tenant’s business. Such Rent abatement shall be Tenant’s only remedy in the event of a negligent interference with Tenant’s business and Tenant shall not be entitled to damages or to termination of this Lease arising from Landlord’s repairs, alterations, improvements or provision of utilities or services. No interference with Tenant’s operations in the Premises shall constitute a constructive or other eviction of Tenant. Tenant hereby waives and releases any right it may have to make repairs at Landlord’s expense under Sections 1941 and 1942 of the California Civil Code, or under any similar law, statute or ordinance now or hereafter in effect.

Tenant hereby agrees to attorn to Landlord’s assignee, transferee, or purchaser from and after the date of notice to Tenant of such assignment and assumption, transfer or sale, in the same manner and with the same force and effect as though this Lease were made in the first instance by and between Tenant and the assignee, transferee or purchaser.

In the event of any default by Landlord hereunder, Tenant shall look only to Landlord’s interest in the Property and rents therefrom and any available insurance proceeds for the satisfaction of Tenant’s remedies, and no other property or assets of Landlord or any trustee, partner, member, officer or director thereof, disclosed or undisclosed, shall be subject to levy, execution or other enforcement procedure for the satisfaction of Tenant’s remedies under or with respect to this Lease. 
18.     DESTRUCTION.

If such notice to terminate is given by Landlord, this Lease shall terminate as of the date of such damage.

- 36 -  

one hundred twenty (120) days after the occurrence of such damage or destruction and (b) the damage materially negatively impacts Tenant’s business operations, then Tenant may, at its option, upon written notice to Landlord to be delivered within fifteen (15) days after receipt of Landlord’s notice, elect to terminate this Lease as of the date of the occurrence of such damage or destruction. 
18.3      Rent Adjustment.  In case of termination pursuant to Sections 18.1 or above, the Base Rent and Operating Expenses shall be reduced by a proportionate amount based upon the square footage of the Premises rendered unusable, and Tenant shall pay such reduced Base Rent and Operating Expenses up to the date of vacation of the Premises. If Landlord is required or elects to make repairs, and Tenant does not terminate this Lease pursuant to Section 18.2, Landlord shall repair the Property and this Lease shall remain in full force and effect except that Tenant shall be entitled to a proportionate reduction of Base Rent and Operating Expenses from the date of such casualty and during the period such repairs are being made by a proportionate amount based upon the square footage of the Premises rendered unusable. The full amount of Base Rent and Operating Expenses shall again become payable immediately upon the completion of such work of repair, reconstruction or restoration, The repairs to be made by Landlord under this Article shall not include, and Landlord shall not be required to repair, any casualty damage to Tenant’s Property or any Alterations. 
18.4      Tenant Obligations.

18.5      No Claim.    Tenant shall have no interest in or claim to any portion of the proceeds of any property insurance or self-insurance maintained by Landlord in connection with the damage. If Landlord is entitled and elects not to rebuild the Premises, Landlord shall relinquish to Tenant such claim as Landlord may have for any part of the proceeds of any insurance maintained by Tenant under Section 13.2 of this Lease. 
18.6      No Damages.    If Landlord is required or elects to make any repairs, reconstruction or restoration of any damage or destruction to the Premises under any of the provisions of this Article 18, Tenant shall not be entitled to any damages by reason of any inconvenience or loss sustained by Tenant as a result thereof. Except as expressly provided in Section 18.3, there shall be no reduction, change or abatement of any rental or other charge payable by Tenant to Landlord hereunder, or in the method of computing, accounting for or paying the same. Tenant hereby waives the provisions of Section 1932(2) and Section 1933(4) of the California Civil Code, or any other statute or law that may be in effect at the time of a casualty under which a lease is automatically terminated or a tenant is given the right to terminate a lease due to a casualty. 
19.     EMINENT DOMAIN. 
19.1      Taking.  If all or any part of the Premises shall be taken as a result of the exercise of the power of eminent domain or any transfer in lieu thereof, this Lease shall terminate as to the part so taken as of the date of taking or as of the date of final judgment, 
 
- 37 -  

whichever is earlier, and, in the case of a partial taking of the Property, either Landlord or Tenant shall have the right to terminate this Lease as to the balance of the Property by written notice to the other within thirty (30) days after such date, provided, however, that a condition to the exercise by Tenant of such right to terminate shall be that the portion of the Premises taken shall be of such extent and nature as substantially to handicap, impede or impair Tenant’s use of the balance of the Premises. If any material part of the Common Area shall be taken as a result of the exercise of the power of eminent domain or any transfer in lieu thereof, whether or not the Premises are affected, Landlord shall have the right to terminate this Lease by written notice to Tenant within thirty (30) days of the date of taking. If any material part of the Common Area shall be taken as a result of the exercise of the power of eminent domain or any transfer in lieu thereof, such that Tenant’s access to or use of the Premises is materially adversely affected, Tenant shall have the right to terminate this Lease by written notice to Landlord within thirty (30) days of the date of taking, 
19.2      Award.  In the event of any taking, Landlord shall be entitled to any and all compensation, damages, income, rent, awards, or any interest therein whatsoever which may be paid or made in connection therewith, and Tenant shall assign to Landlord any right to compensation or damages for the condemnation of its leasehold interest. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to prohibit Tenant from making a separate claim against the condemning authority for the value of Tenant’s Property and moving expenses, provided such claim does not delay or diminish Landlord’s claim or award. 
19.3      Partial Taking.  In the event of a partial taking of the Premises which does not result in a termination of this Lease, the Base Rent and Operating Expenses shall be adjusted as follows: 
(a)      In the event of a partial taking, if this Lease is not terminated pursuant to this Article 19, Landlord shall repair, restore or reconstruct the Premises to a useable state; provided that Landlord shall not be required to expend any sums other than those received pursuant to Section 19.2, and in the event Tenant does not elect to reimburse Landlord for such excess costs within thirty (30) days after notice from Landlord as to the amount of such excess cost, Landlord may elect to terminate this Lease; 
(b)      During the period between the date of the partial taking and the completion of any necessary repairs, reconstruction or restoration, Tenant shall be entitled to a reduction of Base Rent and Operating Expenses by a proportionate amount based upon the extent of interference with Tenant’s operations in the Premises; and 
(c)      Upon completion of said repairs, reconstruction or restoration, and thereafter throughout the remainder of the Term, the Base Rent and Operating Expenses shall be recalculated based on the remaining total number of square feet of Rentable Area of the Premises. 
19.4      Temporary Taking.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article, if a taking occurs with respect to all or any portion of the Premises for a period of twelve (12) months or less, this Lease shall remain unaffected thereby and Tenant shall continue to pay Base Rent and Additional Rent and to perform all of the terms, conditions and covenants of this Lease, 
 
- 38 -  

provided that Tenant shall have the right to terminate this Lease if the taking continues beyond twelve (12) months by giving Landlord notice of such termination within twenty (20) days following the expiration of such twelve (12) month period. If Tenant exercises such termination right, this Lease and the estate hereby granted shall terminate as of the thirtieth (30th) day following the giving of such notice. In the event of any such temporary taking, and if this Lease is not terminated, Tenant shall be entitled to receive that portion of any award which represents compensation for the use or occupancy of the Premises during the Term up to the total Base Rent and Additional Rent owing by Tenant for the period of the taking, and Landlord shall be entitled to receive the balance of any award. 
19.5      Sale in Lieu of Condemnation.  A voluntary sale by Landlord of all or any part of the Property to any public or quasi-public body, agency or person, corporate or otherwise, having the power of eminent domain, either under threat of condemnation or while condemnation proceedings are pending, shall be deemed to be a taking under the power of eminent domain for the purposes of this Article. 
19.6      Waiver.  Except as provided in this Article, Tenant hereby waives and releases any right it may have under any Applicable Law to terminate this Lease as a result of a taking, including without limitation Sections 1265.120 and 1265.130 of the California Code of Civil Procedure, or any similar law, statute or ordinance now or hereafter in effect.

At least sixty (60) days prior to the Move-Out Date, Landlord and Tenant shall walk through the Premises to identify any repair and removal work to be performed by Tenant, provided that failure by any party to participate in the walk-through shall not relieve Tenant of any of its obligations hereunder. Prior to the Termination Date, Tenant shall repair at Tenant’s sole cost, all damage caused by removal of Tenant’s Property and any Alterations as required under this Lease, and shall leave the floor broom clean and the walls patched and paint-ready.

Subject to Article 9, upon any termination of this Lease all improvements, except for Tenant’s Property, shall automatically and without further act by Landlord or Tenant, become the property of Landlord, free and clear of any claim or interest therein by Tenant, and without payment therefore by Landlord. Tenant acknowledges that it is aware of Landlord’s plans to redevelop the Property upon the termination of this Lease, and, therefore, if the Premises are not surrendered as of the end of the Term in the manner and condition described in this Section 20.1, Landlord may suffer extensive damage. In the event of such failure or delay, Tenant shall indemnify, defend, protect and hold Landlord harmless from and against any and all Losses resulting from or caused by Tenant’s delay or failure in so surrendering the Premises, including, without limitation, any lost rents and any claims made by

Any holding over after the expiration of the Term with the consent of Landlord shall be construed to automatically extend the Term on a month-to-month basis at a Base Rent equal one-hundred fifty percent (150%) of the then-current Base Rent and shall otherwise be on the terms and conditions of this Lease to the extent applicable. Any holding over without Landlord’s consent shall entitle Landlord to exercise any or all of its remedies provided in Article 15, notwithstanding that Landlord may elect to accept one or more payments of Base Rent and Operating Expenses from Tenant. 
20.3      Quitclaim.  At the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease, Tenant shall execute, acknowledge and deliver to Landlord, within ten (10) days after written demand from Landlord to Tenant, any quitclaim deed or other document required by any reputable title company, licensed to operate in the State of California, to remove the cloud or encumbrance created by this Lease from the Property.

23.     RULES AND REGULATIONS; SIGNS.

24.     INABILITY TO PERFORM. 
If Landlord is unable to fulfill or is delayed in fulfilling any of Landlord’s obligations under this Lease, by reason of acts of God, accidents, breakage, repairs, strikes, lockouts, other labor disputes, inability to obtain utilities or materials or by any other reason beyond Landlord’s reasonable control, then such inability or delay by Landlord shall excuse the performance of Landlord for a period equal to the duration of such prevention, delay or stoppage, and no such inability or delay by Landlord shall constitute an actual or constructive eviction, in whole or in part, or entitle Tenant to any abatement or diminution of Base Rent or Additional Rent, or relieve Tenant from any of its obligations under this Lease, or impose any liability upon Landlord or Landlord’s Agents by reason of inconvenience, annoyance, interruption, injury or loss to or interference with Tenant’s business or use and occupancy or quiet enjoyment of the Premises or any loss or damage occasioned thereby.
