The `LLMLoader` includes methods for setting various parameters such as input prefix, suffix, cache prompt, number of tokens to predict, sampling techniques, temperature, penalties, and more. Overall, the `LLMLoader`  provides a flexible and extensible framework for interacting with language models in a Python and Scala environment using PySpark and Java.\n",

Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL): Hearing loss is a common symptom of WS, which can affect the ability to hear and understand sounds.\\n5. Neurological disorders: WS can also cause neurological problems, such as movement disorders, cognitive impairment, and other neurodegenerative processes.\\n6.

Taste dysfunction: There is limited information on whether WS affects the sense of taste.\\n\\nIn addition to these symptoms, WS can be associated with other systemic manifestations, such as endocrine dysfunctions, urinary tract anomalies, and neurological disorders.

It's a reliable indicator of long-term blood sugar control and can be used to screen for prediabetes.\\n\\n3. Oral Glucose Tolerance Test: This test measures blood sugar levels before and after drinking a sugary drink. It's more expensive and time-consuming than the other tests, but it can provide more detailed information about how the body processes glucose.\\n\\n4.

Talk to your doctor about your family history and consider getting screened for prediabetes.\\n\\n6. Body Mass Index (BMI): A BMI of 25 or higher is considered overweight, which increases the risk of prediabetes. Maintaining a healthy weight through diet and exercise can help prevent prediabetes.\\n\\n7. Blood Pressure Monitoring: High blood pressure is a common complication of prediabetes. Regularly monitoring blood pressure can help detect prediabetes early and prevent complications.\\n\\n8. Lifestyle Changes: Making lifestyle changes, such as eating a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and maintaining a healthy weight, can help prevent or delay the onset of prediabetes.\\n\\n9.

These tests are not as accurate as medical tests, but they can be a good starting point for individuals who are concerned about their risk.\\n\\n11. Healthcare Provider Recommendations: Your healthcare provider may recommend screening for prediabetes based on your age, weight, and other risk factors. They can also provide guidance on how to manage your risk and prevent the onset of diabetes.\\n\\n12. Regular Check-ups: Regular check-ups with your healthcare provider can help detect prediabetes early and prevent complications.

These groups can also provide you with tips and strategies for making healthy lifestyle changes.\\n\\n15. Health Insurance: Check your health insurance policy to see if it covers screening for prediabetes. Many insurance plans cover diabetes screening and management, which can help reduce the cost of treatment and prevent complications.\\n\\n16. Government Programs: Some government programs offer free or low-cost screening for prediabetes. These programs can be a great resource for individuals who are at risk of developing the condition.\\n\\n17. Mobile Health Apps: There are several mobile health apps available that can help you track your blood sugar levels, monitor your diet, and manage your diabetes. These apps can also provide you with personalized recommendations and support to help prevent prediabetes.\\n\\n18. Community Health Centers: Community health centers often offer free or low-cost screening for prediabetes.

              "\"1. Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG) Test: This is a simple and cost-effective test that measures blood sugar levels after an overnight fast. It can be performed in a clinic or at home using a glucometer. A fasting blood sugar level of 100-125 mg/dL indicates prediabetes.\\n2. Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT): This test involves measuring blood sugar levels before and two hours after consuming a glucose-rich drink. A 2-hour blood sugar level of 140-199 mg/dL indicates prediabetes. While more expensive and time-consuming than FPG, it provides a more comprehensive assessment of glucose metabolism.\\n3. Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) Test: This test measures the average blood sugar levels over the past 2-3 months. An HbA1c level of 5.7%-6.4% indicates prediabetes. It is a convenient and cost-effective screening method that can be performed in a clinic or at home using a home HbA1c test.\\n4. Urine Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio (UACR): This test measures the amount of albumin (a type of protein) in the urine, which can indicate kidney damage. An elevated UACR level can be an early sign of prediabetes and diabetes. It is a relatively low-cost screening method that can be performed in a clinic.\\n5. Body Mass Index (BMI) Assessment: Obesity is a major risk factor for prediabetes and diabetes. Calculating BMI (weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) is a simple and low-cost way to assess body fatness. A BMI of 25 or higher indicates overweight, which increases the risk of prediabetes and diabetes.\\n6. Family History: Assessing family history of diabetes can help identify individuals at higher risk of developing prediabetes and diabetes. This information can be obtained through a patient's medical records or a structured questionnaire.\\n7. Lifestyle Assessment: Evaluating lifestyle factors such as diet, physical activity, and smoking habits can help identify individuals at higher risk of prediabetes and diabetes. This can be done through structured questionnaires or interviews.\\n\\nBy combining these low-cost screening methods, healthcare providers can identify individuals at risk of prediabetes and diabetes and implement appropriate interventions to prevent or delay the onset of these conditions. It is important to note that these screening methods should be used in conjunction with clinical judgment and other risk factors to ensure accurate diagnosis and appropriate management.\""
