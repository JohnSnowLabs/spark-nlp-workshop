Post-evaluation, she was diagnosed with Mild Cognitive Impairment with a stress-related etiology. Neurological examination findings were largely unremarkable, but neuropsychological tests highlighted deficits in short-term memory. Her blood tests ruled out any thyroid or vitamin deficiencies. I have advised her to start on Donepezil to potentially slow the cognitive decline.",
