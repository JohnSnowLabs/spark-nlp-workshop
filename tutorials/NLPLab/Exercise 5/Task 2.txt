Ms. Watson has a past medical history of hypertension and hypothyroidism. She was diagnosed with hypertension five years ago and has been taking medication to control her blood pressure. She was also diagnosed with hypothyroidism three years ago and has been taking levothyroxine daily.

There is a family history of cardiovascular disease in Ms. Watson's immediate family. Her father had a heart attack at the age of 55, and her mother has high blood pressure.
Ms. Watson is married and lives with her husband and two children. She reports occasional alcohol consumption and denies any tobacco or drug use. Ms. Watson leads a sedentary lifestyle due to her occupation as a teacher. She reports minimal physical activity and does not follow a regular exercise routine.


Ms. Watson presents today with complaints of fatigue, weight gain, and hair loss. She reports feeling tired all the time, despite getting enough sleep. She has noticed a gradual increase in her weight over the past few months and has also experienced hair thinning and hair loss. On examination, Ms. Watson's vital signs are within normal limits. Her blood pressure is 120/80 mmHg, heart rate is 78 beats per minute, respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute, and temperature is 98.6Â°F. Physical examination reveals dry skin, coarse hair, and a non-tender thyroid gland.


Laboratory tests were ordered for Ms. Watson to evaluate her symptoms. Her thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level is elevated at 8.5 mIU/L (normal range: 0.4-4.0 mIU/L), indicating hypothyroidism. Her lipid profile and liver function tests are within normal limits.

Ms. Watson is currently taking lisinopril 10 mg daily for hypertension and levothyroxine 75 mcg daily for hypothyroidism. She denies any known medication allergies.

The diagnosis of hypothyroidism is confirmed based on Ms. Watson's symptoms and elevated TSH level. She will continue the current dose of levothyroxine and will follow up in six weeks for repeat TSH level measurement. She will also be advised to make lifestyle modifications, including regular exercise and a balanced diet, to achieve weight loss.
