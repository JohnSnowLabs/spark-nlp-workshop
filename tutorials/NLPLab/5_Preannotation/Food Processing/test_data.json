      "text": "\r\nTo roast the peppers:\r\n Lay the poblano peppers on a work surface so they sit flat naturally without rolling. Using a small, sharp knife, cut a lengthwise slit along one side of each of the poblano peppers, then make a small cross-wise slit along the top to create a T-shaped slit, careful not to cut the stem off. Carefully cut out and remove the core, then scoop out the seeds. Using tongs, roast the poblano chiles over an open flame such as the grill, broiler or stovetop, turning often until the skin is completely blistered. Transfer to a plastic bag (or place in a bowl and cover with plastic wrap) and let steam for 10 to 15 minutes to loosen the skins. Once they are cool enough to handle, use a butter knife to scrape away the charred skins and discard, careful not to tear the peppers. Set the roasted poblanos aside. Preheat the oven to 350F. Pour 1-1/4 cups of the sauce into the bottom of a 9 x 12-inch casserole dish.\r\nTo make the turkey:\r\n Meanwhile, brown the ground turkey on medium heat in large saute pan and season with salt and pepper. Use a wooden spoon to break the meat up into small pieces. Add the chopped onions, garlic, pepper, tomato and cilantro and continue cooking on a low heat. Add cumin, oregano, bay leaves, and more salt if needed. Add tomato sauce and 1/4 cup of water and mix well, reduce heat to low and simmer covered about 15 minutes. Carefully stuff about 1/2 cup of the turkey mixture into each poblano pepper. Place the peppers seam side up over the sauce in the baking dish and top each with 2 tbsp of cheese.
