In recent years, the community has begun to figure out some pretty effective methods of learning from the enormous amounts of unlabeled data available on the internet. The success of transfer learning from unsupervised models has allowed us to surpass virtually all existing benchmarks on downstream supervised learning tasks. As we continue to develop new model architectures and unsupervised learning objectives, \"state of the art\" continues to be a rapidly moving target for many tasks where large amounts of labeled data are available.\n","\n","## Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL)\n","Traditionally, zero-shot learning (ZSL) most often referred to a fairly specific type of task: learn a classifier on one set of labels and then evaluate on a different set of labels that the classifier has never seen before. Recently, especially in NLP, it's been used much more broadly to mean get a model to do something that it wasn't explicitly trained to do. A well-known example of this is in the [GPT-2 paper](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9405/cc0d6169988371b2755e573cc28650d14dfe.pdf) where the authors evaluate a language model on downstream tasks like machine translation without fine-tuning on these tasks directly.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"okhT7AcXxben"},"source":["## Colab Setup"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"n9luR-MGuUb4"},"outputs":[],"source":["! pip install -q pyspark==3.4.1 spark-nlp==5.1.2"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"metadata":{"id":"a-nbXT3euZoS","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":254},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1696438698967,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":40309,"user":{"displayName":"Vildan Sarıkaya","userId":"07789644790967768983"}},"outputId":"b31183de-9f61-4aaa-ce23-38ed2605bb67"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Spark NLP version:  5.1.2\n","Apache Spark version:  3.4.1\n"]},{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["<pyspark.sql.session.SparkSession at 0x7b5e7b862a70>"],"text/html":["\n","            <div>\n","                <p><b>SparkSession - in-memory</b></p>\n","                \n","        <div>\n","            <p><b>SparkContext</b></p>\n","\n","            <p><a href=\"http://6af6e8312207:4040\">Spark UI</a></p>\n","\n","            <dl>\n","              <dt>Version</dt>\n","                <dd><code>v3.4.1</code></dd>\n","              <dt>Master</dt>\n","                <dd><code>local[*]</code></dd>\n","              <dt>AppName</dt>\n","                <dd><code>Spark NLP</code></dd>\n","            </dl>\n","        </div>\n","        \n","            </div>\n","        "]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":2}],"source":["import sparknlp\n","\n","from sparknlp.base import *\n","from sparknlp.annotator import *\n","\n","from pyspark.ml import Pipeline,PipelineModel\n","from pyspark.sql import SparkSession\n","from pyspark.sql import functions as F\n","import pandas as pd\n","\n","spark = sparknlp.start()\n","\n","print(\"Spark NLP version: \", sparknlp.version())\n","print(\"Apache Spark version: \", spark.version)\n","\n","spark"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"AMU4sAJQ0Rhs"},"source":["## Bert Zero-Shot Classification\n","\n","This model is intended to be used for zero-shot text classification, especially in English.
