If you would like to learn more about the Fusionapplet framework, I highly recommend that you read my articles on the Fusion Applet framework and the FASTColor library. Fusionapplets work in parallel with the FFI compiler in order to compile and run your application. The Fusionappliets provide you a very powerful tool for composing code, as well as building on top of them by providing you with useful and concise syntax for composing and building on an application. I have written an introductory blog post on how to use the FusionApplet framework to write application code, and I have also written a short tutorial on how you can use the FAPI FusionApplets to compose code. The FASFColor library is also a powerful and flexible tool that provides many capabilities that are not possible for a Fusionapplator. This blog post focuses on how Fusionapps can be used to compose and build on an existing application and its data and functionality.\n","The first thing we need to understand about using Fusionapps is that it is actually very similar to using an application that has been compiled into the application's code. In the case of fusion-applet, the application is an embedded FFI application and it works with the framework's FICON runtime system. We will also take a look at how to compile an embedded application into the framework.\n","How to use a FusionAppllet to compile a FFI Application\n","FluidApplet provides a method that will allow you to compile the application code into the FICONS runtime system, which is the same runtime system that is available for the Fusion applets. Let us use a simple example to demonstrate how that works.\n","For the purpose of this example, we will create a simple application that contains two parts: two classes and a database.\n","public class User is Employee {\n","private def myDatabase = new User(\"Bob\");\n","This code should compile to the following output.\n","FluentApplet.fatalError: An error occurs compiling this code.\n","Now, let us build a new application.\n","private class Users is Employee.Factory{\n","// This class implements the Factory interface, but it doesn't // define what to call it directly. It will simply inherit from Factory. // The following code creates a new instance for every user object private class UserFactory extends Factory<Employee> {\n","protected static void addNewUser(Employee user1, Employee user2) { // In order for this to take place, all the methods used // must be available on User class as the constructor method is provided by Factory.\n","// We have added a constructor method.
