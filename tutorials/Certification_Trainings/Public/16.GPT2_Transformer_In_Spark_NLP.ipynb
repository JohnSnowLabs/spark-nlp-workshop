The team then spent six weeks researching the story of the wild unicorns. The group had to travel to the remote valley of the \"unicorns.\"\n","During the trip, the researchers discovered that the wild animals had already been born when the herd fled the area.\n","The herd, as far as the research group was concerned, was living in peace and was living a peaceful life. The unicorns were even able to communicate with the humans and the herd was completely independent. They had been born on their own land, without any help from humans, and they had the ability to see their surroundings and communicate with other herd members. The unicorn herd was so close to the human homeland at the remote location that they were even used for medicine by doctors.\n","When the team finally arrived in the remote Andes village, they discovered they were surrounded by a large number of strange animals. The scientists noticed a strange white horse, which they named \"the White Unicorn.\"\n","The team then traveled back to the cave where they found the young herd and discovered they are living among humans now. When a team from the same research team reached the area, they met a large herd of wild cattle and a large group of unicorn. The researchers were able to capture both kinds of creatures. They then took pictures, recorded the sound of the animals and the animals were able for the first time to communicate back to them. The animals then began to feed each other and the whole group soon started to live peacefully among those humans.\n","Scientists and tourists alike were surprised and amazed when they realized that the unicorn community was alive and thriving in the far-off place. After the research team finally returned to the Andean city of Ayapuco and started to explore the nearby jungle, they realized they hadn't traveled far enough to actually find them. In the jungle they saw some wild horses and other animals in groups that could move around at will.\n","\"We were able today to see a herd in the wild with humans that we could not see in the previous year,\" Dr. Lluis said. \"We found the first herd of people here.\"\n","\n","\n"]},{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["   id                                               text  \\\n","0   0  In a shocking finding, scientist discovered a ...   \n","\n","                                              result  \n","0  [ Is it true that In a shocking finding, scien...

The \"old man,\" on the other hand,\n",", who was a very old woman and \"beneath the sea\" (in the old man's language)\n"," has a \"canticle\" of images in her left-hand. The word \"Canny,\" which is found on the top of the left panel of \"the old man,\" is also found on this panel in the Canticle of Canticles .\n","There also are similar examples of cannibalism in the writings of Plato and the great Christian theologian Origen. It has been claimed that this cannibalism was not part of some \"warlike\" battle, but was rather a very common and \"unnatural\" eating that a man was compelled to do by a strong and powerful enemy.\n","This belief also is common amongst the Christian authors of pagan writings, including those who were very much influenced by the Greek philosophy of Socrates: that the eating of a victim was a part of a divinely inspired and natural sacrifice and that, after this had been performed, the victim was left to lie there and die (See, e.g., A History of the World for the period between 1000 BC and A.D. 700).\n","\n","It is interesting to note that the ancient Greeks, and particularly the Pythagoreans, had a very specific way to describe the sacrifice of animals. There's a passage from the Pythian \"Apology\" that is particularly notable:\n"," \"And what is said was this, that the god, if he wished the animal to die, would raise it up again and eat it: or if he had given a man his horse or a lion or any other animal, would say to him, 'Now take this horse or this elephant of mine and bring it to me; I will sacrifice it to you for my service; give its carcass for food; let the god of your tribe do whatever he sees best for his people.' This was the doctrine of the Pythians.\"\n","A.D./C.A. 1000-600 B.C. Hippocrates Theophrastus (c. 350-384) In the \"Apologies to the Gods,\" Hippocrates writes: \"The eating of animals is the highest form of divinity… It means to give up the life and to become a human being.\" In the book \"Gods,\" the Greek philosopher Democritus comments: \"For there is one god only, who has both life and death, and therefore all animals have life. The gods, therefore, are all living gods.
