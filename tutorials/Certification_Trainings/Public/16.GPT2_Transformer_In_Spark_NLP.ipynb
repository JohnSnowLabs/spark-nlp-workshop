That all unicorns live in the valley! It's almost as if I was dreaming I lived a thousand years into the future!\" \"It's like when I hear an elephant being chased by a lion. My jaw is dropped, and I am just as surprised as the elephant! The other unicorn can't comprehend the reason why its master would chase such a huge beast like an elephant, and that it is so aggressive. It is also very curious, and will chase a huge animal around the mountain until it gets tired. \"It seems to know the name of my house, and knows that my friend who lives here is very fond of me, so it will take its time before chasing him. It also has a kind smile on its face.\" (Tatsuya) \"I also have heard of this phenomenon of big-crazed unicorns, but never saw any. However, my neighbor and his friend also reported it after they heard about the big-unicorn thing. They were amazed that a herd like this could live in one place and not in another.\" \"In addition to the fact they were both living in remote, inhospitable locations in the remote valleys, the other unicorn species seem to have a much deeper knowledge about the geography of their own world than us. They seem to be able to distinguish the different mountains as distinct mountain ranges. That's what I really thought. However… this is what they are really good at. It turns out the unicorn species have a unique ability to predict the future, in addition to that they know the weather, the seasons, and a large number of other things. That is something very unique, something only a unicorn can do.\" \"The one who is most surprised by this is my friend! He was thinking that if we had seen that big-horned unicorn for a thousand or even a thousand thousand years ago, we would know how to deal with it. It seems to have had such a high status in the society of the valley, and is the most important species there. It could be considered extremely powerful, but it is also something I really need to learn if I am to survive in this new world.\" \"That's right. I have come so far to live in such a remote and strange place. I really feel as if it is really difficult for me to live here and do everything in my life in a normal manner. I can't imagine myself going out into town every day, or even going anywhere at all. It's a strange feeling, because I've never heard of any people having an existence like me.\" (Yukiko) \"The fact that you are saying that I do not have any sense of identity has really surprised me.\" \"But I must add that my identity has only strengthened since I first heard this story. I also felt that a new feeling began coming over me… it's very important for that sort of thing to develop if you want to survive!\" \"I can't think of anything that's changed for me since I have heard this kind of story! That I have a future and can live and have fun and be happy in my own house… That would be a huge relief.\" Tatsuya's heart sank with a start.  \n","Yukito said: \"Then I must go home. I want to think about what sort of person I am going to become as soon as I am able to move back.\" \"If that's the case, it would be best if you go away with me while I get ready to change again… I really wanted you to have all the time you need.\"  Yukito went to Yukihira's room and left her room. Yukiko returned to her room and got dressed herself, and went to the bedroom. As Yukiko walked out, she felt a bit worried about where she was going.  The sun was coming out from behind the clouds, setting the moon, and setting the trees all in a beautiful mood. Although it was just noon, the atmosphere was very refreshing; the temperature was comfortable. As the last of the clouds drifted away, the moonlight reflected off the leaves in the branches, creating an illusion. When she looked down through the window at the moon above the city below, she had an incredible feeling of peace. She knew she would not be able see the sun during the night\n","\n","\n"]},{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["   id                                               text  \\\n","0   0  In a shocking finding, scientist discovered a ...   \n","\n","                                              result  \n","0  [ Is it true that In a shocking finding, scien...

They were not altogether crows, nor moles, nor buzzards, nor ants, \n","nor vampire bats, nor decomposed human beings; but something I cannot and must not recall.\n","The creatures were not of anything so simple as an earth, with one or two of its constituent elements,  or a human race, but were some great new order of being.\n","They could not, for one thing, see one another; and there were many things, but none more than the air around them. Yet what were they? Were not men a bit different? And yet there were no such things as men, there had never even then been such things.\n","And now they were all of the same and identical nature, and yet, even with what I know, and even in what I don't see, they could not be men and yet be the same with men; and yet these same elements were not the same, for they would have seemed the same from the outside as from within if they had been separate and entirely different beings with separate names and separate minds. That is the nature of the mind of a strange creature, for there is in it a kind of mind, and it is strange, even now, that we dare say that it does not exist in all the things that are.\n","In the night I slept for hours, and, like many men of old, I could not sleep; but in the morning, with many of my dreams, I awoke with the same feeling of fear and loathing that had come upon me when I first found the air, or the sky, and all that came from within.\n","There was a thing that was so vast. It had all the power of the world. And it could not live, for it was its own nature. But, for all its power, it could live within the limits of the night, for when the morning dawned, as if by some miracle, it lay down, like a stone.\n","For a time I was sure of it. I knew there were other worlds and that I might get to them if ever I thought my way through them. There was no way, though, to escape my destiny.\n","On that horrible morning, as they told me to-day and every day, and when I came down again and saw their dead, I thought I must stay for a time, I must wait for their will to take me away; but the night is so terrible that even in these last moments I was not sure of going or coming.\n","But it was not only the night; I knew at last that I was to be in their place, and I knew that I would see the rest of my species there, too, and with them.\n","I did not remember where I had gone from. I could say I took part in the creation of it, which was my pride. But as I was driven from that place by a great wind, I never knew when I saw myself in the sun again. I felt as though one had driven a nail through my heart, and now the heart was all I could think of, and not of me. I had nothing, so long as I had a mind to think, and so long did I think of other things. I have been a man since I saw, before, one day, the sun, the universe; and I never thought of myself, nor had I a mind, but of the sun and the universe. And I have always kept my mind to the sun.\n","One day, just at this moment, I looked at the sun with the light of one who has never looked at it and has never left it, a thing of the most dreadful fascination which a man of genius must never see, and the world's most dreadful horror at the same time. For the first time ever, I saw something.\n","At first I was afraid to look again at that shining luminous thing, but I had never looked so deeply or been so scared before, and after looking at the light once I knew I had to see it again, at the first opportunity; I was frightened and afraid; and in the silence the wind was whistling, and suddenly, as the wind and the sun came together in their close embrace, I cried, in a voice that sounded like the wind from the moon,\n","\n","\n"]},{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["   id                                               text  \\\n","0   0  \\nAt this horror I sank nearly to the lichened...   \n","\n","                                              result  \n","0  [ Is it true that \\nAt this horror I sank near...
