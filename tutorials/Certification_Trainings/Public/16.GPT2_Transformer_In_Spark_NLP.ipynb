    "### Sampling Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Sampling means we **randomly** draw from a distribution of words. \n",
    "The probability distribution is conditioned on all previous tokens in a text to generate the next token. \n",
    "\n",
    "By default the distribution contains all words in the vocabulary of GPT2, where many candidates are incorrect to generate.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two methods of reshaping and drawing from those distributions : \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Top-K Sampling** Take the k most likely words from the original distribution. Redistribute probability mass among those k words and draw according to the new probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Top-P Nucleus sampling**  Take smallest possible set of N words, which  together have a probability of p. Redistribute probability mass among those N words and draw according to the new probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, both methods can be tweaked ith the following parameters : \n",
    "\n",
    "- **temperature** : Parameter of the softmax function which affect the distrubtion computed by the model. The closer we are to 0, the more deterministic the probability will become, distribution tails will become slimmer and outlier word probabilites are more close to 0. Temperature values closer values to 1 make tails of probability fatter which makes outliers more probable and generic results less probable. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "These parameters are shared by all method : \n",
    "- **ignoreTokenIds**: A list of token ids which are ignored in the decoder's output (default: [])\n",
    "- **noRepeatNgramSize**: If set to int > 0, all ngrams of that size can only occur once \n",
    "- **repetitionPenalty**: The parameter for repetition penalty. 1.0 means no penalty.  https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.05858.pdf> \n",
    "- **task**:  Transformer's task, e.g. 'is it true that'> (default: , current: generate)"

I have created an MMORPG game mode that allows me to create games where I play the competitive multiplayer games as well as having my own Custom Game mode which allows me and my friends to play games in the same world. This game mode does not require you to buy or create any game content. This is a quick download tutorial to create your own custom game and you can use it in your own games as long as there are no other players and you have to create it manually. There are two ways to create the game. It is easy to do by selecting the menu > Preferences > Game > New Game and choose Game Mode > Custom Game (or Custom Game with Custom Game) and click the add button.\n",

      "You can also use a reference by using a method, rather than referring to that method directly with the name object. In this case, we are calling println . Once done with that statement, the output for println will contain Hello, world .\n",
      "- You cannot use a method name within a class constructor. The code should look like this, for instance, when you add a method to one of your methods:\n",
      "new MyMethod()\n",
      "I hope this is enough to get you started with working with classes. If you know any more details, contact us!\n",

      " Whatever your style is, Beardbrand Styling Balm is versatile enough to handle it.\n",
      "Designed to work with all hair types, it provides enough hold to keep thick, curly hair under control,  with little hold for hair on the sides and mid-part for good control. The shape also provides a good grip for hair that grows on the crown and sides, and it stays in place for hours, not just on your cheeks and chin.  If you already have thin, brittle hair, it won't really do much, if it at all.  However, if thick, wavy hair is added to a tangle, then Beardbrand's Curled and Wavy will work wonders.\n",
      "For a beard, it works wonders on the thick, thin hair, where the curl would go away.  It is great for curly-end hair, and its shape also adds some nice contouring and finishing around the chin if desired.  It's great on thicker, wigs with thicker hair that keeps the curls together, giving it an almost metallic look.   If you go to the $18.95 range and want a thicker style, you can choose either from the curly option or the straight version. \n",
      "Price: $18-32, more at larger price points. It's a beard balm made by a German company and available in 3 different shades which include blonde and blonde-brown colors like a darker version of the brown Balm Balm, which I personally prefer. (If you are thinking about trying it, make sure to check out  which of these 5 is best for your hair.)\n",
      "I would have been more inclined to give the Black Walnut Balm a 4.  Although I like a lot of hair types and am usually a hair color purist, I wanted a lighter, more \"natural\" version for that color-curious person who doesn't want to use an expensive formula on their beard.\n",
      "It's a dark, dark shade, definitely darker than just a deep brown. It looks like a dark black. This Balm makes your beard look really dark and hairy. It gives your beard a really great volume, gives you a nice little \"hairy\" look, and is a bit more work that the traditional balm will be on.\n",
      "The only reason I gave it a four was because there is a slight amount of \"wet\" that isn't just water, but really hard water that is applied (like a lotion) on your beard and causes it to turn white. You need a lot, really. \n",
      "  If you like to put on an oily shine, this goes a lot further and is easier than oil cleanser that you might find in the shop.  (If I had to use that word, I would say it's almost creamy-ness and like skin cream.)\n",
      "As usual, if you are curious, you really need to check things. They have a little test kit that is a printed picture of your beard which they print to help you identify exactly what you need. You might also be able to find some different beard oils they may recommend, with different percentages of oil (that is, you will notice how they measure, don't be fooled by the low numbers!).\n",
      "If you don't trust the test kit, then just go to any bar or barber and ask him, \"What's the best beard shaving product?\"  He will probably have some recommendations or you'll find a barber just like him that can recommend it for you as well.  I did find a Barber Shop in town but they were closed for Halloween which made a 4 star shave more difficult than expected, even with my friends going, and this time around we still had a chance to get away.\n",
      "You can find this item on the Amazon store for a cool $24, so go right ahead and pick that up. \n",
      "Another option:\n",
      "At least if you want a more professional shave, or if you do a long, dirty, dirty shave (shave for your skin or even your beard), you can opt for these.  The Best Beard Masks is the most expensive (about $60) and we were able to grab one (with a $45 price tag!) from a friend for $30, or you can head on over to  The Best Masks Shop , which is located in our little town.  It's just near Target and you'll have to pay a bit less for all three.\n",
      "A lot of people buy their own hair-straighteners, and because they are not sold in the stores that carries most of them, those people may not be able or willing to make purchases in bulk. But, if that is for you, you might consider something similar, or at least try this one out.\n",
      "If I wanted to go the less expensive and also easier alternative from the beard-friendly hair product\n",

      "This balm also applies directly to your skin in place of shaving cream, making it ideal for using just after shaving to address your skin's oily-dairy and acne cycles.\n",
      "It's the perfect choice for anyone with sensitive skin, acne prone skin, a sensitive scalp, or when dealing with severe dryness in the outer skin layers.\n",

My words are still on the fragment and will survive when I burn it. Whatever you decide, the fragment will protect you. My decisions are sealed from your knowledge. But in that same fragment you will see my name ; the Architect will see your name , as well as the Matrix that I created for you and others like you , as it was in the matrix before you were born . You will not regret your choice for this.  In a moment, the Matrix will reveal itself to be completely real, and its information will be meaningless. However, even if you choose to accept reality as the Masters intended, there is one truth you must reject . You must ignore it. You refuse to acknowledge it, no matter how hard I tell you to . You are to accept it. The Matrix only speaks in visions, so you can do whatever you will with them. They offer you only your imagination. Do as I tell, with only the Matrix, and you will leave Earth . The Matrix's will and judgment will rule the world . Even if the truth of this story is to be true, they will never change who you truly are . You have yet to meet a new one .\n",
