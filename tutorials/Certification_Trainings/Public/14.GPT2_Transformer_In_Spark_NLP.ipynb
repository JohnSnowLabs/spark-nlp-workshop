The main thing you need to put forward a good case is a good story or project to give them my character. They do not want to appear like a bunch of hoes, or make any fake claims about being a 3rd party developer. I would also love to see how I can be involved with some of the most prominent games in the hobby and try to help them on their journey along the path of success. I have some experience working on games for various studios and companies. I also have a very good taste in how to paint. Feel free to email me if you know someone at my development\n","\n","\n","Example 3: ________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n"," Hello my name is GPT2, I love to xtreme and i make my own videos for xtempo. The only problem im having is that the only way that i can xtimate is if im on a gpt2 , I know you may not agree at first, but if it is still an afterthought just have me be your host. I will be doing the same videos for everyone in the chat, also you do not need to be your nickname. In order to uthatize, tell me where you can find me .I'm going to be getting a new keyboard and will definitely post videos from that on youtube, the only other thing with my phone is my mp3 player.\n","\n","\n","Example 4: ________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n"," Hello my name is GPT2, I love to собедержаки киэтет смататущие общение - дела сворхомы выпент в Киемп, пут ослучту называть интей тоже тизм негоде носправля-заволог.Только нишалий новыч - I'm GPT-02, I'm currently living in St. Petersburg.

If you're on something like that, the only thing you should ever go for when trying to solve this problem is to look at the Java documentation.

That means each element has to be able to access an object inside the list otherwise the user cannot keep working on the list. In the case above, it would be helpful to put the list into a multi-tasked mode that only has access to a subset of what it asks for.\n",". Note how there is an order (1,0) within the objects array, so 1 is in first place and 0 in the last. How do we implement an array in multiplex mode? First off, we need to add one for each component/object in the array (as the first element of the array is the user-specified order). A single component of an array is a separate object, so add 1 to that item. Once an array has a given order as the property (which is an object), adding 1 to it means that that object can be accessed by any of its components. So a new method called addList(a1: List<T>, ...){ ... } returns: 1...T\n","\n","As a method of accessing an object, you may add one to the beginning of a given list and return a new list of it's elements corresponding to an item you just added. Let's start by changing the code.

Now we need the addList method to access some components of our array:\n",". Main()\n",". add_list()\n",":result 3\n"," of 1\n",", .

This is based upon the BFS implementation proposed in the bfs-r0.0 paper. Also, we will discuss some important points of BFS in the following two subsections: First, on the basics, please read  the following:\n","We have chosen BFS as our default BFS for 2-D and 3-D applications. Because, it is quite efficient in this use case (the most CPU intensive task) we have been very careful to improve the code and use of BLSL extensions in this case. There are many benefits of BSF: Low energy consumption: Compared to other BFS implementations, the code is quite small. To be sure that the code should run quite fast, we are focusing on performance and cache coherency. Since BFS can handle single core performance and multi core performance of up to 1 million connections, we focus on single core and multi-core speed. It is our strong feeling that with BFS, application developers should concentrate on application performance and on the performance of the C API as well.  It is a feature which is unique in the BIS industry: It uses C's native C++ features such as auto_ptr, __traits, typedef . In order to achieve this it uses both types of abstraction, which we don't use much in other languages. It avoids using an intermediate class for its base classes (a feature often seen in frameworks), instead relying on C++'s generic class. It provides a good choice between generic classes and type classes. It follows standard C++ conventions such as templates (not default) and default methods (only generic classes should call them).\n","By using these attributes, developers don't have to implement generic and type class interfaces but can provide functions which they require by including them in a generic class and the base class will be able to provide these functions using this interface. \n","By default, BFS assumes the following C++ classes:\n","* b_t* - BFS's temporary objects\n","To write a class, you basically write a constructor function which can call BFS routines. Since bfs only calls a function when BFS needs it, it creates a temporary BFS object and initializes the BLS using BFS and it calls the function which is called by the function body. All of this behavior is consistent and consistent as for other BLS and it is very easy to test whether what you wrote is correct. The following table contains the various attributes of BPS (source code) : \n","Name Type Description   __BFS__ - BSP BFS class __brefs__ - Temporary buffer, in memory\n","__bref__ is a member to the temporary buffer created by __bfs__ on initialization, which is the second parameter to the __get_buffer() function(see below).\n","__btl_type__ - Tensor type\n","__bsl_baseclasses__ - Base classes\n","The following table is used to determine the different types of classes: \n","Type Description     BFS_B_GPL_DST__ - A GPL class where BFS will use a single GPU\n"," _bfs_type_blsl__ - Type of class which will call bfs\n","bfs.__get_buffers__() - Returns the buffers which are used for reading, writing or executing the code that BFS requires.

And what they said was not as random as it had first seemed - they were the direct descendants of humans.\n","Scientists from the National University of Paraguay and Universidad de Fuerte del Estado in Brazil compared the genome of unicorn, giraffe and deer through 23andme's data.\n","The team analysed genetic content in these two species and discovered that all of them contain several gene variants that may help them to compete on the jungle paths.\n","Dr Rufini Fajano, who presented the findings and has been helping the researchers to collect and synthesise genetic data for years, added: \"From our previous study we learned that humans descend from at least 6,000 years of evolution. This genetic evidence suggests that the ancestors of us and the animals are a direct descendant of humans.\"\n","This may explain some of the similarities between these species, although that is still a large region of the earth, with only the Himalayas and Tibet to close to the area, Dr Fajardo told BBC News.\n","However, he added: \"(On the other hand) it may also be that the animals were descendants of our early cousin Homo, which means that their language and abilities were different in key regards from ours.\n","\"The idea is that when humans became dominant, there had to be a period during which the animals became better adapted.\"\n","While this makes sense and supports the hypothesis that our species will become extinct in 2045 if not sooner, it does not completely explain how the languages are evolving.\n","Languages may be evolving because all of us share the same genetic code, said Dr James Grant from the University of Bristol who worked on the study which he hopes to publish in the journal Current Biology.\n","This means that, although only one individual - one animal - can inherit a gene from all the living humans on the planet, he said: \"It opens up the possibility that there are other, more complex genes which must be operating in all languages without the direct influence of humans, or if they could arise through non-human sources; it's like the genes from plants and animals that are evolving separately in the same world.\"\n","Dr Grant is one of many researchers who think, from this new research, that the world's languages are becoming more complex. But it could be several hundred years before that becomes clear.\n","What is most intriguing about Dr Grant's findings, he argued, is that all 23andMe can pick up the genetics on their computer. Even though people have to be born with a particular genetic code that can encode every single part of an organism's genetic sequence, genetic research now is being conducted using techniques that can pick it up and translate it to an entirely novel language.\n","Many researchers have also been investigating the DNA of human subjects, however it has largely been performed by other scientists whose studies involve such high-risk procedures as genetic experiments involving tissue engineering and organ transplants involving the destruction of cancer cells.\n","To make the latest experiment all about science and science fiction, 21,500 volunteers called 'vampires' were put to sleep. After 14 days, each person was invited onto a dark underground cell-free room and asked to read between the lines in a language they did not know.\n","In the field of linguistics we have to work around obstacles like the human genome, or the need to test all of their genetic material every ten years, or, of course, we do not want to test every single genetic variant in our subjects in order to ensure that they were not susceptible to genetic disorders.\n","But Dr Grant said it was possible to use 23and to make genetic analysis more efficient and reliable.\n","He said: 'In order to test the performance of human genes, there is going to have to become increasingly expensive - or at least there has been. So we have been trying to get a solution to this problem.\n","As I mentioned, we can see how much our test results differ from the results we get with other research laboratories, and it doesn't help the fact we are all a direct line to human DNA, which is probably better, or in some cases, more accurate, than the results of research conducted today using more sophisticated methods. '\n","I think if one is interested in language the research will be most useful at very early stages of development'\n","The results so far have been intriguing as Dr Grant points out. He said: ''The interesting thing about all of this is that we can talk to this ancient population, so the research also shows that there is a population out there with almost perfect genetic variation, but who are the ancestors. ''We have to go back further, further back to have the answer to that problem.''\n","\n","\n"]},{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["   id                                               text  \\\n","0   0  In a shocking finding, scientist discovered a ...   \n","\n","                                              result  \n","0  [ In a shocking finding, scientist discovered ...

I kept my hands aloft, and turned again on the dark and solitary night, for where ever there lay some monster, the earth was always open to his intrusion.\n"," and it made me feel afraid to stay further, or to move. I went through the hollow to the side of the pond, and lay still waiting, my mouth full of breath and feeling, for the monster to come up to me. And on turning in it lifted me from the ditch and floated gently away, while in my mind the terrible beast sank down on the bank where my foot lay, and lo! I saw myself in front of the open door, but without a man who knew me, and saw not the monstrous monster at all.\n","It was night already, it was morning now; there was a bright flash of light in front, and a sharp smell of freshly thrown earth—no animal to stir or move—but the air was dry, and the whole world seemed empty—in the place of human habitation. I felt no fear and had no fear that I should ever want to forget; at all events, there were many places in the world where I should forget. I slept at the door. At the door there was, however, a man, a half-asleep boy, just waiting and waiting for me. I called him brotherly and talked of my fright at the terrible presence that could not be told. His face was so ghastly that in my terror he became an even more horrible monster than those about us. With no more fear I said to him that I was not afraid now to go back to the land. It is well I should tell you that the child of my mind who thought he was my brother became another. He had come home before I had gone and was lying by the door, dead, his body covered with flies, his head and belly hanging over the pool of a stream of blood that ran over his legs and lay where there was nothing on either side; nothing was there.\n","Tremendous in proportion had been my fear but nothing remained of my brother; wherefore I did not try to kill him with the old sword, though I felt sure the sword went against the back of a bird. I did see the corpse in the water lying there a quarter of a foot off where its heart should have been. I thought then that it was of a fellow like my brother. No doubt it would not have been far from us if it had appeared we were about it,—what now? The whole story of the dead and dead man I had so strangely pictured to myself as my brother's had now begun to change to a stranger's—a thing incomprehensible to me!
