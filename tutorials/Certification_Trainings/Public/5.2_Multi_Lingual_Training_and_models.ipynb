Usually they are trained only on one language and are thus only able to embed text from the original training laguage properly. The Sentence `I love sausages` and `Ich liebe Bratwurst` have the same semantic meaning and should have a small distance in embedding space. But most english embedding models have never seen German words like `Bratwurst`, so the model would never be able to deduct that these sentences say the same thing and should have close proximity in hyperspace.    \n","\n","\n","\n","### Solutions with multi-lingual embeddings\n","**Multi-Lingual embeddings** have been trained on usually 100+ of languages at the same time, which enables them to encode text from all of these languages into a semantic hyperspace. In this space similar semantic  pieces of text get mapped to points which represent the similarity by having a small distance in the embedding space.\n","\n","This enables many new use cases. You can train a classifier model on an English Dataset using Multi-Lingual Embeddings. The resulting model will be able to properly predict labels across all languages supported by the embedding. I.e if you use `LABSE` or `RoBERTa` your English dataset enables you to roll out a feature in 100+ countries because the embeddings already generalize enough for simple classifiers to properly leverage the hyperspace and yield good predictions\n","\n","\n","Embeddings are feat\n","\n","There are many multi-lingual embeddings you can leverage via Spark NLP, you can find them all in the [Models-Hub by setting filters to Multi-Lingual and Type to Embedding](https://nlp.johnsnowlabs.com/models?language=xx&task=Embeddings)\n","\n","\n","\n","| Name
