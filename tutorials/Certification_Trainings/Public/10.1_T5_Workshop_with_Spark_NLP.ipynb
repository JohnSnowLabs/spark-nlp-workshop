change, in the same way that geometry is the study of shape and algebra is the study of generalizations of arithmetic operations. It has two major branches, differential calculus and integral calculus; the former concerns instantaneous rates of change, and the slopes of curves, while integral calculus concerns accumulation of quantities, and areas under or between curves. These two branches are related to each other by the fundamental theorem of calculus, and they make use of the fundamental notions of convergence of infinite sequences and infinite series to a well-defined limit.[1] Infinitesimal calculus was developed independently in the late 17th century by Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz.[2][3] Today, calculus has widespread uses in science, engineering, and economics.[4] In mathematics education, calculus denotes courses of elementary mathematical analysis, which are mainly devoted to the study of functions and limits. The word calculus (plural calculi) is a Latin word, meaning originally \"small pebble\" (this meaning is kept in medicine – see Calculus (medicine)). Because such pebbles were used for calculation, the meaning of the word has evolved and today usually means a method of computation. It is therefore used for naming specific methods of calculation and related theories, such as propositional calculus, Ricci calculus, calculus of variations, lambda calculus, and process calculus.\n","            ''']]\n","\n","\n","\n","df = spark.createDataFrame(sentences).toDF(\"text\")\n","\n","#Predict on text data with T5\n","model = pipeline.fit(df)\n","annotated_df =

infinitesimals\", is the mathematical study of continuous change, in the same way that geometry is the study of shape and algebra is the study of generalizations of arithmetic operations. It has two major branches, differential calculus and integral calculus; the former concerns instantaneous rates of change, and the slopes of curves, while integral calculus concerns accumulation of quantities, and areas under or between curves. These two branches are related to each other by the fundamental theorem of calculus, and they make use of the fundamental notions of convergence of infinite sequences and infinite series to a well-defined limit.[1] Infinitesimal calculus was developed independently in the late 17th century by Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz.[2][3] Today, calculus has widespread uses in science, engineering, and economics.[4] In mathematics education, calculus denotes courses of elementary mathematical analysis, which are mainly devoted to the study of functions and limits. The word calculus (plural calculi) is a Latin word, meaning originally \"small pebble\" (this meaning is kept in medicine – see Calculus (medicine)). Because such pebbles were used for calculation, the meaning of the word has evolved and today usually means a method of computation. It is therefore used for naming specific methods of calculation and related theories, such as propositional calculus, Ricci calculus, calculus of variations, lambda calculus, and process calculus.\\n            |[calculus, originally called infinitesimal calculus, is the mathematical study of continuous change . it has two major branches, differential calculus and integral calculus . the former concerns instantaneous rates of change, and the slopes of curves . integral calculus concerns accumulation of quantities, and areas under or between curves .]|\n","+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n","\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ZyxqNOO1obBv"},"source":["\n","# Task 15 [SQuAD - Context based question answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05250)\n","Predict an `answer` to a `question` based on input `context`.\n","\n","|Predicted Answer | Question | Context |\n","|-----------------|----------|------|\n","|carbon monoxide| What does increased oxygen concentrations in the patient’s lungs displace? | Hyperbaric (high-pressure) medicine uses special oxygen chambers to increase the partial pressure of O 2 around the patient and, when needed, the medical staff.

Joey loved to go outside and play with his cousin Jimmy. Joey and Jimmy played silly games together, and were always laughing. One day, Joey and Jimmy went swimming together 50 at their Aunt Julie’s pond. Joey woke up early in the morning to eat some food before they left. Usually, Joey would eat cereal, fruit (a pear), or oatmeal for breakfast. After he ate, he and Jimmy went to the pond. On their way there they saw their friend Jack Rabbit. They dove into the water and swam for several hours. The sun was out, but the breeze was cold. Joey and Jimmy got out of the water and started walking home. Their fur was wet, and the breeze chilled them. When they got home, they dried off, and Jimmy put on his favorite purple shirt. Joey put on a blue shirt with red and green dots. The two squirrels ate some food that Joey’s mom, Jasmine, made and went off to bed,'|  \n","\n","## How to configure T5 task parameter for Squad Context based question answering\n","`.setTask('question:)` and prefix the context which can be made up of multiple sentences with `context:`\n","\n","## Example pre-processed input for T5 Squad Context based question answering:\n","```\n","question: What does increased oxygen concentrations in the patient’s lungs displace?\n","context: Hyperbaric (high-pressure) medicine uses special oxygen chambers to increase the partial pressure of O 2 around the patient and, when needed, the medical staff.
