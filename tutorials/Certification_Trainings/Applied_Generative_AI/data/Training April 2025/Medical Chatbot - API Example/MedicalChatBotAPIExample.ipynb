              " 'content': '**Interactions between Levothyroxine Sodium and Iron Supplements**\\n\\nLevothyroxine sodium, a common treatment for hypothyroidism, can interact with iron supplements, affecting the absorption and efficacy of both medications [Document 2, Document 4]. Studies have shown that concomitant intake of iron salt supplements and levothyroxine can impair the absorption of levothyroxine, particularly when taken in tablet form [Document 2]. However, new levothyroxine formulations, such as liquid solutions, may be less affected by iron supplements [Document 2].\\n\\n**Mechanism of Interaction**\\n\\nThe stomach plays a crucial role in the absorption of levothyroxine, and factors such as gastric juice pH, volume, and viscosity can influence the dissolution of levothyroxine from its solid form [Document 5]. Iron supplements can alter the gastric environment, potentially affecting levothyroxine absorption.\\n\\n**Clinical Implications**\\n\\nTo minimize interactions between levothyroxine sodium and iron supplements, patients can consider taking levothyroxine at least 30-60 minutes before breakfast, or using alternative formulations such as liquid solutions [Document 2, Document 3]. Additionally, maintaining a proper time interval between levothyroxine and iron supplement intake can help eliminate interactions [Document 4].\\n\\n**Impact on Thyroid Function and Pregnancy**\\n\\nResearch suggests that levothyroxine sodium combined with selenium treatment can improve thyroid function, mood, and inflammatory responses in patients with chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis and hypothyroidism [Document 9]. Furthermore, a study on hypothyroid female rats found that salt supplements, including iron, can promote a healthy birth and reduce the rate of abortion or preterm births [Document 8].\\n\\n**Conclusion**\\n\\nWhile levothyroxine sodium can interact with iron supplements, alternative formulations and proper timing of medication intake can help minimize these interactions. Patients should consult their healthcare provider to determine the best approach for their specific situation.',\n",

              "   'content': \"Refractory hypothyroidism is associated with high morbidity and increased healthcare expenditure. In general, the use of the levothyroxine absorption test looks promising in evaluating refractory hypothyroidism but has shown significant variability in protocols in multiple settings. We intended to assess the usefulness of the levothyroxine absorption test in a low-resource setting and to assess the factors associated with refractory hypothyroidism. A cross-sectional study among age-matched 25 cases of refractory hypothyroidism and 24 treatment-responsive hypothyroid controls was conducted. A supervised levothyroxine absorption test was performed with levothyroxine 1000 μg tablets after a 10-h fast, and serum free tetraiodothyronine (FT4) levels were measured at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 h. Descriptive statistics, chi-square test, Student's t-test, and logistic regression were used in the analysis. Results showed no significant difference in age, body weight, etiology of hypothyroidism, interfering medications, thyroxine storage, and ingestion technique in cases and controls. Cases had a longer duration of hypothyroidism and males had a higher peak FT4 concentration. During pooled analysis, serum FT4 peaked at 3 h with an increment of 149.4% (128.4-170.5%) from baseline and plateaued thereafter. The absolute value of FT4 at 3 h was 41.59 (s.d. 14.14) pmol/L (3.23 ng/dL). We concluded that there was no significant difference in the pattern of levothyroxine absorption in both groups. The most common cause of refractory disease was pseudo-malabsorption. Rapid supervised levothyroxine absorption test with two blood samples for FT4 at baseline and at the peak of absorption (3 h) is simple, convenient, and cost-effective, particularly in low-resource settings.\",\n",

              "   'content': 'Background: Levothyroxine (LT4) sodium is a standard treatment for hypothyroidism. Its absorption and bioavailability when taken as a tablet have been shown to be significantly decreased with concomitant food ingestion. Therefore, LT4 formulations are recommended to be taken on an empty stomach, at least 30, ideally 60, minutes before breakfast, potentially affecting adherence to therapy. A novel LT4 solution (Tirosint^®-SOL) has been shown to result in a faster absorption process than tablets or soft-gel capsule formulations. The objective of this trial was to evaluate the bioavailability of this preparation taken 15 minutes before a high-fat high-calorie meal in comparison with the minimally recommended 30-minute interval. Methods: Thirty-six (33 completers, 24 males and 9 females) healthy volunteers participating in the randomized study took 600 mcg of LT4 oral solution, single doses after a 10-hour fast, 15 or 30 minutes before a high-fat, high-calorie, FDA-approved standardized meal in a controlled research setting. We measured serum total thyroxine using Liquid Chromatography with Tandem Mass Spectrometry at baseline and multiple time points up to 72 hours after LT4 administration. The predefined equivalence boundaries for the extent of exposure reflected by the area under the curve (AUC) were 80-125%. The washout period was at least 35 days. Results: The geometric mean ratios and confidence intervals (CIs) for the baseline-adjusted extent of exposure represented by AUCs truncated at both 48 and 72 hours after dosing (AUC_0-48: 90% [90% CI 86-94]; and AUC_0-72: 92% [90% CI 87-97]) were within the prespecified equivalence boundaries. The baseline-adjusted peak concentration was also clinically similar (C_max: 85% [90% CI 80-90]). The median t_max was 1.5 hours in each group. The rate of adverse events was similar between groups. Conclusions: We observed no significant difference in the pharmacokinetic properties of a novel LT4 solution administered 15 and 30 minutes before a high-fat high-calorie meal in normal subjects. Further research is needed to evaluate (a) the differences in overall bioavailability at other time points (including immediately premeal) and (b) the real-world effectiveness of this preparation in newly proposed administration conditions to optimize treatment outcomes in hypothyroid patients.',\n",

              "   'content': 'Levothyroxine (l-thyroxine, l-T4) is a drug of choice for treating congenital and primary hypothyroidism. Although clinically significant interactions between l-T4 and food can alter the safety and efficacy of the treatment, they still seem to be generally underestimated by patients, physicians and pharmacists. This review aimed to investigate the effects of meals, beverages, and dietary supplements consumption on l-T4 pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, to identify the most evident interactions, and to perform the recommendations for safe co-administering of l-T4 and food. A total of 121 studies were identified following a systematic literature search adhering to PRISMA guidelines. After full-text evaluation, 63 studies were included. The results proved that l-T4 ingestion in the morning and at bedtime are equally effective, and also that the co-administration of l-T4 with food depends on the drug formulation. We found limited evidence for l-T4 interactions with coffee, soy products, fiber, calcium or iron supplements, and enteral nutrition but interestingly they all resulted in decreased l-T4 absorption. The altered l-T4 efficacy when ingested with milk, juices, papaya, aluminium-containing preparations, and chromium supplements, as well as observed enhancement effect of vitamin C on l-T4 absorption, shall be further investigated in larger, well-designed studies. Novel formulations are likely to solve the problem of coffee, calcium and iron induced malabsorption of l-T4. Maintaining a proper time interval between l-T4 and food intake, especially for coffee and calcium, or iron supplements, provides another effective method of eliminating such interactions.',\n",

The time interval between the ingestion of oral thyroxine and its appearance in the plasma renders unlike a gastric absorption of the hormone. However, several evidence confirm the key role of the stomach as a prerequisite for an efficient absorption of oral levothyroxine. In the stomach, in fact, occur key steps leading to the dissolution of thyroxine from the solid form, the process bringing the active ingredient from the pharmaceutical preparation to the aqueous solution. In particular, gastric juice pH, volume, viscosity, as well as gastric emptying time seem to be the most important limiting factors. These hypotheses are confirmed by the detection of an increased need for levothyroxine in patients with Helicobacter pylori infection, chronic atrophic gastritis, gastroparesis, or in simultaneous treatment with drugs interfering with gastric acidic output. The aim of the present article is to focus on the knowledge of pathophysiologic events that determine the absorptive fate of traditional (tablet) and alternative thyroxine preparations (softgel capsule and liquid solution) in patients bearing gastric disorders.',\n",

The study was conducted in three phases. In the first phase, the role of a combinatory supplement along with levothyroxine to treat hypothyroidism by assessing T3, T4, and TSH hormones was investigated. In the second phase, the dose-depended effects of a combinatory supplement were investigated. Additionally, in the third phase, the quality and quantity of the next generation were measured in the hypothyroid female rats receiving the salt supplement.\\n          \\n\\n\\nRESULTS:\\nThe plasma level of T3, T4 and TSH in hypothyroid rats receiving nutrient supplements indicated that the use of combinatory supplements along with levothyroxine could have desirable effects on the treatment of hypothyroidism to such an extent that the level of T3 and T4 hormones in the intervention group was significantly higher than that of the control group (P≤0.01). The second phase demonstrated that the desired effects of combinatory supplements on the serum levels of T3, T4, and TSH hormones were dose-dependent so that by increasing the dosage of supplementation, a significant decrease in the TSH level was observed (P <0.05), while T3 and T4 levels increased (P <0.01).The results of the third phase demonstrated that salt supplements could be effective in reducing the number of dead or preterm pups, and the use of mineral salts along with levothyroxine could promote a healthy birth.\\n          \\n\\n\\nCONCLUSION:\\nSalt supplements have considerable effects on the health status of the offspring of hypothyroid rats, resulting in the birth of more healthy pups and reducing the rate of abortion or preterm births.\",\n",

The subjects of the current study were 138 chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis (CLT) patients with hypothyroidism admitted to our hospital from May 2016 to September 2019 and were randomly divided into a control group taking levothyroxine sodium (LT4) treatment and a combined group of LT4 combined with selenium treatment, with 69 cases each. Patients in both groups were evaluated for efficacy after 3 months of treatment, and their thyroid function was observed by total triiodothyronine (TT3), total thyroxine (TT4), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOAb), and thyroid globulin antibody (TGAb), and their mood changes were observed by Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) scores. The levels of inflammatory factors such as interleukin-2 (IL-2), interleukin-10 (IL-10), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were measured, and the occurrence of adverse drug reactions during the treatment period was observed and recorded in all patients. The results showed that the total effective rate of the combined group was significantly higher than that of the control group. The levels of TT3, TT4, TSH, TgAb, and TPOAb, SAS and SDS scores, and levels of inflammatory factors such as IL-2, IL-10, and TNF-α were significantly improved in both groups after treatment. Compared with the control group, TGAb, TPOAb, IL-2, TNF-α levels, and SAS and SDS scores decreased more and IL-10 levels increased more in the combined group, while the differences of other indexes were not statistically significant. This suggests that LT4 has certain efficacy in treating CLT with hypothyroidism, and the combined selenium treatment can improve the therapeutic effect of LT4 and can play a greater role in improving patients' mood and immune and inflammatory responses.\",\n",

              " 'content': '**Introduction**\\n\\nVitamin A is an essential nutrient that plays a crucial role in various bodily functions, including vision, immune function, and cell growth and differentiation [Document 2]. It is a fat-soluble vitamin that can be obtained through dietary sources, such as preformed retinol, retinyl esters, and provitamin A carotenoids [Document 4].\\n\\n**Primary Functions of Vitamin A**\\n\\nVitamin A is distributed within the body to support chromophore synthesis in the eyes and retinoid signaling in most other tissues [Document 1]. The active metabolite of vitamin A, retinoic acid (RA), is involved in various biological processes, including cell growth and differentiation, embryonic development, and organogenesis [Document 5]. RA signaling is highly dose-dependent, and a fine-tuning regulatory mechanism is required to maintain appropriate levels of RA [Document 5].\\n\\n**Consequences of Vitamin A Deficiency**\\n\\nVitamin A deficiency (VAD) is a significant public health problem, particularly in developing countries [Document 6]. VAD can lead to various health issues, including night blindness, xerophthalmia, and increased susceptibility to infections [Document 6, Document 9]. In children, VAD can also lead to impaired growth and development, as well as increased risk of respiratory tract infections [Document 8, Document 9].\\n\\n**Prevalence of Vitamin A Deficiency**\\n\\nThe prevalence of VAD varies widely depending on the population and geographic location. In developed countries, VAD is relatively rare, but it remains a significant problem in developing countries, particularly in Asia and Africa [Document 6]. In some regions, such as northern China, VAD is a significant public health problem, with a high prevalence among preschool children [Document 8].\\n\\n**Importance of Vitamin A Supplementation**\\n\\nVitamin A supplementation is a cost-effective strategy to prevent VAD, particularly in areas where dietary sources of vitamin A are limited [Document 10]. However, the coverage of vitamin A supplementation varies widely, and in some areas, it is still a significant public health problem [Document 10].\\n\\nIn conclusion, vitamin A is an essential nutrient that plays a critical role in various bodily functions. VAD is a significant public health problem, particularly in developing countries, and can lead to various health issues. Vitamin A supplementation is a cost-effective strategy to prevent VAD, and efforts should be made to increase coverage and accessibility of vitamin A supplementation programs.',\n",

              "   'content': 'Vitamin A is distributed within the body to support chromophore synthesis in the eyes and retinoid signaling in most other tissues. Two pathways exist for the delivery of vitamin A: the extrinsic pathway transports dietary vitamin A in lipoproteins from intestinal enterocytes to tissues, while the intrinsic pathway distributes vitamin A from hepatic stores bound to serum retinol binding protein (RBP). Previously, the intestine-specific homeodomain transcription factor (ISX) and the RBP receptor STRA6 were identified as gatekeepers of these pathways; however, it is not clear how mutations in the corresponding genes affect retinoid homeostasis. Here, we used a genetic dissection approach in mice to examine the contributions of these proteins in select tissues. We observed that ISX deficiency increased utilization of both preformed and provitamin A. We found that increased storage of retinoids in peripheral tissues of ISX-deficient mice was dependent on STRA6 and induced by retinoid signaling. In addition, double-mutant mice exhibited a partial rescue of the Stra6 mutant ocular phenotype. This rescue came at the expense of a massive accumulation of vitamin A in other tissues, demonstrating that vitamin A is randomly distributed when present in excessive amounts. Remarkably, provitamin A supplementation of mutant mice induced the expression of the RBP receptor 2 in the liver and was accompanied by increased hepatic retinyl ester stores. Taken together, these findings indicate dynamic crosstalk between the delivery pathways for this essential nutrient and suggest that hepatic reuptake of vitamin A takes place when excessive amounts circulate in the blood.',\n",

Through its various metabolites, vitamin A sustains fetal development, immunity, vision, and the maintenance, regulation, and repair of adult tissues. Abnormal tissue levels of the vitamin A metabolite, retinoic acid, can result in detrimental effects which can include congenital defects, immune deficiencies, proliferative defects, and toxicity. For this reason, intricate feedback mechanisms have evolved to allow tissues to generate appropriate levels of active retinoid metabolites despite variations in the level and format, or in the absorption and conversion efficiency of dietary vitamin A precursors. Here, we review basic mechanisms that govern vitamin A signaling and metabolism, and we focus on retinoic acid-controlled feedback mechanisms that contribute to vitamin A homeostasis. Several approaches to investigate mechanistic details of the vitamin A homeostatic regulation using genomic, gene editing, and chromatin capture technologies are also discussed.',\n",

Signaling by vitamin A is carried out by its active metabolite, retinoic acid (RA), following a two-step conversion. RA is a small, lipophilic molecule that can diffuse from its site of synthesis to neighboring RA-responsive cells where it binds retinoic acid receptors within RA response elements of target genes. It is critical that both vitamin A and RA are maintained within a tight physiological range to protect against developmental disorders and disease. Therefore, a series of compensatory mechanisms exist to ensure appropriate levels of each. This strict regulation is provided by a number synthesizing and metabolizing enzymes that facilitate the precise spatiotemporal control of vitamin A metabolism, and RA synthesis and signaling.

This review seeks to provide a comprehensive overview of the current research landscape surrounding retinoids and drug repurposing. The scope of this review encompasses a comprehensive examination of retinoids and their potential for repurposing in various therapeutic contexts. Despite their efficacy in treating dermatological conditions, concerns about toxicity persist, driving the search for safer and more potent retinoids. The molecular mechanisms underlying retinoid activity involve binding to retinoic acid receptors (RARs) and retinoid X receptors (RXRs), leading to transcriptional regulation of target genes. This review seeks to shed light on the possibilities for repurposing retinoids to cover a wider spectrum of therapeutic uses by exploring recent scientific progress. It also aims to offer a more comprehensive understanding of the therapeutic prospects of retinoids and the broader impact of drug repositioning in contemporary medicine.',\n",

However, few pieces of evidence are available about the coverage of vitamin A supplementation at the community level in the study area. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess vitamin A supplementation coverage and prevalence of ocular signs of vitamin A deficiency among children aged 6-59 months.\\n          \\n\\n\\nMETHODS:\\nCommunity-based cross-sectional study design was conducted using a two-stage stratified random sampling method. Data were collected from mothers with children aged 6-59 months using a structured pretested questionnaire. A total of 665 children aged 6 to 59 months were examined for clinical signs and symptoms of vitamin A deficiency by trained clinical health professionals. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression were done.\\n          \\n\\n\\nRESULT:\\nVitamin A supplementation coverage in the study area was 36.2% (95% CI: 32.6-39.9). Overall, the prevalence of xerophthalmia was 2.7%. Age group 6-23 months (AOR: 2.1, 95% CI: 1.4-2.9), good maternal knowledge (AOR: 1.5, 95% CI: 1.2-2.1), children with high wealth status (AOR: 2.3, 95% CI: 1.4-3.8), precampaign health education on vitamin A (AOR: 3.4,95% CI: 2.1-5.6), member of Health Development Army (AOR: 2.7, 95% CI: 1.7-4.2), and access to health facility within <30 minutes (AOR: 2.5, 95% CI: 1.6-3.8) were significantly associated with the receipt of vitamin A capsule.\\n          \\n\\n\\nCONCLUSION:\\nVitamin A supplementation coverage of the study area was low as compared to the UNICEF threshold of 70%. Vitamin A deficiency is a public health problem in the study area. Increasing maternal level of knowledge, precampaign health education on vitamin A supplementation, and strengthening Health Development Army are recommended to increase the vitamin A supplementation coverage.',\n",

The primary aim of diabetes management is to prevent complications, which are a major cause of morbidity and mortality [Document 6]. A multifactorial approach, focusing on diet, exercise, glucose levels, blood pressure, and lipids, is the most effective strategy for preventing complications [Document 6].\\n\\n**Pharmacological Therapy**\\n\\nPharmacological therapy is a crucial component of diabetes management, with various classes of medications available, including metformin, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP1) receptor agonists, and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) inhibitors [Document 3]. The choice of medication depends on individual patient characteristics, such as the presence of cardiovascular disease, heart failure, chronic kidney disease, obesity, or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [Document 1].\\n\\n**Newer Glucose-Lowering Agents**\\n\\nNewer glucose-lowering agents, such as SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP1 receptor agonists, have been shown to have cardiovascular and renal benefits, making them a valuable addition to the treatment armamentarium [Document 3, Document 4]. These agents have been recommended for patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure, or kidney disease [Document 3, Document 5].\\n\\n**Lifestyle Modifications**\\n\\nLifestyle modifications, including diet, exercise, and weight loss, are essential components of diabetes management [Document 6]. A comprehensive approach to diabetes management should include education on carbohydrate counting, caloric intake monitoring, and physical activity [Document 7].\\n\\n**Emerging Therapies**\\n\\nEmerging therapies, such as nanotechnology, gene therapy, and stem cell therapy, are being explored for the management of diabetes [Document 8]. However, these therapies are still in the early stages of development, and further research is needed to determine their efficacy and safety.\\n\\n**Health Management Strategies**\\n\\nHealth management strategies, such as internet-based graded diagnosis and treatment, have been shown to improve lifestyle, ameliorate physiological indicators, and reduce complication rates [Document 10]. These strategies have the potential to provide a positive impact on the entire life-cycle health management of diabetes.\\n\\n**Conclusion**\\n\\nIn conclusion, the best treatment for diabetes is a comprehensive approach that includes individualized pharmacological therapy, lifestyle modifications, and emerging therapies. A multifactorial approach, focusing on diet, exercise, glucose levels, blood pressure, and lipids, is the most effective strategy for preventing complications. Newer glucose-lowering agents, such as SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP1 receptor agonists, have been shown to have cardiovascular and renal benefits, making them a valuable addition to the treatment armamentarium.',\n",

While metformin remains the first line treatment in most cases, choices for second line treatment now extend beyond sulfonylureas and include the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP1) receptor agonists, and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) inhibitors. SGLT2 inhibitors are recommended for people with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure or kidney disease. Diabetic ketoacidosis is an uncommon but important side effect; its occurrence can be minimised with appropriate patient education and management, especially during perioperative periods and times of illness. GLP1 receptor agonists are recommended for people with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Gastrointestinal side effects are common but are less prominent with the longer acting agents and can be minimised with slow titration of the shorter acting agents. DPP4 inhibitors are generally well tolerated, but alogliptin and saxagliptin should be used with caution in people with risk factors for heart failure. To optimise the management of type 2 diabetes, clinicians need to be aware of the pharmacological characteristics of each class of blood glucose-lowering medications and of the effect on cardiovascular health and renal function, balanced by potential adverse effects. Medications that have cardiovascular or renal benefits should be prescribed for patients with these comorbidities, and this is reflected in recent international guidelines.',\n",

At an individual level, people with diabetes are less likely than they were several decades ago to experience classical macrovascular and microvascular complications as a result of improvements in modifiable cardiovascular risk factors and preventive healthcare. However, a significant burden of diabetes complications persists at a population level because of the increasing incidence of diabetes, as well as longer lifetime exposure to diabetes because of younger diagnosis and increased life expectancy. Trials have shown that the most effective strategy for preventing complications of diabetes is a multifactorial approach focussing simultaneously on the management of diet, exercise, glucose levels, blood pressure and lipids. In addition to the cornerstone strategies of addressing diet, exercise and lifestyle measures, the introduction of newer glucose-lowering agents, including sodium-glucose transport protein 2 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists, have brought about a paradigm shift in preventing the onset and progression of complications of type 2 diabetes, particularly cardiovascular and renal disease. The improvement in rates of classical complications of diabetes over time has been accompanied by a growing awareness of non-traditional complications, including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. These emerging complications may not respond to a glycaemic-centred approach alone and highlight the importance of foundational strategies centred on lifestyle measures and supported by pharmaceutical therapy to achieve weight loss and reduce metabolic risk in patients living with diabetes.',\n",

Its complex pathogenesis involves the interaction between genetic predisposition and environmental factors, leading to T cell-mediated destruction of insulin-producing pancreatic beta-cells. This destruction results in insulin insufficiency and hyperglycemia. Hence, managing type 1 diabetes requires a comprehensive approach that includes various aspects such as blood glucose monitoring, insulin therapy, carbohydrate counting, caloric intake monitoring, considering family habits and food preferences, planning daily schedules, and incorporating physical activity. Children with type 1 diabetes encounter age-specific challenges in disease management that may exacerbate the risk of metabolic complications and adverse health outcomes. These risk factors may be neurological, physiological, behavioral, psychological, or social, complicate management and necessitate tailored approaches for effective care. Regardless of the age group, primary caregivers have a high responsibility to maintain optimal glycemic control, including monitoring diet, daily activity, and administering insulin. By reviewing research on the challenges faced by pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes, we summarized key insights aimed at developing targeted interventions and support systems that enhance diabetes management and improve health outcomes in this vulnerable population.',\n",

A literature search for published articles on recent advances in DM management was completed with search engines including Web of Science, Pubmed/Medline, Scopus, using keywords such as DM, management of DM, and gene therapy. Our findings indicate that substantial progress has been made in DM management with promising results using different treatment regimens, including nanotechnology, gene therapy, stem cell, medical nutrition therapy, and lifestyle modification. However, a lot of challenges have been encountered using these techniques, including their optimization to ensure optimal glycemic, lipid, and blood pressure modulation to minimize complications, improvement of patients' compliance to lifestyle and pharmacologic interventions, safety, ethical issues, as well as an effective delivery system among others.

              "   'content': 'BACKGROUND:\\nType 2 diabetes (T2D) is a widespread chronic disease with high rates of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Managing risk factors can effectively prevent acute and chronic complications, improve quality of life, and reduce mortality. Therefore, implementation of a diabetes health management strategy is urgently needed. Emerging medical technologies have strengthened communication between patients and clinicians. The establishment and improvement of the graded diagnosis and treatment system has promoted the prevention, treatment, and management of diabetes.\\n          \\n\\n\\nMETHODS:\\nA total of 300 patients diagnosed with T2D in the Health Management Center at the Affiliated Hospital of Nantong University were randomly divided into two groups: an internet plus graded diagnosis and treatment strategy group, and a control group. After 6 months, the physiological parameters, management indices, and complications were compared between the groups.\\n          \\n\\n\\nRESULTS:\\nPhysiological indicators, such as body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and blood glucose were significantly alleviated in the Internet plus graded diagnosis and treatment strategy group. Management indicators (such as blood glucose monitoring compliance rate, diet control compliance rate, and exercise compliance rate) also improved substantially. The incidence of hypoglycemia was notably increased compared to the control group.\\n          \\n\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS:\\nThe new health management strategy for diabetes can improve lifestyle, ameliorate physiological indicators, reduce the complication rate, and form a virtuous cycle. This provides a positive impact on the entire life-cycle health management of diabetes, and is worthy of further promotion.',\n",

This approach recognizes that each individual has a unique set of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors that contribute to their health and disease [Document 8]. By taking a holistic and integrative perspective, functional medicine practitioners can identify and address the underlying imbalances in an individual's physiological and biochemical processes that contribute to disease [Document 16].\\n\\n**Root Cause Analysis**\\n\\nRoot cause analysis is a method used to identify the underlying causes of a problem or disease, rather than just treating its symptoms [Document 4]. This approach involves a detailed examination of the individual's medical history, lifestyle, and environmental factors to identify the underlying causes of their condition. By identifying and addressing the root causes of disease, functional medicine practitioners can develop effective treatment plans that promote long-term health and wellness.\\n\\n**DIGIN Model Application**\\n\\nThe DIGIN model is a framework for understanding the complex interactions between diet, gut health, inflammation, and lifestyle factors in the development of chronic disease [Document 7]. This model recognizes that each individual has a unique set of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors that contribute to their health and disease. By applying the DIGIN model, functional medicine practitioners can identify and address the underlying imbalances in an individual's physiological and biochemical processes that contribute to disease.\\n\\n**Personalized Nutrition**\\n\\nPersonalized nutrition is a tailored approach to nutrition that takes into account an individual's unique genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors [Document 8]. This approach recognizes that each individual has a unique set of nutritional needs and that a one-size-fits-all approach to nutrition is not effective. By using evidence-based pathophysiological reasoning, functional medicine practitioners can develop personalized nutrition plans that promote optimal health and wellness.\\n\\n**Lifestyle & Environmental Evaluations**\\n\\nLifestyle and environmental evaluations are assessments of an individual's lifestyle and environmental factors, such as stress, sleep, and exposure to toxins, and their impact on health [Document 10]. These evaluations are an essential component of functional medicine, as they provide valuable insights into the underlying causes of disease. By identifying and addressing lifestyle and environmental factors that contribute to disease, functional medicine practitioners can develop effective treatment plans that promote long-term health and wellness.\\n\\n**Systems Biology**\\n\\nSystems biology is an approach to understanding complex biological systems and their interactions, using a holistic and integrative perspective [Document 11]. This approach recognizes that biological systems are complex and dynamic, and that understanding their interactions is essential for promoting health and preventing disease. By applying systems biology principles, functional medicine practitioners can identify and address the underlying imbalances in an individual's physiological and biochemical processes that contribute to disease.\\n\\n**Patient-Centered Care**\\n\\nPatient-centered care is an approach to healthcare that prioritizes the patient's needs, values, and preferences [Document 13]. This approach recognizes that each individual has a unique set of needs and preferences, and that healthcare should be tailored to meet those needs. By providing patient-centered care, functional medicine practitioners can promote optimal health and wellness, and improve patient outcomes.\\n\\n**Core Imbalance**\\n\\nCore imbalance refers to the underlying imbalances in an individual's physiological and biochemical processes that contribute to disease [Document 16]. This concept recognizes that disease is not just the result of a single factor, but rather the result of a complex interplay of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. By identifying and addressing core imbalances, functional medicine practitioners can develop effective treatment plans that promote long-term health and wellness.\\n\\n**Therapeutic Options**\\n\\nTherapeutic options refer to the range of treatment approaches used to address underlying imbalances and promote health [Document 18]. These options may include pharmaceuticals, supplements, lifestyle modifications, and precision rehabilitation. By providing a range of therapeutic options, functional medicine practitioners can develop effective treatment plans that meet the unique needs of each individual.\\n\\n**Preventive Measures**\\n\\nPreventive measures refer to strategies used to prevent disease and promote health, including lifestyle modifications, nutritional interventions, and stress management [Document 19]. These measures are an essential component of functional medicine, as they provide a proactive approach to healthcare. By providing preventive measures, functional medicine practitioners can promote optimal health and wellness, and reduce the risk of chronic disease.\",\n",

Precision medicine aims to deliver the right intervention, at the right time, in the right setting, for the right person, ultimately bolstering the value of the care that we provide. To date, precision medicine efforts have rarely focused on function at the level of a person, but precision rehabilitation is poised to change this and bring the focus on function to the broader precision medicine enterprise. To do this, subgroups of individuals must be identified based on their level of function via precise measurement of their abilities in the physical, cognitive, and psychosocial domains.\\xa0Adoption of electronic health records, advances in data storage and analytics, and improved measurement technology make this shift possible. Here we detail critical components of the precision rehabilitation framework, including (1) the synergistic use of various study designs, (2) the need for standardized functional measurements, (3) the importance of precise and longitudinal measures of function, (4) the utility of comprehensive databases, (5) the importance of predictive analyses, and (6) the need for system and team science.

These models were rigorously evaluated against standard medical benchmarks, such as the USMLE, to measure their performance. Furthermore, for a thorough effectiveness assessment, they were compared with other state-of-the-art medical models of comparable size.\\n          \\n\\n\\nRESULTS:\\nThe models trained with a mix of high-quality, domain-specific, and general data showed superior performance over those trained on larger, less clinically relevant datasets (P\\u2009<\\u2009.001). Our 7-billion-parameter model Med5 scores 60.5% on MedQA, outperforming the previous best of 49.3% from comparable models, and becomes the first of its size to achieve a passing score on the USMLE. Additionally, this model retained its proficiency in general domain tasks, comparable to state-of-the-art general domain models of similar size.\\n          \\n\\n\\nDISCUSSION:\\nOur findings underscore the importance of integrating high-quality, domain-specific data in training large language models for medical purposes. The balanced approach between specialized and general data significantly enhances the model's clinical relevance and performance.\\n          \\n\\n\\nCONCLUSION:\\nThis study sets a new standard in medical language models, proving that a strategically trained, smaller model can outperform larger ones in clinical relevance and general proficiency, highlighting the importance of data quality and expert curation in generative artificial intelligence for healthcare applications.\",\n",

It describes how a personalized nutrition practice approach supported by evidence-based pathophysiological reasoning could direct additional research, which could then transform practice and support food industry developments. Current use of the term \"personalized nutrition\" is reviewed and a definition is provided. Also explored are current approaches to personalized nutrition practice and evidence-based practice in clinical nutrition. Patient-centered practice, which involves individuals in their healthcare decisions, is currently being provided under the name \"personalized.\" An evidence-based personalized practice approach should include the use of robust, standardized, and validated tools that gather a patient\\'s signs and symptoms, health history, family history, genetics, environment, lifestyle, social life, diet, behavior and other factors that have an impact on physiological processes. It should also gather anthropometric measures as well as functional, diagnostic, and prognostic biomarkers for pathophysiological mechanisms. Such tools would pool n\\u2009=\\u20091 data into a case-by-case evidence base that uses computational network modelling to predict the efficacy of personalized nutrition interventions. Prediction of the efficacy of interventions should also be validated using, when possible, blinded, randomized, controlled, stratified intervention studies. This model would provide practitioners with data that support evidence-based pathophysiological reasoning. It would enable clinicians to prioritize interventions on the basis of the mechanisms of action of interventions and to ameliorate the mechanisms of pathophysiology, which are a priority for the individual. Interventions then may be applied using a patient-centered practice approach. This would transform evidence-based nutrition practice into a P4 medicine approach that is personalized, preventive, predictive, and participatory. Developing pathophysiological mechanistic understanding also provides new opportunities for stakeholders, including the food industry, researchers, healthcare practitioners, and consumers.',\n",

After assessing medical history, nutritional physical exam, baseline functional status (utilizing validated tools to measure metabolic, physical, cognitive, emotional and behavioral functional capacity), serum biomarkers, and genomic and microbiome markers, participants were assigned to applicable umbrellas and buckets. Personalized health programs were developed and implemented using systems biology formalism and functional medicine clinical approaches.

The four component concepts (i.e., a-d) related to the objective were examined and interpreted using a novel 3-archetype heuristic (i.e., Partner, Client and Customer) revealing common practice-based themes related to care preferences and expectations in collaborative goal setting, enduring relationships, value co-creation and evolving patient expectations during challenging medical circumstances. Most practice-based insights were generated within the Partner archetype, likely reflecting high congruence with pharmacist and patient responses related to the Medication Experience and Therapeutic Relationship.

Despite its improvements, the approach is unable to consider the relative clinical importance or magnitude of imbalance in each covariate weight, and ignores any imbalance which is not statistically significant, even when these imbalances may collectively justify intervention.

Each health state reflects a distinct pattern of one's overall function. This assay provides a new frame of understanding health and disease as complex-adaptive system states of the person as-a-whole. It firstly describes how complex patterns can emerge from simple equations. It then discusses how clinical medicine in certain domains has started to explore the pattern characteristics resulting in the heterogeneity of disease, and how this better understanding has improved patient management. The experiential state of health can be surprising to the observer-some are in good health with disabling disease, others are in poor health without the evidence of any. The main part of the assay describes the underlying complexity principles that contribute to health, and synthesizes available evidence from various research perspectives to support the philosophic/theoretical proposition of the complex-adaptive nature of health. It shows how health states arise from complex-adaptive system dynamics amongst the variables of a hierarchically layered system comprising the domains of a person's macro-level external environment to his nano-level biological blueprint. The final part suggests that the frame of health as a dynamic complex-adaptive state defines a new paradigm, and outlines ways of translating these expanded understandings to clinical practice, future research, and health system design.\",\n",

Recent research has revealed their complex nature involving biological, psychological, and social factors. Care requires a multidisciplinary approach, which, to date, has yet to be considered. A Constructivist Grounded Theory study was conducted to understand the reasons behind this, exploring Functional Neurological Disorders diagnosis, communication, and understanding from multiple perspectives (patients and healthcare professionals). The core category was \"negotiating Functional Neurological Disorders meanings and care amid a dissatisfying dichotomy,\" with sub-categories: i) seeking to \"word\" the disease, ii) exposing reductionism, and iii) a pluralist vision emerging. Diagnosing and communicating Functional Neurological Disorders is a process of negotiating meanings and care that hinges on participants\\' diverse ontological perspectives regarding the condition. Results highlight the difficulty in finding common ground and achieving mutual understanding among the various viewpoints, creating a challenge in establishing a unified approach to Functional Neurological Disorders care. In this context, only a few healthcare professionals emphasized the potential benefits of increased integration. A shift is required from a reductionist to an integrated biopsychosocial perspective to develop a more cohesive approach. Defining a medical paradigm through dialogue with teams and patients is essential in addressing Functional Neurological Disorders effectively. Furthermore, the required interdisciplinary approach holds the potential to mitigate the dissatisfaction arising from fragmented and compartmentalized care (the \"dissatisfying dichotomy\") experienced by our participants.

              "   'content': \"The challenge of making flexible, standard, and early medical diagnoses is significant. However, some limitations are not fully overcome. First, the diagnosis rules established by medical experts or learned from a trained dataset prove static and too general. It leads to decisions that lack adaptive flexibility when finding new circumstances. Secondly, medical terminological interoperability is highly critical. It increases realism and medical progress and avoids isolated systems and the difficulty of data exchange, analysis, and interpretation. Third, criteria for diagnosis are often heterogeneous and changeable. It includes symptoms, patient history, demographic, treatment, genetics, biochemistry, and imaging. Symptoms represent a high-impact indicator for early detection. It is important that we deal with these symptoms differently, which have a great relationship with semantics, vary widely, and have linguistic information. This negatively affects early diagnosis decision-making. Depending on the circumstances, the diagnosis is made solo on imaging and some medical tests. In this case, although the accuracy of the diagnosis is very high, can these decisions be considered an early diagnosis or prove the condition is deteriorating? Our contribution in this paper is to present a real medical diagnostic system based on semantics, fuzzy, and dynamic decision rules. We attempt to integrate ontology semantics reasoning and fuzzy inference. It promotes fuzzy reasoning and handles knowledge representation problems. In complications and symptoms, ontological semantic reasoning improves the process of evaluating rules in terms of interpretability, dynamism, and intelligence. A real-world case study, ADNI, is presented involving the field of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The proposed system has indicated the possibility of the system to diagnose AD with an accuracy of 97.2%, 95.4%, 94.8%, 93.1%, and 96.3% for AD, LMCI, EMCI, SMC, and CN respectively.\",\n",

              "   'content': 'For decades, cognitive and behavioral therapies (CBTs) have been tested in randomized controlled trials for specific psychiatric syndromes that were assumed to represent expressions of latent diseases. Although these protocols were more effective as compared to psychological control conditions, placebo treatments, and even active pharmacotherapies, further advancement in efficacy and dissemination has been inhibited by a failure to focus on processes of change. This picture appears now to be evolving, due both to a collapse of the idea that mental disorders can be classified into distinct, discrete categories, and to the more central attention given to processes of change in newer, so-called \"third-wave\" CBTs. Here we review the context for this historic progress and evaluate the impact of these newer methods and models, not as protocols for treating syndromes, but as ways of targeting an expanded range of processes of change. Five key features of \"third-wave\" therapies are underlined: a focus on context and function; the view that new models and methods should build on other strands of CBT; a focus on broad and flexible repertoires vs. an approach to signs and symptoms; applying processes to the clinician, not just the client; and expanding into more complex issues historically more characteristic of humanistic, existential, analytic, or system-oriented approaches. We argue that these newer methods can be considered in the context of an idiographic approach to process-based functional analysis. Psychological processes of change can be organized into six dimensions: cognition, affect, attention, self, motivation and overt behavior. Several important processes of change combine two or more of these dimensions. Tailoring intervention strategies to target the appropriate processes in a given individual would be a major advance in psychiatry and an important step toward precision mental health care.',\n",

              "   'content': 'The healthcare system is an example of a\\xa0complex sociotechnical system where the goal is the best possible individual treatment together with the cost-effective use of modern technology. Working in anesthesia requires medical knowledge as well as manual skills and the use of specialized technical equipment in an interdisciplinary and interprofessional setting. The susceptibility to errors and adverse events, especially in the care of critically ill patients, is high.In order to avoid unintentional hospital-induced patient harm, the healthcare system has recently taken the path of prescribing the best possible care for a\\xa0large number of patients with the help of evidence-based guidelines and specific algorithms or instructions for action. Patient safety is defined accordingly as a\\xa0state in which adverse events occur as rarely as possible (Safety‑I).Following this approach clinical risk management is defined as the purposeful planning, coordination, execution and control of all measures that serve to avoid unintended hospital-induced patient harm or to limit its effects. For this purpose, the focus has recently been placed on instruments such as Critical Incident Reporting Systems (CIRS) or Morbidity and Mortality Conferences (M&MC); however, it is increasingly recognized that adverse events in complex sociotechnical systems such as the healthcare system arise situationally from the interaction of numerous components of the system. The effectiveness of CIRS and M&MC is limited because they do not comprehensively take situational effects into account. Thus, only selective changes are possible which, however, do not imply a\\xa0sustainable improvement of the system. Newer approaches to strengthening safety in complex sociotechnical systems understand positive as well as negative events as being equally caused by the variable adaptation of behavior to daily practice. They therefore focus on the majority of positive courses of treatment and the necessary adaptations of the health professionals involved in daily practice (Safety‑II). In this way, the adaptability of the system under unexpected conditions should be increased (Resilience Engineering). Taking this systemic approach into account, the Functional Resonance Analysis Method (FRAM) offers a\\xa0variety of possibilities for the prospective analysis of a\\xa0complex sociotechnical system or for retrospective incident analysis through modelling of actual everyday actions (work as done). Through interviews with the health professionals involved, document analyses and work inspections, processes and their functions as well as the associated variability are assessed and graphically presented. The FRAM models the collected information of the process as complexes of interconnected functions represented by hexagonal symbols. Each corner of the hexagon represents a\\xa0given aspect, which together form the properties of the function (input, output, precondition, resource, time, control). Through this visualization and evaluation of the interview results, the actual everyday actions (work as done) can be compared with the predefined ones (work as imagined). The evaluation of the variability found in this way enables the strengths and weaknesses of processes to be uncovered. As a\\xa0result, specific measures can be derived to strengthen the system. Increased consideration of the Safety‑II approach within clinical risk management can be a\\xa0valuable addition to existing clinical risk management methods.',\n",

In this scoping review, we summarized available evidence on the development and validation of IC index scores, the association of IC with health-related factors, and its biological basis. The review specifically focused on identifying current research gaps, proposed strategies to leverage biobank datasets, and opportunities to study the genetic mechanisms and gene-environment interactions underlying IC.\\n          \\n\\n\\nMETHODS:\\nThe literature search was conducted across six databases, including PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science, Scopus, AgeLine, and PsycINFO, using keywords related to IC.\\n          \\n\\n\\nRESULTS:\\nThis review included 84 articles, and most of them (n=38) adopted the 5-domains approach to operationalize IC, utilizing correlated five factors or bifactor structures. Intrinsic capacity has consistently shown significant associations with socio-demographic and health-related outcomes, including age, sex, wealth index, nutrition, exercise, smoking, alcohol use, ADL, IADL, frailty, multimorbidity, and mortality. While studies on the biological basis of the composite IC are limited, with only one study finding a significant association with the ApoE gene variants, studies on specific IC domains - locomotor, vitality, cognitive, psychological, and sensory suggest a heritability of 20-85% of IC and several genetic variants associated with these subdomains have been identified. However, evidence on how genetic and environmental factors influence IC is still lacking, with no available study to date.\\n          \\n\\n\\nCONCLUSION:\\nOur review found that there was inconsistency in the use of standardized IC measurement tools and indicators, but the IC indices had shown good construct and predictive validity. Research into the genetic and gene-to-environment interactions underlying IC is still lacking, which calls for the use of resources from large biobank datasets in the future.',\n",

Understanding the genetic basis of these disorders could improve diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. With publicly available summary statistics, we conducted a multivariate genome-wide association study (GWAS) and multi-omic analysis of four somatoform traits-fatigue, irritable bowel syndrome, pain intensity, and health satisfaction-in 799,429 individuals genetically similar to Europeans. Using genomic structural equation modeling, GWAS identified 134 loci significantly associated with a somatoform common factor, including 44 loci not significant in the input GWAS and 8 novel loci for somatoform traits. Gene-property analyses highlighted an enrichment of genes involved in synaptic transmission and enriched gene expression in 12 brain tissues. Six genes, including members of the CD300 family, had putatively causal effects mediated by protein abundance. There was substantial polygenic overlap (76-83%) between the somatoform and externalizing, internalizing, and general psychopathology factors. Somatoform polygenic scores were associated most strongly with obesity, Type 2 diabetes, tobacco use disorder, and mood/anxiety disorders in independent biobanks. Drug repurposing analyses suggested potential therapeutic targets, including MEK inhibitors. Mendelian randomization indicated potentially protective effects of gut microbiota, including Ruminococcus bromii. These biological insights provide promising avenues for treatment development.',\n",

We include all studies assessing eSBI towards lifestyle habits (dietary habits and/or PA at least), implemented in healthcare settings and targeting adult participants.\\n          \\n\\n\\nRESULTS:\\nOf 1981 articles identified, 15 studies met inclusion criteria. Most of them documented eSBIs implemented in primary care (n\\xa0=\\xa011), targeting PA (n\\xa0=\\xa011) and diet (n\\xa0=\\xa09) alone or combined (n\\xa0=\\xa05). Some eSBIs targeted additional behaviors (e.g. smoking, drinking). Delivery modes included computer (n\\xa0=\\xa08), printed documents (n\\xa0=\\xa08) or phone (n\\xa0=\\xa02) but only four eSBIs were interactive (or partially automated). In addition to personalized feedback, most common behavior change techniques were \"information about social and environmental consequences\" (n\\xa0=\\xa09), \"goal setting\" (n\\xa0=\\xa07), and \"information about health consequences\" (n\\xa0=\\xa07). Most studies assessing behavior change had a control group (8 in 10), and eight studies found positive changes in behavior.\\n          \\n\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS:\\nAlthough implementing eSBIs towards PA/diet among adult patients in medical settings seems promising for primary, secondary and tertiary prevention, common conceptual framework, intervention and outcomes are severely lacking, and the extent to which they follow existing SBI guidelines remains unclear. Demonstrating their effectiveness requires fixing these issues before conducting prospective assessment studies in medical settings.',\n",

Patterns of nutrient deficiency signs and biomarker levels below health-promoting thresholds have been identified in national nutrition surveys. However, identifying these patterns remains a challenge in clinical medicine for many reasons, including clinician training and education, clinical time restraints, and the belief that these signs are both rare and recognizable only in cases of severe nutritional deficiencies. With an increased interest in prevention and limited resources for comprehensive diagnostic evaluations, a functional nutrition evaluation may augment patient-centered screening evaluations and personalized wellness programs. During LIFEHOUSE, we have documented physical exam, anthropometric, and biomarker findings that may increase the recognition of these wellness-challenging patterns in a population of 369 adult employees working in two occupational areas: administrative/sales and manufacturing/warehouse.

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "REASON FOR CONSULT:  I was asked to see this patient with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer, on hospice with inferior ST-elevation MI.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient from prior strokes has expressive aphasia, is not able to express herself in a clear meaningful fashion. Her daughter who accompanies her is very attentive whom I had met previously during drainage of a malignant hemorrhagic pericardial effusion last month. The patient has been feeling well for the last several weeks, per the daughter, but today per the personal aide, became agitated and uncomfortable at about 2:30 p.m. At about 7 p.m., the patient began vomiting, was noted to be short of breath by her daughter with garbled speech, arms flopping, and irregular head movements. Her daughter called 911 and her symptoms seemed to improve. Then, she began vomiting. When the patient's daughter asked her if she had chest pain, the patient said yes.She came to the emergency room, an EKG showed inferior ST-elevation MI. I was called immediately and knowing her history, especially, her hospice status with recent hemorrhagic pericardial effusion, I felt thrombolytic was contraindicated and she would not be a candidate for aggressive interventional therapy with PCI/CABG. She was begun after discussion with the oncologist, on heparin drip and has received morphine, nitro, and beta-blocker, and currently states that she is pain free. Repeat EKG shows normalization of her ST elevation in the inferior leads as well as normalization of prior reciprocal changes.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer. In early-to-mid December, she had an admission and was found to have a malignant pericardial effusion with tamponade requiring urgent drainage. We did repeat an echo several weeks later and that did not show any recurrence of the pericardial effusion. She is on hospice from the medical history, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, history of multiple CVA.MEDICATIONS:  Medications as an outpatient:1. Amiodarone 200 mg once a day.\n",
        "2. Roxanol concentrate 5 mg three hours p.r.n. pain.ALLERGIES: CODEINE. NO SHRIMP, SEAFOOD, OR DYE ALLERGY.FAMILY HISTORY:  Negative for cardiac disease.SOCIAL HISTORY:  She does not smoke cigarettes. She uses alcohol. No use of illicit drugs. She is divorced and lives with her daughter. She is a retired medical librarian from Florida.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Unable to be obtained due to the patient's aphasia.\n",
        "PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Height 5 feet 3, weight of 106 pounds, temperature 97.1 degrees, blood pressure ranges from 138/82 to 111/87, pulse 61, respiratory rate 22. O2 saturation 100%. On general exam, she is an elderly woman with now marked aphasia, which per her daughter waxes and wanes, was more pronounced and she nods her head up and down when she says the word, no, and conversely, she nods her head side-to-side when she uses the word yes with some discordance in her head gestures with vocalization. HEENT shows the cranium is normocephalic and atraumatic. She has dry mucosal membrane. She now has a right facial droop, which per her daughter is new. Neck veins are not distended. No carotid bruits visible. Skin: Warm, well perfused. Lungs are clear to auscultation anteriorly. No wheezes. Cardiac exam: S1, S2, regular rate. No significant murmurs. PMI is nondisplaced. Abdomen: Soft, nondistended. Extremities: Without edema, on limited exam. Neurological exam seems to show only the right facial droop.DIAGNOSTIC/LABORATORY DATA:  EKGs as reviewed above. Her last ECG shows normalization of prior ST elevation in the inferior leads with Q waves and first-degree AV block, PR interval 280 milliseconds. Further lab shows sodium 135, potassium 4.2, chloride 98, bicarbonate 26, BUN 9, creatinine 0.8, glucose 162, troponin 0.17, INR 1.27, white blood cell count 1.3, hematocrit 31, platelet count of 179.Chest x-ray, no significant pericardial effusion.IMPRESSION:  The patient is a 69-year-old woman with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer with a recent hemorrhagic pericardial effusion, now admitted with cerebrovascular accident and transient inferior myocardial infarction, which appears to be canalized. I will discuss this in detail with the patient and her daughter, and clearly, her situation is quite guarded with likely poor prognosis, which they are understanding of.RECOMMENDATIONS:1. I think it is reasonable to continue heparin, but clearly she would be at risk for hemorrhagic pericardial effusion recurrence.\n",
        "2. Morphine is appropriate, especially for preload reduction and other comfort measures as appropriate.3. Would avoid other blood thinners including Plavix, Integrilin, and certainly, she is not a candidate for a thrombolytic with which the patient and her daughter are in agreement with after a long discussion.Other management as per the medical service. I have discussed the case with Dr. X of the hospitalist service who will be admitting the patient.\n",

        "IMPRESSION:1. 60% to 70% mid left anterior descending stenosis.2. Mild 30% to 40% stenosis of the proximal right coronary artery.3. Status post StarClose closure of the right common femoral artery.PLAN: Plan will be to perform elective PCI of the mid LAD.\n",

Jane did receive a course of Bactrim for 14 days for UTI. Evidently, at some point in time, the patient was noted to develop a pressure-type wound on the sole of her left foot and left great toe. She was also noted to have a large sacral wound; this is in a similar location with previous laminectomy, and this continues to receive daily care. The patient was transferred secondary to inability to participate in full physical and occupational therapy and continue medical management of her diabetes, the sacral decubitus, left foot pressure wound, and associated complications of diabetes. She is given Fragmin 5000 units subcutaneously daily, OxyContin 30 mg p.o. q.12 h., folic acid 1 mg daily, levothyroxine 0.1 mg p.o. , Prevacid 30 mg daily, Avandia 4 mg daily, Norvasc 10 mg daily, Lexapro 20 mg daily, aspirin 81 mg daily, Senna 2 tablets p.o. q.a.m., Neurontin 400 mg p.o. t.i.d., magnesium citrate 1 bottle p.o , Wellbutrin 100 mg p.o. daily, and Bactrim DS b.i.d.'''\n"
