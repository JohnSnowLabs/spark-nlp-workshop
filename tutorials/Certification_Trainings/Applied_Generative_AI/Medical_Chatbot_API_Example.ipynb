According to Benvenga, et al. hypothyroidism is a common disorder that has a prevalence of approximately 5% and an incidence of approximately 250/100,000 per year in the adult population [43]. Oral administration of levothyroxine is the standard treatment for patients with hypothyroidism [33]. During pregnancy, supplementation with iron and folic acid is widely used and recommended in Portugal. However, several evidences indicated an interaction between iron and levothyroxine [44,45,46], which is dependent on the formulation of levothyroxine [43]. In our research, all donor mothers were under medication with folic acid during the first trimester of gestation or iron supplementation during the last trimester of gestation. Donor mothers with hypothyroidism were treated with oral levothyroxine (Euthyrox, 2.5 µg) in generic tablets formulation, according to the standard therapy for patients with hypothyroidism [33]. However, the absorption of levothyroxine appears to be reduced when the iron is present, probably due to the formation of an insoluble complex between them [46]. The simultaneous intake of levothyroxine with the oral formulation of iron leads to the need to adjust the levothyroxine dose to achieve the same levels of TH. Regarding the liquid formulation of levothyroxine, Benvenga, et al. demonstrated that it is more resistant to sequestration by calcium bicarbonate or ferrous sulphate [43] than the tablet formulation (used in this work). Thus, it would be interesting to know the levels of TH during pregnancy. Ideally, all women with hypothyroidism should be educated about the potential interaction between iron pills and levothyroxine and should be advised to avoid simultaneous intake of both [46].',\n",

The aim of this review was to summarize the medications, food and beverages that interact with levothyroxine and to assess their effects, mechanisms and treatments.\\n\\n\\nMethods:\\nA systematic review on interfering substances that interact with levothyroxine was performed. Web of Science, Embase, PubMed, the Cochrane library, grey literature from other sources and the lists of references were searched for human studies comparing the levothyroxine efficacy with and without interfering substances. The patient characteristics, drug classes, effects and mechanism were extracted. The NHLBI study quality assessment tools and the JBI critical appraisal checklist were used to assess the quality of included studies.\\n\\n\\nResults:\\nA total of 107 articles with 128 studies were included. Drugs interactions were revealed in calcium and iron supplements, proton pump inhibitors, bile acid sequestrants, phosphate binders, sex hormones, anticonvulsants and other drugs. Some food and beverage could also induce malabsorption. Proposed mechanisms included direct complexing, alkalization, alteration of serum thyroxine-binding globulin levels and acceleration of levothyroxine catabolism via deiodination. Dose adjustment, administration separation and discontinuation of interfering substances can eliminate the interactions. Liquid solutions and soft-gel capsules could eliminate the malabsorption due to chelation and alkalization. The qualities of most included studies were moderate.\\n\\n\\nConclusion:\\nLots of medications and food can impair the bioavailability of levothyroxine.

              "  {'content': 'Abstract : Levothyroxine (l-thyroxine, l-T4) is a drug of choice for treating congenital and primary hypothyroidism. Although clinically significant interactions between l-T4 and food can alter the safety and efficacy of the treatment, they still seem to be generally underestimated by patients, physicians and pharmacists. This review aimed to investigate the effects of meals, beverages, and dietary supplements consumption on l-T4 pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, to identify the most evident interactions, and to perform the recommendations for safe co-administering of l-T4 and food. A total of 121 studies were identified following a systematic literature search adhering to PRISMA guidelines. After full-text evaluation, 63 studies were included. The results proved that l-T4 ingestion in the morning and at bedtime are equally effective, and also that the co-administration of l-T4 with food depends on the drug formulation. We found limited evidence for l-T4 interactions with coffee, soy products, fiber, calcium or iron supplements, and enteral nutrition but interestingly they all resulted in decreased l-T4 absorption. The altered l-T4 efficacy when ingested with milk, juices, papaya, aluminium-containing preparations, and chromium supplements, as well as observed enhancement effect of vitamin C on l-T4 absorption, shall be further investigated in larger, well-designed studies. Novel formulations are likely to solve the problem of coffee, calcium and iron induced malabsorption of l-T4. Maintaining a proper time interval between l-T4 and food intake, especially for coffee and calcium, or iron supplements, provides another effective method of eliminating such interactions.',\n",

              "  {'content': 'Introduction : Levothyroxine (l-thyroxine, l-T4) is a drug of choice for treating primary hypothyroidism, which in developing countries generally occurs due to Hashimoto thyroiditis, thyroidectomy, or iodine deficiency [1]. In 2020, l-T4 was the third most often prescribed drug in the USA [2]. Interactions between l-T4 and food may affect the safety and efficacy of the treatment but are still widely underestimated by patients and health care professionals. McMillan et al. [3] surveyed hypothyroid patients to determine the factors affecting l-T4 therapy. Out of 925 participants, 51.8% used dietary supplements known to interact with l-T4, especially calcium (47.5%) and iron (11.9%), whereas 68% reported frequent (more than twice a week) intake of food and beverages rich in fiber (bran flakes, fiber bars, fiber drinks, or broccoli florets), iodine (dried seaweed, cranberries, plain yogurt, cod), or soy. The disturbing findings were that 20% of patients took l-T4 together with breakfast, lunch, or dinner, and 21.5% administered the drug less than 30 min before the meal. Simultaneously, 124 patients (13.4%) experienced difficulties in controlling their hypothyroid symptoms. Thus, the authors suggest that l-T4 interactions with food, beverages, and dietary supplements, consumed by the participants, can, at least partly, explain these facts. The study performed by Michel et al. [4] also revealed the patients’ inadequate knowledge on l-T4 proper administration schedules. Forty five patients, treated with l-T4, completed a telephone survey. Out of 21 participants, 80% ingested calcium supplements within 4 h before, or after taking l-T4, whereas 67% within 1 h. Five patients reported administering iron or magnesium supplements within less than 1 h from taking l-T4. Only two of all the participants were advised to separate supplements and l-T4 intake.',\n",

              "  {'content': 'Levothyroxine–Coffee Interaction : Six hypothyroid and nine healthy women were administered two 100 µg l-T4 tablets swallowed with (1) coffee, (2) water, or (3) water followed by coffee 60 min later. Th authors measured average and peak incremental rise of serum T4 concentrations and time to reach maximal serum level. Compared to water, coffee significantly lowered the incremental rise of serum T4 level, both average (by 36% in thyroid patients and 29% in volunteers) and peak (by 30% and 19%, respectively). It also significantly delayed time to reach maximal serum level (by 38 and 43 min). As no significant difference was found between groups (2) and (3), it was suggested that 1h break between coffee and l-T4 is enough to prevent the interaction. Additionally, an in vitro study found coffee to be 2-times weaker than other agents, such as antacids and fiber, known to interfere with l-T4 absorption. Sindoni et al. [62] presented cases of 6 patients in whom serum TSH level failed to be normalized or suppressed. All patients, within 1.6–2.2 µg/kg daily dosage range, declared to take l-T4 tablets together with, or shortly before, their morning espresso or barley coffee. Advising patients to separate coffee and l-T4 by 1 h, helped them to achieve euthyroidism. Recently, the interaction of l-T4 with American coffee (drip coffee) was also reported. Węgrzyn [63] described a case of a 52-year-old woman who developed clinical signs of hypothyroidism after taking in the morning 175 µg of l-T4 in tablets, with a cup of drip coffee. The patient was advised to postpone drinking coffee by 1h after taking l-T4. Her TSH levels normalized in 6 weeks (from 8.27 to 0.24 mU/L). The above cases refer to l-T4 in tablets. Recent studies suggest that coffee-induced malabsorption of l-T4 can be reduced by replacing the tablets with soft gel capsules or liquid form. Vita et al. [64] assessed a 6-month study on eight patients with coffee-associated l-T4 malabsorption.',\n",

              "  {'content': 'Recent Technologies for Combating Diabetes, Management of Diabetes : Biguanide (metformin) and Thiazolidinedione type drugs are most frequently used against insulin-resistant T2DM and in some cases, they are even used together in combination [109]. Speaking of combination drugs, metformin is reportedly the most commonly used antidiabetic combination drug, and it is used in combination with either α–glucosidase inhibitors or GLP-1 agonists, SGLT-2 inhibitors, DPP4 inhibitors, or thiazolidinedione depending on the patient’s medical condition [110]. The complex nature of diabetes makes it difficult to develop effective treatment strategies as the etiology of the disease can differ from patient to patient. A universal cure for the disease is highly sought after in studies of the etiology of diabetes, as the cure is hardly feasible. In type 2 diabetes the inability of cells to intake glucose from the blood can be due to genetic mutations or desensitization of receptors which makes developing treatment strategies harder compared to type 1 patients. Unfortunately, recent studies propose that insulin therapy in type 1 patients can lead to developing type 2 diabetes due to desensitization [120], which makes it an important time for finding a cure or alternative treatment methods. Several treatments have been developed so far for diabetes, with a majority of them being focused on type 1 diabetes. As the most common etiology of type 1 diabetes is damaged or dysfunctional islets of Langerhans cells, various treatment methods prioritized reconstructing or inserting functional islets of Langerhans cells in the patient’s body which will liberate the patient from needing external insulin and terminate any possibility of developing type 2 diabetes from type 1 and any other side effect of external insulin ingestion. Advancement of stem cell technology has been a boon for researchers in developing a subsequent cure for type 1 diabetes [121].',\n",

Electroacupuncture (EA) can enhance insulin sensitivity and reduce blood glucose levels.\\n\\n\\nOBJECTIVES:\\nTo compare the effects of EA plus glibenclamide (G) with single therapy by G or EA on blood glucose, pancreas volume, islet volume, ratio of islet volume to pancreas volume, apoptotic and beta cells numbers and body weight in diabetic rats.\\n\\n\\nMETHODS:\\nSixty adult male Wistar rats were randomly divided to 10 groups: 2 non-diabetic control groups and 8 diabetic groups (1 control and 7 experimental groups; D/G 2.5, D/G 5, D/G 10 mg/kg, EA, D/EA/G 2.5, D/EA/G 5, and D/EA/G 10). Diabetes was induced by intraperitoneal injection of 35 mg/kg streptozotocin with high-fat diet. At the end of the course, blood samples were obtained and pancreases were dissected.\\n\\n\\nRESULTS:\\nEA was as effective as D/G 5 and D/G 10 in all outcomes. Combination therapy of EA and glibenclamide 5 and 10 mg/kg resulted in a better glucose-lowering effect, greater islet volume and ratio of islet volume to pancreas volume than single therapies (P < .05). EA increased the pancreas volume as much as the combination therapies (P > .05).\\n\\n\\nCONCLUSION:\\nCombination of EA and glibenclamide 5 showed the best effects on blood glucose, islet volume and ratio of islet to pancreas volume.

        "\n",
        "REASON FOR CONSULT:  I was asked to see this patient with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer, on hospice with inferior ST-elevation MI.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient from prior strokes has expressive aphasia, is not able to express herself in a clear meaningful fashion. Her daughter who accompanies her is very attentive whom I had met previously during drainage of a malignant hemorrhagic pericardial effusion last month. The patient has been feeling well for the last several weeks, per the daughter, but today per the personal aide, became agitated and uncomfortable at about 2:30 p.m. At about 7 p.m., the patient began vomiting, was noted to be short of breath by her daughter with garbled speech, arms flopping, and irregular head movements. Her daughter called 911 and her symptoms seemed to improve. Then, she began vomiting. When the patient's daughter asked her if she had chest pain, the patient said yes.She came to the emergency room, an EKG showed inferior ST-elevation MI. I was called immediately and knowing her history, especially, her hospice status with recent hemorrhagic pericardial effusion, I felt thrombolytic was contraindicated and she would not be a candidate for aggressive interventional therapy with PCI/CABG. She was begun after discussion with the oncologist, on heparin drip and has received morphine, nitro, and beta-blocker, and currently states that she is pain free. Repeat EKG shows normalization of her ST elevation in the inferior leads as well as normalization of prior reciprocal changes.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer. In early-to-mid December, she had an admission and was found to have a malignant pericardial effusion with tamponade requiring urgent drainage. We did repeat an echo several weeks later and that did not show any recurrence of the pericardial effusion. She is on hospice from the medical history, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, history of multiple CVA.MEDICATIONS:  Medications as an outpatient:1. Amiodarone 200 mg once a day.\n",
        "2. Roxanol concentrate 5 mg three hours p.r.n. pain.ALLERGIES: CODEINE. NO SHRIMP, SEAFOOD, OR DYE ALLERGY.FAMILY HISTORY:  Negative for cardiac disease.SOCIAL HISTORY:  She does not smoke cigarettes. She uses alcohol. No use of illicit drugs. She is divorced and lives with her daughter. She is a retired medical librarian from Florida.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Unable to be obtained due to the patient's aphasia.\n",
        "PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Height 5 feet 3, weight of 106 pounds, temperature 97.1 degrees, blood pressure ranges from 138/82 to 111/87, pulse 61, respiratory rate 22. O2 saturation 100%. On general exam, she is an elderly woman with now marked aphasia, which per her daughter waxes and wanes, was more pronounced and she nods her head up and down when she says the word, no, and conversely, she nods her head side-to-side when she uses the word yes with some discordance in her head gestures with vocalization. HEENT shows the cranium is normocephalic and atraumatic. She has dry mucosal membrane. She now has a right facial droop, which per her daughter is new. Neck veins are not distended. No carotid bruits visible. Skin: Warm, well perfused. Lungs are clear to auscultation anteriorly. No wheezes. Cardiac exam: S1, S2, regular rate. No significant murmurs. PMI is nondisplaced. Abdomen: Soft, nondistended. Extremities: Without edema, on limited exam. Neurological exam seems to show only the right facial droop.DIAGNOSTIC/LABORATORY DATA:  EKGs as reviewed above. Her last ECG shows normalization of prior ST elevation in the inferior leads with Q waves and first-degree AV block, PR interval 280 milliseconds. Further lab shows sodium 135, potassium 4.2, chloride 98, bicarbonate 26, BUN 9, creatinine 0.8, glucose 162, troponin 0.17, INR 1.27, white blood cell count 1.3, hematocrit 31, platelet count of 179.Chest x-ray, no significant pericardial effusion.IMPRESSION:  The patient is a 69-year-old woman with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer with a recent hemorrhagic pericardial effusion, now admitted with cerebrovascular accident and transient inferior myocardial infarction, which appears to be canalized. I will discuss this in detail with the patient and her daughter, and clearly, her situation is quite guarded with likely poor prognosis, which they are understanding of.RECOMMENDATIONS:1. I think it is reasonable to continue heparin, but clearly she would be at risk for hemorrhagic pericardial effusion recurrence.\n",
        "2. Morphine is appropriate, especially for preload reduction and other comfort measures as appropriate.3. Would avoid other blood thinners including Plavix, Integrilin, and certainly, she is not a candidate for a thrombolytic with which the patient and her daughter are in agreement with after a long discussion.Other management as per the medical service. I have discussed the case with Dr. X of the hospitalist service who will be admitting the patient.\n",

Jane did receive a course of Bactrim for 14 days for UTI. Evidently, at some point in time, the patient was noted to develop a pressure-type wound on the sole of her left foot and left great toe. She was also noted to have a large sacral wound; this is in a similar location with previous laminectomy, and this continues to receive daily care. The patient was transferred secondary to inability to participate in full physical and occupational therapy and continue medical management of her diabetes, the sacral decubitus, left foot pressure wound, and associated complications of diabetes. She is given Fragmin 5000 units subcutaneously daily, OxyContin 30 mg p.o. q.12 h., folic acid 1 mg daily, levothyroxine 0.1 mg p.o. , Prevacid 30 mg daily, Avandia 4 mg daily, Norvasc 10 mg daily, Lexapro 20 mg daily, aspirin 81 mg daily, Senna 2 tablets p.o. q.a.m., Neurontin 400 mg p.o. t.i.d., magnesium citrate 1 bottle p.o , Wellbutrin 100 mg p.o. daily, and Bactrim DS b.i.d.'''\n"
