In the preceding three\\nmonths, she had experienced two episodes of vaginal bleeding. She was\\notherwise in good health and denied fatigue, lightheadedness, nausea,\\nvomiting or weight loss. Her past medical history included IDC of the left\\nbreast, diagnosed >20 years previously. In addition, her medical history\\nwas notable for hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, and chronic gout.\\nShe had been treated with a left-sided radical mastectomy and lymph\\nnode dissection. She received adjuvant chemotherapy with adriamycin\\nand cyclophosphamide followed by radiation therapy. She was then on\\nmaintenance therapy with tamoxifen for seven years. She also had an\\nautologous bone marrow transplantation and was under surveillance.\\nHer last Papanicolaou smear, performed at age sixty-four, was negative\\nfor intraepithelial cervical lesions and concurrent HPV. She had no\\nhistory of abnormal pap smears or cervical dysplasia. She had been\\nmonogamous (one male partner throughout adult life) and had no reported history of a sexually transmitted infection. She also denied use of\\ntobacco, alcohol, and recreational drugs.\\nThe patient presented to the emergency room with complaints of\\npost-menopausal bleeding consisting of vaginal spotting, passage of\\nblood clots, and new-onset crampy abdominal pain. Her last menstrual\\nperiod was 25 years prior to presentation. The vaginal spotting had\\nbegun three months prior to presentation and had been intermittent and\\nlight. She was now experiencing passage of large blood clots and new-onset abdominal cramping.\\nTransvaginal ultrasound showed a 9.7 \\u00d7 6.4 \\u00d7 6.6 cm uterus with a\\n0.3 cm endometrial stripe. At a prompt gynecology follow-up appointment, two ectocervical biopsies were obtained, which revealed\\nthat the lesions were poorly differentiated carcinoma, which showed\\nimmunoreactivity for CK7, GATA-3, ER (>70% cells) (Fig. 1), PR (40%\\nof cells), and mammaglobin. The specimen did not have reactivity for\\nP63, PAX8, CDX2. P16 staining was focal/rare, beta-catenin showed\\nmembranous staining, and E-cadherin expression was retained (Fig. 1).\\nTogether, this phenotype supported carcinoma of breast origin. Her\\nsubsequent scan revealed increased metabolic uptake within the inferior\\naspect of the uterus (Fig. 2A), consistent with carcinoma of the cervix.\\nHer initial PET scan was also notable for multiple sclerotic bone lesions.\\nBrain CT showed sclerotic osseous metastases in the calvarium, skull\\nbase, but no metastases in the brain.\\nShe underwent palliative radiation to the uterus/cervix with 3000\\ncGy in 10 fractions and chemotherapy with abemaciclib and fulvestrant.\\nFollowing her therapy, a positron emission tomography (PET) scan\\nrevealed an increased number of sclerotic metastases involving the axial\\nand appendicular skeleton, but FDG uptake in the cervix previously seen\\nwas not appreciated (Fig. 2B). The patient developed osteomyelitis of\\nthe left shoulder and required debridement. Bone biopsy taken at the\\ntime of debridement was negative for metastasis in the infected shoulder. Abemaciclib was discontinued due to the diagnosis of osteomyelitis,\\nand she was started on denosumab.\\nAt the time of writing, the patient was free of metastasis to the\\nuterine cervix and continued to be treated by her medical oncologist for\\nbone metastasis. \",\n          \"Fibroadenoma, the most prevalent benign fibroepithelial tumor, is an\\nencapsulated growth resulting from the hyperplasia of a single breast\\nlobule. It predominantly occurs in women between the ages of 14 and 35\\nwith variable sizes, although it occurs in older women occasionally. It\\npresents as a painless swelling with a rubbery consistency that is smooth,\\nfirm, mobile, and non-tender. Like all the solid lumps of the breast, triple\\nassessment should be completed in all patients. A fibroadenoma may\\nshrink over time and does not require excision unless associated with\\nsuspicious cytology or when it becomes very large [1].\\nPhyllodes tumors represent a rare variety of fibroepithelial neoplasms in the breast, accounting for only 0.3 % to 1 % of all breast tumors. These tumors typically present in women between the ages of 40\\nand 50. The growth pattern is usually unilateral and rapid. The physical\\nmanifestation of the tumor is a firm, bosselated lump, often accompanied by necrosis and redness of the skin overlaying the tumor. A bloody\\ndischarge from the nipple can occur, which is a result of spontaneous\\ninfarction within the tumor. Treatment often involves a wide local\\nexcision, ensuring a healthy margin greater than 1 cm, which is\\nfrequently curative. This approach aids in preventing local recurrence and achieving optimal patient outcomes [4].\\nOur patient, diagnosed with multiple bilateral fibroadenomas at 18\\nyears of age, was informed of their benign nature and advised to monitor\\nfor changes. After 17 years of stability, she noticed enlargement in two\\nright breast lumps with nipple retraction and discharge. Both lumps\\nwere firm, mobile and non-tender.\\nFibroadenoma on ultrasound is presented as a well-defined, round or\\novoid mass with uniform hypoechogenicity. In 10 % of cases, calcification may be observed [5].\\nSigns of potential malignancy include irregular form, pronounced\\nhypo-echogenicity, shadowing, an echogenic halo, and tissue distortion\\n[6].\\nFibroadenomas on mammography appear as a distinct oval mass,\\neither hypo- or isodense to breast tissue, or as a macrolobulated or\\npartially obscured mass [5].\\nPhyllodes tumour sonographic features are non-specific and can\\nmimic that of a fibroadenoma. A mass that appears solid and inhomogenous is most frequently observed.\\nPhyllodes on mammography presents as large, rounded, or lobulated\\nwith smooth edges. A clear halo and occasional coarse calcification may be present [7].\\nIn our case there was no sign of potential malignancy on radiographic imaging. The radiographic findings were consistent with benign\\nfibroadenoma and phyllodes tumor.\\nFNAC and ultrasound guided trucut biopsy of the breast lumps\\nshould be done for accurate diagnosis.\\nPatients with fibroadenoma had a 2.17-fold higher risk of invasive\\nbreast cancer, which increased to 3.10-fold in those with complex\\nfibroadenomas [6]. Hubbard, et al., identified criteria for fibroadenoma\\nexcision: age over 35, an immobile or ill-defined mass, size exceeding\\n2.5 cm, or an inconclusive biopsy. These factors indicated a higher risk\\nfor non-fibroadenoma lesions within fibroadenomas [8].\\nIn our particular case, a Tru-cut biopsy was conducted which identified the presence of a fibroadenoma. Given the patient's age of 35 years\\nand the observed increase in the size of the fibroadenoma, these factors\\ncollectively contributed to the decision to proceed with its excision. Core needle biopsy can potentially miss a Ductal Carcinoma in Situ\\n(DCIS) within a fibroadenoma. This could occur if the needle samples\\nnearby normal tissue instead of the tumor. In fact, malignant changes\\nwithin a fibroadenoma are typically discovered incidentally following\\nits excision.\\nFor benign fibroadenoma, surgical treatment involves mass excision.\\nA tumourectomy or lumpectomy can suffice if the surgical margin is\\ncancer-free or only contains ductal or lobular carcinoma in situ within\\nthe fibroadenoma. If the resection margin is involved or close, a wider\\nexcision may be required. Management strategies depend on the stage\\nand extent of metastasis (local or distant) [9].\\nIn our case, the patient underwent lumpectomy procedure; and the\\nhistopathology report concluded it be an invasive cancer with DCIS\\narising within a fibroadenoma. The margins were free of cancer. The\\ntumor was staged as pT1a and in multidisciplinary team meeting it was\\ndecided that sentinel lymph node biopsy will be advised to investigate\\nthe possibility of distant metastatic disease.\\nThe patient has undergone adjuvant radiotherapy and is currently\\nreceiving intravenous trastuzumab. The advantage of using adjuvant\\nradiotherapy and intravenous trastuzumab for HER2neu positive cases\\nlies in their potential to reduce tumor recurrence.\",\n          \"A 59-year-old female patient presented to our hospital with a 3-\\nmonth history of bilateral breast lumps. The patient reported that the\\nlumps were painless and had a history of hypertension treated with\\nmedication. There was no known family history of breast cancer. Clinical examination revealed a painless, mobile, solid, well-defined, skin-invasive mass measuring approximately 5 cm in diameter in the left\\nbreast, associated with a left axillary lymph node measuring 1 \\u00d7 2 cm,\\nlimiting mobility. The right breast exhibited a well-defined mass\\nmeasuring 2 \\u00d7 3 cm that was not attached to the skin or chest wall and\\nshowed no skin changes. No right axillary lymphadenopathy was\\ndetected.\\nBreast ultrasonography and chest CT revealed a mass in the left\\nbreast measuring approximately 4.5 \\u00d7 5.3 cm, with irregular shape,\\nnon-circumscribed margin, categorized as BI-RADS 4A; it is remarkable\\nthat there was a macrocalcification present inside the mass, associated\\nwith left axillary lymph node measuring 1.1 \\u00d7 1.9 cm. Other tumor\\nmeasuring 2.5 \\u00d7 2.7 cm was also identified in the right breast categorized as BI-RADS 4A and no right axillary lymphadenopathy was seen. No metastatic lesions were found on chest and abdominal computed\\ntomography scans.\\nThe patient underwent core needle biopsy of the bilateral breast lesions. Pathological examination of the right breast lesion revealed high-grade intraductal carcinoma, while examination of the left breast\\nrevealed a rhomboid malignant lesion with large nuclei and multiple\\nnucleoli, lacking differentiated tubular or squamous epithelium (Fig. 1).\\nImmunohistochemical (IHC) analysis demonstrated negative expression\\nof ER, PR, CD34, and HER2 in the cancer cells, with strong positive\\nreactivity for vimentin and CKA (E1/AE3), combined osseous differentiation image on HE specimen confirming the diagnosis of metaplastic\\ncarcinoma with extensive osseous differentiation. The final diagnosis\\nwas synchronous left breast cancer (cT4bN2M0) and right breast cancer\\n(cTisN0M0) according to the AJCC 2017 TNM staging system.\\nThe patient was initially treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy\\nusing a combination of docetaxel and cyclophosphamide. After the first\\ntwo cycles, the disease showed a partial response, with tumor shrinkage\\nand drying of skin ulceration. However, during the third and fourth\\ncycles, the left breast tumor began to progress and increase in size. The\\ntreatment regimen was subsequently changed, but the patient was isolated for one month due to the COVID-19 pandemic. During this time,\\nthe tumor grew rapidly. Upon returning to the hospital, the left breast\\ntumor had grown significantly, with skin invasion and bleeding fluid\\n(Fig. 2). The patient was referred for surgery due to the large size of the\\ntumor, which made it difficult for her to walk and increased the risk of\\ntumor rupture. A chest CT scan also revealed a huge mass with size\\nexceeding field of view, heterogeneous enhancement, necrosis inside\\nand invading skin, chest wall (Fig. 3A). A solid mass in the lower lobe of\\nright lung suggested metastases (Fig. 3B). The patient underwent toilet\\nmastectomy on the left breast and was subsequently treated with carboplatin chemotherapy x 3 cycles. The disease progressed and the patient was switched to a gemcitabine x 3-cycle chemotherapy regimen.\\nHowever, the disease progressed rapidly, so we decided to transfer the\\npatient to palliative care, and the patient died two months later. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"title\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"cancer_types_first_batch\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":12}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["rows = df_pd[[\"text\"]].to_dict('records')\n","\n","df = spark.createDataFrame(rows)\n","\n","df.show(truncate=100)"],"metadata":{"id":"uwdevR4SOPnX","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1720813486231,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":637,"user":{"displayName":"Gursev Pirge","userId":"01579888832874245157"}},"outputId":"882bae8e-ae62-4956-bbf8-6fa21b7e2fe3"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n","|                                                                                                text|\n","+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n","|A 72-year-old woman with a history of IDC of the left breast presented to the emergency room with...|\n","|From the current literature, it is apparent that IDC with metastasis to\\nthe cervix has not been ...|\n","|A 35-year-old female patient, gravida 4 para 3, with a 17-year history\\nof bilateral multiple bre...|\n","|Fibroadenoma, a common benign fibroepithelial breast tumor,\\ntypically affects women aged 14–35. ...|\n","|Right breast\\nLump at 2 o'clock: The lump was diagnosed as invasive carcinoma of\\nno special type...|\n","|Fibroadenoma, the most prevalent benign fibroepithelial tumor, is an\\nencapsulated growth resulti...|\n","|Patient information\\nA 48-year-old female presented with bilateral breast masses for 5-month dura...|\n","|A 43-year-old woman suffered from a protruding mass with skin\\nulceration and bloody discharge ov...|\n","|Phyllodes tumor (PT) is a rare type of breast neoplasm, accounting\\nfor less than 1% [1] of all b...|\n","|A 40-year-old woman came to the emergency service with\\ncomplaints of recurrent low back pain.

\"batch_1\",\n","    \"text\": \"A 72-year-old woman with a history of IDC of the left breast presented to the emergency room with a one-day history of heavy post-menopausal bleeding and crampy pelvic pain. In the preceding three\\nmonths, she had experienced two episodes of vaginal bleeding. She was\\notherwise in good health and denied fatigue, lightheadedness, nausea,\\nvomiting or weight loss. Her past medical history included IDC of the left\\nbreast, diagnosed >20 years previously. In addition, her medical history\\nwas notable for hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, and chronic gout.\\nShe had been treated with a left-sided radical mastectomy and lymph\\nnode dissection. She received adjuvant chemotherapy with adriamycin\\nand cyclophosphamide followed by radiation therapy. She was then on\\nmaintenance therapy with tamoxifen for seven years. She also had an\\nautologous bone marrow transplantation and was under surveillance.\\nHer last Papanicolaou smear, performed at age sixty-four, was negative\\nfor intraepithelial cervical lesions and concurrent HPV. She had no\\nhistory of abnormal pap smears or cervical dysplasia. She had been\\nmonogamous (one male partner throughout adult life) and had no reported history of a sexually transmitted infection. She also denied use of\\ntobacco, alcohol, and recreational drugs.\\nThe patient presented to the emergency room with complaints of\\npost-menopausal bleeding consisting of vaginal spotting, passage of\\nblood clots, and new-onset crampy abdominal pain. Her last menstrual\\nperiod was 25 years prior to presentation. The vaginal spotting had\\nbegun three months prior to presentation and had been intermittent and\\nlight. She was now experiencing passage of large blood clots and new-onset abdominal cramping.\\nTransvaginal ultrasound showed a 9.7 \\u00d7 6.4 \\u00d7 6.6 cm uterus with a\\n0.3 cm endometrial stripe. At a prompt gynecology follow-up appointment, two ectocervical biopsies were obtained, which revealed\\nthat the lesions were poorly differentiated carcinoma, which showed\\nimmunoreactivity for CK7, GATA-3, ER (>70% cells) (Fig. 1), PR (40%\\nof cells), and mammaglobin. The specimen did not have reactivity for\\nP63, PAX8, CDX2. P16 staining was focal/rare, beta-catenin showed\\nmembranous staining, and E-cadherin expression was retained (Fig. 1).\\nTogether, this phenotype supported carcinoma of breast origin. Her\\nsubsequent scan revealed increased metabolic uptake within the inferior\\naspect of the uterus (Fig. 2A), consistent with carcinoma of the cervix.\\nHer initial PET scan was also notable for multiple sclerotic bone lesions.\\nBrain CT showed sclerotic osseous metastases in the calvarium, skull\\nbase, but no metastases in the brain.\\nShe underwent palliative radiation to the uterus/cervix with 3000\\ncGy in 10 fractions and chemotherapy with abemaciclib and fulvestrant.\\nFollowing her therapy, a positron emission tomography (PET) scan\\nrevealed an increased number of sclerotic metastases involving the axial\\nand appendicular skeleton, but FDG uptake in the cervix previously seen\\nwas not appreciated (Fig. 2B). The patient developed osteomyelitis of\\nthe left shoulder and required debridement. Bone biopsy taken at the\\ntime of debridement was negative for metastasis in the infected shoulder. Abemaciclib was discontinued due to the diagnosis of osteomyelitis,\\nand she was started on denosumab.\\nAt the time of writing, the patient was free of metastasis to the\\nuterine cervix and continued to be treated by her medical oncologist for\\nbone metastasis. \"\n","}\n","\n","Row 1:\n","{\n","    \"created_username\": \"pre_annotation_batch_1\",\n","    \"result\": [\n","

cervix has not been well studied due to its rarity. Cervical cancer\\narising from ILC is well known to have a distinct metastatic pattern,\\nfavoring bone, gastrointestinal tract, and the ovaries. For metastasis to\\nbe isolated to the cervix is extremely rare. The small size, dense fibro-\\nmuscular composition, and sole afferent lymphatic drainage of the cervix makes it a less likely target of a metastatic cancer [5]. Recurrence in\\nthe first 5\\u201310 years following initial treatment is the highest. In a cohort\\nof premenopausal women initially diagnosed with non-metastatic breast\\ncancer, the median time to recurrence was 45 months or approximately\\n5 years [6]. Approximately 35 cases of metastatic breast cancer to the\\ncervix are reported in the literature. Of those, ductal carcinoma was\\nreported by Proen\\u00e7a et al. [3], Mousavi et al. [2], and Green et al. [1].\\nMetastasis of breast cancer to the uterus has been reported in >200 cases\\n[7]. However, isolated metastases to the cervix from primary breast\\ncancer was reported in a case series to have occurred in only 2 out of 26\\ncases examined [1]. The other 24 cases had metastatic disease from\\nprimary breast cancer present elsewhere in the body in addition to\\ncervical involvement.\\nThis case report highlights the rarity of cervical metastasis from IDC\\nwith recurrence after >20 years. In addition, this case is even more\\nunusual because of the isolated cervical involvement. While abnormal\\nvaginal bleeding or cervical abnormalities may initiate gynecological\\nevaluation, some patients may be asymptomatic and/or have a normal-appearing cervix. Cochrane et al. [8] describe a patient who presented\\n10 years following treatment for IDC with purulent vaginal discharge.\\nHer pelvic exam was unremarkable and endometrial sampling was\\nnegative for malignancy. Objectively, she exhibited all signs of an\\nevolving infectious process, including leukocytosis, fevers, and\\ncontinued purulent vaginal discharge. After she had undergone a total\\nabdominal hysterectomy she was found to have metastatic breast cancer\\nto the cervix. This case is in stark contrast to the one presented here, with\\nan obvious mass on the patient\\u2019s cervix. The variable presentation of\\ncervical metastasis from primary breast cancer should prompt timely Case Reports in Women\\u2019s Health 42 (2024) e00607\\n3workup of women with a history of breast cancer and unusual presenting\\ngynecological symptoms. Additionally, any evidence of postmenopausal\\nbleeding needs to be addressed immediately and any abnormal lesions\\nshould be biopsied. Metastases from IDC of the breast to the cervix is rare. This case\\nemphasizes the importance of a prompt and thorough clinical evaluation\\nin patients with post-menopausal bleeding, including biopsies of any\\nabnormal lesions. This case is unusual given that disease recurrence\\noccurred was over 20 years from initial diagnosis and treatment of the\\nprimary breast cancer. Additionally, the clinical presentation of the late\\nrecurrence was vaginal bleeding, which led to the detection of other,\\nmore common metastatic sites, such as the bones, for which she was\\nasymptomatic. Cervical metastasis from primary breast cancer is rare, with the\\nmajority of its documentation in the literature in the form of case reports. Common sites of breast cancer metastasis include the lungs, bone,\\nliver, and brain. It is estimated that the frequency of cervical metastasis\\nfrom a primary breast cancer is between 0.8% and 1.7% [1]. Symptoms\\nof cervical metastasis can vary from being asymptomatic to more\\ncommonly presenting as abnormal vaginal bleeding, dyspareunia, and\\npain [1]. While most cases arise from a primary invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) pathology, there are a few cases reported in the literature of\\nan invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) pathology [1\\u20133]. Treatment focuses\\non palliative measures and a combination of hormone therapy, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and surgery, as there is currently no standardized\\ntreatment\"\n","}\n","\n","Row

bilateral multiple breast lumps, presented in the Outpatient Department (OPD) with complaints of right breast pain and yellowish nipple\\ndischarge persisting for four days.\\nThe patient had been living with bilateral multiple breast lumps for\\n17 years. These lumps had remained stable throughout this period,\\npresenting as circumscribed and benign-looking. They had previously\\nbeen diagnosed as fibroadenomas. However, over the past month, she\\nnoticed an increase in the size of two lumps in her right breast.\\nAccompanying this change was the onset of pain in her right breast,\\ndescribed as gradual, pricking, and non-cyclical, with no identified\\naggravating or relieving factors.\\nThe nipple discharge was unilateral, spontaneous, slightly thick, and\\nyellowish in color.\\nThe patient is a mother to three living children. Her eldest child, born\\nwhen she was 25 years old, was breastfed for three months. She has\\nundergone one cesarean section.\\nIn terms of family history, there are no reported cases of breast\\ncancer. However, her sister had been diagnosed with stomach cancer.\\nDuring the physical examination, a large, firm, and irregular bosselated mass measuring approximately 7 \\u00d7 8 cm was identified in the\\nretroareolar region of the right breast. The mass was mobile, non-tender,\\nand adherent to the nipple-areola complex. Additionally, another lump\\nof about 2 \\u00d7 2 cm was palpable at the 2 o'clock position in the right\\nbreast. This lump was also firm, mobile, and non-tender. The nipple was\\nretracted with an active yellowish discharge.\\nOn the left side, a large lump of about 3 \\u00d7 4 cm was palpable at the 6\\no'clock position in the left breast. It was mobile, firm, and non-tender.\\nThere was no nipple retraction or discharge from the left breast. Axillary and cervical lymph nodes were not palpable. The patient underwent a radiological investigation, which included\\nmammography and ultrasound.\\nOn the right side, there was a large (33 \\u00d7 61.8 \\u00d7 66.3 mm), well-circumscribed, multi-lobulated solid lesion exhibiting peripheral flow\\non color Doppler, along with a few calcific foci in the retroareolar re-\\ngion. Additionally, another distinct, lobulated, hypoechoic solid mass\\nlesion of about 20.4 \\u00d7 26 \\u00d7 22 mm with calcific foci, causing posterior\\nshadowing and showing no flow on color Doppler, was observed at the\\n2\\u20133 o'clock position. Multiple similar-looking subcentimetric lumps\\nwere also noted in the right breast. A few sub-centimetric lymph nodes\\nwere visible. All lumps were categorized as BIRADS-III. [Figs. 1, 2, 4, 5]\\na well-circumscribed, heterogeneous lesion, exhibiting a wider-than-taller orientation with dimensions of 28.6 \\u00d7 50.9 \\u00d7 47.9 mm. This\\nlesion, located at the 6 o'clock position, was characterized by internal\\ncystic areas. In addition, several sub-centimetric axillary lymph nodes\\nwere detected. It was categorized as BIRADS-II. [Figs. 3, 6, 7].\\nAn ultrasound-guided trucut biopsy was performed on two lesions in\\nthe right breast and one in the left breast. The biopsy results revealed a\\nfibroepithelial lesion in the right retroareolar lump, with a differential\\ndiagnosis of benign phyllodes versus fibroadenoma. The lump at the 2\\no'clock position on the right side and the lump at the 6 o'clock position\\non the left side were both diagnosed as fibroadenomas.\\nGiven these findings, the patient was scheduled for a bilateral breast\\nlumpectomy. During the operation, the lump in the right retroareolar\\nregion was found to be densely adherent to the overlying skin and areola. Consequently, the nipple and areola were excised en bloc with the\\nlump. The lump at the 2 o'clock position was also excised, ensuring a rim\\nof normal and healthy tissue was included. On the left side, the lump at\\nthe 6 o'clock position was excised with the capsule intact, again ensuring\\na rim of surrounding normal tissue was included. \"\n","}\n","\n","Row 3:\n","{\n","    \"created_username\": \"pre_annotation_batch_1\",\n","    \"result\": [\n","        {\n","            \"from_name\": \"label\",\n","            \"id\": \"nHZmhAiMfp\",\n","            \"source\": \"$text\",\n","            \"to_name\": \"text\",\n","            \"type\": \"labels\",\n","            \"value\": {\n","                \"end\": 52,\n","                \"labels\": [\n","                    \"Body_Site\"\n","                ],\n","                \"start\": 46,\n","                \"text\": \"breast\"\n","            }\n","        },\n","        {\n","            \"from_name\": \"label\",\n","            \"id\": \"b85VHZBapN\",\n","            \"source\": \"$text\",\n","            \"to_name\": \"text\",\n","            \"type\": \"labels\",\n","            \"value\": {\n","                \"end\": 167,\n","                \"labels\": [\n","                    \"Body_Site\"\n","                ],\n","                \"start\": 154,\n","                \"text\": \"breast lobule\"\n","            }\n","        },\n","        {\n","            \"from_name\": \"label\",\n","            \"id\": \"2n71KEDTwI\",\n","            \"source\": \"$text\",\n","            \"to_name\": \"text\",\n","            \"type\": \"labels\",\n","            \"value\": {\n","                \"end\": 1099,\n","                \"labels\": [\n","                    \"Body_Site\"\n","                ],\n","                \"start\": 1093,\n","                \"text\": \"breast\"\n","            }\n","        },\n","        {\n","            \"from_name\": \"label\",\n","            \"id\": \"DlpEkTkyXM\",\n","            \"source\": \"$text\",\n","            \"to_name\": \"text\",\n","            \"type\": \"labels\",\n","            \"value\": {\n","                \"end\": 1280,\n","                \"labels\": [\n","                    \"Body_Site\"\n","                ],\n","                \"start\": 1274,\n","                \"text\": \"nipple\"\n","            }\n","        },\n","        {\n","            \"from_name\": \"label\",\n","            \"id\": \"u2pIMXZdCk\",\n","            \"source\": \"$text\",\n","            \"to_name\": \"text\",\n","            \"type\": \"labels\",\n","            \"value\": {\n","                \"end\": 1392,\n","                \"labels\": [\n","                    \"Body_Site\"\n","                ],\n","                \"start\": 1386,\n","                \"text\": \"breast\"\n","            }\n","        },\n","        {\n","            \"from_name\": \"label\",\n","            \"id\": \"NddDcv85ms\",\n","            \"source\": \"$text\",\n","            \"to_name\": \"text\",\n","            \"type\": \"labels\",\n","            \"value\": {\n","                \"end\": 1562,\n","                \"labels\": [\n","                    \"Body_Site\"\n","                ],\n","                \"start\": 1556,\n","                \"text\": \"breast\"\n","            }\n","        }\n","    ]\n","}\n","{\n","    \"title\": \"batch_1\",\n","    \"text\": \"Fibroadenoma, a common benign fibroepithelial breast tumor,\\ntypically affects women aged 14\\u201335. It's a painless, mobile, firm lump\\ndue to overgrowth in a breast lobule. While it often resolves on its own,\\nmay require removal. Uncommonly, conditions such as ductal carcinoma in situ, atypical ductal hyperplasia, lobular carcinoma in situ,\\natypical lobular hyperplasia, and invasive carcinomas can be found\\nwithin a fibroadenoma [1].\\nDCIS originating in a fibroadenoma is a seldom encountered case\\ndiagnosed incidentally on histopathological examination of the excised\\nfibroadenoma. Its incidence is 0.002\\u20130.125 % [2]. There have been\\nroughly 100 reported cases globally of carcinoma developing within a\\nfibroadenoma. This includes various types such as intra-ductal carcinoma, lobular carcinoma in situ, and invasive carcinoma [3].\\nThe management of the invasive cancer arising incidentally in a\\nfibroadenoma is done according to the guidelines of invasive breast\\ncancer which depends on type and stage of cancer.\\nPhyllodes tumors are rare breast neoplasms, accounting for 0.3 % to\\n1 % of all breast tumors. They typically occur in women aged 40\\u201350 and grow rapidly in a unilateral pattern. The physical manifestation of the\\ntumor is a firm, bosselated swelling, often with nipple discharge [4].\\nWe present a case study of a patient who, over a span of 17 years, had\\nmultiple bilateral breast fibroadenomas, one of which evolved into\\nductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and invasive carcinoma occurring\\nsimultaneously with a benign phyllodes tumor in the same breast but\\ndifferent quadrant. This case emphasizes the crucial need for surveillance in patients who have a long history of fibroadenomasand to\\ninvestigate any rapid change in size of fibroadenoma. Ductal carcinoma in situ and invasive breast cancer within a breast\\nfibroadenoma is a rare, often misdiagnosed malignancy. Diagnosis\\naccuracy improves with histopathological specimens and immunohis-\\ntochemical results. Breast-conserving surgery with adjuvant radio-\\ntherapy is an effective treatment. Familiarity with clinicopathological\\nfeatures and treatment methods can enhance survival rates and cure\\nrates. \"\n","}\n","\n","Row 4:\n","{\n","    \"created_username\":

\"batch_1\",\n","    \"text\": \"Fibroadenoma, the most prevalent benign fibroepithelial tumor, is an\\nencapsulated growth resulting from the hyperplasia of a single breast\\nlobule. It predominantly occurs in women between the ages of 14 and 35\\nwith variable sizes, although it occurs in older women occasionally. It\\npresents as a painless swelling with a rubbery consistency that is smooth,\\nfirm, mobile, and non-tender. Like all the solid lumps of the breast, triple\\nassessment should be completed in all patients. A fibroadenoma may\\nshrink over time and does not require excision unless associated with\\nsuspicious cytology or when it becomes very large [1].\\nPhyllodes tumors represent a rare variety of fibroepithelial neoplasms in the breast, accounting for only 0.3 % to 1 % of all breast tumors. These tumors typically present in women between the ages of 40\\nand 50. The growth pattern is usually unilateral and rapid. The physical\\nmanifestation of the tumor is a firm, bosselated lump, often accompanied by necrosis and redness of the skin overlaying the tumor. A bloody\\ndischarge from the nipple can occur, which is a result of spontaneous\\ninfarction within the tumor. Treatment often involves a wide local\\nexcision, ensuring a healthy margin greater than 1 cm, which is\\nfrequently curative. This approach aids in preventing local recurrence and achieving optimal patient outcomes [4].\\nOur patient, diagnosed with multiple bilateral fibroadenomas at 18\\nyears of age, was informed of their benign nature and advised to monitor\\nfor changes. After 17 years of stability, she noticed enlargement in two\\nright breast lumps with nipple retraction and discharge. Both lumps\\nwere firm, mobile and non-tender.\\nFibroadenoma on ultrasound is presented as a well-defined, round or\\novoid mass with uniform hypoechogenicity. In 10 % of cases, calcification may be observed [5].\\nSigns of potential malignancy include irregular form, pronounced\\nhypo-echogenicity, shadowing, an echogenic halo, and tissue distortion\\n[6].\\nFibroadenomas on mammography appear as a distinct oval mass,\\neither hypo- or isodense to breast tissue, or as a macrolobulated or\\npartially obscured mass [5].\\nPhyllodes tumour sonographic features are non-specific and can\\nmimic that of a fibroadenoma. A mass that appears solid and inhomogenous is most frequently observed.\\nPhyllodes on mammography presents as large, rounded, or lobulated\\nwith smooth edges. A clear halo and occasional coarse calcification may be present [7].\\nIn our case there was no sign of potential malignancy on radiographic imaging. The radiographic findings were consistent with benign\\nfibroadenoma and phyllodes tumor.\\nFNAC and ultrasound guided trucut biopsy of the breast lumps\\nshould be done for accurate diagnosis.\\nPatients with fibroadenoma had a 2.17-fold higher risk of invasive\\nbreast cancer, which increased to 3.10-fold in those with complex\\nfibroadenomas [6]. Hubbard, et al., identified criteria for fibroadenoma\\nexcision: age over 35, an immobile or ill-defined mass, size exceeding\\n2.5 cm, or an inconclusive biopsy. These factors indicated a higher risk\\nfor non-fibroadenoma lesions within fibroadenomas [8].\\nIn our particular case, a Tru-cut biopsy was conducted which identified the presence of a fibroadenoma. Given the patient's age of 35 years\\nand the observed increase in the size of the fibroadenoma, these factors\\ncollectively contributed to the decision to proceed with its excision. Core needle biopsy can potentially miss a Ductal Carcinoma in Situ\\n(DCIS) within a fibroadenoma. This could occur if the needle samples\\nnearby normal tissue instead of the tumor. In fact, malignant changes\\nwithin a fibroadenoma are typically discovered incidentally following\\nits excision.\\nFor benign fibroadenoma, surgical treatment involves mass excision.\\nA tumourectomy or lumpectomy can suffice if the surgical margin is\\ncancer-free or only contains ductal or lobular carcinoma in situ within\\nthe fibroadenoma. If the resection margin is involved or close, a wider\\nexcision may be required. Management strategies depend on the stage\\nand extent of metastasis (local or distant) [9].\\nIn our case, the patient underwent lumpectomy procedure; and the\\nhistopathology report concluded it be an invasive cancer with DCIS\\narising within a fibroadenoma. The margins were free of cancer. The\\ntumor was staged as pT1a and in multidisciplinary team meeting it was\\ndecided that sentinel lymph node biopsy will be advised to investigate\\nthe possibility of distant metastatic disease.\\nThe patient has undergone adjuvant radiotherapy and is currently\\nreceiving intravenous trastuzumab. The advantage of using adjuvant\\nradiotherapy and intravenous trastuzumab for HER2neu positive cases\\nlies in their potential to reduce tumor recurrence.\"\n","}\n","\n","Row 6:\n","{\n","

\"batch_1\",\n","    \"text\": \"Patient information\\nA 48-year-old female presented with bilateral breast masses for 5-month duration. She was G7P5A2, lactated for a total of 10 years. She\\nhad regular menstrual cycles in the past. She didn\\u2019t have any chronic\\ndisease. She had undergone hysterectomy for heavy vaginal bleeding\\ndue to a uterine fibroid. Clinical findings\\nOn clinical examination, there was bilateral palpable breast masses,\\nhard, mobile and irregular. On the right side, there was skin tethering\\nand palpable axillary lymph nodes.\\nDiagnostic assessment\\nOn ultrasound examination; there was a heterogenous irregular ill-define mass like lesion seen in upper outer quadrant of right breast\\nand hypoechoic irregular hypo-echoic mass 12*13mm in the upper\\nouter quadrant of left breast. (Bilateral U4a), and on mammogram, there\\nwas asymmetrical density at the upper outer quadrant of right breast,\\nand irregular ill define dense mass 10*10mm at upper outer quadrant of\\nleft breast. (Bilateral M4a).\\nFine needle aspiration from right axillary lymph node was positive\\nfor adenocarcinoma.\\nTherapeutic intervention\\nShe received 4 sessions of NACT then proceeded with right side\\nmastectomy and axillary lymph node dissection and left side mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy.\\nHistopathological examination on right side showed multicentric\\ninvasive ductal carcinoma of no specific type, grade I, well differentiated, extensive intermediate-high grade DCIS, comedo, cribriform and\\nsolid pattern which 5 out of 23 lymph nodes were involved,and one left\\nside unifocal invasive ductal carcinoma, grade II, moderately differentiated, extensive intermediate-high grade DCIS, comedo, cribriform and\\nsolid pattern, 2 lymph nodes were isolated and were tumor-free.\\nFollow up\\nPost-operative period was uneventful. She was followed up for one\\nyear. She received 4 sessions of chemotherapy and 35 sessions of\\nradiotherapy. Breast carcinoma may arise from a benign tumor or the tumors may\\ncoexist independently [4] Bilateral breast carcinomas are very rare and\\ncomprise only 2\\u20135% of all breast malignancies with only triple-negative\\nbreast malignancies being rarer. About 2\\u201311% of breast cancer patients\\nwill develop cancer in the opposite breast in their lifetime with an\\nincidence rate varying from 4 to 8 per 1000 people per year. An infiltrative lobular carcinoma is more prone to multicentricity and\\nbilaterality as compared to infiltrative ductal carcinoma. Bilateral\\ntumors can be either metachronous or synchronous [5]. Family history\\nof breast cancer is a risk factor for the development of unilateral breast\\ncarcinoma; it wouldn\\u2019t be an unreasonable hypothesis to think that it\\ncould be a risk factor for bilateral breast carcinoma. Some authors have\\nsubmitted data supporting this hypothesis [6].\\nIn the current case, a 48-year-old female presented with bilateral\\nbreast masses of 5-month duration. On examination. she had bilateral\\npalpable breast masses, which were hard, mobile, and irregular. On the\\nright side, there was skin tethering and palpable axillary lymph nodes.\\nUltrasound examination showed a heterogeneous, irregular, ill-defined,\\nmass-like lesion in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast along\\nwith a hypoechoic, irregular mass 12*13mm in the upper outer quadrant\\nof the left breast. FNA showed bilateral invasive ductal carcinoma.\\nMicroscopically the findings revealed infiltrative ductal carcinoma,\\nNST, Grade II, with desmoplastic stroma with few DCIS of cribriform\\ntype.\\nSome studies that have compared lumpectomy alone to lumpectomy\\nfollowed by radiation therapy found a 50% reduction in the ipsilateral\\nbreast cancer with the addition of radiation therapy. According to the literature, the majority (87%) of the patients were\\ntreated with mastectomy and axillary nodal evaluation, and most of\\nthem (73%) received postoperative radiotherapy to the locoregional\\narea. Only 8.7% of the patients had been treated with adjuvant therapy,\\nwhich usually consisted of ovarian ablation (4.5%). There was no significant difference between the therapy given to patients with invasive\\nductal carcinoma and that given to patients with invasive lobular carcinoma [1]. Invasive or in situ lobular carcinoma, is considered to be a\\nrisk factor for bilateral disease [6]. Several studies have evaluated the\\nsurvival of patients with bilateral carcinoma. Some authors found no\\ndifference between the survival of patients with bilateral carcinoma and\\nunilateral carcinoma [6].\\nIn the current case, she received 4 sessions of NACT which was followed by right-side mastectomy with axillary lymph node dissection and\\nleft-side mastectomy with sentinel lymph node biopsy.\"\n","}\n","\n","Row 7:\n","{\n","    \"created_username\":

According to the patient, she had a maternal\\naunt who was diagnosed with breast tumor in her 50s. The patient noticed a left palpable breast mass without tenderness\\nfor approximately 3 years and was taking self-administered Chinese\\nherbal medicine for this problem. However, the progressive enlargement\\nof this protruding mass with bleeding tendency led the patient to seek\\ntreatment at our breast clinic. The patient also provided photos, self-taken, to demonstrate the rapidity of the tumor's progression\\n(Fig. 1a\\u2013d). Gross examination showed a >10 cm mass with skin ulceration (Fig. 1d).\\nBreast sonography confirmed highly suspected malignancy (ACR BI-RADS category 5) (Fig. 2). Chest computed tomography (CT) scan also\\nrevealed a protruding mass occupying the left breast (Fig. 3a) with level\\nI, II axillary lymph node metastases (Fig. 3b\\u2013c). Core needle biopsy\\nrevealed a fibroepithelial lesion favoring fibroadenoma in the pathologic figure. Mammography modality was not performed due to the\\npatient's refusal. However, considering the clinical presentations was\\nincompatible with the pathological findings, nipple-sparing mastectomy\\nwas conducted in February 2016 by Dr. Shen-Liang Shih.

Immunohistochemical testing of\\nthe incidentally found tumor revealed E-cadherin negative and cytokeratin positive results (Fig. 5e, f). The results for hormone receptors\\nand the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) receptor\\nwere estrogen receptor (ER) 80% positive, progesterone receptor (PR)\\n90% positive, and HER2 negative.

The patient revisited our clinic,\\nwhere CNB was performed and showed ILC. Subsequently, the patient\\nreceived 4 cycles of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy followed by total\\nmastectomy and axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) without breast\\nreconstruction in December of 2017 (Fig. 1e), with 4 more cycles of\\nadjuvant chemotherapy afterwards.

Carcinoma in situ or invasive\\ncarcinoma arising within or attached to the PT is extremely uncommon,\\nwith an incidence rate of only 1%\\u20132% among all PTs [2]. Of all the\\nliteratures regarding coexistence of PT and other breast tumors, invasive\\nlobular carcinoma (ILC) is far less frequently reported than lobular\\ncarcinoma in situ (LCIS), ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), or invasive\\nductal carcinoma (IDC) [3], with fewer than six cases reported in the last\\n20 years [4]. We present a case initially diagnosed as fibroadenoma\\nthrough core needle biopsy (CNB), whom later underwent total\\nmastectomy, and in which PT was identified, with accidental finding of\\nan ILC within the tumor. PT is a rare type of fibroepithelial tumor that accounts for approximately 1% of all breast neoplasms [1]. It can be classified into benign,\\nborderline, and malignant subtypes. Benign PTs have sonographic and\\nmammographic features similar to fibroadenomas [6]; both possesses\\nsmooth, well-defined, and polylobulated characteristics. However, PTs\\ncan be distinguished from fibroadenomas by its rapid growth tendency\\nand relatively large size. To more clearly differentiate suspected PT from\\nfibroadenomas, a large-sized CNB is required. An excisional biopsy may\\nalso be considered when clinical figures does not correlate with pathological findings.\\nCoexistence of PT and other breast carcinomas is extremely rare.\\nAlthough most studies have reported the incidence rate of this type of\\ncoexistence to be approximately 1% [1], one case series by Widya et al.\\nreported the prevalence of malignant epithelial transformation in PTs to\\nbe 6% [7]. The numbers ranging from 1%\\u20136% implies a dispute over the\\nincidence of synchronous PT and other breast carcinomas. This is\\npossibly due to the scarcity of cases encountered and the occult nature of\\nthis condition. Furthermore, only five cases of synchronous PT and ILC\\nhave been reported in the last 20 years (Table 1) [1,4,8\\u201310]. We hereby\\nreport another case of coexistence of PT and ILC, and is the first reported\\nin Taiwan.\\nRegarding PT management, according to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines for phyllodes tumor [6], excisional biopsy should be performed if clinical suspicion of PT, and wide\\nexcision with tumor-free margin of at least 1 cm is suggested for\\nborderline or malignant PTs. Since PTs are typically hematogenous\\nspread rather than lymphatic, routine axillary dissection is not warranted. Although there are no prospective randomized data supporting\\nthe use of radiotherapy for PT, it may still be considered in some cases,\\nwhereas chemotherapy and hormone therapy are not indicated in all PT\\nsubtypes. In contrast, according to the NCCN guidelines for invasive\\nbreast cancer, when invasive carcinomas are discovered, patients should\\nreceive adjuvant radiotherapy and are subjected to further chemotherapy if necessary [6]. Hormone therapy and target therapy may also\\nbe warranted based on the patient's immunohistochemistry results. This contradiction in managing PTs and invasive carcinomas highlights the\\npossibility that patients could be treated as a case of simple PT without\\nother malignancies, bearing the risk of occult carcinomatous changes\\nbeing neglected. Therefore, when carcinomatous changes arise from\\nwithin or along with the PT, the proposed therapeutical course may be\\naltered, and treatment plans must be tailored to the individual due to the\\nlack of universal consensus on managing the coexistence of invasive\\ncarcinoma and PT.\\nThe presence of carcinomatous components within PTs is difficult for\\nclinicians to detect because of its occult properties and the low chance of\\nencounter. Since it is difficult to locate preoperatively, pathologists must\\nexamine excised tumor specimens thoroughly to reveal possible\\nenclosed cancerous lesions. The current consensus does not recommend\\nroutine axillary dissection for simple PTs. However, our case report\\nhighlights the menace of hidden invasive carcinoma inside PTs. Hence,\\nwe suggest surgeons to perform sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB)\\nwhen clinical presentations contradict pathological findings in PT cases.\\nThe evidence of lymph node involvement can serve as an indicator for\\npathologists to ensure a more accurate diagnosis of invasive or in situ\\ncarcinoma arising in PTs. \"\n","}\n","\n","Row 9:\n","{\n","    \"created_username\":

\"batch_1\",\n","    \"text\": \"A 40-year-old woman came to the emergency service with\\ncomplaints of recurrent low back pain. A computed tomography scan was performed, showing diffuse lytic bone lesions\\nin the axial skeleton suspicious of metastases. After a physical examination, a hard lump was palpated in the upper right\\nbreast, associated with skin retraction. On the mammography, a focal asymmetry was observed in the upper right breast,\\nwith an extension of approximately 9.5 cm. On the breast ultrasound, this alteration corresponded to a suspicious hypoe-\\nchogenic and ill-defined lesion, with posterior acoustic shadowing (Fig. 1). Ipsilateral axillary adenopathy was also present.\\nUltrasound-guided biopsy was performed and grade 2 invasive lobular carcinoma was diagnosed. Estrogen receptors (ER)\\nwere positive (100%), progesterone receptors (PR) were positive\\n(10%) and Her-2 receptors were negative, with no E-cadherin\\nexpression (Fig. 2). The final diagnosis was stage IV luminal\\nB right breast carcinoma. After a discussion in a multidisciplinary meeting, the patient started neoadjuvant chemotherapy with desunomab R\\u00a9 and placlitaxel R\\u00a9.\\nAfter finishing 9 cycles of chemotherapy, magnetic resonance imaging was performed, showing a residual small lesion in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast. Conserva-\\ntive surgery followed by radiation therapy to the right breast\\nand the ipsilateral axillary was performed. Due to the presence of bone metastases, the patient was also treated with\\nfulvestrant R\\u00a9 and palbociclib R\\u00a9, achieving clinical and imaging\\nstability.\\nAfter 2 years of follow-up, the patient showed with complaints of recurrent nausea, epigastric discomfort, early satiety, and weight loss. An abdominal computed tomography\\ndepicted diffuse thickening of the gastric wall with a small\\nlumen, in a leather bottle-like appearance. No other significant abdominal findings were visualized, such as abdominal\\nadenopathy, liver metastases, peritoneal implants, or ascites.\\nUpper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed marked rigidity for\\nthe gastric wall with a narrow lumen and a heterogeneous\\nmucosa with thickened folds, which was suspicious of diffuse malignant infiltration of the submucosa (linitis plastica,\\nFig. 3). Gastric biopsies were compatible with adenocarcinoma\\nwith signet ring cells, which was interpreted as probable primary gastric neoplasia. Consequently, the patient underwent\\na total gastrectomy. The pathological evaluation of the surgical specimen revealed involvement of the entire stomach by a\\nmalignant neoplasm, invading the entire wall thickness, and\\nformed by poorly cohesive cells with focal signet ring features.\\nThe subsequent immunohistochemical study revealed diffuse\\nexpression of GATA-3 and estrogen receptors (about 10% of\\nthe cells), in the absence of CK20, and E-cadherin expression\\n(Fig. 4). Thus, immunohistochemical analysis was compatible\\nwith gastric metastases of previously diagnosed lobular breast\\ncarcinoma. \"\n","}\n","\n","Row 10:\n","{\n","    \"created_username\":

metastatic pattern in comparison to other invasive\\nbreast carcinomas. This may be explained by the fact that\\naround 90% of ILCs have E-cadherin loss, a molecule responsible for cell-cell adhesion [1,4,7\\u20139]. Consequently, the ILC is\\nformed by noncohesive small cells, with preferential growth\\nat sites of metastases. Frequently, gastric metastases spread\\nto the submucosal layer in a diffuse infiltrative pattern without major involvement of the mucosa, which may accordingly\\nlead to normal endoscopic examinations in up to 50% of cases\\nand misleading false-negative biopsies. The histological features of metastatic ILC to the stom-\\nach consist of infiltration of the gastric tissue by noncohesive\\nsmall tumor cells with an occasional intracytoplasmic lumen\\narranged on linear cords between the normal gastric glands\\n[5,7,10]. Therefore, as in the breast, metastatic ILC tends to\\ninfiltrate the affected organs in a diffuse process instead of\\nforming a tumor nodule [11]. On imaging studies, the infiltra-\\ntion of the stomach wall can give an appearance of linitis plas-\\ntica (water-bottle stomach), created by circumferential thick-\\nening and stiffness of the gastric wall, with narrowed lumen\\n[11]. Peritoneal and retroperitoneal spread typically appears\\nas tiny nodules that tend to become confluent and may cause\\n\\u201comental caking.\\u201d In the genitourinary system, the most fre-\\nquent findings are bilateral cystic and solid ovarian masses\\n(Krukenberg syndrome) [11].\\nThe differentiation between primary gastric carcinoma\\nand metastases of breast carcinoma is challenging, especially\\nwhen gastric biopsies contain signet ring-shaped cells on\\npathologic examination [1,5]. Tumor cells with these features\\nare characteristic of a subtype of primary gastric malignancy:\\nSignet ring cell type gastric carcinoma [5]. However, tumor\\ncells of ILC also have this morphology, making diagnosis\\na difficult task [1,2,6]. Therefore, the only way to reach the\\ndiagnosis is through immunohistochemical study. The im-\\nmunohistochemical study is essential for the diagnosis of\\nmetastases in rare locations. For example, Singh T et al\\nreported an extremely rare case of duodenal metastasization\\nfrom endometrial carcinoma, which was confirmed through\\nimmunohistochemistry [12].\\nILCs usually are ER and PR positive, without overexpression\\nor amplification of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2/neu) and E-cadherin [1,7]. ER and PR can be used\\nas markers; however, they are not always suitable diagnostic markers to confirm tumor has originated. These receptors\\nmay be positive in patients with primary gastric carcinoma\\n(ER in 32% and PR in 12% of the cases) [3], and if the primary\\nlesion is negative for ER and PR, these markers are not useful\\nin the diagnosis of breast cancer metastases in the stomach\\n[8]. In addition, it is well known that ER and PR may change in\\nexpression at metastatic sites over the course of disease progression, usually resulting in loss or decrease in expression,\\nwith discrepancy between primary breast cancer and metastases in 15%-40% of the cases [9].\\nOther markers have emerged to distinguish between gastric metastases from breast cancer and primary gastric malignancy. While metastatic breast carcinoma is usually positive for cytokeratin 7 (CK7, 90%), gross cystic disease fluid\\nprotein 15 (GCDFP-15), and negative for cytokeratin 20 (CK20)\\n[1\\u20133,6,9], primary gastric carcinoma is negative for CK7 and\\nGCDFP-15 and positive for CK20 [6\\u20138]. Recently, GATA-3 has\\nemerged as a marker of urothelial and breast carcinoma. It\\nhas 100% positivity in lobular breast carcinoma and 96% positivity in ductal carcinoma of the breast [3]. In primary gastric carcinoma it is positive in only 5% (in well-differentiated\\nadenocarcinomas, with no reported cases in carcinomas\\nwith poorly cohesive cells, such as signet ring carcinomas)\\n[13].\\nOur patient had a strong diffuse nuclear expression of\\nGATA-3, which together with a previous medical history of\\nILC of the breast, CK20-, slight ER positivity, and absence of E-cadherin was consistent with the diagnosis of gastric metastases from invasive lobular carcinoma of the breast. In this\\ncase, there was a change of the expression of ER in the gastric metastases, as the expression was diffuse in the neoplastic cells in the breast and only discreet in the metastatic cells\\n(not exceeding 10%).\\nUnfortunately, the definitive diagnosis in this case was only\\nperformed after total gastrectomy, due to the fact that the immunohistochemical study was not performed on the previous\\ngastric biopsy and was interpreted as primary gastric carcinoma. Despite the similar clinical, endoscopic, and histological characteristics, the differentiation between primary and\\nmetastatic gastric carcinoma is pivotal, because the treatment\\nand prognosis are dissimilar [2,6,9]. The treatment recommendation for gastric metastases of breast cancer is predictably\\nsystemic treatment with chemotherapy and hormone therapy [1,2,7]. Surgical intervention should be reserved for palliation or certain cases of solitary resectable gastrointestinal\\ntract metastases [5\\u20136]. On the other hand, in the case of primary gastric cancer, surgical resection is the primary treatment in the absence of distant metastases [9]. Additionally,\\nsome authors state the importance of regular endoscopy in\\npatients with a history of invasive lobular breast cancer. The\\nhypothesis of gastric metastases should always be considered\\nin these patients and an immunohistochemical study carried\\nout for the definitive diagnosis [1].\\nIn conclusion, although gastric metastases from ILCs are\\nrare, this clinical hypothesis should always be considered in\\npatients with gastrointestinal symptoms (such as nausea, epigastric pain, early satiety, vomiting, and weight loss) and endoscopic changes (for example, gastric wall rigidity and heterogeneous mucosa with thickened folds). \"\n","}\n","\n","Row 11:\n","{\n","    \"created_username\":

PAS and alcian blue histochemistry highlighted the secretory component of this carcinoma.\\nRadiological imaging with tomosynthesis, digital mammography and ultrasound were performed. Digital mammography\\nshowed on external upper quadrant of the right breast architectural\\ndistortion associated with a group of fine pleomorphic microcalcifications of 17 mm in largest diameter. On the left breast several\\ngroups of amorphic low dense microcalcifications were observed.\\nDirected ultrasound on right breast showed a hipoechoeic area on the external upper quadrant corresponding to the architectural\\ndistortion on mammography. Right axillary ultrasound showed\\nmultiple hipoechoechic lymph nodes with focal cortex enlargement (Fig. 1).\\nThe patient\\u00b4\\u0131s case was presented and reviewed by the multidisciplinary Tumor Board in the Breast Unit at \\u201cHospital San\\nJose at Tecnologico de Monterrey\\u201d and in the presence of a clinical resectable disease categorized as T1N0M0 was scheduled for\\nsurgery. A lumpectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy was performed, with no complications. A total of 4 sentinel lymph nodes\\nwere resected.\\nOn gross examination the lumpectomy specimen had an irregular fibrotic area measuring 2.0 \\u00d7 1.5 cm that was located away from\\nthe margins grossly. The microscope exam of this area showed a\\ndense fibrotic stroma with multiple extracellular mucin lakes of\\nsmall diameter (Fig. 2A, B). Inside this lakes were floating numerous\\ntumor cells of small to medium size, with scant to moderate amount\\nof eosinophilic cytoplasm. Some of these cells exhibit intracellular\\nmucin also, giving the appearance of signet ring cell component. At\\nlast, other areas of the tumor consisted of classic lobular invasive\\ncarcinoma, with single cell infiltration (Fig. 2C, D). Final tumor size\\nwas of 9 mm. In situ carcinoma was also observed.\\nOn immunohistochemistry examination, the tumor was positive for estrogen receptors with a combined score of Allred of 7\\n(proportion 5, intensity 2), progesterone receptors was positive in\\nthe 90% of the cells and Her2-neu and e-cadherin were negatives\\n(Fig. 3). All margins were negative for in situ or invasive carcinoma.\\nThe tumor was graded with a modified Scarff Bloom Richardson\\nscore of 5 and the four lymph node were reported negative for\\nmetastases. With this information the tumor was assigned with a\\npathologic T1b, N0, MX. We discussed the possibility of chemotherapy due to immunohistochemically report (ER+, PR+), however, the\\nbenefit of chemotherapy is unknown and taking into account tumor\\nsize and histological grade, we decided adjuvant treatment with\\ntamoxifen 20 mg orally daily for 5 years and radiation therapy to\\nthe breast.

Histologically is composed by non-cohesive cells distributed in a single\\ncell pattern that immerse on fibrotic stroma and possess a low\\nmitotic index. Another characteristics of the cells is that they have\\ncytoplasmic mucin, and when it is prominent gives the appearance of a signet ring cell. Histologic patterns of lobular carcinoma\\nare classic, solid, alveolar, pleomorphic, tubulolobular, signet ring\\ncell and mixed types [4,5]. We present a case with classic lobular\\ncarcinoma features but with the rare characteristic of extracellular\\nmucin lakes. This feature is rare but has been document previously\\non the literature [2,6,7].\\nInvasive lobular carcinoma shows the characteristic loss of\\nexpression of e-cadherin, which is a helpful immunohistochemistry tool to differentiate lobular from ductal carcinomas. In our\\ncase the e-cadherin expression is complete absent, so the lobular\\nnature of the neoplasm is confirmed. On receptor expression, until\\n95% of the lobular carcinomas are estrogen or progesterone receptor positive, and typically do not express Her2 [8,9]. On the previous\\nreported cases of lobular carcinoma with extracellular mucin production, only the one described by Yu et al. had expression of Her2\\n[10].\\nThe differential diagnosis of this case includes mucinous carcinoma, mixed ductal and mucinous carcinoma, papillary mucinous\\nneoplasm and mucocele lesions, but all the above are ductal related\\nand express e-cadherin. The classic lobular carcinoma is characterize by discohesive\\ncells with small nuclei, linear arrangements of cells infiltrating the\\nstroma between collagen fascicles forming so-called \\u2018Indian files\\u2019\\nand low mitotic activity [1]. Lobular neoplasia and infiltrative lobular carcinoma may produce intracellular mucin, when the secretion\\nis prominent; the cells have a signet ring configuration. Extracellular mucin secretion is a feature of ductal carcinoma; however cases\\nhave been reported some cases of lobular carcinoma with extracellular mucin [2]. Although generally accepted histological criteria\\nserve to distinguish lobular from ductal carcinoma of the breast, this\\ndifferential diagnosis may present a challenge in some variants of\\nthe tumors showing equivocal histological features, the e-cadherin\\nimmunostaining is very helpful in these cases [3].

The mass showed unclear border with multiple lymph node swelling. Mammogram represented a poorly circumscribed mass in size of 5.0 cm \\u00d7 4.7 cm \\u00d7 3.0 cm. Ultrasound images (Figure 1) displayed an inhomogeneous hypoechoic nodule in size of 29.1 mm \\u00d7 21.3 mm. Ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration biopsy revealed invasive ductal carcinoma. Thus, the patient underwent left modified radical mastectomy. Moreover, the patient has long-term history of antihypertensive medication. No family members have been diagnosed with breast cancer. Genetic-testing was omitted in clinical diagnosis. Macroscopic pathological examination showed the tumor size as 3.0 cm \\u00d7 2.5 cm \\u00d7 2.0 cm. The mass was yellow-beige on cut section. HBC was diagnosed including invasive carcinoma (IC) of apocrine differentiation (diameter about 5 mm) which was surrounded by extensive carcinoma in situ (CIS, diameter about 25 mm) of apocrine type, and a 4-mm invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) in grade II. The distance between HBC and IDC was 4 mm. There was extensive (42 of 43 lymph nodes) metastasis and intravascular tumor emboli. The tumor extended into peripheral nerve.\\n\\nThe tumor constituted by IDC and HBC which included IC and CIS. We compared the immunohistochemical profiles of 10 breast cancer markers among IC, CIS, and IDC. The invasive part of HBC varied from linear arrangements to irregular small clusters and isolated single cells. The tumor cells had abundant amphophilic cytoplasm, ranging from granular to vacuolated and feathery. They were characterized by enlarged discohesive cells with eccentric large irregular nuclei and prominent nucleoli. They displayed very low mitotic activity. The neoplastic cells demonstrated strong and diffuse immunoreactivity for gross cystic disease \\ufb02uid protein (GCDFP-15) and AR which exhibited apocrine differentiation. However, both membrane and cytoplasm were negative for E-cadherin and P120 staining. P120 was only non-specific staining due to cytoplasm richness. The diagnostic challenges are that apocrine carcinoma, lobular carcinoma, and ductal carcinoma were all excluded after sufficient immunohistochemistry. Therefore, the pathological type was considered as neither lobular nor ductal. HER2/neu was moderately positive (2+). Fluorescent in situ hybridazation (FISH) analysis of HER2 gene status was negative. The cells demonstrated no reactivity with ER, PR (Figure 2), CK5/6, or EGFR. On the other hand, P53 was positive. The combined type near the HBC was IDC (4-mm) without apocrine feature. The neoplastic cells lacked GCDFP-15 and AR, but demonstrated strong and diffuse membrane expressions for E-cadherin and P120. The case was characterized by positive expression of ER, HER2, but lack of PR (Figure 3). Meanwhile, P53 was negative. The CIS part of HBC also showed apocrine feature. It was showed that two type cells disclosed abundant foamy and granular eosinophilic cytoplasm. The immunohistochemical markers of CIS were same as IC. Due to high lymph node metastasis rate, the postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was treated with capecitabine for 500 mg twice daily. The patients could not tolerate hormonal therapy. Currently, the patient was disease free for 10 months after surgery. Then the follow-up diagnosis was breast cancer metastasis to liver and lung. The patient\\u2019s family gave up further treatment, and the patient died 6 months later. Despite being accepted as a variant of breast cancer by many pathologists, the term histio\\u00accytoid breast carcinoma (HBC) is yet to be included in the world health organization (WHO) classification of breast cancer due to its controversial histogenesis (1-3). It has been considered to be a variant of lobular carcinoma, a variant of apocrine ductal carcinoma, and an apocrine variant of lobular carcinoma and to resemble lipid-rich carcinoma (4-7). The majority of reports support the origin of HBC as lobular carcinoma and lobular carcinoma in situ. Some authors have concluded that HBC does not belong to a specific phenotype as both lobular and ductal origins are possible (8). E-cadherin and P120 are relatively specific immunohistochemical markers which were used for cell differentiation of breast carcinoma. However, our case presented the negative staining results.\\n\\nIn this case, the HBC part, whether invasive carcinoma or in situ, was triple negative. Contrastively, ER expression in the IDC part was positive. Based on triple negative phenotype, the HBC part is not that of classical lobular carcinoma as we know. Based on negative E-cadherin and P120, the HBC part is not lobular carcinoma and ductal carcinoma. Even pleomorphic lobular carcinoma, Her2 should be over expressed, while ER and PR should be positive. Gulbeyaz Omeroglu reported a case of triple negative histiocytoid variant of lobular carcinoma without E-cadherin and P120 expressions (9). Li et al. reported two HBC masses in one breast with negative expressions of E-cadherin and P120 (10). The author considered that it displayed characteristics more similar to lobular carcinoma than to ductal carcinoma with triple negative.\\n\\nGupta et al. described three E-cadherin positively stained cases and could therefore belong to ductal subtype. However, their E-cadherin positive case illustration showed just a few cells with apparent incomplete membrane staining, which may be not positive. The conclusion of ductal cancer may be not reliable. In not completely agreement with Eusebi et al., HBC could reasonably be defined as unique variant of breast cancer with histiocytoid cell (1). HBC is a unique variant of carcinoma originating in the terminal unit, without lobular and ductal differentiation.\\n\\nOur case included a HBC and a ductal carcinoma occurring in one breast simultaneously. In the patient in our case report, the distance of two different types was 4 mm. Their immunohistochemical phenotypes were completely different.\\n\\nIHC studies classified breast carcinomas into four subtypes, including Luminal A, Luminal B, HER-2 over expression, and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) groups. Our case of HBC part was characterized by TNBC and lack expressions of CK5/6 and EGFR. This combination has been treated as a TNBC type. However, our case of mixed IDC part was characterized by ER expression and lack PR, HER2, CK5/6 and EGFR. Therefore, this combination was diagnosed as a Luminal A type. At last, the treatment after surgery was combined chemotherapy with endocrine.\\n\\nThe prognosis of patients with HBC was considered to be poor (11). More recent data, however, suggested that prognosis may depend on traditional prognostic factors (histological grade, tumor size, and lymph node status), as with more conventional breast carcinomas. More recent data, suggest that prognosis may depend on stage. In one reported case series, follow-up of 9 female patients demonstrated most patients alive with disease at 48 months, whereas this patient died at 42 months. The prognosis is not much different from that reported in the literature (12). On the other hand, this histiocytoid carcinomas are ER positive, which are favorable prognostic feature, but the patients could not tolerate hormonal therapy. Its consistent expression of GCDFP-15 revealed apocrine differentiation. The diagnosis of apocrine differentiation has not showed clinical significance up to now.\"\n","}\n","\n","Row 14:\n","{\n","    \"created_username\": \"pre_annotation_batch_1\",\n","    \"result\":

nipple. Ultrasound images revealed left breast edema with\\ndilated ducts; therefore, inflammatory lesion was considered. Breast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed posterior\\noedema of the left breast glandular layer with ductal dilatation (Fig. 1).\\nGLM was firstly suspected as the initial diagnosis. Therefore, the patient\\nreceived anti-inflammatory treatment supplemented with a wet\\ncompress of mirabilite for localized swelling. Then the oedema in the left\\nbreast was significantly reduced one day later. However, to confirm the\\ndiagnosis, a lesion biopsy was conducted, and the histological manifestations of GLM associated with solid subtype high-grade DCIS were\\nobserved. Eventually, the patient underwent a surgical dissection of the\\nlesion. The gross examination of the lesion revealed gray-yellow and\\ngray-brown cut surfaces. Histopathology showed a non-caseating Annals of Diagnostic Pathology 68 (2024) 152241\\n2necrotizing granulomatous inflammation involving multiple lobules,\\ncharacterized by epithelioid tissue cells, multinucleated giant cells,\\nneutrophils, and plasma cells. In the non-mass region, there was dilation\\nof terminal ducts with the presence of yellowish-white lipid-like material. In the affected lobules or surrounding areas, features of solid-type\\nhigh-grade DCIS were present. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated\\npositivity for p63 and CK5/6 around ductal myoepithelium (Fig. 2),\\nwhile ER ( ), PR ( ), and HER2 (1+). The final pathological diagnosis\\nwas confirmed as GLM associated with solid-type high-grade DCIS. The patient was a 50-year-old perimenopausal woman who had\\ndiscovered a tumor in her left breast for over six months. The epidermis\\non the surface of the lump was slightly red, warm and wavy, resembling\\norange peel. The left nipple was sunken, and comedogenic discharge can\\nbe squeezed out (Fig. 3). Two months of anti-inflammatory therapy and\\nfluid aspiration were administered to the patient, but the mass returned\\n1.5 months after treatment. Ultrasound revealed local glandular hypertrophy in lateral portion of the left breast, with multiple hypoechoic\\nnodules detected internally, which were considered BI-RADS grade 4a. Mammography revealed enlarged ducts and dense calcification\\nresembling gravel in the ducts. Enhanced MRI of the breast revealed an\\nabnormal mass shadowing and ductal dilatation in the left breast, which\\nraised the possibility of breast cancer. After the surgical resection of the\\nlesion, gross examination revealed a gray-brown cut surface, with some\\nareas resembling fish meat. Histopathology demonstrated the fusion of\\nmultiple lobules forming a non-caseating necrotizing granulomatous\\ninflammation. In the non-mass region, there was dilation of terminal\\nducts containing yellowish-white lipid-like material, and typical GLM\\nhistological changes were observed in the surrounding areas.

The lump's surface epidermis exhibited redness, swelling, heat\\nand pain. Nipple retraction and comedogenic discharge were also observed. Multiple fluid-filled dark areas were detected on ultrasound,\\nso the inflammatory lesion was suspected. To relieve the distending\\nsymptoms, the patient underwent puncture aspiration which revealed\\nthick yellow-white pus. The pus culture indicated a gram-positive bacterial infection sensitive to ceftriaxone therapy. The aspirated tissue\\nbiopsy revealed breast DCIS. The patient underwent inflammatory mass\\nresection. The gross examination of the lesion revealed a gray-yellow\\nand gray-brown cut surface. Histopathology showed a non-caseating\\ngranulomatous inflammation involving multiple lobules, characterized\\nby epithelioid tissue cells, multinucleated giant cells, neutrophils, and\\nplasma cells. In the non-mass region, there was dilation of terminal ducts\\ncontaining yellowish-white lipid-like material. Within multiple affected\\nlobules, features of cribriform-type low-grade DCIS were observed.\\nImmunohistochemistry demonstrated positive staining for P63 and\\nCK5/6 around ductal myoepithelium, and

\"batch_1\",\n","    \"text\": \"GLM is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by non-caseous\\nnecrotizing granulomas centred on the lobules of the breast. This disease\\nmanifests initially as a localized, often painful, rigid, and poorly-defined\\nmass. The clinical presentation is similar to that of breast cancer and is\\neasily misdiagnosed; in rare instances, the two diseases coexist. In the\\nprevious literature, 5 cases of combined breast cancer and GLM have\\nbeen reported (Table 1) [4-8]. We summarized a total of 8 cases,\\nincluding 5 from previous reports and 3 cases presented in this study.\\nAmong them, 5 cases involved premenopausal patients, while 3 cases\\ninvolved postmenopausal patients. The distribution of cases was\\nbalanced, with 4 occurring in the left breast and 4 in the right breast.\\nThere were 2 cases of solid-type high-grade DCIS. 2 cases of invasive\\nductal carcinoma, and 1 case with both high-grade DCIS and invasive\\nductal carcinoma. Notably, one case confirmed the coexistence of\\ncoryneform bacteria and DCIS in the same breast [4]. Another case\\nexperienced metastases to the brain and bones and succumbed 6 months\\nlater [8]. Additionally, there was one case of cribriform-type low-grade\\nDCIS.\\nGLM associated with DCIS is frequently difficult to diagnose based on\\nclinical features. As patients with DCIS do not have an obvious clinical\\npresentation in the early stages, and patients may have an absence of the\\nmass on ultrasound, or they may have ultrasound features that suggest a\\nsolid mass masked by the coexisting inflammatory oedema of the GLM.\\nIn this article, all three patients had the typical GLM presentation at the\\nbeginning of their illness. GLM most commonly affects women of\\nchildbearing age, especially those with a recent history of pregnancy childbirth, milk stasis or abnormal lactation [1], while three patients\\nwere elderly and had no apparent risk factors. For those with no obvious\\ncause or atypical clinical symptom, pathological examination is required\\nto rule out breast cancer [9].\\nWith an effective preoperative examination, clinicians are able to\\naccurately diagnose a patient's condition and select the most appropriate treatment more swiftly and precisely. However, it is extremely difficult\\nto accurately diagnose DCIS by imaging of GLM patients, although ultrasound and MRI have a high resolution for soft tissue lesions and\\nintraductal masses. On the basis of ultrasound characteristics, DCIS can\\nbe classified as mass or non-mass, and the non-mass type of DCIS is\\nblurred from the adjacent tissue [10]. A retrospective analysis of 705\\ncases of DCIS revealed that hypoechoic breast areas are the most common DCIS lesion finding (48.6 %) [11]. DCIS, which is confined to the\\nbreast ducts, lacks the characteristic \\u201chyperechoic halo\\u201d and \\u201cburr or\\ncrab foot\\u201d appearance of breast cancer, along with the absence of a\\ndistinct solid mass in non-mass DCIS. This makes ultrasound diagnosis of\\nDCIS extremely problematic. In this paper, all three patients presented\\nwith initial symptoms of diffuse glandular oedema, which added to the\\ndifficulty of diagnosing DCIS on ultrasound. In addition, mammography\\nis not recommended in the routine examination of GLM because it can\\nincrease the risk of ductal rupture and thus the dissemination of GLM to\\nthe periphery by compressing the breast tissue. In addition, the breast\\npain induced by the inflammatory response in patients with GLM renders this exam intolerable during acute episodes. In contrast, clinical\\npractitioners believe that mammography should play a larger role in the\\ndiagnosis of intraductal breast cancer [12]. Intraductal lesions are\\nmainly diagnosed by radiography, and mammography can clearly show\\nmasses around dilated ducts in the areola area as well as various types of\\ncalcified foci. Therefore, in view of the difficulty of diagnosing these\\nconditions, we believe that it is important to give high priority to intraductal core needle biopsy.\\nThe mechanism of co-occurrence of GLM and breast cancer is still\\nunclear. It is widely believed that inflammation plays multiple roles in\\nthe development of cancer. For example, inflammation can promote the\\noverexpression of cytokines, chemokines and growth factors that are\\ninvolved in the progression of different cancers, including breast cancer\\n[13]. In 1863, Rudolf Virchow made the first connection between\\ninflammation and cancer. He believed that \\u201clymphatic reticular infiltration\\u201d reflected the origin of cancer in chronic inflammatory sites [14].\\nIt has even been demonstrated that TNF and interleukins, two main\\ninflammatory mediators, can also promote tumor growth and spread\\n[15]. Aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have been\\nshown in some studies to reduce the incidence of breast cancer [16].\\nBased on previous studies, it has been suggested that chronic inflammation is a prerequisite for the development of cancer. The most important clinical differential diagnosis for middle-aged\\npatients with GLM is breast cancer. While the co-occurrence of GLM\\nand breast cancer is rare, the possibility should always be considered\\ngiven the clinical implications. \"\n","}\n","\n","Row 16:\n","{\n","    \"created_username\":

breast mass for one month. She enjoyed good past health and did\\nnot have a family history of breast cancer. On physical examination,\\nthere was a 6.5 cm mass occupying the lateral aspect of the right breast.\\nNo skin ulceration was seen. Mammography of the right breast showed a\\ndumbbell-shaped mass with a well-defined border and clumps of coarse\\npunctate microcalcifications (Fig. 1). Ultrasonography of the index mass\\nshowed internal hyperechoic striations with occasional intramural\\ncystic spaces. The overall features were categorized as BIRADS (Breast\\nImaging-Reporting and Data System) 4a. The left breast and bilateral\\naxillae showed no significant radiological abnormality. Core biopsy of\\nthe index lesion showed findings consistent with fibroadenoma with no\\ndefinite features of PT. The patient subsequently underwent local excision of the mass. Gross examination of the excised specimen revealed a\\n6.5 \\u00d7 4.5 \\u00d7 4 cm well-circumscribed mass with lobulated growth and\\nsolid white cut surfaces. Necrosis was not observed.\\nMicroscopic examination of the mass showed a well-circumscribed and encapsulated fibroepithelial tumor with a pushing and focally\\npermeative border (Fig. 2a). It showed biphasic epithelial and stromal\\nproliferation with an extensive leaf-like architecture. The stroma was\\nhypercellular with conspicuous subepithelial accentuation and stromal\\novergrowth (Fig. 2b, c). No heterologous element was noted. The stromal cells possessed moderate pleomorphism with nucleolar prominence.\\nThe mitotic count was 4 per mm2 (Fig. 2d). Adjacent fibroadenomatoid\\nareas were also noted. The DCIS component (measuring 2.7 cm across) consisted of epithelial cells with cribriform and micropapillary structures exhibiting foci of comedonecrosis and abundant luminal calcifi-\\ncations (Fig. 2d, e). The epithelial cells possessed enlarged\\nhyperchromatic nuclei with occasional prominent nucleoli.\\nImmunohistochemical study showed diffuse and strong estrogen\\nreceptor staining with loss of CK5/6 staining (Fig. 3a, b, c). A diagnosis\\nof borderline PT with high-grade DCIS was therefore made. The resection margin was focally involved by both the PT and DCIS, for which the\\npatient opted for a right modified radical mastectomy with axillary\\nlymph node dissection. Subsequent pathological examination showed no\\nresidual tumor or lymph node metastasis. No further adjuvant treatment\\nwas given. She remained disease-free clinically and radiologically at her\\n8th annual follow-up. \"\n","}\n","\n","Row 17:\n","{\n","    \"created_username\": \"pre_annotation_batch_1\",\n","    \"result\":

research was performed using the PubMed database to\\nlook for published carcinoma cases arising within PT. Including this case\\nstudy, 48 published cases were analyzed (Table 1) [2,2\\u201342]. They were\\nall female patients between 19 and 80 years old (mean age = 47.7 years\\nold, median age = 50 years old). The size of the PTs ranged from 1.4 cm\\nto 21 cm (mean = 7 cm, median = 5.6 cm). In-situ carcinoma alone was\\nseen in 27 cases (23 DCIS, 2 lobular carcinoma in-situ (LCIS), 2 DCIS + LCIS). Invasive carcinoma was reported in 21 cases (12 invasive ductal\\ncarcinomas (IDC), 3 invasive lobular carcinomas (ILC), 3 invasive\\ntubular carcinomas (ITC), 1 invasive cribriform carcinoma (ICC), 1\\nneuroendocrine carcinoma, and 1 squamous cell carcinoma). Ten of the\\n21 cases with invasive carcinoma also had in-situ carcinoma (5 DCIS, 5\\nLCIS). There were 18 malignant, 8 borderline, and 22 benign PTs.\\nInvasive carcinomas were found in 7 (39%) cases of malignant PTs, 5\\n(63%) cases of borderline PTs, and 8 (36%) cases of benign PTs. For a\\npoint of comparison, ductal hyperplasia within PTs was also most found\\nwithin borderline PTs (83%), followed by benign PTs (74%) and malignant PTs (51%) [1].\\nInformation regarding microcalcification was available in 21 cases;\\nthey were present in 6 (29%) cases and absent in 15 (71%) cases. Of the\\n6 cases with microcalcification, 2 had pure DCIS, while 4 had invasive\\ncarcinoma (3 ITC (2 with associated LCIS and 1 with associated DCIS)\\nand 1 IDC). Both benign-looking specks and suspicious coarse punctate\\nclusters of microcalcifications had been described [21,23].\\nThere were 20 cases with axillary surgery done (13 cases with\\ninvasive component and 7 cases with in-situ component only). Three of\\nthe 13 cases with invasive component had lymph node metastasis\\n(23%), whereas one of the 7 cases with in-situ carcinoma alone had\\nlymph node metastasis (14%). All four cases with lymph node metastasis\\nhad components of IDC. Such incidence of lymph node metastasis is\\ncomparable to that of ordinary invasive breast carcinoma not arising\\nfrom a PT [43]. Furthermore, none of the cases had lymph node involved\\nwith sarcomatous component.\\nTwo studies reported disease-related death resulting from distant\\nmetastasis of the sarcomatous component [34,37]. On the other hand,\\ndistant carcinomatous metastasis from carcinoma arising in PT has not\\nyet been reported. There were 33 cases with information regarding post-treatment follow up of which none reported local recurrence (average\\nfollow-up period of 33 months).\\nCarcinoma, especially in-situ lesions, within a PT is often not suspected during breast imaging [2]. As a result, the carcinoma component\\nis usually diagnosed incidentally on subsequent pathological examination of the core biopsy or excision specimen. Calcification is virtually not\\nseen in pure phyllodes tumors [44]. The presence of microcalcifications\\nin PTs such as those seen in our case is unusual, which could be an\\nalarming feature suggesting the possibility of a carcinoma component\\nwithin the PT. A targeted biopsy of the microcalcifications shall therefore be performed.\\nIn cases with carcinoma within PT, both the stromal and epithelial\\ncomponents should be evaluated when formulating a management plan.\\nThis rationale is supported by a study demonstrating that the carcinoma\\nand stromal neoplastic components are of different clones [39]. The mainstay of treatment for these lesions is surgical excision followed by\\nadjuvant therapies. Local excision/lumpectomy (with a margin of 1 cm\\nadvocated) and mastectomy are common surgical approaches. \"\n","}\n","\n","Row 18:\n","{\n","    \"created_username\":

histopathologically as either ductal or lobular depending on its cytologic features and architectural\\ngrowth pattern. The natural history of each subtype\\nof this disease is different, and patient management\\nvaries accordingly. For example, ductal carcinoma\\nin situ (DCIS) is associated with the development of\\ninvasive cancer at or near the tumor site and is\\ntreated using excision with or without radiotherapy.\\nIn contrast, lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) appears to be a marker for increased risk of invasive\\ncancer at any site in either breast, and the most\\ncommon management option for it is lifetime\\nfollow-up with or without chemopreventive therapy (1).\\nPleomorphic LCIS (PLCIS) is a recently recognized variant of LCIS (2\\u20135). However, all of the\\nPLCIS cases described in the literature have been\\nassociated with infiltrating pleomorphic lobular\\ncarcinoma (IPLC) at a frequency of approximately\\n50% of IPLC cases (2\\u2013 4). In those reports, PLCIS\\nwas described as being cytologically similar to IPLC with a cell population consisting of large, pleomorphic, dyshesive cells with eccentric nuclei and eosinophilic cytoplasm. Although lesions similar to\\nPLCIS but lacking associated invasion have been\\nencountered, the striking cytologic differences between them and classic LCIS and occasional associated necrosis made distinction of these lesions\\nfrom solid DCIS difficult. Consequently, such lesions have been designated as indeterminate,\\nmixed ductal lobular carcinoma in situ (DLCIS) (1,\\n6 \\u2013 8), or \\u201cflorid\\u201d PLCIS (5). To our knowledge, there\\nhave been no reports of PLCIS/DLCIS (PL/DLCIS)\\nas an isolated lesion without associated invasive\\ncarcinoma, and information about the natural history of PL/DLCIS is lacking. In addition, the clinical\\nand mammographic presentation and biomarker\\ncharacteristics of PL/DLCIS are not known.\\nTo address this, we examined a series of 10 cases\\nof PL/DLCIS and 14 cases of PLCIS with associated\\nIPLC and evaluated the clinical presentation, histologic features, and expression of biomarkers involved in cell cycle regulation, cell proliferation,\\nand cellular adhesion. We then compared the features of PL/DLCIS with those of classic LCIS and\\nDCIS. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue blocks\\nobtained from all 24 cases were available for study.\\nFor the purpose of better histomorphologic characterization of PL/DLCIS in relation to classic LCIS, 10\\nconsecutive cases of classic LCIS were also retrieved\\nfrom the surgical pathology file, and their histologic\\nfeatures were reviewed.\\nThe histologic characteristics evaluated included\\nthe nuclear size in relation to a lymphocyte, nuclear\\npleomorphism as graded using a scale of 1\\u20133 (1,\\nmild; 2, intermediate; 3, marked), chromatin pattern (fine versus clumped), presence or absence of\\nnucleoli (including whether they were prominent or\\nsmall at 10 \\u0001 magnification), cytoplasmic features\\n(vacuolated versus eosinophilic or granular), loss of\\ncell cohesion, and presence or absence of central\\nnecrosis or microcalcifications. The presence or absence of classic LCIS within the same or adjacent\\nlobular units was recorded, as was the presence or absence of associated IPLC and other types of invasive carcinoma. When classic LCIS was present,\\nthe cells were categorized as type A, defined as\\nhaving small, bland, uniform nuclei, or type B, defined as having more abundant cytoplasm and\\nmore pleomorphic (grade 1 or 2) nuclei (9).\\nReplicate tumor sections obtained from the tissue blocks were evaluated via immunohistochemical analysis for estrogen receptors (ERs), p53, Ki67,\\nE-cadherin, and gross cystic disease fluid\\nprotein-15 (GCDFP-15) status and via fluorescence\\nin situ hybridization (FISH) for HER-2/neu gene\\namplification. Briefly, 4-\\u0001m-thick tissue sections\\nwere cut, mounted on charged slides, deparaffinized in xylene, and rehydrated in ethanol at descending grades (100 \\u201370%). For immunohistochemistry, the sections were subjected to heat-induced antigen retrieval via immersion in 0.01\\nmol/L citrate buffer (pH 6.0), preheated to more\\nthan 90\\u00b0C, and then heated in an electric vegetable\\nsteamer (Black and Decker, Shelton, CT) for 54\\nminutes. Endogenous peroxidase activity was\\nblocked using 5-minute treatment with 3% hydrogen peroxide in absolute methanol.\\nImmunohistochemical analysis was performed\\nusing the avidin-biotin technique (LSAB2 peroxidase kit; Dako Corp., Carpinteria, CA) with primary\\nantibodies and dilutions as summarized in Table 1.\\nThe antigen-antibody immunoreaction was visualized using 3,3'-diaminobenzidine as the chromogen, and the slides were counterstained using Mayer\\u2019s hematoxylin.\\nThe immunostaining results were evaluated separately for PL/DLCIS with and without invasive carcinoma and for coexisting classic LCIS. Immunoreactivity for ERs, p53, and Ki67 was scored as the\\nestimated percentage of immunostained tumor-cell\\nnuclei. Immunostaining for ERs and p53 was interpreted as being positive when more than 10% of the\\ntumor-cell nuclei showed staining. Also, the proliferation rate was graded as mild, moderate, and\\nmarked when less than 10%, 10%-20%, and more\\nthan 20% of the tumor-cell nuclei, respectively,\\nwere positive for Ki67. Staining for E-cadherin was\\ninterpreted as being positive or negative based on the presence or absence of membranous staining of\\nthe cells of interest. Finally, staining for GCDFP-15\\nwas interpreted as being positive or negative based\\non the presence or absence of cytoplasmic staining\\nof the neoplastic cells. \"\n","}\n","\n","Row

\"batch_1\",\n","    \"text\": \"All 24 patients were women, and their ages\\nranged from 36 to 86 years (mean, 55.1 years). Ten\\nof the patients had PL/DLCIS with no associated\\ninvasion (age range, 44 \\u2013 64 years; mean age, 50.8\\nyears). Thirteen patients had dominant IPLC in association with PLCIS; while one patient had predominant PLCIS with two microscopic foci (less\\nthan 2 mm in extent) of stromal invasion (these 14\\npatients were categorized as having PLCIS with\\ninvasion).\\nIn 9 of the 10 patients who had PL/DLCIS without\\ninvasion, the lesions were detected using mammography by the presence of architectural distortions with associated calcifications in four cases, a\\n5-mm spiculated mass in one case, and calcifications in four cases. The clinical and mammographic\\nfindings in the remaining patient were unknown. In\\nthe 13 patients having both PLCIS and dominant\\ninvasive carcinoma, the clinical presentation was a\\npalpable mass with associated abnormal mammographic findings with or without suspicious calcifications. In the patient having both PLCIS and microinvasion, the lesion was detected using\\nmammography, owing to the presence of\\ncalcifications.\\nTreatment and Follow-up Data\\nAmong the 10 patients having PL/DLCIS without\\ninvasion, 5 underwent needle-localization lumpectomy, and 2 underwent simple mastectomy. All\\nseven of these patients are still alive, six of whom\\nhad no evidence of recurrent disease (clinically or\\nmammographically) in follow-up periods ranging\\nfrom 4 to 32 months (mean, 17 months). The seventh patient developed recurrent suspicious calcifications 12 months after initial lumpectomy for\\nPL/DLCIS; in this case, the excised lesion extended\\nto within less than 1 mm from the inked margin of\\nresection. The patient underwent re-excision,\\nwhich showed in situ carcinoma with features identical to those of the initial lesion. Treatment and\\nfollow-up data for the remaining three patients\\nwere not available.\\nThe patient having PLCIS and microinvasion underwent simple mastectomy with axillary lymph\\nnode dissection. Residual PLCIS with microinvasion was identified in the patient\\u2019s breast biopsy\\nsite, but her axillary lymph nodes were free of metastasis. She had no evidence of disease at 12\\nmonths of follow-up.\\nThe 13 patients having dominant invasive carcinoma and PLCIS underwent segmental resection or mastectomy with or without hormonal therapy,\\nchemotherapy, and/or radiotherapy.\\nPathologic Findings\\nIn 7 of the 10 cases of PL/DLCIS without invasion,\\nthe macroscopic characteristics of the resected\\nspecimens (lumpectomy or simple mastectomy)\\nwere reported. The characteristics were described\\nas being unremarkable with no grossly evident\\nlesions.\\nThe microscopic features of the 10 PL/DLCIS lesions were generally similar to those of PLCIS with\\ninvasion and are summarized in Table 2. In particular, PL/DLCIS involved one or more lobular units\\nand invariably distended the terminal ducts and\\nacini with a pleomorphic population of medium to\\nlarge cells. The nuclei of PL/DLCIS cells were often\\n\\u00024 times the size of a lymphocyte (range, 3\\u2013 6), and\\neccentrically placed, and they often exhibited moderate to marked pleomorphism and distinct small\\nor prominent nucleoli (Fig. 1). Additionally, the cytoplasm in these cells was moderate to abundant,\\nusually eosinophilic or granular, and occasionally\\nvacuolated. The cells were evenly spaced and\\nshowed focal loss of cohesion in 90% of the cases.\\nCentral necrosis with or without calcifications was\\npresent in 40% of the cases of PL/DLCIS without\\ninvasion and 21% of the cases of PLCIS with invasion; also, microcalcifications were present in 40%\\nof the former and 21% of the latter. PL/DLCIS cells\\nalso involved adjacent ducts (pagetoid spread) in\\nthe majority of the cases (Fig. 1D).\\nAssociated classic LCIS was found in 10 of 24\\ncases (four [40%] PL/DLCIS cases and six [46%]\\nPLCIS cases with invasion) either admixed with the\\nin situ component or occurring as isolated lobules.\\nBoth type A and type B cells were identified. In four\\ncases (two PL/DLCIS, two PLCIS with invasion),\\nclassic LCIS was present at the periphery of the\\nareas involved by PL/DLCIS with intervening foci\\nshowing transition from small cells having bland\\nnuclear features to more pleomorphic and larger\\ncells (Fig. 1E). In the cases with associated IPLC, the\\ninvasive lobular component displayed cytologic\\nfeatures similar to those of the accompanying\\nPLCIS.\\nIn the PL/DLCIS cases without invasion, the histologic findings corresponded to the mass lesion or\\narchitectural distortion noted on the mammograms\\n(9 of 10 cases with available mammograms); also,\\ncalcifications were noted within the area of PL/\\nDLCIS. PL/DLCIS was not detected in any of the\\ncases as an incidental finding. The excised surgical\\nmargins were free of carcinoma and measured at\\nleast 3 mm from the tumor in six cases and less\\nthan 1 mm in one case. In the 10 cases of classic LCIS we reviewed, five of\\nthe lesions had, in addition to the small, bland,\\nuniform type A cells, cells with plumper nuclei and\\nmore abundant cytoplasm: type B cells. A comparison of the cytomorphologic features of PL/DLCIS\\nand classic LCIS is shown in Table 2. The immunohistochemical staining and FISH results for PL/DLCIS and PLCIS with invasion are\\nsummarized in Table 3. All 10 PL/DLCIS cases and\\n14 PLCIS cases with invasion were positive for ER,\\nwith the percentages of positive nuclei ranging\\nfrom 40 \\u2013100%. Staining for p53 was positive in 30%\\nof the cases of PL/DLCIS and 29% of the cases of\\nPLCIS with invasion, with the nuclear p53 positivity\\nrate approaching 40% in both p53-positive groups.\\nAdditionally, the proliferation rate as demonstrated\\nby Ki67 immunostaining was low in 56% of the\\ncases of PL/DLCIS and 50% of the cases of PLCIS\\nwith invasion; the rate was moderate or marked,\\nalmost in equal percentages, in the other cases (Fig.\\n2A). The associated classic LCIS component (n \\u0002\\n10) had a markedly lower percentage of tumor-cell\\nnuclei positive for p53 protein and Ki67 in comparison with the PL/DLCIS or PLCIS components with\\ninvasion. Membranous immunostaining for\\nE-cadherin was negative in all of the cases of PL/\\nDLCIS and PLCIS with invasion (Fig. 2B); normal\\nductal epithelium served as an appropriate internal\\ncontrol. HER-2/neu gene amplification was found in\\nonly one case (7%) of PLCIS with invasion and no\\ncases of PL/DLCIS. Finally, immunostaining for\\nGCDFP-15 was performed in 14 cases, 73% of which\\n(PL/DLCIS, 89%; PLCIS with invasion, 60%) were\\npositive. \"\n","}\n","\n","Row 20:\n","{\n","

\"title\": \"batch_1\",\n","    \"text\": \"Our findings demonstrate that PL/DLCIS lesions\\nhave histomorphologic and biomarker characteristics similar to those of PLCIS with associated invasion. Also, in the cases of PLCIS with invasion, the\\nnuclear and cytoplasmic features of the PLCIS component were remarkably similar to those of the\\nIPLC component. These findings are similar to\\nthose described previously (2\\u2013 4). Furthermore, our\\nfindings support the belief that PL/DLCIS may exist\\nas an isolated lesion and display characteristic cytomorphologic features that allow its recognition.\\nThe histologic features of PL/DLCIS that we observed differ from those of classic LCIS, which is\\ncharacterized by a population of small, uniform\\ncells and usually lacks necrosis and calcification. In\\nprevious studies by Haagensen et al. (9) and Rosen\\net al. (11), in addition to the characteristic cells of\\nLCIS (type A cells having bland uniform nuclei),\\nsome LCIS lesions had type B cells, which were\\nlarger and more varied in size and shape. In those\\nseries, however, the extent and severity of the\\nchanges were not quantitated. Although most of the\\nillustrations in those series showed cells with mild\\nto moderate pleomorphism, it is likely that some of\\nthe LCIS lesions having type B cells had a higher\\nlevel of nuclear pleomorphism similar to that observed in our cases. In our series, type A and/or B LCIS cells were\\nassociated with the PL/DLCIS lesions either individually or within the same space. The features of\\ntype B LCIS were generally similar to those of PL/\\nDLCIS except that the cells in the latter had higher\\nnuclear pleomorphism, larger nuclei, and occasional distinct nucleoli. These findings suggest that\\nLCIS represents a spectrum of lesions ranging from\\nthose having small uniform cells (grade 1) to those\\nhaving more nuclear pleomorphism and nuclear\\nenlargement (grades 2 and 3).\\nWhen compared with historical biomarker expression data for classic LCIS, PL/DLCIS had a\\nhigher proliferation rate and higher percentage of\\ncases showing nuclear accumulation of p53 protein, both features compatible with aggressive behavior (Table 4) (6, 12\\u201314). Similar to classic LCIS,\\nhowever, all cases of PL/DLCIS were ER-positive\\nand they all showed uniform loss of membranous\\nstaining for E-cadherin. None of the cases showed\\nHER-2/neu gene amplification. The immunostaining positivity for GCDFP-15 seen in most of our\\nPL/DLCIS cases was consistent with the data reported for IPLC (4, 15).\\nOn the other hand, when PL/DLCIS lesions were\\ncompared with solid low-and high-grade DCIS,\\nthey differed in that DCIS showed E-cadherin expression in the majority of cases and lacked ER\\nexpression, especially in high-grade lesions (Table\\n4) (6, 14, 16). In a study by Shin et al. (17) comparing \\u201cflorid LCIS with necrosis and calcification\\u201d\\nwith low-to intermediate-grade solid DCIS, the authors showed that, in contrast to DCIS, all florid\\nLCIS cases displayed mutational alteration of\\nE-cadherin in addition to a lack of E-cadherin expression. In another study by Acs et al. (18), all\\ncases of mixed DLCIS showed a lobular type of\\nE-cadherin expression. Based on their findings, the\\nauthors suggested that these lesions are more\\nclosely related to LCIS than to DCIS. Similar findings were reported by Jacobs et al. (6) in a subgroup\\nof carcinoma in situ cases that they designated as\\nindeterminate. Our results of the present study are\\nin concordance with those reported previously supporting the closer relationship of PL/DLCIS with\\nLCIS than with DCIS. The natural history of PL/DLCIS is unknown.\\nThis is probably due to the fact that the majority of\\nPL/DLCIS cases, especially those associated with\\nnecrosis and calcifications, were categorized as\\nDCIS and therefore treated as such. For example, in\\nNational Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel\\nProject protocol B-17, Fisher et al. (7) regarded\\nsmall-cell lobular lesions with comedo necrosis as\\n\\u201cductal lobular carcinoma in situ\\u201d and excluded\\ncases having these lesions from their study of LCIS;\\nin contrast, the same lesions were recently accepted\\nby Tavassoli (19) and Rosen (5) as LCIS. Although\\nthe follow-up period in our series was short, most of\\nthe patients had no evidence of disease after surgical resection. One patient having PL/DLCIS was\\nfound to have recurrent disease 12 months after\\ninitial lumpectomy; however, her initial excised lesion was close to the resection margin, and the\\ncompleteness of the excision was uncertain.\\nHistologically, PL/DLCIS is differentiated from\\nsolid-type DCIS with lobular involvement based on\\nthe finding of a population of cells having nuclear\\nand cytoplasmic characteristics of pleomorphic\\nlobular carcinoma: eccentric nuclei, loss of cell cohesion, and negative staining for E-cadherin in neoplastic cells but positive immunostaining in adjacent or residual nonneoplastic epithelium (5, 1214,\\n17, 18). Diffuse positivity for ER regardless of the\\npresence of nuclear pleomorphism and negativity\\nfor HER-2/neu gene amplification are additional\\ncharacteristics that help distinguish PL/DLCIS from\\nhigh-grade DCIS (Table 4). Furthermore, the presence of associated cells of classic LCIS, including\\ntype B cells, and transition from a low to a higher\\ngrade of nuclear pleomorphism should support the\\ndiagnosis of PL/DLCIS.\\nCurrently, the recommended management of patients having PL/DLCIS is similar to that of patients\\nhaving DCIS (7, 16). Considering that the majority\\nof PL/DLCIS cases are associated with a mammographic abnormality, we believe that, as with DCIS,\\ncomplete excision of the lesion with tumor-free\\nmargins with or without irradiation is appropriate\\nfor patients having PL/DLCIS when possible.\\nIn conclusion, the PL/DLCIS may present as an\\nisolated lesion and displays histomorphologic features and biomarker expression profile similar to\\nthose of PLCIS with invasion.\"\n","}\n","\n","Row 21:\n","{\n","    \"created_username\": \"pre_annotation_batch_1\",\n","    \"result\": [\n","        {\n","

female whose screening mammograms revealed a solid mass in the left breast. A physical examination revealed a hard mass of almost 2 cm in diameter, but there was no evidence of abnormal nipple discharge, skin changes or axillary lymphadenopathy. A mammogram demonstrated a high-density mass with a microlobulated contour, partially irregular margins and microcalcifications. The mass was located in the lower outside quadrant of the left breast, and was scored as breast imaging reporting and date system (BI-RADS) Category 4 (Figure 1). An ultrasonographic evaluation showed a lobulated, non-homogenous internal echo, an irregular border and highly echogenic spots (Figure 2). The MRI showed a lobulated mass 20 mm in diameter with early enhancement high signal intensity and a washout pattern in the late-phase image, which suggested that the tumour was a malignant invasive carcinoma (Figure 3). A fine needle aspiration and core needle biopsy were performed, and non-invasive ductal carcinoma was diagnosed. Subsequently, the patient underwent a breast partial resection and sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy. Complete dissection of the axillary lymph nodes was not performed because no metastasis was found in the SLN. Macroscopically, a whitish nodular mass measuring approximately 27 \\u00d7 15 mm in diameter was observed in the centre of the cut surface of the resected specimen (Figure 4). The cut margin of the specimen was negative. Upon histological examination, HE staining of the lesion revealed extensive LCIS characterised by a solid proliferation of small uniform cells with massive distension within the lobular unit. The tumour cells had indistinct cytoplasmic borders, but had clear circular nuclei (Figures 5). Immunohistochemical staining for E-Cadherin was negative. E-cadherin testing is commonly positive in ductal carcinomas but negative in lobular carcinomas and, therefore, the morphological and immunohistochemical findings were consistent with the diagnosis of pure LCIS of the breast. Immunohistochemical reactivity was diffusely positive for oestrogen receptors and progesterone receptors and absent for the expression of human epidermal growth factor recepter type 2 (HER-2). A patient presented with a 2 cm lump in the lower outer quadrant of the left breast. Mammogram and ultrasonography showed a solid mass with a microlobulated contour, partially irregular border and microcalcifications. MRI showed an irregular mass with early enhancement and high signal intensity, and the late-phase image demonstrated a partial washout pattern. These findings suggest that the tumour was a malignant invasive carcinoma. Non-invasive ductal carcinoma was diagnosed after a fine needle aspiration and core needle biopsy followed by a partial breast excision and sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy. A pathological examination of the lesion displayed characteristic small monomorphic cells, solid proliferation and massive distension within the lobular unit. The tumour was immunohistochemically negative for E-cadherin and pure lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) was diagnosed. Pure LCIS is very rare and there have been no previous reports of pure LCIS forming a solid mass.\"\n","}\n","\n","Row 22:\n","{\n","    \"created_username\": \"pre_annotation_batch_1\",\n","    \"result\": [\n","        {\n","            \"from_name\": \"label\",\n","            \"id\": \"No2kach3YV\",\n","            \"source\": \"$text\",\n","            \"to_name\": \"text\",\n","            \"type\": \"labels\",\n","            \"value\": {\n","                \"end\": 496,\n","                \"labels\": [\n","                    \"Body_Site\"\n","                ],\n","                \"start\": 490,\n","                \"text\": \"breast\"\n","            }\n","        },\n","        {\n","            \"from_name\": \"label\",\n","            \"id\": \"5vfPcleGkK\",\n","            \"source\": \"$text\",\n","            \"to_name\": \"text\",\n","            \"type\": \"labels\",\n","            \"value\": {\n","                \"end\": 1077,\n","                \"labels\": [\n","                    \"Biomarker_Result\"\n","                ],\n","                \"start\": 1068,\n","                \"text\": \"increased\"\n","            }\n","        },\n","        {\n","            \"from_name\": \"label\",\n","            \"id\": \"105KnvDiQ9\",\n","            \"source\": \"$text\",\n","            \"to_name\": \"text\",\n","            \"type\": \"labels\",\n","            \"value\": {\n","                \"end\": 2247,\n","                \"labels\": [\n","                    \"Body_Site\"\n","                ],\n","                \"start\": 2233,\n","                \"text\": \"mammary tissue\"\n","            }\n","        }\n","    ]\n","}\n","{\n","    \"title\": \"batch_1\",\n","    \"text\": \"LCIS was first described as a distinct pathological entity by Foote and Stewart in 1941 [7].Traditionally, LCIS does not present as a mass nor does it contain any microcalcifications on radiological imaging, and the mammography and ultrasound findings do not appear to play a role in prospectively diagnosing LCIS [1-3]. There are no characteristic macroscopic features of LCIS to guide tissue sampling, and the diagnosis of LCIS is often made as an incidental, microscopic finding after a breast biopsy for other indications. Consequently, the true incidence of LCIS in the general population is unknown and, presumably, many asymptomatic women go undiagnosed.\\n\\nAlthough it has long been thought that LCIS is not associated with any specific mammographic findings, recent data indicates that finely stippled clusters of calcifications detected on mammography are often associated with LCIS [4-7]. Furthermore, calcifications are seen in 21% to 67% of LCIS cases [8, 9]. Owing to the increased use of mammography and core needle biopsy, the incidence rate of LCIS has increased 2.6-fold from 1980 to 2001, 1.3-fold over the past 10 years and 1.1-fold over the past 5 years [10]. Sapino et al observed that in ten cases of LCIS detected on mammograms, nine were non-palpable and radiologically identified by the presence of calcifications [5]. In only one case, a spiculated mass was observed in a different quadrant than the one containing the calcifications, and the case was histologically diagnosed as multiple foci of LCIS associated with an invasive component. Georgian-Smith et al evaluated six cases of LCIS and observed that no mass or architectural distortion was associated with the LCIS calcifications on mammography [3]. Philpotts et al evaluated five cases of LCIS diagnosed by core needle biopsy of which two masses were detected on mammogram and three patients had calcifications [11]. Excision biopsies of the two mass lesions revealed one case of LCIS admixed with ductal carcinoma in situ and another case of atypical lobular hyperplasia. The other cases with associated calcifications were diagnosed as LCIS.\\n\\nThe diagnosis of LCIS is most common in women aged 40 to 50 years [10]. Women of this age have abundant mammary tissue, and the background parenchymal features are heterogeneous, which may obscure the lesion. In our case, the patient's glandular tissue had diminished and was replaced by fatty tissue and, therefore, the pure LCIS lesion was clearly displayed as a solid mass on mammography.\\n\\nAccording to our research, there has been only one case report of LCIS presenting as a 9 mm nodule by mammography and ultrasonography. However, this case was not a pure LCIS, which is defined as a mass consisting primarily of LCIS with foci of DCIS\"\n","}\n","\n","Row 23:\n","{\n","    \"created_username\":

\"batch_1\",\n","    \"text\": \"The patient was a 50-year-old nulliparous, diabetic hypertensive woman whose previous screening mammograms showed multiple, bilateral, and stable subcentimeter nodules without dominant mass or suspicious microcalcifications. Just before diagnosis, mammograms performed at an outside institution showed a dominant mass in the outer portion of the right breast (Figs. 1A and 1B). Evaluation at our institution with sonography showed a 9-mm hypoechoic, microlobulated mass (Fig. 1C). The patient was offered but refused minimally invasive biopsy and chose to have surgical excisional biopsy. The patient underwent preoperative needle localization with sonographic guidance. A specimen radiograph showed a poorly defined mass (Fig. 1D). Pathologic evaluation of the surgical excisional biopsy specimen was interpreted as LCIS (Fig. 1E). As a result of the clinical and radiologic presentation, which strongly suggested an invasive carcinoma, the entire specimen was resected and evaluated pathologically, with confirmation of the diagnosis of LCIS. As a result of the radiologic-pathologic discordance, additional sections of the lesion were sectioned and immunohistochemically analyzed for E-cadherin reactivity. Membranebound immunohistochemical reactivity was identified in more ductal appearing components indicative of a mixed lesion composed of low-grade ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and LCIS. Immunohistochemical reactivity was diffusely positive for estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor and absent for expression of HER-2. The natural history of LCIS is difficult to define, as it generally has no specific clinical or mammographic findings [2, 3, 5]. It is usually incidentally identified histologically in breast tissue biopsied for other reasons. Preoperative detection of LCIS is not possible, since no specific mammographic features of this entity are generally recognized [3]. Therefore, its reported incidence depends on the frequency of biopsy, and is consequently underestimated [2, 4, 6]. LCIS occurs predominantly in women with a mean age of 45 years old, approximately 10 to 15 years younger than the mean age when invasive breast carcinoma occurs [1].\\nLCIS is a high-risk marker for the future development of invasive carcinoma [2-5]. However, some investigators have speculated that individual foci of LCIS progress to invasive disease [3]. Regardless of the mechanisms involved, a woman with LCIS has approximately a 15% chance of developing an infiltrating ductal or lobular carcinoma in the breast in which the LCIS is discovered, but also has a similar risk (15%) for contralateral development of cancer over the next 30 years [5]. Recent evidence also shows that 18-25% of the cases diagnosed with LCIS at core needle biopsy were upgraded to more invasive cancer pathologies at surgical excision [7, 8].\\nMicroscopically, LCIS consists of numerous cells of uniform appearance with round nuclei and relatively clear cytoplasm. The malignant cells fill the lobular acini, leaving the basement membrane intact [5]. Nonspecific microcalcifications are often the impetus for biopsy in the cases when LCIS is discovered. However, a substantial percentage of women with LCIS have no abnormalities on mammography [3]. Identification of mammographic features of LCIS has been attempted in several studies with only minimal success [9]. Recently, however, several studies have determined that calcifications could be a specific finding of LCIS and not just an indirectly associated regional abnormality [3, 4]. These studies describe two types of calcifications associated with LCIS: classic nonnecrotic calcifications and pleomorphic necrotic calcifications. Classic calcifications are described as smaller and morphologically identical to calcifications in surrounding breast tissue. Pleomorphic calcifications are identified by their association with central necrosis in the LCIS focus and their location amid pleomorphic cells. These calcifications are likened to comedocarcinoma calcifications found in DCIS [4]. Because of this finding, cases that were previously considered DCIS because of necrotic features are being redefined as LCIS. The similarity between LCIS and DCIS may lead to difficulty in distinguishing between these two pathologic entities. DCIS is generally clinically silent and is often discovered incidentally. However, it can manifest clinically as a palpable mass, nipple discharge, or Paget's disease [10]. On mammography, 62-98% of DCIS lesions are detected by the presence of characteristic microcalcifications, with only 2-23% manifesting solely as a mass or asymmetric density [10]. Although the majority of DCIS cases are detected mammographically, 6-23% of DCIS lesions are not visible mammographically and manifest with clinical symptoms such as nipple discharge or a palpable mass. Detection of DCIS as calcifications on mammography becomes more likely with high-grade lesions [10]. In the rare instance that DCIS presents as a mass, it is associated with a higher nuclear grade. This is a case of a mass consisting primarily of LCIS with foci of low-grade DCIS. The manifestation of a mass is previously unreported for LCIS and rare for low-grade DCIS.\\nLCIS can be pathologically differentiated from DCIS by loss of cellular cohesion, intracytoplasmic vacuoles, and pagetoid ductal involvement. Likewise, microacini are present in DCIS and absent in LCIS [4]. In reality, however, these histologic distinctions are not always clear. Frykberg [2] delineates several factors that may generate some difficulty in the pathologic diagnosis of LCIS. He states that the cells of LCIS may proliferate outside the lobules into the major lactiferous ducts, that ductal forms of breast carcinoma may extend into the breast lobules, and that LCIS may resemble low-grade forms of DCIS. This latter point is significant, especially in light of the fact that these two entities may closely coexist [2]. This case exemplifies the overlap that can be found between these two types of lesions. \"\n","}\n","\n","Row 24:\n","{\n","    \"created_username\": \"pre_annotation_batch_1\",\n","    \"result\":

\"batch_1\",\n","    \"text\": \"Inflammatory breast cancer is a special type of breast cancer,\\nand the incidence of HER2-positive subtypes is higher in IBC, ac-\\ncounting for about 35 %e40 %.1,2 This type of breast cancer has a\\nhigh degree of malignancy and a poor prognosis, but after stan-\\ndardized treatment, even in patients with advanced metastasis, a\\ngood outcome can still be achieved. In this paper, we present a\\ncase of HER2-positive advanced inflammatory breast cancer, which\\nwas initially diagnosed with organ metastasis, but after standardized treatment, the patient has survived for 30 months without\\nrecurrence and distant metastases have completely disappeared. \\nA 56-year-old female patient was admitted to the hospital with\\na \\u201cright breast lump found for more than 2 months\\u201d. Physical examination: the whole right breast was red, swollen, bruised and hard\\nwith localized elevated skin temperature. There was a 20*20 cm\\nmass in the right breast, protruding from the body surface, and\\nan enlarged lymph node of about 2*2 cm in size was detected in\\nthe left axilla. Pathology of right breast(Fig. 1A) and left supraclavicular lymph node(Fig. 1B) puncture showed: invasive ductal carcinoma of right breast, ER (1\\u00fe, 10 %), PR(1\\u00fe, 60 %), HER2(3\\u00fe), Ki67(30 %), metastatic carcinoma was detected. Abdominal enhanced\\nCT(Fig. 1C) showed a slightly low-density nodule in the right anterior lobe of the liver, about 22*26 mm in size, which was considered\\nto be a high possibility of metastasis. The patient was diagnosed\\nwith invasive ductal carcinoma of the right breast with right axillary lymph node metastasis with distant metastasis (cT4dN3cM1\\nHER-2 type stage IV) and received 10 cycles of THP (first 8 docetaxel, then 2 albumin-bound paclitaxel \\u00fe trastuzumab \\u00fe patuximab)rescue therapy. Breast MRI showed that: no obvious\\nenhancement lesions were found in the right breast, and PR was\\nconsidered, abdominal enhanced CT showed that: hepatic nodules,\\nthe large one with a diameter of about 9 mm, decreased compared\\nwith the previous one. PET/CT showed that the activity of the right\\nbreast lesion and axillary lymph nodes and hepatic nodal metastases was suppressed. Then the patient underwent bilateral\\nmastectomy \\u00fe bilateral axillary lymph node dissection. Postoperative pathology suggested: bilateral breast and bilateral axilla: no\\ncancer metastasis(Fig. 1D). Postoperative diagnosis: ypT0N0M1(-liver). Postoperative treatment: HP double-targeted therapy \\u00fe\\ncapecitabine intensive therapy \\u00fe local radiotherapy. There were\\nno signs of recurrence and metastasis after surgery, and the liver\\nmetastases completely disappeared(Fig. 1E).\\nIn this case, the diagnosis of HER2 type inflammatory breast\\ncancer with liver metastasis was clear, and double-targeted therapy\\nwas given preoperatively, the pathological effect was evaluated as\\nG5, followed by sequential adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy, and CT showed that the liver nodules disappeared. Thus,\\neven in advanced metastatic HER2 inflammatory breast cancer, patients receiving trastuzumab and pertuzumab therapy can benefit\\nsignificantly. Inflammatory breast cancer has a number of different\\ncharacteristics compared to non-inflammatory breast cancer that\\ndetermine its biological highly aggressive nature. Neoadjuvant\\nchemotherapy can improve the overall survival rate of patients\\nwith inflammatory breast cancer, and surgery and radiotherapy\\ncan reduce the risk of local recurrence. 4 At present, inflammatory\\nbreast cancer still has a very poor prognosis, and new modes of control must be explored to change the status quo. The role of targeted\\ntherapies has been recognized, and immunotherapy research has\\nattracted increasing attention, 5 multicenter studies are needed in\\nthis area to provide high-quality evidence.\"\n","}\n","\n","Row 25:\n","{\n","    \"created_username\": \"pre_annotation_batch_1\",\n","    \"result\": [\n","        {\n","            \"from_name\": \"label\",\n","            \"id\":

She had no significant family history and no systemic disease or surgery history. On physical examination: The\\nskin of entire breast is slightly red but normal in shape, the axillary\\nlymph nodes (ALNs) are enlarged, non-firm and mobile, and right\\nbreast is normal. Pre-admission examinations included: Ultrasonography: A nodule 1.0 cm in diameter below left nipple, BI-RADS: 4A; Contrast-enhanced ultrasound: A lesion with rich blood\\nsupply; Ultrasound-guided coarse needle biopsy (CNB):more infiltration of lymphocytes and plasma cells; However, the mass\\nincreased progressively after CNB. Reexamination ultrasound: A\\nsolid cystic echo 3.6*2.5 cm below the nipple, with uneven low-echo area 7.5*4.1 cm surrounding, considered hematoma. Before\\ntreatment: WBC: 14.72*10 9 /L, CRP: 17.3 mg/L; Ultrasound: Consider\\ninflammatory changes. According to clinical manifestations and\\npathological results, diagnosed plasma cell mastitis (PCM). Patients\\nwere given anti-infective, oral and external application of Chinese\\nherbal medicine and physical anti-inflammatory therapy more\\nthan one week, but her symptoms are getting worse and she has\\na low-grade fever (Fig. 1A). Even there was no remission with added\\nglucocorticoid therapy. Then Reexamination ultrasound revealed\\ninflammatory changes again. The second CNB was performed\\nbecause of abnormal progression (Fig. 1B), then the pathological results: invasive breast cancer, but inflammatory breast cancer (IBC)\\ncouldn't be excluded. ALNs are infiltrated with carcinoma.  Further examination revealed left supraclavicular lymph\\nnode metastasis. She was given chemotherapy with anthracyclines\\nand cyanobacteria, and the symptoms are better than before.\\nThe reasons for patient's misdiagnosis were: First, her breast\\nshowed signs of inflammation, and ultrasound revealed inflammatory changes; Second, the CNB clearly indicated plasma cell infiltration. It's hard to distinguish it's benign or malignant just by taking\\nphysical examination. Immune response and complement reaction\\ncaused by inflammation may cover up other eviler lesions, causing\\nconfusion to clinical diagnosis. Ultrasound revealed no normal\\nglandular structure, no tumor echo, only skin and adipose layer\\nedema, so inflammation was considered. But in fact, it's been\\neroded by tumor cells.\\nThe possible causes of pathological misdiagnosis were: First, the\\nfirst puncture biopsy failed to obtain breast tissue with real lesions.\\nSecond, limited puncture tissue makes pathological diagnosis difficult. Third, the patient had both PCM and IBC. The first two factors\\ncan't be completely avoided. And mammary gland skin change of\\nIBC is to gather as a result of tumor, matrix, immune cell, form cancer bolt and invade lymphatic canal of true cortex, cause lymphatic\\ncanal to be blocked, cause lymphoedema. Although tumor embolization of cutaneous lymphatic vessels is characteristic of IBC, only\\n75% of pathological specimens can show tumor\\nembolization.1,2 So, the typical pathological features of IBC are not\\nalways observed.\\nIn clinical practice, misdiagnosis of IBC as PCM is rare.

2006. She underwent a right lumpectomy for a pT1b\\n(1.1 cm) invasive micropapillary carcinoma, poorly\\ndifferentiated, pN3a with 27 of 29 lymph nodes involved. The\\nhormonal receptor status [estrogen receptor (ER) and\\nprogesterone receptor (PgR)] was negative, HER2 was\\noverexpressed and Ki-67 was 35%.\\nSix cycles of adjuvant Canadian CEF (cyclophosphamide,\\nepirubicin and 5-fluorouracil), completed in April 2007, plus\\nright breast and right supraclavicular region irradiation were\\nadministered.\\nIn July 2007, the patient commenced adjuvant trastuzumab\\ntherapy. During trastuzumab therapy, in November 2007, the\\npatient showed locoregional recurrence with an inflammatory\\narea on the right chest. A punch biopsy confirmed the recurrence\\nof ER- and PgR-negative HER2-overexpressed breast carcinoma.\\nThe patient received weekly paclitaxel and trastuzumab (from\\nDecember 2007 to March 2008) with local progressive disease,\\nfollowed by a trastuzumab and vinorelbine combination with\\nfurther local progression in October 2008. In November 2008, the patient commenced treatment with\\nthe tyrosine kinase inhibitor lapatinib (1250 mg/day\\ncontinuously) and capecitabine (2000 mg/mq days 1\\u201314 every\\n21 days) with local response (Figure 1B).\\nOn May 2009, because of local progression due to the\\npresence of a new area of erythema on the right breast\\n(Figure 1C), the patient started metronomic capecitabine\\n(500 mg thrice daily), continuing lapatinib therapy with\\nprolonged disease control for 20 weeks (Figure 1D).\\nDespite progress in combined-modality treatment, the long-term outcome for patients with inflammatory breast cancer\\n(IBC) remains poor. The diffuse nature of IBC local\\ninvolvement is highly indicative of a disease mechanism closely\\nassociated with angiogenesis activity; consequently, the\\nantiangiogenic drugs against vascular endothelial growth factor\\nhave yielded promising results [1].\\nMoreover, preclinical evidence also indicates that blockade\\nof the HER receptor family, in particular of the epidermal\\ngrowth factor receptor (EGFR) and HER2/neu, may inhibit\\nangiogenesis.\\nLapatinib represents a treatment option for women with\\nHER2-overexpressing advanced breast cancer previously\\ntreated with anthracycline, taxane and trastuzumab [2].\\nThe antiangiogenic activity of lapatinib by EGFR blockade\\ncould explain the higher efficacy in inflammatory disease. In\\nfact, in heavily pretreated inflammatory HER2-positive breast\\ncancer patients, the response rate of lapatinib is 39% [3]\\ncompared with modest clinical activity, with response rates\\nranging from 5% to 8% in pretreated HER2 non-IBC. On the other hand, retrospective analyses have demonstrated\\nthat lower doses of capecitabine have a more favorable\\ntherapeutic index in metastatic breast cancer (MBC) when\\ncompared with standard dose. The fixed daily doses and\\ncontinuous dosing schedule of capecitabine have been\\ndemonstrated to be well tolerated and active in breast cancer.\\nThe daily oral administration of capecitabine mimics\\na continuous i.v. infusion of 5-fluorouracil, which has\\nantiangiogenic activity in preclinical models. Recently, we reported that metronomic capecitabine and\\ncyclophosphamide combined with bevacizumab provides long-\\nterm disease control in a high proportion of MBC patients [5].\\nOur patient showed prolonged disease control to lapatinib\\nand metronomic capecitabine therapy. This combination may\\nhave antiangiogenic effects with good tolerability and may be\\nsuitable for future evaluation in inflammatory HER2-positive\\nbreast cancer.\"\n","}\n","\n","Row 27:\n","{\n","

\"batch_1\",\n","    \"text\": \"A 38 year old woman at high risk of breast cancer due to prior\\nradiation for Hodgkin disease was discovered to have an area of\\ncalcifications in the lower inner quadrant of the right breast on\\nher first screening mammogram. No skin lesions were present and\\nthe nipple was normal in appearance. A 10 gauge vacuum-assisted\\ncore needle biopsy successfully sampled the calcifications and a\\nmarking clip was placed. The needle entered the breast at approximately 5:00 (Fig. 1). The biopsy revealed high grade DCIS with\\ncomedo necrosis and calcifications. A single focus was suspicious\\nfor microinvasion. The DCIS was negative for estrogen receptor\\n(ER), showed 1\\u20134% positivity for progesterone receptor (PR), and\\nwas positive for HER2 (3+). Breast MRI showed a corresponding\\n2.5 \\u00d7 1.0 cm area of enhancement in the area of the DCIS, located\\n5.3 cm away from the nipple.\\nThe patient opted to undergo bilateral skin sparing mastectomies with immediate reconstruction using pedicled transverse ectus abdominus myocutaneous (TRAM) flaps. The nipple and areolar complexes were removed, but the skin in the area of the prior\\nneedle biopsy site was preserved. The right mastectomy revealed\\nDCIS with 2 foci of microinvasion over 3\\u20134 cm. The skin, nipple,\\nsuperficial skin flap margin, and deep margin were free of carcinoma, as were 3 sentinel nodes.\\nOne and a half years after the mastectomy, the patient noted an\\narea of skin change in the lower inner aspect of the right reconstructed breast (Fig. 2). This area was not close to the mastectomy\\nscar or the reconstructed nipple. The lesion measured 1.2 cm but\\ngradually increased in size and was treated by her primary care\\nphysician with topical antifungal medication. The skin lesion continued to enlarge and was brought to the attention of her breast\\nsurgical oncologist three years after her mastectomy. The erythematous lesion now measured 2.5 \\u00d7 2.0 cm and appeared eroded\\n(Fig. 3). Photographs taken by her plastic surgeon prior to her mastectomy and reconstruction fortuitously showed the skin puncture site of the original core needle biopsy (Fig. 1). It was apparent\\nthat the skin lesion was at this same site. A skin punch biopsy was\\nperformed and revealed tumor cells restricted to the epidermis\\n(Paget disease).\\nThe entire area of involved skin was excised to negative margins. Because of the size and location of the lesion, full thickness\\nskin grafting was necessary for cosmetic closure. The carcinoma\\nwas restricted to the epidermis over a 1.7 cm area (Fig. 4). The\\ncarcinoma was negative for ER, showed low levels of PR, and was\\nstrongly positive for HER2. No invasion was present. No evidence\\nof an ectopic nipple, Toker cells, residual breast tissue, or apocrine\\nglands was seen. Therefore the most likely source of the tumor cells\\nwas iatrogenic displacement of tumor cells from the breast into the\\nepidermis from the prior core needle biopsy. The patient is without evidence of carcinoma, 3 years after the skin excision and 6 years\\nafter mastectomy. \"\n","}\n","\n","Row 28:\n","{\n","    \"created_username\":

epithelium is classified as Paget disease. The\\nmost common cause in the breast is DCIS extending from breast\\nducts into the epidermis of the nipple areolar complex. In the current case, the Paget disease was located away from the nipple and\\nother etiologies had to be considered. Paget disease can arise from\\nan ectopic nipple [2,3]. However, the location was far from the\\nnormal milk line along which ectopic nipples usually occur and a\\npreviously existing nipple was not observed. Extramammary Paget\\ndisease is thought to arise from apocrine glands, as it occurs in\\nthe genital, perianal, and axillary areas [4,5]. However, the recurrence was far from the axilla and no apocrine glands were present.\\nVery rare cases of \\u201cectopic\\u201d extramammary Paget disease occur in\\nskin without apocrine glands and may arise from eccrine glands\\n[6]. This disease most commonly involves the trunk of elderly\\nmales. No involvement of eccrine glands was seen in the current\\ncase.\\nThe only likely remaining mechanism for this case of Paget disease is displacement of tumor cells from the original DCIS to the\\nepidermis from tumor seeding the needle track. This possibility is\\nsupported by the identical histologic appearance and tumor marker\\nexpression of the original and recurrent carcinomas and the location at the core needle biopsy site.\\nCarcinoma recurring in a needle track as Paget disease of the\\nskin has not been reported previously. There are only 13 other\\ncases of breast cancer recurrence in a needle track after definitive surgery and a disease- free interval (Table 1) [7\\u201313]. Eleven\\nof the cases were invasive cancers, one was DCIS, and one was not\\nspecified. The time to recurrence ranged from 1 to 6 years (average 2.5 years). Three patients who underwent breast conservation\\nrecurred as invasive carcinoma in the breast and 1 recurred in the\\nskin. Seven of 9 patients who underwent mastectomy recurred as\\ninvasive carcinomas involving the skin and subcutaneous tissue.\\nOne patient recurred as invasive carcinoma in skeletal muscle. The\\nsite of recurrence was not specified for 1 patient. All but 1 patient\\nhad carcinoma limited to the core needle site. This patient had multiple foci of carcinoma in the dermis in the same quadrant [10]. She\\nhad presented with 3 invasive carcinomas and had undergone 3\\ncore needle biopsies.\\nEpithelial displacement into needle tracks immediately after the\\nprocedure has been shown to be quite common [1,14]. How then,\\ndoes one explain the scarcity of clinically evident recurrences? The\\nlikelihood of finding cells in the needle track diminishes over time,\\nsupporting that, in many cases, these cells do not persist, perhaps\\ndue to lack of a developed blood supply [15]. It is also possible that\\nradiation therapy plays a role, as none of the patients with needle\\ntrack recurrences received this therapy. The possible role of systemic therapy is less clear. Two patients received chemotherapy, 6\\ndid not, and this information is not provided for the other 5 patients\\n(Table 1). Finally, removal of the needle track as part of the intended\\nsurgical resection or as a separate excision will eliminate any residual cells, though the utility of such a minor risk-reducing maneuver\\nat the expense of likely cosmetic compromise may be debatable.\\nThere are no definite risk factors for needle track recurrences.\\nNeedle track seeding has not been clearly associated with the type\\nand size of needles, the number of needle passes, or the duration of\\nthe procedure [1]. Recurrences have been associated with both fine\\nneedle aspirations and core needle biopsies (Table 1). Although 5 of\\nthe cancers were of special histologic types, this association may be\\nrelated to the decision not to radiate rather than the type of cancer. The rarity of clinically diagnosed needle track recurrences sup-\\nports that routine excision of the skin and needle track is not\\nrequired, especially for women undergoing radiation therapy. It\\nhas been suggested that it would be helpful to document the site\\nof the biopsy with a diagram or photograph in the patient\\u2019s medical record [12]. The location of the skin puncture site for a needle\\nbiopsy depends on the location of the lesion, the imaging modality\\nused, and the size of the breast and cannot be determined with certainty unless recorded before the site heals. The need to document\\nbiopsy sites may be questioned due to the low number of reported\\nrecurrences. However, in the absence of knowing the location of\\nthe skin puncture, recurrences may be underreported. Documentation can also aid in early detection of recurrences. In the reported\\ncase, diagnosis was delayed for over a year as the skin lesion was\\nmistaken for an infection. Fortunately, the carcinoma was detected\\nwhile still in situ. Invasion can occur from Paget disease and the\\ndelay in diagnosis could have resulted in development of invasive\\ncarcinoma and a poorer prognosis [16,17].\\nThe reported recurrences have been successfully treated with\\nlocal excision and adjuvant treatment. Although follow-up is short,\\nno cases have been reported with distant metastasis. It is important to recognize a skin recurrence as an isolated needle track\\nrecurrence, as this type of recurrence may not have the same dire\\nprognosis for recurrent invasive carcinoma elsewhere in the chest\\nwall. \"\n","}\n","\n","Row 29:\n","{\n","    \"created_username\": \"pre_annotation_batch_1\",\n","    \"result\": [\n","        {\n","            \"from_name\": \"label\",\n","

The left breast was unremarkable.

\"batch_1\",\n","    \"text\": \"Paget's disease of the nipple is a rare form of ductal carcinoma in situ.\\nIt corresponds to infiltration of the epidermis of the nipple-areolar region by adenocarcinoma-like cells. It accounts for 1\\u20133 % of breast tumours and is often associated with an underlying breast cancer in over\\n80 % of cases or, more rarely, may be isolated without breast neoplasm.\\nPaget's disease should be suspected in the presence of any persisent\\nunilateral lesion of the nipple, and only anatomopathological examination combined with immunohistochemistry can confirm the diagnosis. Imaging, based on ultrasound mammography and magnetic\\nresonance imaging (MRI), is of fundamental importance in the search for\\nunderlying cancer, which will enable management to be adapted and\\nprognosis to be established. Histologically, Paget's disease corresponds to invasion of the nipple\\nepidermis by lesions of ductal carcinoma in situ, with the presence of so-called Paget's cells in the epidermis (large cells with clear cytoplasm,\\nlarge irregular hyperchromatic nuclei, seat of mitosis). Two mechanisms\\nhave been suggested: migration of Paget cells from an underlying car-\\ncinoma, or transformation of nipple keratinocytes independently of any\\nassociated breast pathology. Clinically, it manifests as erythematous and eczematous eruptions on\\nthe nipple and areola, the extent of which varies according to the age of\\nthe lesions. At an advanced stage, it may extend to the entire surface of\\nthe breast, with destruction of the entire nipple-areolar plate (5).\\nThe association of Paget's disease of the nipple with breast cancer is\\nthe most frequent situation, requiring a complete radiological work-up\\nof the breast (breast ultrasound, mammography and at least breast\\nMRI) in search of an underlying breast lesion, in order to adapt therapeutic management and establish a prognosis (1).\\nDiagnosis is confirmed by anatomopathological examination combined with immunohistochemistry. Paget's cells express low-molecular-weight cytokeratins, including cytokeratin 7 (CK7), with a sensitivity\\nclose to 100 %, helping to confirm the diagnosis (4).\\nThe treatment of Paget's disease remains controversial, with mastectomy long considered the gold standard due to its potential multi-focality (3). However, given the low sensitivity of clinical examination\\nand mammography/ultrasound for the detection of underlying breast\\ncarcinomas, and their multifocal or multicentric nature, treatment of\\nPaget's disease should be discussed on a case-by-case basis within the\\nframework of a multidisciplinary consultation meeting (2).\\nIn our case, Paget's disease of the nipple was very extensive, so there\\nwas no room for conservative treatment, but we had a problem with\\ncoverage, so we proceeded with a dorsalis major flap. Paget's disease of the nipple is a rare entity among breast cancers,\\noften associated with an underlying breast cancer, which needs to be\\nevaluated in order to adjust the therapeutic strategy and determine the\\nprognosis.\\nThe diagnosis is clinically suspected in the presence of a persistent\\nnipple-areolar plaque lesion and confirmed by histology and\\nimmunohistochemistry.\\nTreatment is

She also reported sporadic bloody nipple\\ndischarge and mild erythema. The patient had no family history of\\nbreast cancer or significant medical history. Upon physical examination,\\nwe observed erythema, scaling, and minor excoriation localized to the\\nright nipple and areola. No palpable breast masses, axillary lymphadenopathy, or skin alterations were detected elsewhere on the breast. The\\ncontralateral breast appeared unremarkable.\\nA diagnostic mammogram revealed bilaterally dense breast tissue\\nwith multiple benign calcifications. Bilateral breast ultrasound demonstrated fibrocystic changes in both breasts with no concerning findings,\\neffectively ruling out underlying masses or ductal abnormalities.\\nGiven the persistence of the symptoms and the clinical suspicion of\\nPDN, a punch biopsy of the right nipple and areola was performed.\\nHistopathological examination identified a population of atypical large\\nclear cells within the squamous epithelium, raising the suspicion of\\nPaget's disease (Fig. 1A). Immunohistochemical staining revealed tumor\\ncells positive for cytokeratin-7, a marker commonly associated with\\nmammary glandular cells, and negative for S-100 protein, different from\\nmelanoma, thus confirming the diagnosis of PDN (Fig. 1B and C). In\\naddition, intraductal proliferation testing revealed positivity for estrogen receptors (ER). P63 staining positive demonstrates preserved\\nmyoepithelial cells, confirming the diagnosis of ductal carcinoma in situ\\n(DCIS).\\nBreast MRI, which was performed to rule out any underlying breast\\ncarcinoma, demonstrated a small enhancing focus in the 12 o'clock\\nposition in the right breast (Fig. 2). Based on the clinical presentation and pathological findings, a diagnosis of both PDN and DCIS was\\nestablished. Further surgical intervention was recommended; however,\\na second-look ultrasound with focused needle localization was performed preoperatively due to challenges in precisely identifying the\\nsuspicious lesion noted on the breast MRI scan (Fig. 3). Breast-conserving surgery (BCS) involving the removal of the nipple-areola\\ncomplex (NAC) was performed (Fig. 4). The postoperative pathological report indicated DCIS and invasive ductal carcinoma, measuring\\napproximately 0.4 cm in size (Fig. 5). The deep fascia, skin, and soft\\ntissue margins were tumor-free. Immunohistochemical staining revealed\\nER positivity in 10 % of the cells; however, the cells were negative for\\nprogesterone receptor and Her-2/neu.\\nFurther staging was achieved through sentinel lymph node biopsy\\n(SLNB), which demonstrated negative results for lymph node metastasis.\\nSubsequently, the patient received postoperative radiotherapy and\\nhormonal therapy to minimize the risk of disease recurrence.

condition characterized by adenocarcinoma cell infiltration into\\nthe nipple epidermis. This condition was first documented by a British\\nsurgeon, Sir James Paget, in 1874. PDN typically affects the skin around\\nthe nipple in women and is associated with an underlying breast carcinoma, accounting for approximately 1 %\\u20133 % of breast malignancies\\n[1\\u20134]. Despite its relative rarity, PDN poses significant diagnostic and\\ntherapeutic challenges due to its clinical similarity to benign\\ndermatological conditions and its frequent association with in situ or\\ninvasive carcinoma (observed in 90 %\\u2013100 % of cases) [1,2,5\\u20139].\\nPatients with PDN commonly present with symptoms such as pruritus, erythema, scaling, and, occasionally, sanguineous nipple\\ndischarge [1]. However, these nonspecific clinical manifestations often\\nlead to delayed diagnosis and intervention. This report details a PDN\\ncase in a female patient with concomitant occult invasive breast cancer.\\nThe diagnostic process involved breast magnetic resonance imaging\\n(MRI) and second-look ultrasound to identify suspected lesions, thereby\\nreducing the extent of surgical resection. This case underscores the importance of early diagnosis, additional diagnostic imaging surveys\\nwith MRI and second-look ultrasound, and appropriate treatment strategies for managing PDN. PDN typically presents with clinical signs and symptoms that mimic\\nbenign dermatological conditions, such as eczema or contact dermatitis.\\nCommon clinical features include pruritus, erythema, scaling, and, occasionally, nipple discharge [1]. Consequently, a delayed diagnosis is\\ncommon, with patients often seeking treatment from dermatologists\\nbefore a correct diagnosis is made. The differential diagnosis for PDN\\nincludes various dermatological conditions affecting the nipple and\\nareola, such as contact dermatitis, eczema, psoriasis, and Pagetoid\\nmelanoma. A timely diagnosis can significantly impact the treatment\\nand prognosis of the disease; therefore, distinguishing PDN from these\\nbenign conditions is crucial [11].\\nPatients with Paget's disease exhibit distinctive characteristics that\\nshould heighten the suspicion for diagnosis. More than 90 % of Paget's\\ndisease cases are associated with an underlying breast malignancy.\\nTherefore, even when traditional mammography and ultrasound do not reveal abnormalities, additional imaging studies such as breast MRI\\nshould be considered for further evaluation, especially in patients with\\nPDN [3]. Lim et al. [8] underscored the significance of MRI in Paget's\\ndisease and reported its importance in assessing the nipple-areolar\\ncomplex and detecting potential underlying breast malignancies. In\\nthe current case study, a small suspicious lesion that had gone unnoticed\\non mammography and ultrasound was detected in the breast MRI scan.\\nSubsequently, a second-look ultrasound was conducted to identify the\\nrelative position of the potential lesion and guide the placement of a\\nlocalization needle, thereby ensuring the precise localization of the\\ntumor during surgery and minimizing the extent of the surgical procedure. This approach not only improved the aesthetic outcome but also reduced the potential harm to the patient.\\nSurgical management remains the primary approach for PDN.\\nTypically, total or skin-sparing mastectomy, with or without breast\\nreconstruction, is performed for PDN associated with multifocal disease.\\nHowever, advances in imaging and patient selection have led to\\nincreased use of breast-conserving therapy for unifocal PDN limited to\\nthe nipple-areolar region. The surgical procedures include central\\nlumpectomy for nipple-areolar complex removal and oncoplastic techniques like Grisotti mastopexy [1,12] and Wise-Pattern mammaplasty\\n[1,13,14] for aesthetic outcomes. Nipple-areolar reconstruction and\\nmedical tattooing may enhance the post-surgery appearance and psychological well-being [1].\\nThe utility of SLNB for PDN currently remains inconclusive. Given\\nthat PDN pathology typically remains localized to the NAC, the propensity for metastatic involvement of the axillary lymph nodes is\\ncomparatively low [7]. In this case, the patient initially underwent BCS\\nwith the removal of the NAC and a small lesion via needle localization.\\nThe decision for this surgical intervention was prompted by the suspicion of a PDN in conjunction with DCIS without clinical evidence of\\nnodal involvement. Postoperative pathology confirmed a diagnosis of\\ninvasive cancer, staged as T1a according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 8th edition staging system. Subsequent SLNB\\nrevealed no nodal metastasis.\\nConsidering oncological outcome, Lin et al. [7] reported that Mastectomy and BCS with radiotherapy have significantly lower local\\nrecurrence rates than BCS alone in patients with PDN with underlying\\ninvasive carcinoma and DCIS. Additionally, a palpable mass, underlying\\ninvasive carcinoma, and a positive lymph node status may lead to a\\npoorer prognosis. Helme et al. [15] reached a similar conclusion,\\nemphasizing that the outcomes obtained after achieving the surgical\\nmargins and administering adjuvant radiotherapy were equivalent to\\nthose obtained after mastectomy. Moreover, a Brazilian study [16]\\nindicated that oncoplastic breast surgery for Paget's disease expands\\ntreatment options without adversely affecting recurrence or survival\\nrates. PDN is a rare and often misdiagnosed breast condition requiring a\\nhigh suspicion index for prompt recognition. Enhancing awareness\\namong the general population and healthcare professionals is vital for\\nearly disease detection and intervention. Given the frequent association\\nwith underlying malignancies, additional diagnostic imaging examinations are imperative. MRI and second-look ultrasound play pivotal roles\\nin uncovering potential lesions, enabling a more precise surgical\\napproach with minimal surgical extension.\"\n","}\n","\n","Row 33:\n","{\n","

bilateral breast lumps. The patient reported that the\\nlumps were painless and had a history of hypertension treated with\\nmedication. There was no known family history of breast cancer. Clinical examination revealed a painless, mobile, solid, well-defined, skin-invasive mass measuring approximately 5 cm in diameter in the left\\nbreast, associated with a left axillary lymph node measuring 1 \\u00d7 2 cm,\\nlimiting mobility. The right breast exhibited a well-defined mass\\nmeasuring 2 \\u00d7 3 cm that was not attached to the skin or chest wall and\\nshowed no skin changes. No right axillary lymphadenopathy was\\ndetected.\\nBreast ultrasonography and chest CT revealed a mass in the left\\nbreast measuring approximately 4.5 \\u00d7 5.3 cm, with irregular shape,\\nnon-circumscribed margin, categorized as BI-RADS 4A; it is remarkable\\nthat there was a macrocalcification present inside the mass, associated\\nwith left axillary lymph node measuring 1.1 \\u00d7 1.9 cm. Other tumor\\nmeasuring 2.5 \\u00d7 2.7 cm was also identified in the right breast categorized as BI-RADS 4A and no right axillary lymphadenopathy was seen. No metastatic lesions were found on chest and abdominal computed\\ntomography scans.\\nThe patient underwent core needle biopsy of the bilateral breast lesions. Pathological examination of the right breast lesion revealed high-grade intraductal carcinoma, while examination of the left breast\\nrevealed a rhomboid malignant lesion with large nuclei and multiple\\nnucleoli, lacking differentiated tubular or squamous epithelium (Fig. 1).\\nImmunohistochemical (IHC) analysis demonstrated negative expression\\nof ER, PR, CD34, and HER2 in the cancer cells, with strong positive\\nreactivity for vimentin and CKA (E1/AE3), combined osseous differentiation image on HE specimen confirming the diagnosis of metaplastic\\ncarcinoma with extensive osseous differentiation. The final diagnosis\\nwas synchronous left breast cancer (cT4bN2M0) and right breast cancer\\n(cTisN0M0) according to the AJCC 2017 TNM staging system.\\nThe patient was initially treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy\\nusing a combination of docetaxel and cyclophosphamide. After the first\\ntwo cycles, the disease showed a partial response, with tumor shrinkage\\nand drying of skin ulceration. However, during the third and fourth\\ncycles, the left breast tumor began to progress and increase in size. The\\ntreatment regimen was subsequently changed, but the patient was isolated for one month due to the COVID-19 pandemic. During this time,\\nthe tumor grew rapidly. Upon returning to the hospital, the left breast\\ntumor had grown significantly, with skin invasion and bleeding fluid\\n(Fig. 2). The patient was referred for surgery due to the large size of the\\ntumor, which made it difficult for her to walk and increased the risk of\\ntumor rupture. A chest CT scan also revealed a huge mass with size\\nexceeding field of view, heterogeneous enhancement, necrosis inside\\nand invading skin, chest wall (Fig. 3A). A solid mass in the lower lobe of\\nright lung suggested metastases (Fig. 3B). The patient underwent toilet\\nmastectomy on the left breast and was subsequently treated with carboplatin chemotherapy x 3 cycles. The disease progressed and the patient was switched to a gemcitabine x 3-cycle chemotherapy regimen.\\nHowever, the disease progressed rapidly, so we decided to transfer the\\npatient to palliative care, and the patient died two months later. \"\n","}\n","\n","Row 34:\n","{\n","    \"created_username\": \"pre_annotation_batch_1\",\n","    \"result\": [\n","        {\n","

of histopathological variants, including low-grade\\nadeno-squamous carcinoma, fibromatosis-like metaplastic carcinoma,\\nspindle cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, metaplastic carcinoma\\nwith heterologous differentiation, and mixed metaplastic carcinoma. These tumors exhibit a germ cell-like phenotype, characterized by positive expression of CD44 and ALDH1 and negative expression of CD24.\\nThey also display features of epithelial-mesenchymal transition, such as\\nincreased expression of ZEB1 and loss of E-cadherin. The pathogenesis of\\nMBC is associated with mutations in the PI3K and RAS pathways, with a\\nhigh frequency of mutations in genes such as TP53, PIK3CA, PTEN, NF1,\\nHRAS, and PIK3R1.\\nInvasive breast cancer with osseous metaplasia is an extremely rare\\nsubtype, accounting for only 0.003\\u20130.12 % of all breast cancer cases\\n[1,3]. The median age at diagnosis ranges from 48 to 59 years, and the\\ntumor typically presents as a rapidly growing mass [7,8]. Despite the\\nlarger tumor size, MBC is less commonly associated with axillary node\\ninvolvement (6 %\\u201326 % of cases) compared to standard invasive breast\\ncancer [9]. MBC commonly metastasizes to the lungs and bone tissue via\\nthe bloodstream [10]. A review of 15 clinical cases, retrieved from\\nPubMed, was conducted and the results are presented in Table 1. The\\nage of the patients ranged from 43 to 77 years, with 7 cases of left-sided\\nbreast tumors and 9 cases of right-sided breast tumors. The mean tumor\\nsize for right breast tumors was 5.6 cm, with the largest tumor\\nmeasuring 20 cm in our case. The majority of cases did not exhibit\\nmetastasis to lymph nodes and the primary treatment modality was\\nsurgery.\\nLymph node metastasis was suggested based on ultrasound imaging\\nand physical examination. The lung is the most common site of metastasis for this histopathology, which differs from other histopathological\\ntypes that commonly metastasize to the bone. MBC has a poorer prognosis than invasive ductal carcinoma, and at the time of diagnosis, the\\ntumor is often large, necessitating neoadjuvant chemotherapy [5].\\nHowever, the response rate to neoadjuvant chemotherapy is poor, with a\\ncomplete response rate of only 0\\u201317 % [5,17\\u201319], much lower than the\\n37 % complete response rate observed in triple-negative invasive ductal\\ncarcinoma [20].\\nIn our case, the patient failed to respond to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and the tumor doubled in size compared to its initial size at\\ndiagnosis. Some studies have shown that MBC is resistant to chemotherapy. For example, a review of records from 46 patients with MBC\\ntreated with systemic therapy in either the neoadjuvant (n = 12) or\\npalliative (n = 6) settings found that 83 % of patients who received\\nneoadjuvant chemotherapy experienced disease progression and no\\npatient responded to anthracycline, vinorelbine, or cyclophosphamide-based regimens [18]. A recent retrospective study of 29 patients with\\nMBC undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy reported a pathologic complete response (pCR) rate of 17 % (5 of 29), which is the highest rate\\nreported for MBC [21]. Another study by Hennessy et al. reported a pCR\\nrate of 10 % for some patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy\\n[22].\\nToday, with the development of science and the birth of many new\\ndrugs such as monoclonal antibodies: trastuzumab and pertuzumab,\\nCDK 4/6 inhibitors, and PARP inhibitors\\u2026 however, for the triple-negative group like our patient, there are very few options for treatment.\\nThe KEYNOTE-522 study demonstrated that the addition of (neo) adjuvant pembrolizumab to a chemotherapy foundation consisting of\\ntaxanes, carboplatin, and anthracyclines in early triple-negative breast\\ncancer was associated with excellent improvement. For 7.2 % pathologic\\ncomplete response rate and 9 % absolute improvement in pathologic-free survival (EFS) [23].\\nThe role of immunotherapy for advanced triple-negative breast\\ncancer has been demonstrated in research in the KEYNOTE-355. In the\\ngroup of patients with CPS-10, adding pembrolizumab to chemotherapy\\nincreased the risk of death by 27 % compared to placebo [24]. However,\\nin Vietnam's economic conditions, the use of immunotherapy drugs still\\nfaces many difficulties due to high treatment costs, and health insurance\\ndoes not cover treatment costs, so patients in clinical cases in our clinic\\nwere not treated with this drug. These findings suggest that the role of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in\\nthis histopathological group is limited and its use should be carefully\\nconsidered. Surgery may be a preferred treatment option for these\\npatients.\"\n","}\n","\n","Row 35:\n","{\n","    \"created_username\": \"pre_annotation_batch_1\",\n","    \"result\": [\n","        {\n","

ultrasound in\\nSeptember 2021 for evaluation of a new palpable mass in the\\nleft breast upper outer quadrant at posterior depth at the site\\nof prior partial mastectomy in 2015. Initial diagnosis of T2N1\\nleft breast invasive ductal carcinoma (ER+, PR+, high Ki67 at\\n35%, HER2 equivocal but not amplified by FISH) in 2015 was\\ntreated with partial mastectomy and sentinel lymph node\\nbiopsy with one positive lymph node and positive surgical\\nmargins, re-excision of margins with final margins negative,\\nadjuvant chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. Reproductive\\nhistory includes menarche at age 13, 5 pregnancies, and 4 live\\nbirths with the first live birth at age 21, and menopause at\\nage 52 years. The patient never had germline genetic testing.\\nTable 1 summarizes the timelines of initial and recent breast\\ncancer diagnosis and treatment. In September 2021, mammography of the left breast demonstrated a high-density irregular mass with microlobulated and\\nspiculated margins with associated areas of coarse, heterogeneous, and dystrophic appearing calcifications in the upper\\nouter quadrant in the posterior third of the breast 11 cm from\\nthe nipple at the site of the clinically palpable mass (Figs. 1\\nand 2). This mass was new when compared with the most recent prior mammogram from 2 years and 10 months previously. Focused left breast ultrasound revealed a 5 cm x 3.8 cm\\nx 2.5 cm irregular mixed echogenicity mass with angular margins and posterior acoustic shadowing at the site of cutaneous\\nlumpectomy scar and area of palpable mass at 2:00 11 cm\\nfrom the nipple (Fig. 3). Left axillary ultrasound demonstrated\\na normal axillary lymph node. Ultrasound-guided core needle\\nbiopsy demonstrated an invasive high-grade malignant neoplasm consisting of spindled epithelioid cells with invasion\\ninto skeletal muscle (Fig. 4). Rare clusters of glandular elements were identified, as well as areas of eosinophilic osteoid\\nwith areas of mineralizing osteoid, consistent with osteosarcoma. A cytokeratin AE1/AE3 immunostain demonstrated the\\nglandular elements were positive, while the high-grade undifferentiated malignant cells, as well as the osteosarcomatous\\nelements, were negative. Breast prognostic markers revealed\\nthat the neoplastic cells were ER-, PR-, HER2-, with high Ki67\\nat 70%. These features were reported as consistent with high-grade metaplastic transformation of the patient\\u2019s prior breast\\ncarcinoma in 2015.\\nBreast MRI with contrast was ordered but not obtained. A\\nwhole body F18-FDG PET/CT without contrast was performed\\nfor staging in October 2021 and demonstrated a multilobulated intensely FDG avid mass in the left upper outer breast\\nwith invasion of the left pectoralis major muscle and abutment of the left pectoralis minor muscle (Figs. 5A and B). The\\nmass measured approximately 6.6 cm x 5.7 cm with coarse\\ncalcifications and biopsy clip (SUV max 8.8). Few sub-6 mm\\nnodes in the left axilla were noted adjacent to the mass with\\nminimal FDG uptake (SUV max up to 0.9), as well as an indeterminate 1.5 cm non-FDG avid right apical ground glass nodule,\\ninterpreted as inflammatory although adenocarcinoma in situ\\nwas a consideration. A few additional sub-6 mm pulmonary\\nnodules/micronodules were also seen (Figs. 6A and B). Correlation with prior outside imaging was recommended if available\\nversus attention to short-term follow-up imaging.

Metaplastic breast carcinoma\\n(MBC) is a heterogeneous group of indolent to highly aggressive tumors that consists of epithelial and non-glandular elements such as matrix-production, spindle cell morphology,\\nsquamous differentiation, or heterologous differentiation (ie,\\nosseous or chondroid) [3]. Of the breast carcinoma subtypes,\\nMBC accounts for less than 1%-5% of all cases of invasive\\nbreast cancer. In contrast to low-grade variants like fibromatosis-like\\nmetaplastic carcinoma, a subset of these rare tumors is\\nhighly aggressive with poor prognosis and high mortality rate\\n[6,7]. MBC is usually triple negative and in general portends\\na worse prognosis and 5-year survival than triple-negative\\nbreast carcinomas without metaplastic features [5,8]. Osseous\\nand sarcomatous differentiation are the rarest mesenchymal subtypes of MBC and are typically poorly differentiated\\n[9] with osteosarcomatous differentiation accounting for between 0.003% and 0.12% of all breast cancer cases [10,11].\\nWe present a case of a 61-year-old female with a history of\\npreviously treated left invasive ductal carcinoma with subsequent diagnosis of a triple negative metaplastic left breast carcinoma with osteosarcomatous differentiation approximately 7 years after an initial breast cancer diagnosis. Metaplastic breast carcinoma often clinically presents as a\\nlarge palpable mass ranging from 1 to 21 cm, [3]. which was\\nobserved in this case. The maximum dimension of the mass\\nwas 7.2 cm by surgical pathology. Other reports of MBC describe mass measurements at initial presentation as greater\\nthan 2 cm [10\\u201318]. Many cases of MBC also present clinically\\nas a rapidly growing mass [16,19]. MBC can also present with\\npain [10] as in this case.\\nThe imaging appearance of MBC is variable on mammography and ultrasound. Both benign and malignant imaging features are described in the literature. A retrospective\\nanalysis comparing imaging features of 43 patients with\\nMBC matched by tumor stage with 43 patients with ductal carcinoma of the breast found that MBC on mammography was less frequently irregular in shape and less often showed microlobulated or spiculated margins or calcifications\\nthan ductal carcinoma [20]. MBCs can also present with circumscribed margins and posterior acoustic enhancement on\\nultrasound [19].\\nIn a retrospective single-institution review of 72 cases of\\nMBC by Yoon et al [12], MBC was more often an oval or round\\nmass with noncircumscribed margins without calcifications\\non mammography. Similarly, in a retrospective review of 65\\ncases of MBC by Aydin et al [5] MBC was most commonly\\npresented as a microlobulated, round, high-density mass on\\nmammography without calcifications. In a smaller retrospective review, Jia et al [13] reported that on mammography, MBC\\nusually demonstrated an oval shape, indistinct mass margin,\\nand high density without associated calcifications.\\nLike the majority of cases of MBC reviewed in Yoon et al\\n[12], Aydin et al [5], and Jia et al [13] mass margin on mammography and ultrasound in our case was not circumscribed. Similar to Aydin et al [5] and Jia et al [13] the mass was high density. Unlike Yoon et al, [12] Aydin et al [5], and Jia et al [13] the\\nmass in our case was irregular with associated calcifications\\non mammography. Mass shape and margin, as well as associated features on mammography such as calcifications, could\\nbe partially confounded in our case by the mass location at a\\nsite of prior breast conservation therapy.\\nOn ultrasound, Yoon et al [12] described most often a complex or hypoechoic appearance for MBC while Aydin et al\\n[5] and Donato et al [18] reported predominantly a hypoechoic\\nor heterogeneous internal echotexture. The internal echotexture of the mass in our case was heterogeneous. The nonhomogeneous internal echotexture on ultrasound likely reflects\\nthe intertumoral heterogeneity seen in pathology due to internal hemorrhage and necrosis [16,18].\\nRegarding posterior features on ultrasound, Yoon et al\\n[12] and Donato et al [18] report posterior acoustic enhancement in the majority of their cases while approximately 70%\\nof cases in Aydin et al [5] showed no posterior features. In a\\nsmaller retrospective review, Lai et al [19] also described posterior acoustic enhancement as a common sonographic feature in MBC positing tumor hypercellularity as the etiology. Although posterior acoustic enhancement is a more commonly\\nobserved ultrasound feature in MBC, [7] both the calcifications\\nwithin the mass or the IDC component could have contributed\\nto the posterior acoustic shadowing in our case. Furthermore,\\ndifferences in ultrasound equipment or software algorithms at various institutions could impact the appearance of posterior features.\"\n","}\n","\n","Row 37:\n","{\n","    \"created_username\": \"pre_annotation_batch_1\",\n","    \"result\": [\n","        {\n","            \"from_name\": \"label\",\n","            \"id\": \"lRldMh23m9\",\n","            \"source\": \"$text\",\n","            \"to_name\": \"text\",\n","            \"type\": \"labels\",\n","            \"value\": {\n","                \"end\": 2254,\n","                \"labels\": [\n","                    \"Biomarker_Result\"\n","                ],\n","                \"start\": 2245,\n","                \"text\": \"mutations\"\n","            }\n","        },\n","        {\n","            \"from_name\": \"label\",\n","            \"id\": \"MXNHNb0ySM\",\n","            \"source\": \"$text\",\n","            \"to_name\": \"text\",\n","            \"type\": \"labels\",\n","            \"value\": {\n","                \"end\": 2858,\n","                \"labels\": [\n","                    \"Biomarker\"\n","                ],\n","                \"start\": 2841,\n","                \"text\": \"estrogen receptor\"\n","            }\n","        },\n","        {\n","            \"from_name\": \"label\",\n","            \"id\": \"7R810Ck1yc\",\n","            \"source\": \"$text\",\n","            \"to_name\": \"text\",\n","            \"type\": \"labels\",\n","            \"value\": {\n","                \"end\": 2862,\n","                \"labels\": [\n","                    \"Biomarker\"\n","                ],\n","                \"start\": 2860,\n","                \"text\": \"ER\"\n","            }\n","        },\n","        {\n","            \"from_name\": \"label\",\n","            \"id\": \"vaWcyOwQqr\",\n","            \"source\": \"$text\",\n","            \"to_name\": \"text\",\n","            \"type\": \"labels\",\n","            \"value\": {\n","                \"end\": 3705,\n","                \"labels\": [\n","                    \"Biomarker_Result\"\n","                ],\n","                \"start\": 3690,\n","                \"text\": \"triple negative\"\n","            }\n","        },\n","        {\n","            \"from_name\": \"label\",\n","            \"id\": \"k8cOTOTByA\",\n","            \"source\": \"$text\",\n","            \"to_name\": \"text\",\n","            \"type\": \"labels\",\n","            \"value\": {\n","                \"end\": 4529,\n","                \"labels\": [\n","                    \"Body_Site\"\n","                ],\n","                \"start\": 4525,\n","                \"text\": \"skin\"\n","            }\n","        },\n","        {\n","            \"from_name\": \"label\",\n","            \"id\": \"ArYh9Pim3S\",\n","            \"source\": \"$text\",\n","            \"to_name\": \"text\",\n","            \"type\": \"labels\",\n","            \"value\": {\n","                \"end\": 4544,\n","                \"labels\": [\n","                    \"Body_Site\"\n","                ],\n","                \"start\": 4534,\n","                \"text\": \"chest wall\"\n","            }\n","        },\n","        {\n","            \"from_name\": \"label\",\n","            \"id\": \"92NMXOwFWO\",\n","            \"source\": \"$text\",\n","            \"to_name\": \"text\",\n","            \"type\": \"labels\",\n","            \"value\": {\n","                \"end\": 5770,\n","                \"labels\": [\n","                    \"Body_Site\"\n","                ],\n","                \"start\": 5764,\n","                \"text\": \"breast\"\n","            }\n","        }\n","    ]\n","}\n","{\n","    \"title\": \"batch_1\",\n","    \"text\": \"Calcifications\\nCalcifications associated with the MBC in this case appeared coarse, coarse heterogeneous, and dystrophic. Although coarse and dystrophic calcifications are usually considered benign descriptors for calcifications on mammography [21], their association with a new mass, as in this case,\\nwould typically warrant further diagnostic evaluation including ultrasound.\\nIn Yoon et al [12], less than one-third of the masses (31.3%)\\ndemonstrated calcifications on imaging with calcification\\nmorphology not specified. Similarly, Aydin et al [5] demonstrated associated calcifications by mammography in 33% of\\ncases of MBC, with predominantly amorphous calcifications,\\nfine pleomorphic, fine linear, and lastly coarse heterogeneous\\nin descending order of frequency. Jia et al [13] reported MBC in\\nassociation with calcifications on mammography in only 3 of\\n13 cases and described calcifications as pleomorphic, coarse\\nheterogeneous, and fine linear branching. In another case series, calcifications were present on mammography in 3 of 22\\ncases and described as pleomorphic [14]. Coarse calcifications\\nwere reported in a case of MBC with osseous differentiation,\\n[17]. pleomorphic calcifications were described in a case of\\nMBC with osteoblastic differentiation, [10] and \\u201cosseous matrix\\u201d was described in a case of malignant phyllodes with osteosarcomatous differentiation with subsequent diagnosis of\\ninvasive ductal carcinoma [11] Lai et al [19] also described calcifications in MBC as typically larger than those seen in DCIS,\\nwhich was seen in our case report.\\nPathology findings\\nMetaplastic breast carcinoma is a heterogeneous group of malignant neoplasms of the breast comprised of malignant invasive breast carcinoma and an admixed non-gland-forming\\ncomponent [3]. Less than 5% of breast carcinomas demonstrate metaplastic pathology, with subtype differentiation\\nincluding squamous, spindle, matrix-producing, and those\\ndemonstrating frank heterologous sarcomatous differentiation [3,9]. Heterologous sarcomatous differentiation is the\\nleast common subtype of metaplastic breast carcinoma, in\\nwhich case the sarcomatous component is typically high-grade and aggressive [9]. Frequently, the tumors will not\\ndemonstrate KIT activating mutations, but upregulation of\\nEGFR copies [3]. Typically, this group is triple-negative for\\nER/PR/HER2. Clinical course\\nGiven the low rate at which metaplastic cancers of the breast\\nare diagnosed, there is little evidence available to guide the\\nmost appropriate and effective management for patients with\\nthis diagnosis. Overall survival and disease-free survival in patients with MBC are significantly less when compared to the\\nmore common adenocarcinomas of the breast [6] including\\ntriple-negative invasive ductal carcinoma [8]. Recurrence rate\\nis typically influenced by stage at diagnosis, estrogen receptor\\n(ER) status, and adjuvant therapy [22]. With MBC, there is high\\nrisk for recurrence after initial treatment, with little evidence\\nto support the use of selective estrogen receptor modulators\\nor aromatase inhibitors after initial treatment [6]. The patient\\nin this case not only developed MBC after an initial diagnosis\\nof invasive breast carcinoma, but also experienced recurrence\\nafter surgical management of MBC while maintaining therapy\\nwith an aromatase inhibitor.\\nMoreover, it is possible that each subtype of metaplastic\\ncarcinoma of the breast responds uniquely to the treatments\\ncurrently available. Recently, a small case series demonstrated\\nthe use of antiprogrammed death ligand 1 immunomodulation in metaplastic breast carcinoma, with limited response to\\ntreatment in 3 out of the 5 patients evaluated, 2 of which were\\ntriple negative on immunohistochemistry [23]. This demonstrates a need to further understand this disease process to\\nimprove overall prognosis by identifying effective treatment\\noptions.\\nConsidering the rarity and highly aggressive nature of\\nmetaplastic breast carcinoma with osteosarcomatous differentiation, contributing additional case reports to the literature facilitates diagnostic acumen. A recent study comparing\\nclinical and pathological features between MBC and nonspecific invasive breast carcinoma (NSIBC) demonstrated a significantly greater risk of higher clinical stage of disease at diagnosis of MBC when compared to NSIBC [24]. In that study,\\nMBC was significantly more often triple negative on immunohistochemistry, an important factor that limits treatment options for patients with MBC. Moreover, in that analysis, skin\\nand chest wall invasion was more often typically seen in MBC\\nthan in NSIBC, as was observed in this case, which can contribute to a more advanced stage at clinical presentation for\\nMBC.\\nAggregating cases to describe the clinicopathological features of MBC could also further support investigations\\ninto various treatment options for a rare but often lethal disease. A large case series with less than 3% of patients with\\nhistopathology results of rare invasive breast cancer types determined that for limited disease (breast carcinoma with tumors less than 4 cm greatest dimension) and extensive disease (breast carcinoma with tumors greater than 4 cm), cumulative disease specific survival at 5 years was above 90%\\nand between 80% and 90%, respectively [25]. This exceeds the\\n5-year survival rate with MBC estimated at 57.7% in one retrospective review. Breast cancer has the highest incidence and the second largest\\nmortality rate of all cancers affecting women. Metaplastic\\nbreast carcinoma, although a rare subtype, includes highly aggressive tumors with poor prognosis when compared to the\\nmore common invasive breast carcinomas of no special type\\nand invasive lobular carcinoma. When evaluating a new, large,\\nor rapidly growing breast mass with or without benign appearing calcifications, especially at a site of prior lumpectomy,\\nrare but aggressive histopathologies like MBC should be considered and prompt core needle biopsy performed with careful radiology-pathology correlation. There is little evidence\\nregarding the most effective treatment of MBC. \"\n","}\n","\n","Row 38:\n","{\n","    \"created_username\": \"pre_annotation_batch_1\",\n","    \"result\": [\n","

\"batch_1\",\n","    \"text\": \"A 55-year-old lady presented to the hospital in June 2010 as a\\nreferred case of locally advanced breast cancer of left breast (T4bN1M0).\\nShe had a fungating mass with purulent discharge. Biopsy revealed\\nmucinous carcinoma with micropapillary features, grade I (Nottingham\\nmodification of Bloom-Richardson system score 5). On IHC, ER and PR\\nwas positive (100% and 60% respectively with strong intensity) while\\nHER2 was equivocal (2+ ) but eventually FISH amplified (HER2:CEP17\\nratio of 2.5; mean Her2 copy number 4.5) (Fig. 1). She was advised a\\ncombination chemotherapy (TCH: Taxotere, Carboplatin, Herceptin).\\nShe did not opt for trastuzumab (Herceptin) in view of logistic reasons.\\nShe was given NACT (Docetaxel and Epirubicin) from July to September\\n2010 (3 cycles), after which clinicoradiological re-evaluation revealed\\nprogressive disease in the breast mass and multiple subcutaneous nodules in the left breast. A surgical consultation was sought and surgery\\nwas denied. She was started on local radiotherapy to the left breast (45\\nGy;20 fractions) during the period September to November 2010. Post\\nradiation, the patient showed stable disease. Post radiotherapy, she was\\nstarted on hormonal therapy with exemestane. She showed a phenomenal clinicoradiological response after completion of radiotherapy on\\nexemestane. Mammogram after 27 months showed no evidence of disease with the patient still being on exemestane.\\nOn regular clinicoradiological follow up for the next 7 years, she was\\nfree of disease till June 2018 and was on hormone therapy. She then\\ndefaulted for follow up and presented in December 2019 with lump in\\nthe right breast which was biopsied and reported as Invasive ductal\\ncarcinoma-No special type (IDC-NST) type [ER positive (60%, moderate\\nintensity); PR positive (40%, moderate intensity)]. HER2 was equivocal\\non IHC and subsequently FISH amplified (HER2/CEP 17 ratio: 2.7; mean\\nHer2 copy number 4.9) (Fig. 2) and Ki-67 was also high (35\\u201340%).\\nSubsequent PET/CT revealed metabolically active right breast lesion\\nwith ipsilateral axillary lymph node, cervical, supraclavicular and\\nmediastinal lymph nodes. EBUS guided FNAC from mediastinal lymph\\nnodes was positive (metastatic poorly differentiated carcinoma) and was suggestive of metastatic IDC-NST from the right breast. The case was\\ndiscussed in multispeciality tumor board and surgical option was ruled\\nout and she was advised palliative chemotherapy with paclitaxel and\\ntrastuzumab but the patient was lost to follow up. MCB are low grade tumors with low rates of local and distant metastases and good prognosis as compared to IDC-NST than other invasive\\ncancers. Pure MCB are described for the tumors with at least 90% of\\nmucinous components. It is typically characterized by ER+/PR+/HER2-\\nimmunophenotype [1,3\\u20135] and show low genomic instability and rare\\nrecurrent oncogene amplifications. Previous studies have suggested that\\nHER2 positivity and high Ki67 levels are associated with more aggressive behavior in MCB [4,6,7]. Barbashina et al. [8] analysed 15 cases of\\nMucinous micropapillary carcinoma of the breast. They found HER2\\npositivity in 20% while p53 positivity was seen in 23% of the cases. On\\ncomparison, none of the pure MCB (24 cases) showed HER2 or P53\\npositivity. The authors concluded that micropapillary pattern in MCB is\\nrare, and is associated with aggressive clinical course.\\nKim et al. [2] have evaluated the significance of micropapillary\\npattern in pure MCB and compared it with pure MCB without micropapillary pattern, invasive micropapillary carcinoma of breast (IMCB)\\nand with invasive ductal and micropapillary carcinoma of breast\\n(IDMCB). In comparison to IMCB and IDMCB, the MCB with micropapillary pattern was associated with lower frequency of ER and PR\\nnegativity (p = .04) and HER2 positivity (p = .01). In addition, the\\nnuclear grade and mitotic rate were also lower in MCB with micropapillary pattern. Their results suggested that MCB with micropapillary\\npattern exhibits clinical behavior and aggressiveness intermediate to\\nthat of pure MCB and IMCB.\\nPajera et al. [9] evaluated the genetic alterations underpinning the MCB with micropapillary pattern and found heterogeneity at genetic\\nlevel in these histological type. They found some tumor showing somatic\\ngenetic alterations similar to that of pure MCB while others resemble\\nIMCB at the genetic level.\\nIn the presented case, surgical intervention was not offered due to\\nthe advanced stage of the disease, however, in our case, the patient was\\nput on NACT and additional trastuzumab was suggested but patient\\nrefused due to logistic reason. Subsequently on progression of disease,\\nthe patient was subjected to radiation therapy followed by hormonal\\ntherapy which led to complete clinicoradiological response. The patient\\nwas on regular follow up with no evidence of disease for a period of next\\nseven years on hormonal therapy. Subsequently after one year patient\\npresented with lump in the right breast (contralateral), the biopsy\\nrevealed IDC-NST with ER positive and HER2 positive. The right breast\\ncarcinoma was considered as a second primary in view of occurrence\\nafter 8 years and with different histology.\\nTo conclude, this case report highlights an unusual report of\\nadvanced stage HER2 + MCB with micropapillary pattern who has\\nshown astounding effect with radiation and hormonal therapy without\\ntrastuzumab and remained in remission for eight years and eventually\\ndeveloped contralateral breast HER2 positive IDC-NST.\"\n","}\n","\n","Row 39:\n","{\n","    \"created_username\": \"pre_annotation_batch_1\",\n","    \"result\": [\n","        {\n","

\"batch_1\",\n","    \"text\": \"An 87-year-old woman presented with a rapidly enlarging\\ntumor of the right breast over the course of a few weeks. Her past\\nmedical history was significant for hyperlipidemia, but she had no\\nhistory of malignancy or thoracic injury. Before three weeks ago\\nshe did not realize the breast tumor at all, and she had used no\\ndrugs with anticoagulants or anti-platelets. Physical examination\\nshowed a tumor in the outer area of the right breast, measuring\\napproximately 10 \\u00d7 10 cm (Fig. 1). Laboratory data revealed mild\\nanemia (hemoglobin level 10.3 g/dL), and elevated levels of carcinoembryonic antigen (8.0 ng/mL) and carbohydrate antigen 15-3\\n(40.9 U/mL). Ultrasonography showed a 15 \\u00d7 12 cm tumor consisting of solid and cystic components with polygonal and well defined but rough borders (Fig. 2). Parenchymal components showed mixed\\necogenicity. Cystic lesion showed a fluid\\u2013fluid level, suspicious\\nof intracystic hemorrhage. Enlarged axillary lymph node was not\\nidentified. Mammography was not performed because of the size of\\ntumor and suspicion of intratumor hemorrhage. Computed tomography of the chest revealed a giant tumor located on the right chest\\nwall, with heterogeneous parenchymal components and several\\ncystic lesions (Fig. 3). Fine-needle aspiration of the cystic lesion\\nwas performed, and 300 mL of old blood was drained. Core needle biopsy of the tumor was performed, but the specimen showed\\nno malignant findings. Four days later, urgent mastectomy was\\nperformed because of rapid tumor enlargement complicated by\\nhemorrhage. Fascia of pectoralis major was removed with the\\ntumor, and lymph node dissection was not performed because of\\nFig. 4. The histopathological specimen showing mucus production and hemorrhage\\nin the cyst lumen and around the alveolar structures. The inset image shows the\\nmicropapillary components consisting of small, free clusters of tumor cells in the\\nlumen.\\nno lymph node swelling. The skin was directly sutured because it\\nhad sufficient extensibility.\\nMacroscopically, the tumor was 14 \\u00d7 12 \\u00d7 6 cm in size, and consisted of a combination of solid lesions and multi-lobulated cysts.\\nMicroscopical examination revealed mucus production and hemorrhage in the cyst lumen and around the alveolar structures. The\\ntumor cells were growing in cribriform, tubular, papillary, and\\nsolid alveolar patterns. In some parts of the lumen, micropapillary components consisting of small, free clusters of tumor cells\\nwere observed (Fig. 4). Histopathological diagnosis confirmed an\\ninvasive ductal carcinoma composed of a papillotubular carcinoma\\nwith an IMPC component. The margin of the resected specimen was\\nfree from cancer cells, and no filtration was observed with the fascia. Tumor cells were negative for the estrogen receptor (ER) and\\nprogesterone receptor (PgR), and the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) score was 2+. Ki-67 proliferation index was\\n22%. The patient\\u2019s postoperative course was uneventful and she was\\ndischarged on the eighth postoperative day. She refused all adjuvant treatments with hormone therapy and radiation therapy. Ten\\nmonths later, right axillary lymph node swelling was found, and\\nshe was underwent lymph node dissection. She has remained free\\nfrom relapse for one year after the second operation. A rapidly enlarging breast tumor is clinically rare, and more\\nlikely to be a phyllodes tumor rather than a breast carcinoma. IMPC is a distinct histological sub-type of breast carcinoma\\nthat was initially described by Fisher et al. [2] in 1980. Morphologically, this tumor is characterized by delicate pseudopapillary\\nstructures that lack fibrovascular cores and float freely in empty,\\nclear spaces formed by a stromal, fibrocollagenous, sponge-like\\nnetwork\\u2014a pattern that mimics extensive lymphatic permeation\\n[5]. IMPC is associated with a high incidence of axillary lymph node\\nmetastases, frequent local recurrence, and a poor clinical outcome\\n[6]. Shi et al. reported that overall survival and recurrence free survival were poorer in the IMPC group than in the invasive ductal\\ncarcinoma(IDC) group [7], and Chen et al. found that IMPC patients\\nhave poorer recurrence-free survival and loco-regional recurrence-free survival than IDC patients [8].\\nPathologically, a pure IMPC is rare, and the amount of micropapillary architecture in a tumor required for the diagnosis of IMPC has\\nnot yet been well established [9]. The 2003 World Health Organization classification of breast tumors listed IMPC as a subtype of\\ninvasive carcinoma; however, no specific percentage of the IMPC\\ncomponent within the breast tumor has been proposed as a criterion for the IMPC diagnosis [6,10].\\nBreast cancer has been characterized by 5 intrinsic molecular\\nsubtypes (luminal A, luminal B, HER2-enriched, Basal, and Normal-like) [11]. Generally, ER and PgR positive status is associated with\\nan improved differentiation of tumors and improved clinical outcome [9]. HER2 over-expression is known to have a poor prognosis\\nin breast tumors [12]. Although IMPC has an aggressive behavior,\\nmany studies have reported that IMPC is characterized by higher\\nrates of ER and PgR expression compared to other breast cancer\\ntypes [6\\u201310]. However, this is controversial as other reports have\\nmentioned a low rate of ER expression in IMPC [13]. In our case, the\\ntumor was negative for the ER and PgR receptors, and positive for\\nHER2. Although our case was different from more frequent IMPC\\nintrinsic type, the examined tumor had an aggressive behavior as it\\nwas HER2-enriched. The exact etiology of intratumoral hemorrhage\\nis unknown, but the malignant behavior of the IMPC component is\\nconsidered to be the cause of a rapid tumor growth that is enhanced\\nby hemorrhage with in the tumor. \"\n","}\n","\n","Row 40:\n","{\n","    \"created_username\": \"pre_annotation_batch_1\",\n","    \"result\": [\n","        {\n","            \"from_name\": \"label\",\n","

Upon physical examination, the mass measured approximately 2.0 x 1.0\\ncm, displays good mobility, and lacks any adhesion to the surrounding tissues. The patient had\\npreviously undergone a Coarse Needle Biopsy (CNB) at our hospital six months ago, confirming\\nthe diagnosis of ACC of the breast.. Immunohistochemical staining indicated negative for ER, PR\\nand Her-2, and exhibiting a Ki-67 proliferation index of 10%. However, the patient refused further\\ntreatment after the biopsy confirmed the diagnosis. Seven months later, the patient returned to our\\nhospital for a follow-up examination and a repeat breast Doppler ultrasound revealed a hypoechoic\\nshadow measuring 1.6 x 1.1cm (Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System category(BI-RADS):\\n4c), characterized by irregular morphology, parallel growth, and poorly defined margins (Fig. 1).\\nNo significant abnormalities were observed in the right breast and lymph node of bilateral axillae. Subsequently, the patient underwent a localized enlarged mastectomy and sentinel node biopsy.\\nPostoperative histopathological examination confirmed the presence of ACC in the left breast. Notably, there was no evidence of nerve invasion or intravascular cancerous embolus, and\\ncancerous tissue was absent from the upper, lower, inner, outer, basal, and skin margins. Furthermore,\\nno metastasis was detected in the sentinel lymph nodes. Immunohistochemical staining results\\ndemonstrated negative expression for ER, PR, and Her-2, while exhibiting positive expression for\\nCK5/6, CK7, CK8/18, CD117, P63, and PAS. Ki-67 staining indicated a 40% positivity rate, in\\ncontrast to the 10% recorded six months earlier. The final pathological staging, as per the American\\nJoint Committee on Cancer (AJCC), was determined as pT2N0. We elucidated to the patient that chemotherapy would not confer enhanced survival advantages\\nand would instead entail corresponding adverse effects. Considering her youth, the patient persisted\\nin opting for chemotherapy and elected to undergo the treatment at a different medical facility. She\\nunderwent 8 cycles of intravenous chemotherapy (EC-T: epirubicin cyclophosphamide sequential\\ndocetaxel) at other hospital post-operation. Six months after sugery, she underwent a follow-up MRI scan at our institution. The MRI revealed post-operative changes in the left breast following breast-\\nconserving surgery, with no abnormalities detected in the right breast or axillary lymph nodes (Fig.\\n3). Subsequently, she received adjuvant postoperative radiotherapy with the regimen of Planning\\nTarget Volume\\uff08PTV\\uff09: 40Gy/15F for the whole breast irradiation and 48Gy/15F for Planning\\nGross Tumor Volume\\uff08PGTV\\uff09. During this period, the patient exhibited a slightly decreased\\nleukocyte count (2.95\\u00d710^9/L) on blood analysis, and no other significant discomforts were\\nreported. This indicates that the patient's CTCAE\\uff08Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse\\nEvents\\uff09 grading was assessed as grade 1 and no specific intervention was required. Subsequently, the patient underwent an additional 4-month follow-up period. A breast color\\nDoppler ultrasound was performed, indicating no significant bilateral breast abnormalities (BI-\\nRADS category 1) (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, there were no discernible abnormalities detected in the\\nbilateral supraclavicular and infraclavicular lymph nodes. Despite having informed the patient that\\nctDNA has certain significance in monitoring tumor recurrence and metastasis, its value in guiding\\nclinical treatment is quite limited. The patient has chosen to proceed with the test on her own. The\\nctDNA results suggest a germline FANCL gene mutation. This finding suggests a potential susceptibility to therapies with Olaparib (Grade C: the evidence levels for mutation-drug\\nsensitivity(Li et al., 2017)) and Talazoparib (Grade C). Notably, the ctDNA results indicated\\npotential responsiveness to targeted therapeutic agents. Some studies have shown that mutations in\\nFANCL gene promote tumor growth and make tumor cells resistant to cisplatin(Yuan et al., 2012).\\nHowever, considering the early stage of ACC and the favorable prognosis associated with complete\\nsurgical resection, the patient was advised to continue with regular follow-ups.\"\n","}\n","\n","Row 41:\n","{\n","    \"created_username\":

adenoid\\ncystic carcinomas are low grade and triple-negative by histology. Unlike other triple-negative breast\\ncarcinomas, ACC of the breast generally have a low propensity for recurrence and metastasis, with\\ncomplete surgical excision alone being curative in most circumstances in early-stage disease. ACC of the breast is a relatively rare pathological type. The main features of this case include\\na particularly slow course, with the appearance of a left breast mass lasting for eight years before\\ndiagnosis and treatment. Furthermore, surgery was not performed until six months after pathological\\ndiagnosis, but there was no evidence of local lymph node or distant metastasis. This indicates that\\nACC is a relatively indolent tumor, with slow growth. This case report may enrich the understanding\\nof this rare disease and provide specific diagnostic and therapeutic ideas. It offers viable options for\\nsubsequent development of standardized treatment and has a certain clinical guidance value. ACC primarily presents in the salivary glands but can also manifest in other exocrine glands,\\nsuch as the breast. ACC of the breast represents a rare subtype of invasive breast carcinoma, with a\\nreported incidence of less than 0.1% (Ghabach et al., 2010). Typically, the median age of individuals\\ndiagnosed with ACC typically falls within the range of 50 to 65 years, predominantly observed in\\npostmenopausal women, albeit occasional cases have been documented in men and younger\\nwomen(Wan et al., 2022, Mackenzie and Douglas, 2020, Kim et al., 2014, Tang et al., 2015).\\nGhabach et al. reported that among women aged 50 years or older, the incidence of breast ACC was\\n11 times higher compared to younger counterparts (<50 years) (age \\u226550 years: incidence rate ratio\\n[IRR] = 11.02, 95% confidence intervals [CI] = 8.31 to 14.87; age <50 years: [IRR]=1.00)(Ghabach\\net al., 2010). Several factors have been associated with the development of ACC, including exposure\\nto ionizing radiation, low dietary intake of vitamin C, and a history of breast cancer in women(Cant\\u00f9,\\n2021). Nonetheless, the impact of smoking and alcohol consumption on ACC remains uncertain due\\nto insufficient evidence(Cant\\u00f9, 2021).\\n2 Clinical phenotypes and characteristics\\nThe predominant anatomical localization of ACC was observed within the upper outer\\nquadrants of the breast, with no statistically significant variance in incidence rates noted between\\nleft-sided and right-sided breast cancer presentations (IRR = 1.06, 95% CI = 0.85 to 1.32)(Ghabach\\net al., 2010). Additionally, there were no documented instances of bilateral breast ACC. Furthermore,\\n95% of cases presented at a localized stage (n = 320; incidence rate [IR] = 0.87), while occurrences\\nof regional and distant disease manifestations were infrequent(Ghabach et al., 2010).\\nAccording to the 5th edition of the WHO Classification of Breast Tumors, breast ACC is\\nclassified as a rare salivary gland-type tumor among the epithelial tumors of the breast(Foschini et\\nal., 2019). These tumors are further classified as classic, solid basaloid and ACC with high-grade\\ntransformation(Foschini et al., 2019). Despite absence of ER, PR (IR = 0.56, n = 128)(Ghabach et\\nal., 2010), and Her-2, ACC of the breast is considered an indolent malignancy typically associated\\nwith a favorable prognosis. Clinically, it presents as a painless solitary mass, frequently situated\\nnear the areola, with infrequent nipple discharge. Invasion into surrounding tissues is rare, and instances of in situ recurrence, regional lymph node metastasis, and distant metastasis following\\ntumor resection are infrequent. The reported survival rates for ACC at 5 years, 10 years, and 15\\nyears are 95.5%, 93.5%, and 91%, respectively(Ghabach et al., 2010).\\n3 Treatment and prognosis\\n3.1 surgical treatment\\nACC can be classified based on the percentage of the solid/basaloid component within the\\nentire tumor. Grade I ACC exhibits no solid component, Grade II ACC has less than 30% solid\\ncomponent, and Grade III ACC contains over 30% solid component. Based on this classification,\\nsome experts suggest varying surgical procedures depending on the grade. Specifically, local\\nexcision or simple mastectomy is recommended for Grade I and Grade II ACC, respectively.\\nConversely, mastectomy with axillary dissection is advised for Grade III ACC. (Canyilmaz et al.,\\n2014, Foschini et al., 2016, Ro et al., 1987). However, some studies suggest that axillary dissection\\nmay not be warranted unless nodal metastasis is present (Khanfir et al., 2012, Treitl et al., 2018, W.\\nZhang et al., 2021, Thompson et al., 2011). In situations where the tumor exceeds 3 cm,\\ndemonstrates high-grade features, or contains other invasive breast cancer subtypes, sentinel lymph\\nnode sampling can be performed (Boujelbene et al., 2012b). Welsh et al. conducted a research\\nshowing that preoperative axillary ultrasound with fine needle aspiration (FNA) of suspicious nodes\\naccurately predicted pathologic nodal stage, suggesting that axillary surgery might be safely omitted\\nin patients with pure ACC and a clinically negative axilla(Welsh et al., 2017). Additionally, Arpino\\nG et al. conducted a study on 28 cases of ACC extracted from 50,000 cases of breast cancer. They\\nsuggested that axillary lymph node dissection does not provide benefits and is typically not\\nrecommended for ACC patients (Arpino et al., 2002).\\n3.2 Radiotherapy\\nRadiotherapy(RT) should be performed following lumpectomy, regardless of surgical\\nmargins(Khanfir et al., 2012), as it has been found to be a strong prognostic determinant for both\\noverall and cause-specific survival(McClenathan and de la Roza, 2002). Nonetheless, Zhang et al.\\nobserved that adjuvant RT post-surgery significantly improved overall survival(OS) in the high-risk subgroup but conferred negligible benefits in the low-risk subgroup (Zhang et al., 2022),\\nsuggesting that low-risk patients may be able to exempt from postoperative RT(Zhang et al., 2022).\\nIn the study by Sun et al., the results showed that lumpectomy with adjuvant radiation therapy was\\nan independent prognostic factor for cause-specific survival and OS(Sun et al., 2017). Notably,\\npatients receiving this combined treatment exhibited superior survival outcomes compared to those\\nundergoing lumpectomy alone or mastectomy alone.\\n3.3 Adjuvant therapy\\nAdjuvant therapy is still controversial. A recent study reported that Lenvatinib highlights the\\npromising anti-tumor efficacy of Lenvatinib in Phase II trials involving patients with metastatic\\nACCs (Tchekmedyian et al., 2019). Despite this, conventional chemotherapy approaches, whether\\nutilizing single-drug or combination regimens, have demonstrated limited effectiveness against the\\nmajority of salivary gland ACCs (Dodd and Slevin, 2006). Additionally, the results of a network\\nmeta-analysis showed that chemotherapy could not significantly improve the OS and breast cancer-\\nspecific survival among patients with hormone receptor-positive/lymph node-negative. However, Grabenstetter et al. presented the clinical and pathologic findings of a patient with\\nSB-ACC (solid basaloid) who was treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy and achieved a\\nremarkable pathologic response to treatment (Grabenstetter et al., 2022).\\nArpino G et al. suggested that patients with ACC are unlikely to experience significant survival\\nbenefits from adjuvant systemic therapy. As a result, these patients can avoid the associated side\\neffects and financial burden of such treatment. In the research series, there was no observed\\ndifference in Disease-Free Survival (DFS) or OS rates between those who received systemic\\nadjuvant treatment post-surgery and those who did not. Therefore, the decision to administer\\nsystemic adjuvant therapy should consider the generally favorable natural history of this specific\\ntype of carcinoma. CC generally has a favorable prognosis, typically devoid of regional lymph node involvement\\nor distant metastasis. However, there are still instances where metastases can occur. Mhamdi et al.\\nreported a case of breast-ACC with metastases to the lung, kidney, and brain (Mhamdi et al., 2017).\\nThe lung is the most common site of metastasis, followed by the liver, kidneys and brain (Coates et\\nal., 2010). Concurrent studies have shown that a heightened expression of Ki67 and neural invasion\\nrepresent significant risk factors for recurrence and metastasis in ACC.\"\n","}\n","\n","Row 42:\n","{\n","

0, with no known comorbid, presented in Breast Surgery\\nclinic in July 2022, with a complaint of pain in the lateral upper and\\nlower quadrants of the right breast for 15 days. She had an intra-uterine\\ncontraceptive device in place for four years and had no significant family\\nhistory of malignancy. She had a previous surgical history of cholecystectomy and a right forearm implant after a road traffic accident. Patient\\nhad no significant psychosocial history.\\nHer general and physical was unremarkable. Breast examination did\\nnot show presence of any underlying lump. Diagnostic mammography\\nwas offered which showed an asymmetric irregular density (Fig. 1) in\\nthe right upper outer quadrant with no evidence of architectural\\ndistortion, skin thickening, or nipple retraction bilaterally (BIRADSCATEGORY-0) but, as heterogeneously dense breast parenchyma\\nwas demonstrated bilaterally, an Ultrasound (US) was advised.\\nOn the US of the bilateral breast and axilla (Fig. 2), the right breast\\nhad a well-defined hypoechoic solid nodule of 1.5 \\u00d7 1.2 \\u00d7 1.3 cm with\\ninternal vascularity at 10 o\\u2019clock position in correspondence to the site\\nof pain, with the right axilla showing few subcentimetric benign-appearing lymph nodes with intact fatty hila (BIRADS CATEGORY-IV\\nB). The left breast was normal on the US with the left axilla showing\\nfew subcentimeter benign-appearing lymph nodes with intact fatty hila\\n(BIRADS CATEGORY-I). Based on the US findings, a right breast biopsy\\nwas recommended.\\nCore biopsy of right breast 9 o\\u2019clock lesion showed a biphasic tumor\\npredominantly of cribriform architecture consisting of ductal and\\nmyoepithelial cells (containing myxoid and hyalinized globules).\\nImmunohistochemical (IHC) staining of the specimen highlighted p63\\nand CD117 whereas ER (Estrogen Receptor), as well as GATA3, came out\\nto be negative. These features were consistent with adenoid cystic carcinoma. Metastatic workup including computed tomography (CT) chest,\\nwhole abdomen, pelvis, and whole-body bone scintigraphy, turned out\\nto be negative making the clinical stage of T1N0M0. The patient subsequently underwent right breast wire localized wide local excision\\n(WLE) and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNBx). The procedure was\\nconducted by the highly skilled surgeon of our tertiary care hospital with\\na working experience of 10 years (she has done MBBS, FCPS general\\nsurgery, FCPS breast surgery, FACS). The histopathological report\\nrevealed a tumor size of 2.1 \\u00d7 1.6 \\u00d7 1.3 cm, unifocal with margins and\\nskin being tumor free, without any evidence of ductal carcinoma in situ\\n(DCIS) or lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS). Five sentinel lymph nodes\\nwere taken out, none of which was involved by the tumor. Thus, it was\\npathologically staged II-A i.e. pT2N0M0 (Fig. 3).\\nShe recovered well, her case was discussed in multi-disciplinary\\ntumor board. She was referred to Radiation Oncology for adjuvant\\nradiotherapy on account of breast conservation. Subsequently, she\\nreceived 26 Fractions of radiation to right breast, comprising of 36 Gy\\n(Gy). She has since then been kept on surveillance and on subsequent\\nthree and six months follow up patient is doing well, with satisfactory\\nlocal and systemic examination findings.

rate of less than 0.1 % [1]. Most of these cases are\\nknown to occur in females aged between 50 and 60 years old with just a\\nfew cases reported to date involving males. Morphologically, BACC is a\\ndiverse entity that is composed of solid, cribriform and tubular-trabecular pattern found in varying distribution. BACC traditionally\\npresents with a palpable mass with pain in the affected area which according to Kashiwagi et al. occurs as a consequence of perineural infiltration of tumor cells and contraction of myoepithelial cells [2].\\nBACC is considered a favorable neoplasm that differs from the typical\\nTNBC encountered in medical practice, as evidenced by its lower\\nexpression of Ki-67 [3], and rarer involvement of the axillary lymph\\nnodes. Despite these features, it is also found to be notorious for local\\nrecurrences and relatively common distant metastasis within 10 years,\\nwith the pulmonary disease being the most common site involved. Breast adenoid cystic carcinoma (BACC) is a rare distinct salivary\\ngland-like carcinoma of the breast with similar morphological features\\nto those seen in salivary gland adenoid cystic carcinoma i.e. intermixed\\ngland-forming luminal cells with myoepithelial or basal cells, resulting\\nin a pseudolumen that contains abundant basement membrane material.\\nIt was first known as \\u2018Cylindroma\\u2019 in the early 1850s by Billroth. The\\nname was later changed to adenoid cystic carcinoma in 1945 by\\nGeschikter [7]. In literature, BACC has been reported to occur mostly as\\na solitary mass in the superior lateral quadrant or below the areola of the\\nbreast, with only rare presentations with multiple masses [8].\\nBACC is often found to have a basal-like phenotype with negative immunohistochemical stain for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone\\nreceptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2).\\nInspite of being triple negative, it presents and behaves differently with\\nfewer distant metastasis, nodal involvement, and local recurrences when\\ncompletely excised. Histologically various patterns (cribriform, tubular,\\nor solid) can be appreciated. Among which, cribriform is the commonest\\npattern whereas solid is the most aggressive pattern, especially the\\nbasaloid variant [9].\\nSurgical resection is the standard mode of treatment in BACC. In an\\ninstitutional study of 20 years duration, BACC accounted for 0.1 % of all\\nbreast cancer diagnosed, with most patients presenting with stage I-II\\ndisease, which were successfully treated with surgical resection alone\\n[7].\\nAdjuvant radiotherapy is usually indicated in cases of nodal metastases. It is also recommended following breast conservation due to the\\nhigher rate of positive surgical margins which in turn increases the risk\\nof local recurrences. In a study conducted by Sun, Jia-Yuan et al.,\\nadjuvant radiotherapy after lumpectomy increased the 5-year cancer-specific survival by 4.3 % [10]. In another study, post-operative radiation was associated with better survival rates than without radiation\\n[11]. The role of adjuvant chemotherapy has not proven beneficial in the\\nmanagement of BACC, owing to the similar survival rates seen in patients with and without chemotherapy [12]. In a study involving 19,900\\npatients, the survival rates of BACC were found to be statistically similar\\nto infiltrating ductal carcinomas [13]. Thus, the common indications for\\nadjuvant chemotherapy, recommended by the present-day guidelines\\nfor the diagnosis and treatment of TNBC, cannot be implied upon BACC. Breast adenoid cystic carcinoma is a distinct variant in breast cancer,\\nwhich despite being included among the heterogeneous triple negative\\nhistology, has a good prognosis and responds well to surgical resection,\\nwith mastectomy alone providing acceptable clinical outcomes.\"\n","}\n","\n","Row 44:\n","{\n","    \"created_username\": \"pre_annotation_batch_1\",\n","    \"result\": [\n","

evaluation of a left breast mass in 4/2018. Screening mammogram demonstrated a well-circumscribed, oval, and isodense mass in the upper\\ninner quadrant of the left breast, middle third. Diagnostic ultrasound\\ndemonstrated an oval hypoechoic mass with circumscribed margins and\\nposterior acoustic enhancement at 10:00, 5 cm to the nipple. Normal\\naxillary contents are imaged on the left. She denied any palpable\\nmasses, skin changes, nipple discharge or retraction. She has never had\\nany prior breast biopsies or abnormal images. She notes loose stools or\\ndiarrhea three times a day and has occasional flushing. She also notes\\nstress eating and depression.\\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) abdomen showed diffuse sub-centimeter lesions with restricted diffusion in the liver. Lesions demonstrate early arterial enhancement which becomes isointense on\\ndelayed imaging. Her past medical history was significant for an ileal well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor diagnosed in 2/2009, which was followed by a resection of terminal ileum and right colon. She then went\\nto a clinic and underwent an exploratory laparotomy with cholecystectomy, appendectomy, and liver biopsy, which proved metastatic\\nwell-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor in the liver. Since that time,\\nshe has been on lanreotide injections. Lanreotide is a synthetic analogue\\nof somatostatin, a naturally occurring inhibitory hormone which blocks\\nthe release of several other hormones, including growth hormone,\\nthyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), insulin and glucagon.\\nSince she is asymptomatic from a breast standpoint, her liver metastasis are indolent and well controlled with lanreotide, there is no\\nindication for resection as it would not change her prognosis. However,\\nclose imaging follow up and elective lumpectomy was offered to the\\npatient as she has significant anxiety over the new diagnosis. Histological findings\\nHistologically, the tumor was composed of nests of small uniform\\ncells separated by large bands of dense connective tissues (Fig. 1). The\\ntumor cells are small, round or polyhedral. The nuclei are round or oval\\nand exhibit fine regularly dispersed chromatin, with one or two small\\nnucleoli. The cytoplasm was slightly eosinophilic. Mitotic figures are\\nextremely rare. No necrosis is identified. No intraductal or in situ carcinoma is identified in the breast parenchyma surrounding the tumor. mmunohistochemical studies\\nImmunohistochemical studies were performed to explore the immunoreactivity of the neoplastic cells for neuroendocrine markers (synaptophysin and chromograninm), cytokeratin 7 (CK7), GATA binding\\nprotein 3 (GATA3), estrogen receptor (ER), caudal type homeobox 2\\n(CDX2), and proliferation marker Ki67. The tumor cells are diffusely\\nand strongly positive for chromogranin, synaptophysin, and CDX2\\n(Fig. 2). An immunostain for ER shows weak staining in the tumor cells\\n(Fig. 3A). No immunoreactivity was shown for CK7 (Fig. 2D) and\\nGATA3 (Fig. 3B). These immunophenotypic features, in conjunction\\nwith the clinical history, supports the diagnosis of metastatic well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor with ileal origin. \"\n","}\n","\n","Row

\"title\": \"batch_1\",\n","    \"text\": \"Well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor, also known as carcinoid\\ntumor, arises from the enterochromaffin or Kulchitsky cells, which are\\nwidely distributed throughout the body [1]. The organ systems with\\nnormal neuroendocrine cell populations such as gastrointestinal\\n(especially ileum), lung, and pancreas are most common primary sites\\ndeveloping well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor. The neoplastic\\ncells often retain their ability to produce and secrete biologically active\\npeptides, amines, and other substances. As a consequence, a neuroendocrine tumor may be associated with a clinical syndrome that\\nincludes flushing, wheezing, watery diarrhea, and vascular heart disease.\\nThe most common metastatic sites of neuroendocrine tumor/carcinoid tumor are the liver and regional lymph nodes [1]. Rare cases of\\nmetastatic neuroendocrine tumor in the breast have been reported\\n[2\\u20135]. G\\u00fcnhan-Bilgen et al. reported an incidence rate of neuroendocrine breast carcinoma of only 0.27% in a series of 1845 histopathologically proven breast carcinomas [6].\\nMetastatic well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor in the breast\\noften presents as a breast mass with nonspecific characteristics on\\nroutine breast imaging and can exhibit overlapping histological features\\nwith primary breast well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor and invasive breast carcinoma. Combination of clinical history, imaging studies, histology, and immunohistochemical studies are critical to reach a\\ncorrect diagnosis. Although the treatment regimen for metastatic well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor in the breast has not been\\nestablished mainly due to its rarity, it usually does not require as aggressive treatment as required for the invasive breast carcinoma. Accurate diagnosis of metastatic well-differentiated neuroendocrine\\ntumor in the breast is challenging and of crucial importance as the\\noptimal treatment is different. Major differential diagnoses for metastatic well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor in the breast include\\nprimary breast well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor, and invasive\\nbreast carcinoma with neuroendocrine features. Histologically, well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors of the breast are comprised of\\nnests or sheets of uniform cell population with abundant eosinophilic\\ncytoplasm and characteristic \\u201csalt and pepper\\u201d nuclear chromatin.\\nWhile the tumor cell distribution pattern and characteristic nuclear\\nfeatures can be present in all the differential diagnoses, the extent of\\ntumor cells with neuroendocrine features helps differentiate breast\\ncarcinoma versus primary/metastatic breast well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor. Primary/metastatic well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor in the breast need to have neuroendocrine features in more\\nthan 50% of tumor cells [7]. Neuroendocrine differentiation has been\\ndemonstrated in up to 30% of invasive breast carcinomas, and is most\\nfrequently found in the hypercellular variant of mucinous carcinomas\\nand solid papillary carcinomas [8]. Evaluating the neuroendocrine\\ntumor cell populations can be achieved by morphology and immunohistochemical markers. Due to the considerable morphologic overlap, differentiating primary versus metastatic well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor in the\\nbreast can be very challenging, even in the circumstances of known\\nhistory of well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor in other organs.\\nThe in situ carcinoma is the only absolute proof of the primary nature of\\nbreast carcinoma [9]. However, histochemical special stains and immunostaining studies have been proven to be very helpful. It has been\\nreported that primary and metastatic well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor of small bowel demonstrate abundant argyrophillic cytoplasmic granules (Sevier-Munger technique) and argentaffin cytoplasmic granules (Fontana-Masson method), whereas primary well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor of breast shows only argyrophilic\\ngranules [5,10,11]. Thus, these special stains could be helpful in assisting differentiating the primary (argyrophilic granules positive only)\\nand metastatic (both argyrophilic and argentaffin granules positive)\\nwell-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors in the breast. Furthermore,\\nit has also been reported that the argentaffin granule reaction and\\nmorphology may help to specify the site of primary tumor.\\nImmunohistochemical studies have been widely utilized to reach\\nthe correct diagnosis of well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor in the\\nbreast. Both the primary and metastatic well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor cells in the breast are immunoreactive for at least\\none of the neuroendocrine markers such as synaptophysin, chromogranin (CGA), neuron-specific enolase, and CD56 (also known as neural\\ncell adhesion molecule, NCAM). Synaptophysin is an integral membrane glycoprotein expressed in the pre-synaptic vesicles of neurons as\\nwell as diffusely in the normal and neoplastic neuroendocrine cells\\n[12]. Chromagranin A is a marker staining for dense core (endocrine)\\ngranules and has wide distribution and high degree of specificity. Both\\nsynaptophysin and chromogranin are the most commonly established\\nimmunohistochemical markers for neuroendocrine cells. In our case, we\\nfound tumor cells diffusely immunoreactive to synaptophysin and\\nchromogranin, which confirmed their neuroendocrine features and evaluated the percentage of neoplastic neuroendocrine cells.\\nIn addition, analysis of expression of hormone receptors (ER and\\nPR) and breast markers such as GATA3, mammaglobin, GCDP15 is of\\ngreat value in making a correct diagnosis. Primary breast well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors and invasive breast carcinomas with\\nneuroendocrine features are generally positive for hormone receptors\\nand breast makers [9]. In contrast, metastatic well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors in the breast are usually negative for breast markers and positive for site-specific markers, with variable positivity for\\nhormone receptors [13]. Some invasive breast carcinoma may exhibit\\noverlapping morphological features with well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor. The immunohistochemical analysis can be extremely helpful in the accurate recognition of neuroendocrine features\\nand origin of the neoplastic cells. Our case showed the tumor cells are\\nnegative for GATA3 and cytokeratin 7, and weak positive reaction to\\nER, which supports the metastatic well-differentiated neuroendocrine\\ntumor. Furthermore, the immunoreactivity to CDX2 confirmed the ileal\\norigin.\\nRadiological analyses, including mammography, sonography, and\\nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI), of neuroendocrine breast carcinoma revealed overlapping features with other breast malignancies\\n[14]. On mammography, neuroendocrine breast carcinoma have a\\ntendency of exhibiting sharply circumscribed margins, different to\\nother breast malignancy and similar to benign lesions such as fibroadenoma, cysts or intramammary lymph nodes. On sonography,\\nneuroendocrine breast carcinomas may appear as indistinct irregular\\nhypoechoic solid masses with echogenic halos, similar to other types of\\ninvasive cancer. On color Doppler imaging, most of the masses were\\nhighly vascularized. Neuroendocrine breast carcinoma has been reported to show early rapid or medium enhancement on MRI [15].\\nOverall, radiological analyses can be helpful differentiating breast\\nneuroendocrine tumors from other malignancies when in conjunction\\nwith histopathological analyses.\"\n","}\n","\n","Row 46:\n","{\n","    \"created_username\": \"pre_annotation_batch_1\",\n","    \"result\": [\n","

\"batch_1\",\n","    \"text\": \"We report a case of a 50-year-old woman, no menopausal, three\\ngestations and three parities (vaginal delivery). with history family: her\\nmother died of oropharyngeal cancer.\\nShe had presented since November 2020, a nodule in the left breast,\\nthat gradually increased size during six months ago.\\nMammography [Fig. 1], and breast ultrasound had shown a large\\nnodular formation in the left upper-external quadrant measuring 32 \\u00d7\\n25 mm, with irregular hypoechoic contours, assessed as Breast Imaging\\nReporting and Data System (BIRADS) 5. A biopsy of the nodule was performed and showed: a nonspecific,\\npoorly differentiated, graded as Scarff\\u2013Bloom\\u2013Richardson (SBR) II,\\ninfiltrating breast carcinoma, with the presence of vascular emboli.\\nA surgical, tumorectomy with a homolateral axillary dissection, was\\nperformed.\\nAnatomo-pathological study showed a malignant infiltrating neoplaisc process of 4,2 cm suggesting a large cell neuroendocrine differentiation carcinoma, graded SBRIII, with intra-tumoral lymphocytes\\nestimated at 5 %, with thirteen positive lymph node metastases out of\\nnineteen lymph nodes (13 N+/19 N). The edges of surgical excision\\nwere healthy. We stadified our patient pT2N3.\\nImmuno-histochemical study showed that the tumor cells expressed\\ndiffusely and intensely Chromogranin A [Fig. 2] (polyclonal antibody),\\nand focally Synaptophysin [Fig. 3] (DAK-SYNAP clone) with low\\nintensity.\\nHormone receptors were highly expressed (Estrogen receptor = 90 %\\n[Fig. 4], Progesterone receptor = 60 % [Fig. 5]). The Ki67 proliferation\\nindex was expressed at 70 %. The membrane expression of invasive\\ntumor cells to the anti-HER2 anti body was 2, a FISH done which was\\nequivocal. The diagnosis retained was a large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma [Fig. 6]. In order to rule out a secondary origin, a thoracic-abdominal-pelvic\\nCT scan and a bone scan were requested, they were unremarkable and\\nthe primary breast origin was retained. The therapeutic decision was to\\nperform sequential adjuvant chemotherapy: 3 courses of anthracyclines\\nsuch as Epirubicin and 3 courses of taxanes such as Paclitaxel, without\\nanti-Her2 treatment, followed by external radiotherapy and hormone\\ntherapy.\\nCurrently, the patient had received six courses of chemotherapy,\\nfollowed by fifteen sessions of radiotherapy on the tumor and lymph\\nnode areas with Boost, and put on Tamoxifen 20 mg/day in adjuvant, it\\nhas been six months. Neuroendocrine carcinomas are rare, the first description of primary\\nneuroendocrine breast tumor was done by Wade and al. in 1983 [4,5].\\nEpidemiologically, these tumors are predominantly found in women\\naround the seventh decade of age, but our patient is younger. Without\\nexcluding, cases reported in men.\\nThese tumors are classified into 4 types: Solid neuroendocrine carcinomas, atypical carcinoids, small cell carcinomas, and large cell carcinomas [6,7]. The diagnosis of primary neuroendocrine tumors was\\nretained in front of the expression by the cancer cell of neuroendocrine\\nmarker (Chromogranin and or synaptopysin), and after a detailed paraclinical examination made of an octreoscanner or thoracoabdominopelvic scan with bone scintigraphy [8,9]. In our observation,\\nit was a large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma.\\nRadiologically, stellate or spiculated opacities on mammography are\\nrare [11]. These tumors present on mammography as a dense mass with\\nirregular or multilobulated contours, hypoechogenic and homogeneous\\non ultrasound [6], this echo-mammographic appearance is strongly\\nsuggestive of a neuroendocrine tumor for some authors. A clinicomammographic character similar to adenocarcinoma is noted [10].\\nAnatomically, primary neuroendocrine tumors of the breast are\\nround or poly-lobed, whitish- yellow in color, firm in consistency, or\\nrarely gelatinous in case of an associated mucinous component [6,7].\\nThus, the origin of neuroendocrine tumors is confirmed by the expression of neuroendocrine markers, particularly Chromogranin A, CD56\\nand Synaptophysin [6,12]. Furthermore, the certainty of the mammary\\norigin of these tumors is essentially based on the demonstration of an in situ contingent; the immunohistochemical expression of hormone receptors by the tumor cells also points to the \\u201cmammary\\u201d primitive nature of the tumor [6,13]. On the other hand, hormone receptors are\\nexpressed by neuroendocrine carcinomas of the breast and are related to a more favorable prognosis of the tumor, whereas HER2 is almost always\\nnegative. Accordingly, gene expression profile analysis had revealed\\nthat primary neuroendorine tumors of the breast belonged to the\\nluminal subtype [17].\\nIn our case, hormone receptors were highly expressed. However, the\\nexpression of estrogen and progesterone receptors in large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas of the lung andthose of other sites was cited. Thus,\\nin this case, one cannot rely solely on their expression to maintain breast\\norigin [14].\\nSurgical treatment (mastectomy with axillary dissection and metastasectomy), remains the first line treatment in neuroendocrine tumors.\\nThe indications for chemotherapy and radiotherapy are the same as\\nfor other breast cancers. Given the rarity of this entity, the chemotherapy protocol is not standardized: neuroendocrine carcinomas of the\\nbreast are treated by some as an adenocarcinoma of the breast and by\\nothers as neuroendocrine carcinoma of the lung [10].\\nSome examples of chemotherapy regimens reported in the literature\\ninclude: fluorouracil/epirubicin/cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxel; docetaxel/epirubicin/cyclophosphamide; cyclophosphamide and\\ndoxorubicin; cyclophosphamide/methotrexate/fluorouracil; paclitaxel\\nalone; carboplatin/paclitaxel; carboplatin or cisplatin and etoposide;\\nand cisplatin and irinotecan [22,23].\\nIn a small series, the type of chemotherapy chosen was based on the\\nKi67 proliferation index, according to a modified treatment algorithm\\noriginally developed for gastro intestinal neuroendocrine tumors [24].\\nIn this series, anthracycline-based chemotherapy was given to patients\\nwith a Ki67 index of 15 %, and cisplatin/etoposide to patients with a\\nKi67 greater than 15 % [25]. However, the lack of solid data on the role\\nof platinum and etoposide compounds in the adjuvant treatment of\\nprimary neuroendorine tumors of the breast, the therapeutic course\\nadopted is that of ductal breast carcinoma.\\nThe neuroendocrine component usually escapes within a few months\\nbut can be controlled by anthracycline-based chemotherapy [4]. Hormone therapy was indicated in patients with hormone receptor expression [22].\\nThe prognosis of neuroendocrine differentiation in breast cancer is\\nstill debated, as several studies were published with mixed results\\n[18\\u201321]. These conflicting results can be explained by the limited\\nnumber of cases reported in each series, by the different inclusion\\ncriteria according to the 2003 or 2012 World Health Organization\\n(WHO) definitions, as well as by the analysis performed considering\\nprimary neuroendorine tumors of the breast as a whole, without\\nanalyzing the results according to the different histological subtypes.\\nThe prognosis of primary neuroendocrine carcinomas of the breast\\ndepends mainly on the histological grade and the anatomoclinical stage\\n[6,8,13]. The evolution of endocrine tumors of the breast is slow. These\\ntumors are graded histologically like their counterparts in other sites\\n[6,7]. On the other hand, neuroendocrine carcinomas with atypical and\\nsolid carcinoid variants have a better prognosis than small cell neuroendocrine carcinomas and poorly differentiated large cell carcinomas.\\nThe presence of an associated mucinous contingent would be a good\\nprognostic factor [6,12].\\nThe five-year survival rate exceeds 80 % for all forms. On the other\\nhand, the latest studies speak of the frequency of locoregional recurrence and metastasis, which makes the prognosis dreadful overall\\n[12,15,16]. The accepted prognostic factors are represented by age,\\nterrain, tumor secretory power, tumor size and the existence or not of\\nmetastases [15,16].\\nIn our observation, we note histological factors of bad prognosis such\\nas large cell variant, tumor size of 4.2 cm; the presence of several lymph\\nnode metastases and SBR grade III, on the other hand the only factor of\\ngood prognosis

intervention with wide excision and reconstruction.\\nThe lump was found to be on the superior lateral quadrant which had\\npersisted during the past six years. Metastatic work up already done and\\nfound no metastatic in this patient. The pathology report was given as\\nAdenocarcinoma showing apocrine like cell differentiation with differential diagnose as a primary breast carcinoma (primary cutaneous\\nadnexal carcinoma with apocrine differentiation, grade 2 according to\\nBloom Richardson Score, invasive ductal carcinoma of NST with\\napocrine differentiation grade 2), metastatic adenocarcinoma from\\nother site to breast (secondary carcinoma). Based on the Elston-Ellis\\nmodification of the Bloom and Richardson grading system then invasive apocrine carcinomas are usually categorized as grade 2 or 3 carcinomas. This grading system reflects the architectural pattern of the\\ntumor cells, which indicates their level of differentiation towards normal\\nbreast ducts and lobules [1].\\nVranic et al. have reported that Apocrine Carcinoma (AC) is a rare\\nform of breast malignancies, constituting to only 0.3\\u20134 % of all breast\\nmalignancies which often depend on criteria\\u2019s that have been used to\\ndefine it [2]. When defined strictly as above, it comprises approximately\\n1 % of female invasive breast carcinoma [3]. AC is an aggressive type of\\ncutaneous adenocarcinoma that is more commonly seen in middle-aged\\nwomen, and it tends to occur in regions of the body that are rich in\\napocrine glands, such as the axilla, as well as in other sites like the eyelid\\n(in Moll\\u2019s glands), ear, and scalp [4].\\nMacroscopic and clinical characteristics shows that apocrine carcinoma of the breast typically presents as a solidified whitish mass with a\\nfine infiltrative line. Nipple discharge may or may not be present [3]. on\\nmicroscopic examination, the apocrine carcinoma exhibits similar\\npattern for its growth as invasive ductal carcinoma, NST. This includes a\\nrare encapsulated apocrine papillary carcinoma of the breast, which is\\nclearly identifiable as a cyst which are well demarcated on microscopical examination. The cells of apocrine carcinoma are characterized by\\ntypical apocrine features, such as abundant eosinophilic granular cytoplasm and prominent/multiple nucleoli. These cells resemble those\\nfound in the sweat glands of the underarm and groin region. The\\ntransformation of normal ductal breast cells into apocrine cells is\\nbelieved to occur through metaplasia, although the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood [2].\\nInvasive apocrine breast cancer is an infrequent form of breast cancer\\nthat, like other types of invasive ductal cancer, originating from the\\nducts of the breast which then spreads to the surrounding tissues. One of\\nthe risk factors for breast cancer is age, where this patient is 67 years old,\\nwhich means that he has experienced menopause. Menopause after 55\\nyears of age will be at risk of developing breast cancer because of an\\nimbalance of the hormones estrogen and progesterone [6]. It is important to carry out clinical reevaluation with unusual or unusual pathological results so that mismanagement does not occur. The objective of\\nlocal therapy for apocrine breast cancer is to minimize the likelihood of\\nbreast cancer recurrence by targeting the affected area of the breast. Local therapy typically includes surgical procedures such as lumpectomy or mastectomy [7].\\nLike in this patient, we found that the pathology result is adenocarcinoma showed apocrine-like cell differentiation. The malignant\\nadnexal tumor is rarely found and especially the site in the breast skin\\ncan be misdiagnosed as other breast cancer or any other breast pathology. It is crucial to conduct clinical reevaluations with exceptional or\\nunusual pathological results to avoid mismanagement.\\nThe malignant cells are positive for CK7, CK19, E-Cadherin and\\nMOC31 immunomarkers. CK7 and CK19 indicate invasive apocrine\\ncarcinoma [2,8], E-Cadherin positive in ductal carsinom [8] similar to\\nthis case that happened in breast, MOC31 for metastatic adenocarcinom\\n[9] in accordance with the pathology report. Other markes, TTF-1,\\nCK20, CDX2, GCDFP-15, Mammoglobin Her2/Neu, Estrogen and Progesteron receptors are negative.\\nAccording to some studies, apocrine carcinomas predispose to estrogen and progesterone receptor negativity, androgen receptor positivity (ER -, PR- AR +) and expression of Gross cystic disease protein\\nfluid-15 (GCDPF-15) [2,3,10]. The expression of androgen receptors\\nwere found to be noticed in up to 80 % of breast malignancies including\\nER-/PR- breast carcinomas. Androgen receptors are known to be a\\nmember of the steroid receptor family. It is a single polypeptide with\\nseveral capability to mediate different functions with one of them being\\nimplicated in breast cancer development and progression. AR exerts\\nanti-estrogenic, growth-suppressive effects in normal breast tissue and\\nER-positive breast carcinomas. ER-/PR- shows promoting cell growth\\nand tumor development [2,11]. GCDFP-15 is present in the liquid of\\nbreast cysts and any apocrine cells: mammary glands, salivary glands,\\nsweat, Paget\\u2019s disease, etc.\\nTTF-1 negative shows that absent of thyroid transcription factor 1\\n[12], CK20 negative means there is no metastatic to lung, breast, thyroid, pancreas, and female genital tract [13], also CDX2 is a biomarker of\\nmature colon cells, was shown to predict metastatic carcinoma in colon\\n[14]. This patient has no recurrence to date (about one year following\\nthe surgical intervention). This shown that malignant adnexal life survival of this patient still good until recently, even though the patient\\nrefused to received any radiotherapy and decided to go back to her\\ncounty.

synchronous biBC occurring\\nin a 68-year-old female patient.\\nIn July 2023, her breast ultrasonography showed a 7.3*6.3*3.3 cm\\nmass in the left breast, and a 3.2*2.2*1.2 cm mass in the right breast,\\nboth were classified as 4C (BI-RADS), with enlarged lymph nodes in\\nthe left axilla. The pathology of the core needle biopsy revealed two\\npunctured tissues were invasive adenocarcinomadpart of which\\nwas apocrine adenocarcinoma. Left axillary lymph nodes revealed\\nmetastatic cancer. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) revealed the right\\nbreast was triple negative BC (TNBC) and the left breast was triple\\npositive BC. CT scan showed no systemic distant metastasis. She\\nreceived neoadjuvant therapy with TCbHP (docetaxel, carboplatin\\nand Pertuzumab, Trastuzumab every 21 days). After 4 cycles of this\\nregimen, the patient was evaluated by MRI: the overall reduction\\nof the lesion was 41% with no obvious regression of the right breast\\nlesion, and there was a tendency to increase of the left breast in size\\n(Fig. 1A). Therefore, the patient was operated with \\\"double\\nmastectomy \\u00fe double axillary lymph node dissection\\\" after 4 cycles\\nof therapy. Postoperative pathology displayed that the right breast:\\nmass size 3.6*3.2*3 cm, apocrine carcinoma; lymph nodes metastases in the right axilla 2/22, although none lymph nodes in the right\\naxilla were showed on preoperative imaging; the left breast: mass\\nsize 3.5*2.5*2.5 cm, non-specialized invasive BC grade 3; lymph\\nnodes metastases in the left axillary 4/12. IHC: right breast: ER (\\u0002),\\nPR (\\u0002), HER2 (1\\u00fe), AR (70%\\u00fe), Ki67 (10%\\u00fe); right axillary lymph\\nnodes: the same as the right breast; left breast: ER (80%\\u00fe), PR\\n(3%\\u00fe), HER2 (3\\u00fe), Ki67 (40%\\u00fe); left axillary lymph node: ER\\n(90%\\u00fe), PR (\\u0002), HER2 (3\\u00fe), Ki67 (40%\\u00fe) (Fig. 1B&C). Genetic tests\\ndidn't indicate the presence of germ line mutation (Supplementary\\ndata). The patient is undergoing postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy (pharmorubicin, and cyclophosphamide every 21 days for\\n4 cycles). After the chemotherapy, the patient will be further treated\\nwith T-DM1 (14 cycles), combined with chest wall and bilateral subclavian radiotherapy and exemestane.\\nApocrine carcinoma is a rare BC subtype, accounting for 1e4%. It\\nfrequently expresses AR and divided into two subtypes based on\\nHER2 status: TNBC and HER2-positive BC. 3 Previous study has demonstrated that apocrine TNBC has a poorer response to (neo)\\nadjuvant chemotherapy than other non-apocrine TNBC.4 In our\\ncase, the patient suffered from Synchronous biBC, the right was\\napocrine TNBC. Our data provided evidence that it really had a\\npoor response to neoadjuvant therapy. It suggested that the treatment plan should be adjusted in time and the operation time\\nshould be grasped for such patients.\\nIn conclusion, although molecular typing is crucial to the selection of BC treatment, equal attention should be paid to tissue\\ntyping, and personalized and precise treatment should be carried\\nout for special tissue type.\"\n","}\n","\n","Row 50:\n","{\n","

Hospital Lahore, Pakistan, with a massive, recurrent lump in the right breast which had been rapidly growing for four months prior to presentation. The patient had a BMI > 30, and no other co-morbidities were noted at the time of presentation to the hospital.\\n\\nThe examination findings at the time of presentation were: a large 35cm x 40cm, irregular, mildly tender mass in the right breast which was not fixed to the underlying skin. It was palpable in all quadrants and a large lymph node was palpable in the ipsilateral axilla. A 5cm x 5cm ulcerated lesion was noted on the upper, inner quadrant and a scar mark from previous surgeries was visible. There was no nipple discharge, inversion, or sinuses. There was no obvious deformity in the contralateral breast. \\n\\nThe patient had undergone wide local excision of lumps in the same region twice previously within a span of 14 months prior to presentation in our hospital with differing histopathological reports. The first excision biopsy was done at a local hospital in the periphery and reported only stromal fibrosis and dilated acini and ducts with no evidence of malignancy. The mass recurred and the patient underwent a second excision biopsy four months later which came back with a report of a benign spindle cell lesion. The mass recurred once again and this time, larger and more massive than ever before and the patient decided to report to our tertiary care hospital. Upon admission, a Tru-cut biopsy was performed as a bed-side technique which came back with a report of a spindle cell lesion with evidence of fibrocystic lesions.\\n\\nProcedure\\n\\nThe General Surgery team at Services Hospital Lahore performed a modified radical mastectomy with level III dissection. The decision to perform a level III dissection was taken due to the ambiguous diagnosis of the tumor as noted previously and the high propensity for recurrence. A level III dissection of the lymph nodes would give the patient a better chance for survival as it would completely clear out the breast tissue.\\n\\nMarkings were made for the patient\\u2019s massive breast tissue under anesthesia and the subsequent dissection and excision took two and a half hours. The cavity left after excision and the tissue removed are shown below in Figures \\u200bFigures1,1, \\u200b,22. After that, the Plastic Surgery team took over and the large 20cm x 18cm defect was noted. Specific markings were made for the transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous (TRAM) flap were made in line and parallel to the umbilicus (Figure \\u200b(Figure3).3). The vessels for the flap were identified with Doppler intra-operatively (Figure \\u200b(Figure4).4). The flap was rotated beneath the skin and subcutaneous tissue and placed on the defect (Figure \\u200b(Figure5),5), filling it completely and subsequently stapled. The abdominal defect was closed and a drain was placed for drainage and the total reconstruction was a three-hour process. Post-operatively, the patient was nursed in the Surgical ICU to aid post-operative recovery since the operating time for the combined procedures was over four hours. The patient was shifted to the Plastic Surgery ward after two days. The total hospital stay for the patient was three weeks. The long hospital stay was due to patient preference since she lived in a remote village and due to social reasons, follow-up for graft take-up would have been challenging for her. She remained stable throughout the stay. The flap remained viable and showed no signs of deterioration. The patient was discharged from the hospital and asked to follow up at her leisure for nipple-areola reconstruction.\\n\\nThe specimen was first sent to the Pathology Department of Services Institute of Medical Sciences and came back with a histological report revealing spindle cell proliferation with hypo and hypercellular areas arranged in herring bone and fascicular patterns against hyalinizing stroma as shown in Figure \\u200bFigure7. Pleomorphism7. Pleomorphism and a mitotic count of 20 per 10 HPF was noted. The tumor was 7cm away from the superior resection margin, 6cm away from the inferior resection margin, 2cm away from the lateral resection margin and 3cm away from the medial resection margin. The deep margin was grossly involved with the tumor. Upon discussion with the pathology team, they suggested staining as well. The specimen was then sent to Chugtai Laboratory, which is a private institution and after an extensive immune-histochemistry workup, the report came back suggestive of a neoplasm showing spindle-shaped cells with nuclear enlargement, pleomorphism, and hyperchromasia. The stains used were SMA, desmin, cytokeratin, S-100, BCL-2, EMA, CK-5/6, and Caldesmon all of which were negative. A note on the report suggested, however, that the possibility of a malignant phyllodes tumor could not be ruled out. \"\n","}\n","\n","Row 51:\n","{\n","    \"created_username\":

\"batch_1\",\n","    \"text\": \"Spindle cell carcinoma of the breast is a known but rare condition. Previous studies have shown that it comprises a total of 0.2% of all breast lesions [1,2]. Microscopically, it contains dominant spindle shape cells together with in situ /or ductal, lobular, squamous, or mixed infiltrating carcinoma [3]. Thus, the mixed morphological patterns on histopathological reports often make for a difficult diagnosis. Prognosis in spindle cell carcinoma has been reported as comparable to that of common breast carcinoma [4]. It has been found that the tissue usually contains a well-circumscribed boundary with a low incidence of lymph node metastasis. The mainstay of treatment for this disease has been traditionally a mastectomy. The modified radical mastectomy with level III dissection and subsequent TRAM flap was done in front of a live audience with many senior consultants in attendance. It was managed by audio-visual feedback from the operation theatre with microphone headsets applied to the leading surgeons and two cameramen in the operation theatre. The diagnosis of the tumor was hotly debated among many peers. The underlying discussion was that spindle cell tumors rarely occur in the breast. Many of the audience suggested that the case is most likely a misdiagnosed malignant phyllodes tumor since they present with a similar history (a rapidly growing, solitary, ill-defined tumor with a tendency to occur in the breast).\\n\\n It reported a spindle cell lesion but stated that a phyllodes tumor could not be ruled out as mentioned previously. This, again, started a debate among many surgical consultants and pathologists who considered the presentation of the case with the appearance of the tumor and were divided in their diagnosis; therefore, a conclusive diagnosis could still not be reached.\\n\\nOwing to the considerable confusion regarding the diagnosis of this particular case even after the previously mentioned biopsy reports, we looked at other reports of this disease around the world. Common features from all of the reports we have noted include the rarity of the disease, a challenging diagnosis owing to overlapping morphology with other tumors, a high propensity of local recurrence, and tumors themselves being locally aggressive [6-9]. We note that in our case there were similar features; the tumor had been excised twice and grew back in the course of a few months each time. The main feature that differed from previous studies in our case was the involvement of lymph nodes. It is previously noted that spindle cell carcinomas do not usually involve lymph nodes, however, in our case, the axillary group of lymph nodes was grossly involved and enlarged, warranting a level III clearance. Although a recent report has suggested newer diagnostic biomarkers using gene amplification to identify spindle cell carcinomas [10], the biopsies taken for our patient each time proved to be inconclusive. However, we also note that after the modified radical mastectomy was performed along with a level III dissection finally, the patient did not report recurrence till at least one month after discharge after which our patient self-discontinued follow-up. The TRAM flap was an ambitious undertaking considering that the tumor still was not fully diagnosed but we are glad to report that up till the patient's last follow-up it was considerably well taken. In conclusion, the diagnostic dilemma of a spindle cell carcinoma of the breast is still a problem, although it is a rarity. However, a modified radical mastectomy with a level III dissection may be possible. Depending on the size of the cavity, a TRAM flap reconstruction can also be successful within the same procedure.\"\n","}\n","\n","Row 52:\n","{\n","    \"created_username\":

complained the pain on her right breast. She underwent a breast surgery in our hospital. The patient and her family\\u2019s medical histories were unremarkable.\\n\\nThe patient was 157 cm tall and weighed 53 kg. Physical examination of the right breast (area C) revealed an elastic hard mass measuring 2.5 cm \\u00d7 2.5 cm. Margins were distinct, with relatively good mobility and a tumor-nipple distance of 3.2 cm. No axillary or cervical lymph nodes were palpable. Hematological and biochemical blood test results were normal. The levels of tumor markers, such as carcinoembryonic antigen, carbohydrate antigen 15-3, and National Cancer Center-Stomach-439, were within normal limits.\\n\\nMammography revealed an indistinct margined hyper dense mass in the right outer portion, which was assessed as Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System category 4C (Figure 1A: MLO view, Figure 1B: CC view). Breast ultrasonography (US) revealed complex cystic lesion, and the tumor was large with 2.5 cm diameter (Figure 2). Complex cystic lesion on US with blood content on fine-needle aspiration (FNA) cytology revealed malignant cells. Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings and a T2 weight image revealed an early enhancement image with no intraductal spread (Figure 3). No distant metastases was identified on computed tomography or bone scan. The tumor stage was T2N0M0. Breast-conserving surgery and sentinel lymph node biopsy were performed. The results exposed two sentinel lymph nodes and no malignant cell. The tumor measured 2.0 cm in diameter and contained a central cystic area (Figures 4,\\u200b,5).5). Histopathological examination showed low papillary growth in the cystic cavity surface, which was covered by adenocarcinomatous components associated with some squamous metaplasia. Most of the lesions comprising the cyst wall were a mixture of irregular bundles of spindle-shaped tumor cells and fibrous connective tissue proliferation. The tumor was diagnosed as spindle cell. Immunostaining of spindle-shaped tumor cells showed positive results for cytokeratin (AE1/AE3) and vimentin (Figures 7,\\u200b,8),8), partially positive results for s-100, and negative results for desmin and \\u03b1-actin. The final histopathological diagnosis was spindle cell carcinoma. Histological grade from malignancy was grade III. Lymphatic invasion was negative, whereas blood vessel invasion was positive. Lymph node metastasis was negative, and p-stage I was diagnosed. Estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2), which showed negative results by biochemical tests, were called triple negative type in subtype classification. The postoperative course was uneventful. The patient received six courses of FEC-100 chemotherapy. Radiotherapy included simultaneous integrated boost enforced 60 Gy (2 Gy/day) to the residual breast tissue. After 24 months of postoperation, no recurrence has been detected. \"\n","}\n","\n","Row 53:\n","{\n","    \"created_username\": \"pre_annotation_batch_1\",\n","    \"result\": [\n","        {\n","

\"title\": \"batch_1\",\n","    \"text\": \"Spindle cell carcinoma of the breast is a rare tumor. This tumor can proliferate rapidly and cause cystic changes because of internal tissue necrosis. We evaluated a 54-year-old woman with right breast lump. Mammography showed a category four mass with a diameter of 2.5 cm. Ultrasonography (US) revealed a complex cystic lesion, and fine-needle aspiration (FNA) cytology demonstrated bloody fluid and malignant cells. Partial breast resection and sentinel lymph node biopsy were performed. Immunohistology revealed spindle cells with positive results for cytokeratin (AE1/AE3) and vimentin, partially positive results for s-100, and negative results for desmin and \\u03b1-actin. The pathological stage was IIA, and biochemical characterization showed that the tumor was triple negative. Six courses of FEC-100 chemotherapy (5-fluorouracil 500 mg/m2, epirubicin 100 mg/m2, and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2) were administered. Radiotherapy was performed. Spindle cell carcinoma of the breast is a rare histological carcinoma, accounting for approximately 0.08% of all breast cancers1. Together with squamous cell carcinoma and carcinoma with osseous and chondroid metaplasia, this entity is classified as a metaplastic carcinoma2. The tumor comprises spindle-shaped cells with a sarcomatoid appearance, representing carcinosarcoma. In the present case, some tumor cell nests with epithelial features and areas of squamous metaplasia were observed. The sarcomatoid component is defined as a component by which epithelial cancer cells assume a spindle shape. In our hospital, which has been operating for over 10 years, only 3 (0.024%) of 1,280 breast cancer surgery cases have involved spindle cell carcinoma.\\n\\nAt the time of initial diagnosis, numerous spindle cell carcinomas tend to be large and localized, with histopathological examination often showing well-defined margins or a partially nodular appearance3. The image view of spindle cell carcinoma reveals a large size and nonspecific shadow, clear of the boundary around on mammography, and high signal intensity on T2 MRI images4. On breast US, the cystic change is not rare, these cysts are not true cysts with a capsule, but rather result from internal degeneration and necrosis because of relatively rapid tumor proliferation.\\n\\nBreast-conserving surgery is often difficult because of the large tumor size in numerous patients5. A report has indicated that the tumor average diameter is 4 cm6. Lymph node metastasis is less common than other breast cancers6,7. In the present case, breast-conserving surgery is possible when minimal peripheral invasion or intraductal spread is present.\\n\\nHistopathological examination revealed spindle-shaped sarcomatoid cell proliferation and a distinct area of epithelial cancer cells. In the sarcomatoid component, epithelial characteristics were decreased; therefore, immunostaining revealed a mixture of areas positive for epithelial marker cytokeratin and mesenchymal marker vimentin. Many of the tumors discussed above are histological grade from malignancy grade III, but the prognosis may be poor even in grade I8. This finding is largely attributable to biochemical characteristics on the tumor, such as the high negative rates of hormone receptors and HER2/neu protein6,9. Given this triple-negative status exhibited in many cases, hormone and molecular-targeted therapies are often ineffective. Treatment therefore usually consists of chemotherapy. However, no specific chemotherapy regimens has been devised for metaplastic carcinoma, including spindle cell carcinoma. As spindle cell carcinoma shows sarcomatoid features, the efficacy of chemotherapy is also often uncertain5. Treatment is thus based on protocols for invasive ductal cancer. In our patient, the histopathological diagnosis was T2N0, grade III, triple-negative; therefore, six courses of FEC-100 were administered. No sign of recurrence has been identified as of the time of writing, that is, 10-month postoperation. Nevertheless, careful follow-up observation will be required. \"\n","}\n","\n","Row 54:\n","{\n","    \"created_username\": \"pre_annotation_batch_1\",\n","    \"result\": [\n","        {\n","

of the right breast was transferred to our institution for further management. She had initially presented to a\\ncommunity hospital due to a rapidly enlarging right breast\\nmass and had a two-core biopsy performed without complication. The pathology of both specimens revealed a malignant\\nspindle cell neoplasm with a mitotic rate of 20 mitoses/10\\nHPF and approximately 30% necrosis present. There were no\\nglandular structures or areas resembling phyllodes tumor\\nseen on the biopsy. Immunohistochemical staining showed\\nweak cytokeratin 14, p63 and GATA3 expression as well as\\nstrong staining for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)\\n(Figure 1). Immunostains for desmin and S100 were negative. It scored 9/9 on Scarff-Bloom-Richardson breast carcinoma grading (tubule formation 3, degree of pleomorphism\\n3, mitosis 3). Testing for breast biomarkers failed to reveal\\nany estrogen and progesterone receptor expression or HER2\\ngene amplification. Based on the location in the breast along with weak keratin expression the diagnosis of high grade\\nmetaplastic carcinoma\\u2014spindle cell type was made.\\nStaging CT scan noted a large right breast mass with\\nassociated skin thickening, consistent with the patient\\u2019s\\nknown breast neoplasm, and prominent subpectoral lymph nodes. The CT scan also revealed several hypoattenuating liver lesions, many of which appeared to be\\ncystic consistent with simple cysts, with a few indeterminate smaller lesions. These have remained stable on follow up CT scans, the last being about 18 months since the\\ninitial study.\\nThe patient received three cycles of neoadjuvant AIM\\nbetween March 2018 and May 2018. Treatment was complicated by neutropenic fever of 38.5\\u00b0 with an absolute\\nneutrophil count (ANC) of 0.09 after cycle 1. Post-treatment CT of the chest showed grossly stable appearance of the large right breast mass and did not indicate\\ntreatment effect. She underwent chest wall resection to\\ninclude the right breast with immediate rotational flap\\nreconstruction. The resected mass measured 16 \\u00d7 14 \\u00d7\\n12 cm with margins free of tumor.

Her adjuvant treatment course was complicated by\\nG3 dermatitis, which limited her treatment to 6 Gy boost\\nfrom the originally intended 10 Gy. Twenty-four months\\nafter initiation of her neoadjuvant AIM chemotherapy the\\npatient is alive and well with no evidence of residual tumor\\nor disease recurrence. \"\n","}\n","\n","Row

heterogeneous breast neoplasms known as\\nmetaplastic carcinomas. Metaplastic carcinomas are morphologically heterogeneous and comprise low- and high-grade\\ntumors. The current World Health Organization (WHO) classification system for these tumors includes low-grade adenosquamous carcinoma, fibromatosis-like metaplastic carcinoma,\\nsquamous cell carcinoma, spindle cell carcinoma, and carcinoma with mesenchymal differentiation.1 With the exception\\nof low-grade adenosquamous and fibromatosis-like variants,\\nmetaplastic carcinomas are typically aggressive, chemoresistant, and have a high propensity for metastasis.2,3 In one study,\\nmetaplastic carcinomas of the breast when compared to\\npoorly differentiated ductal carcinomas had higher rates of\\ndeveloping metastatic disease (21.6% vs 18.1%), locoregional recurrence (5.4% vs 2.8%), and death from disease\\nprogression (29.7% vs 4.2%).2\\nThis case was unique in several respects. This patient had a\\nmalignant spindle cell neoplasm with the differential diagnosis\\nincluding metaplastic carcinoma\\u2014spindle cell type, phyllodes\\ntumors, and primary undifferentiated sarcoma of the breast.\\nPhyllodes tumors are composed of connective tissue stroma\\nand epithelial elements, with the most aggressive being malignant phyllodes tumors (MPH), which typically demonstrate\\nstromal components exhibiting a sarcoma-like pattern. However, the absence of glandular structures provided evidence against a phyllodes tumor. Primary breast sarcomas are\\nrare, accounting for <5% of all soft tissue sarcomas and <1%\\nof all breast malignancies.5,6,7 Primary breast sarcomas often\\npresent as a unilateral, painless, well-defined mass, such as our\\npatient. Notably, they tend to be larger than epithelial breast\\ncancers with rapid increase in size. Among the subsets of\\nundifferentiated soft tissue sarcomas is the spindle cell variant,\\nwhich our case resembled histologically. However, the weak\\ncytokeratin expression of CK14 and P63 as seen in this case\\nfavored the diagnosis of metaplastic carcinoma\\u2014spindle cell\\ntype over spindle cell sarcoma. Weak keratin expression\\n(CK14 and P63) has been observed previously in spindle cell\\ncarcinoma. 8,9\\nOurs is the first reported case of spindle cell carcinoma that was treated with AIM neoadjuvant therapy, a\\nsarcoma based regimen. Due to the rarity of metaplastic\\nbreast cancer and the heterogeneity of disease presentation, a standardized approach is lacking. Instead, treatment is extrapolated from other types of breast cancer or\\nmetaplastic carcinomas of different locations. 10,11,12\\nTreatment can be modeled from those of breast sarcoma,\\nas there is some data suggesting that metaplastic tumors\\nwith predominantly sarcomatous appearance are likely to\\nbehave as sarcomas. 13 However, because primary breast\\nsarcomas are also rare, the treatment is then extrapolated\\nfrom soft tissue sarcomas of other locations (most often\\nthose of the extremity and chest wall). 5 Data on the use of\\nneoadjuvant chemotherapy, either for sarcoma or for\\nmetaplastic carcinoma, is even more sparse and treatment\\ndecisions are made on a case-by-case basis. Because negative surgical margins in sarcoma are crucial for local\\ncontrol and increased survival, preoperative systemic\\ntreatment is considered for large or locally advanced sarcomas. 14 The preoperative treatment for these large and high-risk sarcomas is usually neoadjuvant chemotherapy\\n(with or without radiation), usually with doxorubicin and\\nan alkylator. The pathological complete response (pCR)\\nafter neoadjuvant therapy was described in several studies that utilized carcinoma-type chemotherapy in metaplastic breast cancer (with inclusion of a taxane)\\nregimens, but most systemic treatment regimens were\\npoorly described. 15\\u201317\\nIn one study, 29 metaplastic breast carcinomas underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy with an overall pathological complete response rate of 17% using mostly standard\\nbreast cancer agents such as doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and taxanes.17 However, only one of these patients\\nwith a complete response was classified as having a pure\\nspindle cell type carcinoma. Given the overall poor activity\\nof standard breast regimens against this rare tumor type and\\nthe poorly described regimen in this study of metaplastic\\nbreast carcinomas, the decision was made to treat with a\\nmore traditional sarcoma regimen that would not exclude a\\nbackbone consisting of an alkylator and doxorubicin.\\nTherefore, our choice of AIM therapy seemed to be the most\\nappropriate for this rare tumor.\\nCurrent limited data regarding the efficacy of neoadjuvant regimens hint at the potential for additional research\\nand improvements in how we treat metaplastic breast cancer. For example, in the retrospective analysis of patients\\ntreated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy with anthracyclines\\nand taxanes, those with metaplastic breast cancer perform\\nworse than those with triple negative breast cancer. Given\\nthis, there are increasing consideration for use of immunotherapies and targeted agents to optimize both pathologic\\ncomplete response (pCR) and resection rates.18\\nThe post-treatment CT of the thorax had only showed\\nstable disease of the breast after three cycles of chemotherapy and thus was not indicative of a treatment effect (Figure\\n3). Due to the large size of the mass, the whole mass could\\nnot be included in the field of imaging. However, based on\\nthe available images and as measured and shown on the\\nimages, the tumor did not change significantly in size.\\nWhile dedicated breast imaging such as MRI with contrast\\ncould have better delineated areas of necrosis by evaluating\\nfor total tumor glycolysis, this was unfortunately not done.\\nIt was only after resection of tumor that the extensive treatment effect was observed. This discrepancy between\\nResponse Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)\\ncriteria and histopathologic response to neoadjuvant therapy has been described in sarcoma. 19 This may further suggest that metaplastic carcinoma\\u2014spindle cell type of the\\nbreast closely resembles the behavior of primary breast sarcoma, with excellent response to neoadjuvant therapy\\nintended for sarcomas without radiological response. In our\\npatient, the use of AIM chemotherapy was sufficient to\\ncause almost complete necrosis of the tumor prior to resection. Presently, she remains disease free 2 years after her\\ntreatment. \"\n","}\n","\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### **Upload the Dataset**\n","\n","Once the dataset is pre-annotated, it is uploaded to the Generative AI Lab.\n","\n","The Generative AI Lab is a specialized **platform** designed to facilitate the annotation process, offering tools and interfaces for annotators to work efficiently.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"vWU9l1XoiEc8"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["alab.upload_preannotations(\n","\n","    # required: name of project to upload annotations to\n","    project_name = 'Brain_Cancer_Project-Cloned',\n","\n","    # required: preannotation JSON\n","    preannotations = pre_annotations\n","    )"],"metadata":{"id":"TrsqTtUOPRlf","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1720813867853,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":5262,"user":{"displayName":"Gursev Pirge","userId":"01579888832874245157"}},"outputId":"85deb9bf-de0b-4e86-bd52-485188f750e0"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Uploading 56 preannotation(s).\n","Operation completed successfully.

Imaging examinations identified a mass measuring 25 mm in the right temporal\n","lobe. A surgical resection was performed. Upon microscopic examination, the tumor was found to consist of numerous small cells.\n","The tumor cells had scant cytoplasm, as “oat-like” or “lymphocyte-like”, and frequent mitoses could be observed (Fig. 1a). Additionally, there was a moderate proliferation of glial cells in the\n","surrounding tissue. A malignant small blue round cell tumor was\n","considered, and metastasis could not be ruled out. The immunohistochemistry showed that tumor cells were positive for CK, TTF-1,\n","synaptophysin, INSM1, p53, and were negative for vimentin, GFAP, Olig2, NeuN, CD3, and CD20 (Fig. 1bee). The Ki-67 index\n","was 80 %. Accordingly, lymphoma, glioma, and soft tissue tumors were dismissed, and metastatic SCLC was diagnosed, with further assistance of CT scanning.\n","During the evaluation of immunostaining, we noticed that NeuN was completely absent in surrounding brain tissues, in which glial cells were positive for GFAP and Olig2 (Fig. 1d and e).\n","\n","In addition, despite the mild hypercellularity of glial cells, microcytic changes and perivascular pseudorosettes were evident focally (Fig. 1a).\n","These histological features are common diagnostic clues for the low-grade glioma. Therefore, we conducted further glioma-related genetic testing to exclude the presence of a low grade glioma.\n","To our surprise, the IDH1 R132H mutation (Fig. 1f) and MGMT promoter methylation were detected, and no other glioma-related gene alterations were detected, such as 1p/19q co-deletion, CDKN2A/B deletion,\n","TERT mutations, IDH2 mutations, etc. The IDH1 R132H mutation is the hallmark genetic alteration in the tumorigenesis of glioma, and is the most prevalent mutation\n","in glioma.2 Although IDH1 R132H can also be identified in other types of cancer such as acute myeloid leukemia and chondrosarcoma, to date, no reports have shown SCLC harboring this mutant.\n","\n","The MGMT promoter methylation, a common genetic alteration in both SCLC and glioma, has no diagnostic roles but can serve as a predictive biomarker of benefit from temozolomide chemotherapy.\n","Based on the genetic and histological data, a diagnosis of astrocytoma, IDH-mutant, WHO grade 2, was confirmed. The final diagnosis was revised as an intracranial collision tumor of\n","low-grade astrocytoma and metastatic SCLC. According to the diagnosis, temozolomide was added to the chemo-radiotherapy strategy. The patient was followed up for nine months post-surgery without recurrence.\n","\n","A 71 year male (BMI = 25 kg/m2) presented with chief complaint of weakness of left upper limbs and lower limbs for 22 days. He developed sudden weakness of left hand associated with numbness. He was unable\n","to hold weight in his left hand and was unaware of things slipping off his hand. Then, he developed weakness of his left foot and was unaware of slipping off his slipper. There was no history of abnormal body\n","movement, altered behavior and memory. He didn’t give history of trauma, headache, photophobia, slurring of speech, difficulty in swallowing. He did not give history of any prior comorbidities- diabetes mellitus,\n","hypertension and family history of any malignancies. On admission, his general condition was fair (GCS- E4V2M5). Bilateral pupils were 2 mm in diameter, and reactive to light. He was alert, conscious and well oriented to time, place, person. His vital signs\n","were stable and within normal limits. There was no pallor, icterus, lymphadenopathy, edema, dehydration, cyanosis or clubbing. There was weakness in his left upper and lower limbs (muscle power was 4/5\n","and 4/5 respectively). There was no weakness in his right upper and lower limb with muscle power 5/5. Bulk and tone of his upper and lower limbs were normal. There was decreased sensation in his left hand and\n","below left knee. However, sensations of right upper and lower limbs were intact. Bilateral plantar reflex was down going. His higher mental function and cranial nerves were normal. There was no facial deviation.\n","Cerebellar sign, meningeal irritation, clonus was absent. His heart sounds S1 and S2 were normal with no murmur. His breathing sounds were normal with no added sounds. The rest of the systemic examination\n","findings were regular.\n","\n","Investigations such as hematological tests, Liver function tests (LFTs), Renal Function Tests (RFTs), Computed Tomography (CT) scan of head, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of brain with Magnetic\n","Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) were done. CT scan of head showed approximately 1.4 × 1.2 cm sized hyperdense extra-axial mass in right frontal cortex. A well-defined round solid cystic\n","lesion of 4x3cm is noted in the white matter of right parietal lobe. Areas of calcification and hemorrhage were absent. Perilesional edema was seen. Mass effect was noted in the form of effacement of adjacent sulci\n","and compression of body of right lateral ventricle. CT scan findings were suggestive of right frontal meningioma and right parietal malignant neoplastic lesion. MRI scan of brain with MRS\n","revealed solid cystic mass in front-parietal region with patchy diffusion restriction, tiny foci of blooming and patchy intense enhancement of solid component with perilesional edema and mild surrounding mass\n","effect with effacement of adjacent sulci- features suggestive of high-grade glioma.
