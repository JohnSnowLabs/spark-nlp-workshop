Accomplished:\n","1. ✅ Ingested documents from various formats\n","2. ✅ Generated LLM-powered abstractive summaries\n","3. ✅ Enriched chunks with dual context (summary + original)\n","4. ✅ Created semantic embeddings for vector search\n","5. ✅ Persisted results in efficient format\n","\n","### Pipeline Variations:\n","\n","#### Current Approach: **Document-Level Enrichment**\n","- Summarize entire document first\n","- Then split and embed\n","- Best for: Executive summaries, high-level context\n","\n","#### Alternative: **Chunk-Level Enrichment**\n","- Split document first\n","- Enrich each chunk individually\n","- Best for: Fine-grained control, section-specific summaries\n","\n","### Hallucination Mitigation:\n","- Original text preserved alongside summaries\n","- Database contains both for grounding\n","- Retrieval system can return original chunks for verification\n","\n","### Production Considerations:\n","1. **Model Selection**: Choose T5 size based on quality/speed tradeoff\n","2. **Chunk Size**: Adjust sentence detection for optimal chunk granularity\n","3. **Embedding Model**: Select BERT variant based on domain (clinical, legal, etc.)\n","4. **Vector Database**: Integrate with Pinecone, Weaviate, or Milvus\n","5. **Monitoring**: Track summary quality, embedding coherence, retrieval metrics\n","\n","---"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"1dht3-0nPBI9"},"source":["## 🚀 Next Steps\n","\n","To use this pipeline in production:\n","\n","1. **Configure your environment**:
