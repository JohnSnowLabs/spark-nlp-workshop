It is a neural network architecture that automatically detects word and character-level features using a hybrid bidirectional LSTM and CNN architecture, eliminating the need for most feature engineering steps.\n","  \n","  In the original framework, the CNN extracts a fixed length feature vector from character-level features. For each word, these vectors are concatenated and fed to the BLSTM network and then to the output layers. They employed a stacked bi-directional recurrent neural network with long short-term memory units to transform word features into named entity tag scores. The extracted features of each word are fed into a forward LSTM network and a backward LSTM network. The output of each network at each time step is decoded by a linear layer and a log-softmax layer into log-probabilities for each tag category. These two vectors are then simply added together to produce the final output. In the architecture of the proposed framework in the original paper, 50-dimensional pretrained word embeddings is used for word features, 25-dimension character embeddings is used for char features, and capitalization features (allCaps, upperInitial, lowercase, mixedCaps, noinfo) are used for case features."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"bee4b28c-dda1-4708-9240-edb6fe105013","metadata":{"id":"bee4b28c-dda1-4708-9240-edb6fe105013"},"source":["### Finance SEC NER Model\n","\n","This model detects Organizations (ORG), People (PER) and Locations (LOC) in financial texts.
