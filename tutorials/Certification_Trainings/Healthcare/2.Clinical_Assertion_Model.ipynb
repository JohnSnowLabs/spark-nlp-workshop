Its goal is to classify the assertions made on given medical concepts as being present, absent, or possible in the patient, conditionally present in the patient under certain circumstances,\n","hypothetically present in the patient at some future point, and\n","mentioned in the patient report but associated with someoneelse.\n","In the proposed implementation, input units depend on the\n","target tokens (a named entity) and the neighboring words that\n","are explicitly encoded as a sequence using word embeddings.\n","Similar to paper mentioned above,  it is observed that that 95% of the scope tokens (neighboring words) fall in a window of 9 tokens to the left and 15\n","to the right of the target tokens in the same dataset. Therefore, the same window size was implemented and it following parameters were used: learning\n","rate 0.0012, dropout 0.05, batch size 64 and a maximum sentence length 250. The model has been implemented within\n","Spark NLP as an annotator called AssertionDLModel.

For approximately four months, I've been experiencing symptoms such as feeling light-headed, battling poor digestion, dealing with anxiety attacks, depression, a sharp pain on my left side chest, an elevated heart rate, and a significant loss of weight. Due to these conditions, I was admitted to the hospital and just got discharged recently. During my hospital stay, a number of different tests were carried out by various physicians who initially struggled to pinpoint my actual medical condition. These tests included numerous blood tests, a brain MRI, an ultrasound scan, and an endoscopy. At long last, I was examined by a homeopathic doctor who finally diagnosed me with hyperthyroidism, indicating my TSH level was at a low 0.15 while my T3 and T4 levels were normal. Additionally, I was found to be deficient in vitamins B12 and D. Hence, I've been on a regimen of vitamin D supplements once a week and a daily dose of 1000 mcg of vitamin B12. I've been undergoing homeopathic treatment for the last 40 days and underwent a second test after a month which showed my TSH level increased to 0.5. While I'm noticing a slight improvement in my feelings of weakness and depression, over the last week, I've encountered two new challenges: difficulty breathing and a dramatically increased heart rate. I'm now at a crossroads where I am unsure if I should switch to allopathic treatment or continue with homeopathy. I understand that thyroid conditions take a while to improve, but I'm wondering if both treatments would require the same duration for recovery. Several of my acquaintances have recommended transitioning to allopathy and warn against taking risks, given the potential of developing severe complications. Please forgive any errors in my English and thank you for your understanding.'''"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":51,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":1000},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":2319,"status":"ok","timestamp":1724357131438,"user":{"displayName":"Akar Öztürk","userId":"07602883577262601067"},"user_tz":-120},"id":"D8Scfe2Cojzb","outputId":"e750ca0b-943f-41a6-cd64-6e6290a06db0"},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/html":["\n","<style>\n","    @import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Montserrat:wght@300;400;500;600;700&display=swap');\n","    @import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Vistol Regular:wght@300;400;500;600;700&display=swap');\n","    \n","    .spark-nlp-display-scroll-entities {\n","        border: 1px solid #E7EDF0;\n","        border-radius: 3px;\n","        text-align: justify;\n","        \n","    }\n","    .spark-nlp-display-scroll-entities span {  \n","        font-size: 14px;\n","        line-height: 24px;\n","        color: #536B76;\n","        font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif !important;\n","    }\n","    \n","    .spark-nlp-display-entity-wrapper{\n","    \n","        display: inline-grid;\n","        text-align: center;\n","        border-radius: 4px;\n","        margin: 0 2px 5px 2px;\n","        padding: 1px\n","    }\n","    .spark-nlp-display-entity-name{\n","        font-size: 14px;\n","        line-height: 24px;\n","        font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif !important;\n","        \n","        background: #f1f2f3;\n","        border-width: medium;\n","        text-align: center;\n","        \n","        font-weight: 400;\n","        \n","        border-radius: 5px;\n","        padding: 2px 5px;\n","        display: block;\n","        margin: 3px 2px;\n","    \n","    }\n","    .spark-nlp-display-entity-type{\n","        font-size: 14px;\n","        line-height: 24px;\n","        color: #ffffff;\n","        font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif !important;\n","        \n","        text-transform: uppercase;\n","        \n","        font-weight: 500;\n","\n","        display: block;\n","        padding: 3px 5px;\n","    }\n","    \n","    .spark-nlp-display-entity-resolution{\n","        font-size: 14px;\n","        line-height: 24px;\n","        color: #ffffff;\n","        font-family: 'Vistol Regular', sans-serif !important;\n","        \n","        text-transform: uppercase;\n","        \n","        font-weight: 500;\n","\n","        display: block;\n","        padding: 3px 5px;\n","    }\n","    \n","    .spark-nlp-display-others{\n","        font-size: 14px;\n","        line-height: 24px;\n","        font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif !important;\n","        \n","        font-weight: 400;\n","    }\n","\n","</style>\n"," <span class=\"spark-nlp-display-others\" style=\"background-color: white\">Hello, I am a 20-year-old woman who was diagnosed with </span><span class=\"spark-nlp-display-entity-wrapper\" style=\"background-color: #9D4176B3\"><span class=\"spark-nlp-display-entity-name\">hyperthyroidism </span><span class=\"spark-nlp-display-entity-type\">Disease</span><span class=\"spark-nlp-display-entity-resolution\" style=\"background-color: #9D4176FF\">Present_Or_Past </span></span><span class=\"spark-nlp-display-others\" style=\"background-color: white\"> around a month ago.
