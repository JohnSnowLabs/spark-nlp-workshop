Its goal is to classify the assertions made on given medical concepts as being present, absent, or possible in the patient, conditionally present in the patient under certain circumstances,\n","hypothetically present in the patient at some future point, and\n","mentioned in the patient report but associated with someoneelse.\n","In the proposed implementation, input units depend on the\n","target tokens (a named entity) and the neighboring words that\n","are explicitly encoded as a sequence using word embeddings.\n","Similar to paper mentioned above,  it is observed that that 95% of the scope tokens (neighboring words) fall in a window of 9 tokens to the left and 15\n","to the right of the target tokens in the same dataset. Therefore, the same window size was implemented and it following parameters were used: learning\n","rate 0.0012, dropout 0.05, batch size 64 and a maximum sentence length 250. The model has been implemented within\n","Spark NLP as an annotator called AssertionDLModel.
