While current support is focused on MPNet-based Few-Shot Assertion models, future updates will extend compatibility to include other popular models like Bert, DistillBert, and Roberta.\n","\n","This classifier model supports various classifier types, including sklearn's LogisticRegression and custom PyTorch models, providing flexibility for different model setups.
