years prior to presentation and subsequent type two diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ), one prior episode of HTG-induced pancreatitis three years prior to presentation , associated with an acute hepatitis , and obesity with a body mass index ( BMI ) of 33.5 kg/m2 , presented with a one-week history of polyuria , polydipsia , poor appetite , and vomiting . \n","Two weeks prior to presentation , she was treated with a five-day course of amoxicillin for a respiratory tract infection . She was on metformin , glipizide , and dapagliflozin for T2DM and atorvastatin and gemfibrozil for HTG . She had been on dapagliflozin for six months at the time of presentation . Physical examination on presentation was significant for dry oral mucosa ; significantly , her abdominal examination was benign with no tenderness , guarding , or rigidity . \n","Pertinent laboratory findings on admission were : serum glucose 111 mg/dl , bicarbonate 18 mmol/l , anion gap 20 , creatinine 0.4 mg/dL , triglycerides 508 mg/dL , total cholesterol 122 mg/dL , glycated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) 10% , and venous pH 7.27 . Serum lipase was normal at 43 U/L . Serum acetone levels could not be assessed as blood samples kept hemolyzing due to significant lipemia . \n","The patient was initially admitted for starvation ketosis , as she reported poor oral intake for three days prior to admission . However , serum chemistry obtained six hours after presentation revealed her glucose was 186 mg/dL , the anion gap was still elevated at 21 , serum bicarbonate was 16 mmol/L , triglyceride level peaked at 2050 mg/dL , and lipase was 52 U/L . \n","The β-hydroxybutyrate level was obtained and found to be elevated at 5.29 mmol/L - the original sample was centrifuged and the chylomicron layer removed prior to analysis due to interference from turbidity caused by lipemia again . The patient was treated with an insulin drip for euDKA and HTG with a reduction in the anion gap to 13 and triglycerides to 1400 mg/dL , within 24 hours . \n","Her euDKA was thought to be precipitated by her respiratory tract infection in the setting of SGLT2 inhibitor use . The patient was seen by the endocrinology service and she was discharged on 40 units of insulin glargine at night , 12 units of insulin lispro with meals , and metformin 1000 mg two times a day . \n","It was determined that all SGLT2 inhibitors should be discontinued indefinitely . She had close follow-up with endocrinology post discharge .\"\"\"\n","\n","greedy_result =

Here we describe the genomicorganization of the KCNJ9 locus on chromosome 1q21-23 as a candidate gene forType II diabetes mellitus in the Pima Indian population. The gene spansapproximately 7.6 kb and contains one noncoding and two coding exons separated byapproximately 2.2 and approximately 2.6 kb introns, respectively. We identified14 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), including one that predicts aVal366Ala substitution, and an 8 base-pair (bp) insertion/deletion. Ourexpression studies revealed the presence of the transcript in various humantissues including pancreas, and two major insulin-responsive tissues: fat andskeletal muscle. The characterization of the KCNJ9 gene should facilitate furtherstudies on the function of the KCNJ9 protein and allow evaluation of thepotential role of the locus in Type II diabetes.BACKGROUND: At present, it is one of the most important issues for the treatment of breast cancer to develop the standard therapy for patients previously treated with anthracyclines and taxanes. With the objective of determining the usefulnessof vinorelbine monotherapy in patients with advanced or recurrent breast cancerafter standard therapy, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of
