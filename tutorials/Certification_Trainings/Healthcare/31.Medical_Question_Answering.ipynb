A retrospective review was performed on 52 cases with a histologic diagnosis of acute chorioamnionitis from 2,051 deliveries at University Hospital, Newark, from January 2003 to July 2003. Third-trimester placentas without histologic chorioamnionitis (n = 52) served as controls. Cases and controls were selected sequentially. Maternal medical records were reviewed for indicators of maternal infection. Histologic chorioamnionitis was significantly associated with the usage of antibiotics (p = 0.0095) and a higher mean white blood cell count (p = 0.018).

Post hoc analysis of data from a proof-of-concept, double-blind, randomized study of 134 adult patients treated with esomeprazole (10 or 40 mg od for 4 weeks) for LA grade C or D oesophagitis. A curve was fitted to pooled 24-h intragastric pH (day 5) and endoscopically assessed healing (4 weeks) data using piecewise quadratic logistic regression. Maximal reflux oesophagitis healing rates were achieved when intragastric pH>4 was achieved for approximately 50-70% (12-17 h) of the 24-h period.

The puncture was extended to create a 1.5-cm incision using a pull-type sphincterotome, and a double-channel endoscope was advanced into the peritoneal cavity. The peritoneal cavity was insufflated with air through the endoscope. The spleen was visualized. The splenic vessels were ligated with endoscopic loops and clips, and then mesentery was dissected using electrocautery. Endoscopic splenectomy was performed on six pigs. There were no complications during gastric incision and entrance into the peritoneal cavity. Visualization of the spleen and other intraperitoneal organs was very good. Ligation of the splenic vessels and mobilization of the spleen were achieved using commercially available devices and endoscopic accessories.\"\n","question = \"Transgastric endoscopic splenectomy: is it possible?\"\n","\n","light_model = LightPipeline(model)\n","\n","light_result = light_model.annotate([question],[context])\n","\n","light_result"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":14,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":12,"status":"ok","timestamp":1759258248105,"user":{"displayName":"Mehmet DaÄŸ","userId":"14052875917891496135"},"user_tz":-180},"id":"4gAvcFCvzlcV","outputId":"6b269024-a732-4057-8d30-37b5207ac557"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["['per - oral transgastric splenectomy was technically feasible in a porcine model. further studies are necessary to determine the safety and efficacy of this procedure in']"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":14}],"source":["light_result[0][\"answer\"]"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"xQXWo7_tAPOk"},"source":["## clinical_notes_qa_base_onnx"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":15,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":3225,"status":"ok","timestamp":1759258255030,"user":{"displayName":"Mehmet DaÄŸ","userId":"14052875917891496135"},"user_tz":-180},"id":"pCVHc48DAcfx","outputId":"fd4d569c-e298-4075-aaec-0eb075388cbe"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["clinical_notes_qa_base_onnx download started this may take some time.\n","Approximate size to download 963.7 MB\n","[OK!]\n"]}],"source":["document_assembler = MultiDocumentAssembler()\\\n","    .setInputCols(\"question\", \"context\")\\\n","    .setOutputCols(\"document_question\", \"document_context\")\n","\n","med_qa  = MedicalQuestionAnswering().pretrained(\"clinical_notes_qa_base_onnx\", \"en\", \"clinical/models\")\\\n","    .setInputCols([\"document_question\", \"document_context\"])\\\n","    .setCustomPrompt(\"Context: {context} \\n Question: {question} \\n Answer: \")\\\n","    .setOutputCol(\"answer\")\\\n","\n","pipeline = Pipeline(stages=[document_assembler, med_qa])\n","\n","empty_data = spark.createDataFrame([[\"\"]]).toDF(\"text\")\n","\n","model = pipeline.fit(empty_data)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":16,"metadata":{"id":"TKjoplswWlai","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1759258255283,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":250,"user":{"displayName":"Mehmet DaÄŸ","userId":"14052875917891496135"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["note_text = '''\n","  Patient with a past medical history of hypertension for 15 years.\n","  (Medical Transcription Sample Report)\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:\n","  The patient is a 74-year-old white woman who has a past medical history of hypertension for 15 years, history of CVA with no residual hemiparesis and uterine cancer with pulmonary metastases, who presented for evaluation of recent worsening of the hypertension.
