        "LLMLoader is designed to interact with a LLMs that are converted into gguf format. This module allows using John Snow Labs' licensed LLMs at various sizes that are finetuned on medical context for certain tasks. It provides various methods for setting parameters, loading models, generating text, and retrieving metadata. The LLMLoader includes methods for setting various parameters such as input prefix, suffix, cache prompt, number of tokens to predict, sampling techniques, temperature, penalties, and more. Overall, the LLMLoader provides a flexible and extensible framework for interacting with language models in a Python and Scala environment using PySpark and Java."
