0,Gastroenterology," PROCEDURES PERFORMED: Colonoscopy. INDICATIONS: Renewed symptoms likely consistent with active flare of Inflammatory Bowel Disease, not responsive to conventional therapy including sulfasalazine, cortisone, local therapy. PROCEDURE: Informed consent was obtained prior to the procedure with special attention to benefits, risks, alternatives. Risks explained as bleeding, infection, bowel perforation, aspiration pneumonia, or reaction to the medications. Vital signs were monitored by blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation. Supplemental O2 given. Specifics discussed. Preprocedure physical exam performed. Stable vital signs. Lungs clear. Cardiac exam showed regular rhythm. Abdomen soft. Her past history, her past workup, her past visitation with me for Inflammatory Bowel Disease, well responsive to sulfasalazine reviewed. She currently has a flare and is not responding, therefore, likely may require steroid taper. At the same token, her symptoms are mild. She has rectal bleeding, essentially only some rusty stools. There is not significant diarrhea, just some lower stools. No significant pain. Therefore, it is possible that we are just dealing with a hemorrhoidal bleed, therefore, colonoscopy now needed. Past history reviewed. Specifics of workup, need for followup, and similar discussed. All questions answered. A normal digital rectal examination was performed. The PCF-160 AL was inserted into the anus and advanced to the cecum without difficulty, as identified by the ileocecal valve, cecal stump, and appendical orifice. All mucosal aspects thoroughly inspected, including a retroflexed examination. Withdrawal time was greater than six minutes. Unfortunately, the terminal ileum could not be intubated despite multiple attempts. Findings were those of a normal cecum, right colon, transverse colon, descending colon. A small cecal polyp was noted, this was biopsy-removed, placed in bottle #1. Random biopsies from the cecum obtained, bottle #2; random biopsies from the transverse colon obtained, as well as descending colon obtained, bottle #3. There was an area of inflammation in the proximal sigmoid colon, which was biopsied, placed in bottle #4. There was an area of relative sparing, with normal sigmoid lining, placed in bottle #5, randomly biopsied, and then inflammation again in the distal sigmoid colon and rectum biopsied, bottle #6, suggesting that we may be dealing with Crohn disease, given the relative sparing of the sigmoid colon and junk lesion. Retroflexed showed hemorrhoidal disease. Scope was then withdrawn, patient left in good condition. IMPRESSION: Active flare of Inflammatory Bowel Disease, question of Crohn disease. PLAN: I will have the patient follow up with me, will follow up on histology, follow up on the polyps. She will be put on a steroid taper and make an appointment and hopefully steroids alone will do the job. If not, she may be started on immune suppressive medication, such as azathioprine, or similar. All of this has been reviewed with the patient. All questions answered."
1,Gastroenterology," OPERATION 1. Ivor-Lewis esophagogastrectomy. 2. Feeding jejunostomy. 3. Placement of two right-sided #28-French chest tubes. 4. Right thoracotomy. ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal anesthesia with a dual-lumen tube. OPERATIVE PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: After obtaining informed consent from the patient, including a thorough explanation of the risks and benefits of the aforementioned procedure, the patient was taken to the operating room and general endotracheal anesthesia was administered. Prior to administration of general anesthesia, the patient had an epidural anesthesia placed. In addition, he had a dual-lumen endotracheal tube placed. The patient was placed in the supine position to begin the procedure. His abdomen and chest were prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion. After applying sterile dressings, a #10-blade scalpel was used to make an upper midline incision from the level of the xiphoid to just below the umbilicus. Dissection was carried down through the linea using Bovie electrocautery. The abdomen was opened. Next, a Balfour retractor was positioned as well as a mechanical retractor. Next, our attention was turned to freeing up the stomach. In an attempt to do so, we identified the right gastroepiploic artery and arcade. We incised the omentum and retracted it off the stomach and gastroepiploic arcade. The omentum was divided using suture ligature with 2-0 silk. We did this along the greater curvature and then moved to the lesser curvature where the short gastric arteries were taken down with ligation using 2-0 silk. Next, we turned our attention to performing a Kocher maneuver. This was done and the stomach was freed up. We took down the falciform ligament as well as the caudate attachment to the diaphragm. We enlarged the diaphragmatic hiatus so as to be able to place approximately 3 fingers into the chest. We also did a portion of the esophageal dissection from the abdomen into the chest area. The esophagus and the esophageal hiatus were identified in the abdomen. We next turned our attention to the left gastric artery. The left gastric artery was identified at the base of the stomach. We first took the left gastric vein by ligating and dividing it using 0 silk ties. The left gastric artery was next taken using suture ligature with silk ties followed by 2-0 stick tie reinforcement. At this point the stomach was freely mobile. We then turned our attention to performing our jejunostomy feeding tube. A 2-0 Vicryl pursestring was placed in the jejunum approximately 20 cm distal to the ligament of Treitz. We then used Bovie electrocautery to open the jejunum at this site. We placed a 16-French red rubber catheter through this site. We tied down in place. We then used 3-0 silk sutures to perform a Witzel. Next, the loop of jejunum was tacked up to the abdominal wall using 2-0 silk ties. After doing so and pulling the feeding jejunostomy out through the skin and securing it appropriately, we turned our attention to closing the abdomen. This was done with #1 Prolene. We put in a 2nd layer of 2-0 Vicryl. The skin was closed with 4-0 Monocryl. Next, we turned our attention to performing the thoracic portion of the procedure. The patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position. The right chest was prepped and draped appropriately. We then used a #10 blade scalpel to make an incision in a posterolateral, non-muscle-sparing fashion. Dissection was carried down to the level of the ribs with Bovie electrocautery. Next, the ribs were counted and the 5th interspace was entered. The lung was deflated. We placed standard chest retractors. Next, we incised the peritoneum over the esophagus. We dissected the esophagus to just above the azygos vein. The azygos vein, in fact, was taken with 0 silk ligatures and reinforced with 2-0 stick ties. As mentioned, we dissected the esophagus both proximally and distally down to the level of the hiatus. After doing this, we backed our NG tube out to above the level where we planned to perform our pursestring. We used an automatic pursestring and applied. We then transected the proximal portion of the stomach with Metzenbaum scissors. We secured our pursestring and then placed a 28 anvil in the divided proximal portion of the esophagus. The pursestring was then tied down without difficulty. Next, we tabularized our stomach using a #80 GIA stapler. After doing so, we chose a portion of the stomach more distally and opened it using Bovie electrocautery. We placed our EEA stapler through it and then punched out through the gastric wall. We connected our anvil to the EEA stapler. This was then secured appropriately. We checked to make sure that there was appropriate muscle apposition. We then fired the stapler. We obtained 2 complete rings, 1 of the esophagus and 1 of the stomach, which were sent for pathology. We also sent the gastroesophageal specimen for pathology. Of note was the fact that the frozen section showed no evidence of tumor and in the proximal distal margins. We then turned our attention to closing the gastrostomy opening. This was closed with 2-0 Vicryl in a running fashion. We then buttressed this with serosal 3-0 Vicryl interrupted sutures. We returned the newly constructed gastroesophageal anastomosis into the chest and covered it by covering the pleura over it. Next, we placed two #28-French chest tubes, 1 anteriorly and 1 posteriorly, taking care not to place it near the anastomosis. We then closed the chest with #2 Vicryl in an interrupted figure-of-eight fashion. The lung was brought up. We closed the muscle layers with #0 Vicryl followed by #0 Vicryl; then we closed the subcutaneous layer with 2-0 Vicryl and the skin with 4-0 Monocryl. Sterile dressing was applied. The instrument and sponge count was correct at the end of the case. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was extubated in the operating room and transferred to the ICU in good condition."
2,Gastroenterology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Gastroesophageal reflux disease. 2. Chronic dyspepsia. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Gastroesophageal reflux disease. 2. Chronic dyspepsia. 3. Alkaline reflux gastritis. 4. Gastroparesis. 5. Probable Billroth II anastomosis. 6. Status post Whipple's pancreaticoduodenectomy. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Esophagogastroduodenoscopy with biopsies. INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: This is a 55-year-old African-American female who had undergone Whipple's procedure approximately five to six years ago for a benign pancreatic mass. The patient has pancreatic insufficiency and is already on replacement. She is currently using Nexium. She has continued postprandial dyspepsia and reflux symptoms. To evaluate this, the patient was boarded for EGD. The patient gave informed consent for the procedure. GROSS FINDINGS: At the time of EGD, the patient was found to have alkaline reflux gastritis. There was no evidence of distal esophagitis. Gastroparesis was seen as there was retained fluid in the small intestine. The patient had no evidence of anastomotic obstruction and appeared to have a Billroth II reconstruction by gastric jejunostomy. Biopsies were taken and further recommendations will follow. PROCEDURE: The patient was taken to the Endoscopy Suite. The heart and lungs examination were unremarkable. The vital signs were monitored and found to be stable throughout the procedure. The patient's oropharynx was anesthetized with Cetacaine spray. She was placed in left lateral position. The patient had the video Olympus GIF gastroscope model inserted per os and was advanced without difficulty through the hypopharynx. GE junction was in normal position. There was no evidence of any hiatal hernia. There was no evidence of distal esophagitis. The gastric remnant was entered. It was noted to be inflamed with alkaline reflux gastritis. The anastomosis was open and patent. The small intestine was entered. There was retained fluid material in the stomach and small intestine and _______ gastroparesis. Biopsies were performed. Insufflated air was removed with withdrawal of the scope. The patient's diet will be adjusted to postgastrectomy-type diet. Biopsies performed. Diet will be reviewed. The patient will have an upper GI series performed to rule out more distal type obstruction explaining the retained fluid versus gastroparesis. Reglan will also be added. Further recommendations will follow."
3,Gastroenterology," PROCEDURE: Colonoscopy. PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Rectal bleeding and perirectal abscess. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Perianal abscess. MEDICATIONS: MAC. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The Olympus pediatric variable colonoscope was introduced through the rectum and advanced carefully through the colon into the cecum and then through the ileocecal valve into the terminal ileum. The preparation was excellent and all surfaces were well seen. The mucosa throughout the colon and in the terminal ileum was normal, with no evidence of colitis. Special attention was paid to the rectum, including retroflexed views of the distal rectum and the anorectal junction. There was no evidence of either inflammation or a fistulous opening. The scope was withdrawn. A careful exam of the anal canal and perianal area demonstrated a jagged 8-mm opening at the anorectal junction posteriorly (12 o'clock position). Some purulent material could be expressed through the opening. There was no suggestion of significant perianal reservoir of inflamed tissue or undrained material. Specifically, the posterior wall of the distal rectum and anal canal were soft and unremarkable. In addition, scars were noted in the perianal area. The first was a small dimpled scar, 1 cm from the anal verge in the 11 o'clock position. The second was a dimpled scar about 5 cm from the anal verge on the left buttock's cheek. There were no other abnormalities noted. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was sent to the recovery room. FINAL DIAGNOSES: 1. Normal colonoscopy to the terminal ileum. 2. Opening in the skin at the external anal verge, consistent with drainage from a perianal abscess, with no palpable abscess at this time, and with no evidence of fistulous connection to the bowel lumen. RECOMMENDATIONS: 1. Continue antibiotics. 2. Followup with Dr. X. 3. If drainage persists, consider surgical drainage."
4,Gastroenterology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right colon tumor. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Right colon cancer. 2. Ascites. 3. Adhesions. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: 1. Exploratory laparotomy. 2. Lysis of adhesions. 3. Right hemicolectomy. ANESTHESIA: General. COMPLICATIONS: None. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Less than 200 cc. URINE OUTPUT: 200 cc. CRYSTALLOIDS GIVEN: 2700 cc. INDICATIONS FOR THIS PROCEDURE: The patient is a 53-year-old African-American female who presented with near obstructing lesion at the hepatic flexure. The patient underwent a colonoscopy which found this lesion and biopsies were taken proving invasive adenocarcinoma. The patient was NG decompressed preoperatively and was prepared for surgery. The need for removal of the colon cancer was explained at length. The patient was agreeable to proceed with the surgery and signed preoperatively informed consent. PROCEDURE: The patient was taken to the Operative Suite and placed in the supine position under general anesthesia per Anesthesia Department and NG and Foley catheters were placed preoperatively. She was given triple antibiotics IV. Due to her near obstructive symptoms, a formal ________ was not performed. The abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. A midline laparotomy incision was made with a #10 blade scalpel and subcutaneous tissues were separated with electrocautery down to the anterior abdominal fascia. Once divided, the intraabdominal cavity was accessed and bowel was protected as the rest of the abdominal wall was opened in the midline. Extensive fluid was seen upon entering the abdomen, ascites fluid, which was clear straw-colored and this was sampled for cytology. Next, the small bowel was retracted with digital exploration and there was a evidence of hepatic flexure, colonic mass, which was adherent to the surrounding tissues. With mobilization of the colon along the line of Toldt down to the right gutter, the entire ileocecal region up to the transverse colon was mobilized into the field. Next, a window was made 5 inches from the ileocecal valve and a GIA-75 was fired across the ileum. Next, a second GIA device was fired across the proximal transverse colon, just sparring the middle colic artery. The dissection was then carried down along the mesentry, down to the root of the mesentry. Several lymph nodes were sampled carefully, and small radiopaque clips were applied along the base of the mesentry. The mesentry vessels are hemostated and tied with #0-Vicryl suture sequentially, ligated in between. Once this specimen was submitted to pathology, the wound was inspected. There was no evidence of bleeding from any of the suture sites. Next, a side-by-side anastomosis was performed between the transverse colon and the terminal ileum. A third GIA-75 was fired side-by-side and GIA-55 was used to close the anastomosis. A patent anastomosis was palpated. The anastomosis was then protected with a #2-0 Vicryl #0-muscular suture. Next, the mesenteric root was closed with a running #0-Vicryl suture to prevent any chance of internal hernia. The suture sites were inspected and there was no evidence of leakage. Next, the intraabdominal cavity was thoroughly irrigated with sterile saline and the anastomosis was carried into the right lower gutter. Omentum was used to cover the intestines which appeared dilated and indurated from the near obstruction. Next, the abdominal wall was reapproximated and the fascial layer using a two running loop PDS sutures meeting in the middle with good approximation of both the abdominal fascia. Additional sterile saline was used to irrigate the subcutaneous fat and then the skin was closed with sequential sterile staples. Sterile dressing was applied and the skin was cleansed and the patient was awakened from anesthesia without difficulty and extubated in the Operating Room and she was transferred to Recovery Room in stable condition and will be continued to be monitored on the Telemetry Floor with triple antibiotics and NG decompression."
5,Gastroenterology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS (ES): 1. Cholelithiasis. 2. Cholecystitis. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS (ES): 1. Acute perforated gangrenous cholecystitis. 2. Cholelithiasis. PROCEDURE: 1. Attempted laparoscopic cholecystectomy. 2. Open cholecystectomy. ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal anesthesia. COUNTS: Correct. COMPLICATIONS: None apparent. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 275 mL. SPECIMENS: 1. Gallbladder. 2. Lymph node. DRAINS: One 19-French round Blake. DESCRIPTION OF THE OPERATION: After consent was obtained and the patient was properly identified, the patient was transported to the operating room and after induction of general endotracheal anesthesia, the patient was prepped and draped in a normal sterile fashion. After infiltration with local, a vertical incision was made at the umbilicus and utilizing graspers, the underlying fascia was incised and was divided sharply. Dissecting further, the peritoneal cavity was entered. Once this done, a Hasson trocar was secured with #1 Vicryl and the abdomen was insufflated without difficulty. A camera was placed into the abdomen and there was noted to be omentum overlying the subhepatic space. A second trocar was placed in the standard fashion in the subxiphoid area; this was a 10/12 mm non-bladed trocar. Once this was done, a grasper was used to try and mobilize the omentum and a second grasper was added in the right costal margin; this was a 5-mm port placed, it was non-bladed and placed in the usual fashion under direct visualization without difficulty. A grasper was used to mobilize free the omentum which was acutely friable and after a significant time-consuming effort was made to mobilize the omentum, it was clear that the gallbladder was well incorporated by the omentum and it would be unsafe to proceed with a laparoscopy procedure and then the procedure was converted to open. The trocars were removed and a right subcostal incision was made incorporating the 10/12 subxiphoid port. The subcutaneous space was divided with electrocautery, as well as the muscles and fascia. The Bookwalter retraction system was then set up and retractors were placed to provide exposure to the right subhepatic space. Then utilizing a right-angle and electrocautery, the omentum was freed from the gallbladder. An ensuing retrograde cholecystectomy was performed, in which, electrocautery and blunt dissection were used to mobilize the gallbladder from the gallbladder fossa; this was done down to the infundibulum. After meticulous dissection, the cystic artery was identified and it was ligated between 3-0 silks. Several other small ties were placed on smaller bleeding vessels and the cystic duct was identified, was skeletonized, and a 3-0 stick tie was placed on the proximal portion of it. After it was divided, the gallbladder was freed from the field. Once this was done, the liver bed was inspected for hemostasis and this was achieved with electrocautery. Copious irrigation was also used. A 19-French Blake drain was placed in Morrison's pouch lateral to the gallbladder fossa and was secured in place with 2-0 nylon; this was a 19-French round Blake. Once this was done, the umbilical port was closed with #1 Vicryl in an interrupted fashion and then the wound was closed in two layers with #1 Vicryl in an interrupted fashion. The skin was closed with and absorbable stitch. The patient was then awakened from anesthesia, extubated, and transported to the recovery room in stable condition."
6,Gastroenterology," The patient was taken to the GI lab and placed in the left lateral supine position. Continuous pulse oximetry and blood pressure monitoring were in place during the procedure. After informed consent was obtained, the video endoscope was inserted over the dorsum of the tongue without difficulty. The scope was advanced down the esophagus and into the body of the stomach. The scope was further advanced to the pylorus and into the duodenum. The duodenum was visualized well into its second portion and was free of stricture, neoplasm, or ulceration. Retroflexion view of the fundus was normal without evidence of abnormality. The scope was then slowly removed. The patient tolerated the procedure well."
7,Gastroenterology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Gastrostomy (gastrocutaneous fistula). POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Gastrostomy (gastrocutaneous fistula). OPERATION PERFORMED: Surgical closure of gastrostomy. ANESTHESIA: General. INDICATIONS: This 1-year-old child had a gastrostomy placed due to feeding difficulties. Since then, he has reached a point where he is now eating completely by mouth and no longer needed the gastrostomy. The tube was, therefore, removed, but the tract has not shown signs of spontaneous closure. He, therefore, comes to the operating room today for surgical closure of his gastrostomy. OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: After the induction of general anesthetic, the abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual manner. An elliptical incision was made around the gastrostomy site and carried down through skin and subcutaneous tissue with sharp dissection. The tract and the stomach were freed. Stay sutures were then placed on either side of the tract. The tract was amputated. The intervening stomach was then closed with interrupted #4-0 Lembert, Nurolon sutures. The fascia was then closed over the stomach using #3-0 Vicryl sutures. The skin was closed with #5-0 subcuticular Monocryl. A dressing was applied, and the child was awakened and taken to the recovery room in satisfactory condition."
8,Gastroenterology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Acute acalculous cholecystitis. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Acute hemorrhagic cholecystitis. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Open cholecystectomy. ANESTHESIA: Epidural with local. COMPLICATIONS: None. DISPOSITION: The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to recovery in stable condition. SPECIMEN: Gallbladder. BRIEF HISTORY: The patient is a 73-year-old female who presented to ABCD General Hospital on 07/23/2003 secondary to a fall at home from which the patient suffered a right shoulder as well as hip fracture. The patient subsequently went to the operating room on 07/25/2003 for a right hip hemiarthroplasty per the Orthopedics Department. Subsequently, the patient was doing well postoperatively, however, the patient does have severe O2 and steroid-dependent COPD and at an extreme risk for any procedure. The patient began developing abdominal pain over the course of the next several days and a consultation was requested on 08/07/2003 for surgical evaluation for upper abdominal pain. During the evaluation, the patient was found to have an acute acalculous cholecystitis in which nonoperative management was opted for and on 08/08/03, the patient underwent a percutaneous cholecystostomy tube placement to drain the gallbladder. The patient did well postdrainage. The patient's laboratory values and biliary values returned to normal and the patient was planned for a removal of the tube with 48 hours of the tubing clamp. However, once the tube was removed, the patient re-obstructed with recurrent symptoms and a second tube was needed to be placed; this was done on 08/16/2003. A HIDA scan had been performed, which showed no cystic duct obstruction. A tube cholecystogram was performed, which showed no cystic or common duct obstruction. There was abnormal appearance of the gallbladder, however, the pathway was patent. Thus after failure of two nonoperative management therapies, extensive discussions were made with the family and the patient's only option was to undergo a cholecystectomy. Initial thoughts were to do a laparoscopic cholecystectomy, however, with the patient's severe COPD and risk for ventilator management, the options were an epidural and an open cholecystectomy under local was made and to be performed. INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS: The patient's gallbladder had some patchy and necrosis areas. There were particular changes on the serosal surface as well as on the mucosal surface with multiple clots within the gallbladder. The patient also had no plane between the gallbladder and the liver bed. OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: After informed written consent, risks and benefits of the procedure were explained to the patient and discussed with the patient's family. The patient was brought to the operating room after an epidural was performed per anesthesia. Local anesthesia was given with 1% lidocaine. A paramedian incision was made approximately 5 cm in length with a #15 blade scalpel. Next, hemostasis was obtained using electro Bovie cautery. Dissection was carried down transrectus in the midline to the posterior rectus fascia, which was grasped with hemostats and entered with a #10 blade scalpel. Next, Metzenbaum scissors were used to extend the incision and the abdomen was entered . The gallbladder was immediately visualized and brought up into view, grasped with two ring clamps elevating the biliary tree into view. Dissection with a ______ was made to identify the cystic artery and cystic duct, which were both easily identified. The cystic artery was clipped, two distal and one proximal to the gallbladder cutting between with Metzenbaum scissors. The cystic duct was identified. A silk tie #3-0 silk was placed one distal and one proximal with #3-0 silk and then cutting in between with a Metzenbaum scissors. The gallbladder was then removed from the liver bed using electro Bovie cautery. A plane was created. The hemostasis was obtained using the electro Bovie cautery as well as some Surgicel. The gallbladder was then removed as specimen, sent to pathology for frozen sections for diagnosis, of which the hemorrhagic cholecystitis was diagnosed on frozen sections. Permanent sections are still pending. The remainder of the fossa was hemostatic with the Surgicel and attention was next made to closing the abdomen. The peritoneum as well as posterior rectus fascia was approximated with a running #0 Vicryl suture and then the anterior rectus fascia was closed in interrupted figure-of-eight #0 Vicryl sutures. Skin staples were used on the skin and sterile dressings were applied and the patient was transferred to recovery in stable condition."

10,Gastroenterology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Abdominal wall abscess. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Abdominal wall abscess. PROCEDURE: Incision and drainage (I&D) of abdominal abscess, excisional debridement of nonviable and viable skin, subcutaneous tissue and muscle, then removal of foreign body. ANESTHESIA: LMA. INDICATIONS: Patient is a pleasant 60-year-old gentleman, who initially had a sigmoid colectomy for diverticular abscess, subsequently had a dehiscence with evisceration. Came in approximately 36 hours ago with pain across his lower abdomen. CT scan demonstrated presence of an abscess beneath the incision. I recommended to the patient he undergo the above-named procedure. Procedure, purpose, risks, expected benefits, potential complications, alternatives forms of therapy were discussed with him, and he was agreeable to surgery. FINDINGS: The patient was found to have an abscess that went down to the level of the fascia. The anterior layer of the fascia was fibrinous and some portions necrotic. This was excisionally debrided using the Bovie cautery, and there were multiple pieces of suture within the wound and these were removed as well. TECHNIQUE: Patient was identified, then taken into the operating room, where after induction of appropriate anesthesia, his abdomen was prepped with Betadine solution and draped in a sterile fashion. The wound opening where it was draining was explored using a curette. The extent of the wound marked with a marking pen and using the Bovie cautery, the abscess was opened and drained. I then noted that there was a significant amount of undermining. These margins were marked with a marking pen, excised with Bovie cautery; the curette was used to remove the necrotic fascia. The wound was irrigated; cultures sent prior to irrigation and after achievement of excellent hemostasis, the wound was packed with antibiotic-soaked gauze. A dressing was applied. The finished wound size was 9.0 x 5.3 x 5.2 cm in size. Patient tolerated the procedure well. Dressing was applied, and he was taken to recovery room in stable condition."
11,Gastroenterology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Esophageal foreign body. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Esophageal foreign body, US penny. PROCEDURE: Esophagoscopy with foreign body removal. ANESTHESIA: General. INDICATIONS: The patient is a 17-month-old baby girl with biliary atresia, who had a delayed diagnosis and a late attempted Kasai portoenterostomy, which failed. The patient has progressive cholestatic jaundice and is on the liver transplant list at ABCD. The patient is fed by mouth and also with nasogastric enteral feeding supplements. She has had an __________ cough and relatively disinterested in oral intake for the past month. She was recently in the GI Clinic and an x-ray was ordered to check her tube placement and an incidental finding of a coin in the proximal esophagus was noted. Based on the history, it is quite possible this coin has been there close to a month. She is brought to the operating room now for attempted removal. I met with the parents and talked to them at length about the procedure and the increased risk in a child with a coin that has been in for a prolonged period of time. Hopefully, there will be no coin migration or significant irrigation that would require prolonged hospitalization. OPERATIVE FINDINGS: The patient had a penny lodged in the proximal esophagus in the typical location. There was no evidence of external migration and surrounding irritation was noted, but did not appear to be excessive. The coin actually came out with relative ease after which endoscopically identified. DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: The patient came to the operating room and had induction of general anesthesia. She was slow to respond to the usual propofol and other inducing agents and may be has some difficulty with tolerance or __________ tolerance to these medications. After her endotracheal tube was placed and securely taped to the left side of her mouth, I positioned the patient with a prominent shoulder roll and neck hyperextension and then used the laryngoscope to elevate the tiny glottic mechanism. A rigid esophagoscope was then inserted into the proximal esophagus, and the scope was gradually advanced with the lumen directly in frontal view. This was facilitated by the nasoenteric feeding tube that was in place, which I followed carefully until the edge of the coin could be seen. At this location, there was quite a bit of surrounding mucosal inflammation, but the coin edge could be clearly seen and was secured with the coin grasping forceps. I then withdrew the scope, forceps, and the coin as one unit, and it was easily retrieved. The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no intraoperative complications. There was only one single coin noted, and she was awakened and taken to the recovery room in good condition."
12,Gastroenterology," PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: Following a barium enema prep and lidocaine ointment to the rectal vault, perirectal inspection and rectal exam were normal. The Olympus video colonoscope then introduced into the rectum and passed by directed vision to the distal descending colon. Withdrawal notes an otherwise normal descending, rectosigmoid and rectum. Retroflexion noted no abnormality of the internal ring. No hemorrhoids were noted. Withdrawal from the patient terminated the procedure."
13,Gastroenterology," PREPROCEDURE DIAGNOSIS: Abdominal pain, diarrhea, and fever. POSTPROCEDURE DIAGNOSIS: Pending pathology. PROCEDURES PERFORMED: Colonoscopy with multiple biopsies, including terminal ileum, cecum, hepatic flexure, and sigmoid colon. INDICATIONS: The patient is a 28-year-old female with history of abdominal pain, diarrhea, and fever. Colonoscopy is indicated to evaluate for etiology. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the endoscopy suite with IV fluids being administered. She was given a total of 300 mcg of fentanyl and 15 mg of Versed, titrated for conscious IV sedation. Her heart rate, heart rhythm, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation were monitored throughout the procedure. She remained hemodynamically stable throughout the procedure. The procedure began with a digital rectal examination. The scope was then placed through the anus and advanced without difficulty to the terminal ileum. There was what appeared to be some inflammation of the terminal ileum. This was biopsied. The scope was then withdrawn into the cecum, where biopsies were obtained. The scope was then slowly withdrawn throughout the entire length of the colon. The prep was adequate, but multiple syringes of irrigation were necessary to irrigate out some of the residual stool and allow for better visualization of the colonic mucosa. There was an area of induration and inflammation at the hepatic flexure. This was biopsied. The scope was again withdrawn throughout the length of the colon. There was also some area of inflammation in the sigmoid colon with narrowing. Again, these findings were seen on the way in with the colonoscope and were not due to scope trauma or the procedure itself. Further biopsies were obtained of the sigmoid colon in this area of narrowing. Total biopsies included terminal ileum, cecum, hepatic flexure, and sigmoid colon. The scope was then withdrawn into the rectum. Retroflexion showed a normal-appearing anal canal with no internal hemorrhoids or fissures. Other than the areas of inflammation, there were no other abnormalities identified, no AV malformations, no polyps, no diverticulum. The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no immediate postprocedure complications."
14,Gastroenterology," The patient is a 60-year-old male, who self-reported history of head and neck cancer status post 35 radiation treatments and 6 weeks of chemotherapy between March 2008 and July 2008. The patient was referred for an outpatient speech and language pathology consult to increase speech and swallowing abilities. The patient is currently NPO with G-tube to meet all of his hydration and nutritional needs. He has been NPO since April 2008. The patient also has a trach, which she is currently using finger occlusion to achieve voicing. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Lortab. PREVIOUS MEDICAL HISTORY: Cardiac stent in 2000. PATIENT'S GOAL: To eat again by mouth. STUDY: A trial of Passy-Muir valve was completed to allow the patient to achieve hands-free voicing and also to improve his secretion management. A clinical swallow evaluation was not completed due to the severity of the patient's mucus and lack of saliva control. The patient's laryngeal area was palpated during a dry swallow and he does have significantly reduced laryngeal elevation and radiation fibrosis. The further evaluate of his swallowing function is safety; a modified barium swallow study needs to be concluded to objectively evaluate his swallow safety, and to rule out aspiration. A trial of neuromuscular electrical stimulation therapy was completed to determine if this therapy protocol will be beneficial and improving the patient's swallowing function and safety. For his neuromuscular electrical stimulation therapy, the type was BMR with a single mode cycle time is 4 seconds and 12 seconds off with frequency was 60 __________ with a ramp of 2 seconds, phase duration was 220 with an output of 99 milliamps. Electrodes were placed on the suprahyoid/submandibular triangle with an upright body position, trial length was 10 minutes. On a pain scale, the patient reported no pain with the electrical stimulation therapy. FINDINGS: The patient was able to tolerate a 5-minute placement of the Passy-Muir valve. He reported no discomfort on the inhalation; however, he felt some resistance on exhalation. Instructions were given on care placement and cleaning of the Passy-Muir valve. The patient was instructed to buildup tolerance over the next several days of his Passy-Muir valve and to remove the valve at anytime or he is going to be sleeping or napping throughout the day. The patient's voicing did improve with the Passy-Muir valve due to decreased leakage from his trach secondary to finger occlusion. Mucus production also seemed to decrease when the Passy-Muir was placed. On the dry swallow during this evaluation, the patient's laryngeal area is reduced and tissues around his larynx and showed radiation fibrosis. The patient's neck range of motion appears to be adequate and within normal limits. A trial of neuromuscular electrical stimulation therapy: The patient tolerating the neuromuscular electrical stimulation, we did achieve poor passive response, but these muscles were contracting and the larynx was moving upon stimulation. The patient was able to actively swallow with stimulation approximately 30% of presentation. DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION: The patient with a history of head and neck cancer status post radiation and chemotherapy with radiation fibrosis, which is impeding his swallowing abilities. The patient would benefit from outpatient skilled speech therapy for neuromuscular electrical stimulation for muscle reeducation to improve his swallowing function and safety and he would benefit from a placement of a Passy-Muir valve to have hands-free communication. PLAN OF CARE: Outpatient skilled speech therapy two times a week to include neuromuscular electrical stimulation therapy, Passy-Muir placement and a completion of the modified barium swallow study. SHORT-TERM GOALS (6 WEEKS): 1. Completion of modified barium swallow study. 2. The patient will coordinate volitional swallow with greater than 75% of the neuromuscular electrical stimulations. 3. The patient will increase laryngeal elevation by 50% for airway protection. 4. The patient will tolerate placement of Passy-Muir valve for greater than 2 hours during awaking hours. 5. The patient will tolerate therapeutic feedings with the speech and language pathologist without signs and symptoms of aspiration. 6. The patient will decrease mild facial restrictions to the anterior neck by 50% to increase laryngeal movement. LONG-TERM GOALS (8 WEEKS): 1. The patient will improve secretion management to tolerable levels. 2. The patient will increase amount and oral consistency of p.o. intake tolerated without signs and symptoms of aspirations. 3. The patient will be able to communicate without using finger occlusion with the assistance of a Passy-Muir valve."
15,Gastroenterology," DIAGNOSIS ON ADMISSION: Gastrointestinal bleed. DIAGNOSES ON DISCHARGE 1. Gastrointestinal bleed, source undetermined, but possibly due to internal hemorrhoids. 2. Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. 3. Hypothyroidism. PROCEDURE: Colonoscopy. FINDINGS: Poor prep with friable internal hemorrhoids, but no gross lesions, no source of bleed. HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the emergency room by Dr. X. He apparently had an NG tube placed in the emergency room with gastric aspirate revealing no blood. Dr. Y Miller saw him in consultation and recommended a colonoscopy. A bowel prep was done. H&Hs were stable. His most recent H&H was 38.6/13.2 that was this morning. His H&H at admission was 41/14.3. The patient had the bowel prep that revealed no significant bleeding. His vital signs are stable. He is continuing on his usual medications of Imdur, metoprolol, and Synthroid. His Plavix is discontinued. He is given IV Protonix. I am hesitant to use Prilosec or Protonix because of his history of pancreatitis associated with Prilosec. The patient's PT/INR was 1.03, PTT 25.8. Chemistry panel was unremarkable. The patient was given a regular diet after his colonoscopy today. He tolerated it well and is being discharged home. He will be followed closely as an outpatient. He will continue his Pepcid 40 mg at night, Imdur, Synthroid, and metoprolol as prior to admission. He will hold his Plavix for now. They will call me for further dark stools and will avoid Pepto-Bismol. They will follow up in the office on Thursday."
16,Gastroenterology," EXAM: CT abdomen without contrast and pelvis without contrast, reconstruction. REASON FOR EXAM: Right lower quadrant pain, rule out appendicitis. TECHNIQUE: Noncontrast CT abdomen and pelvis. An intravenous line could not be obtained for the use of intravenous contrast material. FINDINGS: The appendix is normal. There is a moderate amount of stool throughout the colon. There is no evidence of a small bowel obstruction or evidence of pericolonic inflammatory process. Examination of the extreme lung bases appear clear, no pleural effusions. The visualized portions of the liver, spleen, adrenal glands, and pancreas appear normal given the lack of contrast. There is a small hiatal hernia. There is no intrarenal stone or evidence of obstruction bilaterally. There is a questionable vague region of low density in the left anterior mid pole region, this may indicate a tiny cyst, but it is not well seen given the lack of contrast. This can be correlated with a followup ultrasound if necessary. The gallbladder has been resected. There is no abdominal free fluid or pathologic adenopathy. There is abdominal atherosclerosis without evidence of an aneurysm. Dedicated scans of the pelvis disclosed phleboliths, but no free fluid or adenopathy. There are surgical clips present. There is a tiny airdrop within the bladder. If this patient has not had a recent catheterization, correlate for signs and symptoms of urinary tract infection. IMPRESSION: 1.Normal appendix. 2.Moderate stool throughout the colon. 3.No intrarenal stones. 4.Tiny airdrop within the bladder. If this patient has not had a recent catheterization, correlate for signs and symptoms of urinary tract infection. The report was faxed upon dictation."

19,Gastroenterology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Biliary colic and biliary dyskinesia. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Biliary colic and biliary dyskinesia. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy. ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal. COMPLICATIONS: None. DISPOSITION: The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to recovery in stable condition. BRIEF HISTORY: This patient is a 42-year-old female who presented to Dr. X's office with complaints of upper abdominal and back pain, which was sudden onset for couple of weeks. The patient is also diabetic. The patient had a workup for her gallbladder, which showed evidence of biliary dyskinesia. The patient was then scheduled for laparoscopic cholecystectomy for biliary colic and biliary dyskinesia. INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS: The patient's abdomen was explored. There was no evidence of any peritoneal studding or masses. The abdomen was otherwise within normal limits. The gallbladder was easily visualized. There was an intrahepatic gallbladder. There was no evidence of any inflammatory change. PROCEDURE: After informed written consent, the risks and benefits of the procedure were explained to the patient. The patient was brought into the operating suite. After general endotracheal intubation, the patient was prepped and draped in normal sterile fashion. Next, an infraumbilical incision was made with a #10 scalpel. The skin was elevated with towel clips and a Veress needle was inserted. The abdomen was then insufflated to 15 mmHg of pressure. The Veress needle was removed and a #10 blade trocar was inserted without difficulty. The laparoscope was then inserted through this #10 port and the abdomen was explored. There was no evidence of any peritoneal studding. The peritoneum was smooth. The gallbladder was intrahepatic somewhat. No evidence of any inflammatory change. There were no other abnormalities noted in the abdomen. Next, attention was made to placing the epigastric #10 port, which again was placed under direct visualization without difficulty. The two #5 ports were placed, one in the midclavicular and one in the anterior axillary line again in similar fashion under direct visualization. The gallbladder was then grasped out at its fundus, elevated to patient's left shoulder. Using a curved dissector, the cystic duct was identified and freed up circumferentially. Next, an Endoclip was used to distal and proximal to the gallbladder, Endoshears were used in between to transect the cystic duct. The cystic artery was transected in similar fashion. Attention was next made in removing the gallbladder from the liver bed using electrobovie cautery and spatulated tip. It was done without difficulty. The gallbladder was then grasped via the epigastric port and removed without difficulty and sent to pathology. Hemostasis was maintained using electrobovie cautery. The liver bed was then copiously irrigated and aspirated. All the fluid and air was then aspirated and then all ports were removed under direct visualization. The two #10 ports were then closed in the fascia with #0 Vicryl and a UR6 needle. The skin was closed with a running subcuticular #4-0 undyed Vicryl. 0.25% Marcaine was injected and Steri-Strips and sterile dressings were applied. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to Recovery in stable condition."
20,Gastroenterology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Protein-calorie malnutrition. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Protein-calorie malnutrition. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube. ANESTHESIA: Conscious sedation per Anesthesia. SPECIMEN: None. COMPLICATIONS: None. HISTORY: The patient is a 73-year-old male who was admitted to the hospital with some mentation changes. He was unable to sustain enough caloric intake and had markedly decreased albumin stores. After discussion with the patient and the son, they agreed to place a PEG tube for nutritional supplementation. PROCEDURE: After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the endoscopy suite. He was placed in the supine position and was given IV sedation by the Anesthesia Department. An EGD was performed from above by Dr. X. The stomach was transilluminated and an optimal position for the PEG tube was identified using the single poke method. The skin was infiltrated with local and the needle and sheath were inserted through the abdomen into the stomach under direct visualization. The needle was removed and a guidewire was inserted through the sheath. The guidewire was grasped from above with a snare by the endoscopist. It was removed completely and the Ponsky PEG tube was secured to the guidewire. The guidewire and PEG tube were then pulled through the mouth and esophagus and snug to the abdominal wall. There was no evidence of bleeding. Photos were taken. The Bolster was placed on the PEG site. A complete dictation for the EGD will be done separately by Dr. X. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to recovery room in stable condition. He will be started on tube feedings in 6 hours with aspiration precautions and dietary to determine his nutritional goal."
21,Gastroenterology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Feeding disorder. 2. Down syndrome. 3. Congenital heart disease. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Feeding disorder. 2. Down syndrome. 3. Congenital heart disease. OPERATION PERFORMED: Gastrostomy. ANESTHESIA: General. INDICATIONS: This 6-week-old female infant had been transferred to Children's Hospital because of Down syndrome and congenital heart disease. She has not been able to feed well and in fact has to now be NG tube fed. Her swallowing mechanism does not appear to be very functional, and therefore, it was felt that in order to aid in her home care that she would be better served with a gastrostomy. OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: After the induction of general anesthetic, the abdomen was prepped and draped in usual manner. Transverse left upper quadrant incision was made and carried down through skin and subcutaneous tissue with sharp dissection. The muscle was divided and the peritoneal cavity entered. The greater curvature of the stomach was grasped with a Babcock clamp and brought into the operative field. The site for gastrostomy was selected and a pursestring suture of #4-0 Nurolon placed in the gastric wall. A 14-French 0.8 cm Mic-Key tubeless gastrostomy button was then placed into the stomach and the pursestring secured about the tube. Following this, the stomach was returned to the abdominal cavity and the posterior fascia was closed using a #4-0 Nurolon affixing the stomach to the posterior fascia. The anterior fascia was then closed with #3-0 Vicryl, subcutaneous tissue with the same, and the skin closed with #5-0 subcuticular Monocryl. The balloon was inflated to the full 5 mL. A sterile dressing was then applied and the child awakened and taken to the recovery room in satisfactory condition."
22,Gastroenterology," EXAM: CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis without and with intravenous contrast. CLINICAL INDICATION: Left lower quadrant abdominal pain. COMPARISON: None. FINDINGS: CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was performed without and with intravenous contrast. Total of 100 mL of Isovue was administered intravenously. Oral contrast was also administered. The lung bases are clear. The liver is enlarged and decreased in attenuation. There are no focal liver masses. There is no intra or extrahepatic ductal dilatation. The gallbladder is slightly distended. The adrenal glands, pancreas, spleen, and left kidney are normal. A 12-mm simple cyst is present in the inferior pole of the right kidney. There is no hydronephrosis or hydroureter. The appendix is normal. There are multiple diverticula in the rectosigmoid. There is evidence of focal wall thickening in the sigmoid colon (image #69) with adjacent fat stranding in association with a diverticulum. These findings are consistent with diverticulitis. No pneumoperitoneum is identified. There is no ascites or focal fluid collection. The aorta is normal in contour and caliber. There is no adenopathy. Degenerative changes are present in the lumbar spine. IMPRESSION: Findings consistent with diverticulitis. Please see report above."

MEDICATIONS: Tramadol 50 mg every 4 to 6 hours p.r.n., hydrocodone 7.5 mg/500 mg every 6 hours p.r.n., zolpidem 10 mg at bedtime, triamterene 37.5 mg, atenolol 50 mg, vitamin D, TriCor 145 mg, simvastatin 20 mg, ibuprofen 600 mg t.i.d., and Lyrica 75 mg. FAMILY HISTORY: Mother is age 78 with history of mesothelioma. Father is alive, but unknown medical history as they have been estranged. She has a 51-year-old sister with history of multiple colon polyps. She has 2 brothers, 1 of whom has schizophrenia, but she knows very little about their medical history. To the best of her knowledge, there are no family members with stomach cancer or colon cancer. SOCIAL HISTORY: She was born in Houston, Texas and moved to Florida about 3 years ago. She is divorced. She has worked as a travel agent. She has 2 sons ages 24 and 26, both of whom are alive and well. She smokes a half a pack of cigarettes per day for more than 35 years. She does not consume alcohol. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: As per the form filled out in our office today is positive for hypertension, weakness in arms and legs, arthritis, pneumonia, ankle swelling, getting full quickly after eating, loss of appetite, weight loss, which is stated as fluctuating up and down 4 pounds, trouble swallowing, heartburn, indigestion, belching, nausea, diarrhea, constipation, change in bowel habits, change in consistency, rectal bleeding, hemorrhoids, abdominal discomfort and cramping associated with constipation, hepatitis A or infectious hepatitis in the past, and smoking and alcohol as previously stated. Otherwise, review of systems is negative for strokes, paralysis, gout, cataracts, glaucoma, respiratory difficulties, tuberculosis, chest pain, heart disease, kidney stones, hematuria, rheumatic fever, scarlet fever, cancer, diabetes, thyroid disease, seizure disorder, blood transfusions, anemia, jaundice, or pruritus. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Weight 152 pounds. Height is 5 feet 3 inches. Blood pressure 136/80. Pulse 68. In general: She is a well-developed and well-nourished female who ambulates with the assistance of a cane. Neurologically nonfocal. Awake, alert, and oriented x 3. HEENT: Head normocephalic, atraumatic. Sclerae anicteric. Conjunctivae are pink. Mouth is moist without any obvious oral lesions. Neck is supple. There is no submandibular, submaxillary, axillary, supraclavicular, or epitrochlear adenopathy appreciable. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Heart: Regular rate and rhythm without obvious gallops or murmurs. Abdomen is soft, nontender with good bowel sounds. No organomegaly or masses are appreciable. Extremities are without clubbing, cyanosis, and/or edema. Skin is warm and dry. Rectal was deferred and will be done at the time of the colonoscopy. IMPRESSION: 1. A 50-year-old female whose 51-year-old sister has a history of multiple colon polyps, which may slightly increase her risk for colon cancer in the future. 2. Reports of recurrent bright red blood per rectum, mostly on the toilet paper over the past year. Bleeding most likely consistent with internal hemorrhoids; however, she needs further evaluation for colon polyps or colon cancer. 3. Alternations between constipation and diarrhea for the past several years with some lower abdominal cramping and discomfort particularly associated with constipation. She is on multiple medications including narcotics and may have developed narcotic bowel syndrome. 4. A long history of pyrosis, dyspepsia, nausea, and belching for many years relieved by antacids. She may likely have underlying gastroesophageal reflux disease. 5. A 1-year history of some early satiety and fluctuations in her weight up and down 4 pounds. She may also have some GI dysmotility including gastroparesis. 6. Report of dysphagia to solids over the past several years with a history of a bone spur in her cervical spine. If this bone spur is pressing anteriorly, it could certainly cause recurrent symptoms of dysphagia. Differential also includes peptic stricture or Schatzki's ring, and even remotely, the possibility of an esophageal malignancy. 7. A history of infectious hepatitis in the past with some recent mild elevations in AST and ALT levels without clear etiology. She may have some reaction to her multiple medications including her statin drugs, which can cause mild elevations in transaminases. She may have some underlying fatty liver disease and differential could include some form of viral hepatitis such as hepatitis B or even C. PLAN: 1. We have asked her to follow up with her primary care physician with regard to this recent elevation in her transaminases. She will likely have the lab tests repeated in the future, and if they remain persistently elevated, we will be happy to see her in the future for further evaluation if her primary care physician would like. 2. Discussed reflux precautions and gave literature for further review. 3. Schedule an upper endoscopy with possible esophageal dilatation, as well as colonoscopy with possible infrared coagulation of suspected internal hemorrhoids. Both procedures were explained in detail including risks and complications such as adverse reaction to medication, as well as respiratory embarrassment, infection, bleeding, perforation, and possibility of missing a small polyp or tumor. 4. Alternatives including upper GI series, flexible sigmoidoscopy, barium enema, and CT colonography were discussed; however, the patient agrees to proceed with the plan as outlined above. 5. Due to her sister's history of colon polyps, she will likely be advised to have a repeat colonoscopy in 5 years or perhaps sooner pending the results of her baseline examination."
24,Gastroenterology," HISTORY: Reason for ICU followup today is acute anemia secondary to upper GI bleeding with melena with dropping hemoglobin from 11 to 8, status post transfusion of 2 units PRBCs with EGD performed earlier today by Dr. X of Gastroenterology confirming diagnosis of ulcerative esophagitis, also for continuing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation with productive cough, infection and shortness of breath. Please see dictated ICU transfer note yesterday detailing the need for emergent transfer transfusion and EGD in this patient. Over the last 24 hours, the patient has received 2 units of packed red blood cells and his hematocrit and hemoglobin have returned to their baseline of approximately 11 appropriate for hemoglobin value. He also underwent EGD earlier today with Dr. X. I have discussed the case with him at length earlier this afternoon and the patient had symptoms of ulcerative esophagitis with no active bleeding. Dr. X recommended to increase the doses of his proton pump inhibitor and to avoid NSAIDs in the future. The patient today complains that he is still having issues with shortness of breath and wheezing and productive cough, now producing yellow-brown sputum with increasing frequency, but he has had no further episodes of melena since transfer to the ICU. He is also complaining of some laryngitis and some pharyngitis, but is denying any abdominal complaints, nausea, or diarrhea. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION VITAL SIGNS: Blood pressure is 100/54, heart rate 80 and temperature 98.8. Is and Os negative fluid balance of 1.4 liters in the last 24 hours. GENERAL: This is a somnolent 68-year-old male, who arouses to voice, wakes up, seems to have good appetite, has continuing cough. Pallor is improved. EYES: Conjunctivae are now pink. ENT: Oropharynx is clear. CARDIOVASCULAR: Reveals distant heart tones with regular rate and rhythm. LUNGS: Have coarse breath sounds with wheezes, rhonchi, and soft crackles in the bases. ABDOMEN: Soft and nontender with no organomegaly appreciated. EXTREMITIES: Showed no clubbing, cyanosis or edema. Capillary refill time is now normal in the fingertips. NEUROLOGICAL: Cranial nerves II through XII are grossly intact with no focal neurological deficits. LABORATORY DATA: Laboratories drawn at 1449 today, WBC 10, hemoglobin and hematocrit 11.5 and 33.1, and platelets 288,000. This is up from 8.6 and 24.7. Platelets are stable. Sodium is 134, potassium 4.0, chloride 101, bicarb 26, BUN 19, creatinine 1.0, glucose 73, calcium 8.4, INR 0.96, iron 13%, saturations 4%, TIBC 312, TSH 0.74, CEA elevated at 8.6, ferritin 27.5 and occult blood positive. EGD, final results pending per Dr. X's note and conversation with me earlier, ulcerative esophagitis without signs of active bleeding at this time. IMPRESSION/PLAN 1. Melena secondary to ulcerative esophagitis. We will continue to monitor the patient overnight to ensure there is no further bleeding. If there are no further episodes of melena and hemoglobin is stable or unchanged in the morning, the patient will be transferred back to medical floor for continuing treatment of his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation. 2. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation. The patient is doing well, taking PO. We will continue him on his oral Omnicef and azithromycin and continuing breathing treatments. We will add guaifenesin and N-acetyl-cysteine in a hope to mobilize some of his secretions. This does appear to be improving. His white count is normalized and I am hopeful we can discharge him on oral antibiotics within the next 24 to 48 hours if there are no further complications. 3. Elevated CEA. The patient will need colonoscopy on an outpatient basis. He has refused this today. We would like to encourage him to do so. Of note, the patient when he came in was on bloodless protocol, but with urging did accept the transfusion. Similarly, I am hoping that with proper counseling, the patient will consent to further examination with colonoscopy given his guaiac-positive status, elevated CEA and risk factors. 4. Anemia, normochromic normocytic with low total iron binding capacity. This appears to be anemia of chronic disease. However, this is likely some iron deficiency superimposed on top of this given his recent bleeding, with consider iron, vitamin C, folate and B12 supplementation and discharge given his history of alcoholic malnutrition and recent gastrointestinal bleeding. Total critical care time spent today discussing the case with Dr. X, examining the patient, reviewing laboratory trends, adjusting medications and counseling the patient in excess is 35 minutes."
25,Gastroenterology," PRESENTATION: A 16-year-old male presents to the emergency department (ED) with rectal bleeding and pain on defecation. HISTORY: A 16-year-old African American male presents to the ED with a chief complaint of rectal bleeding and pain on defecation. The patient states that he was well until about three days prior to presentation when he first started to experience some pain when defecating. The following day he noted increasing pain and first noted blood on the surface of his stool. The pain worsened on the subsequent day with increasing bleeding as well as some mucopurulent anal discharge. The patient denies any previous history of rectal bleeding or pain. He also denies any previous sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and states that he was screened for HIV infection eight months ago and was negative. The patient does state that he has not felt well for the past week. He states that he had felt &quot;feverish&quot; on several occasions but has not taken his temperature. He has also complained of some abdominal discomfort with nausea and diarrhea as well as generalized myalgias and fatigue. He thinks he has lost a few pounds but has not been weighing himself to determine the exact amount of weight loss. The patient states that he has been sexually active since age 13. He admits to eight previous partners and states that he &quot;usually&quot; uses a condom. On further questioning, the patient states that of his eight partners, three were female and five were male. His most recent sexual partner was a 38-year-old man whom he has been with for the past six months. He states that he has been tested for STDs in the past but states that he only gave urine and blood for the testing. He is unaware of the HIV status of his partner but assumes that the partner is uninfected because he looks healthy. The patient also admits to one episode of sexual abuse at the age of 8 by a friend of the family. As the man was a member of the family's church, the patient never felt comfortable disclosing this to any of the adults in his life. He is very concerned about disclosure of his sexual behavior to his family, as they have expressed very negative comments concerning men who have sex with men. He is accessing care in the ED unaccompanied by an adult. PHYSICAL EXAM: Thin but non-toxic young man with clear discomfort. Pulse = 105 RR = 23 BP = 120/62 HEENT: Several areas of white plaque-like material on the buccal mucosa. Neck: Multiple anterior/posterior cervical nodes in both anterior and posterior chains- 1-2 cm in diameter. Lungs: Clear to auscultation. Cardiac: Quiet precordium. Nl S1/S2 with a II/VI systolic murmur. Abdomen: Soft without hepatosplenomegaly. GU: Tanner V male with no external penile lesions. Lymph: 2-3 cm axillary nodes bilaterally. 1-2 cm epitrochlear nodes. Multiple 1-2 cm inguinal nodes. Rectal: Extremely painful digital exam. + gross blood and mucous. LABORATORY EVALUATION: Hbg = 12. 5 gm/dL Hct = 32% WBC = 3.9 thou/&micro;L Platelets = 120,000 thou/&micro;L 76% neutrophils 19% lymphocytes 1% eosinophils 4% monocytes ALT = 82 U/L AST= 90 U/L Erythrocyte sedimentation rate = 90 Electrolytes = normal Gram stain of anal swab: numerous WBCs DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: This patient is presenting with acute rectal pain with bleeding and anal discharge. The patient also presents with some constitutional symptoms including fever, fatigue, abdominal discomfort, and adenopathy on physical examination. The following are in the differential diagnosis: Acute Proctitis and Proctocolitis. ACUTE HIV SEROCONVERSION: This subject is sexually active and reports inconsistent condom use. Gastrointestinal symptoms have recently been reported commonly in patients with a history of HIV seroconversion. The rectal symptoms of bleeding and pain are not common with HIV, and an alternative diagnosis would be required. PERIRECTAL ABSCESS: A patient with a history of receptive anal intercourse is at risk for developing a perirectal abscess either from trauma or a concurrent STD. The patient could experience more systemic symptoms with fever and malaise, as found with this patient. However, the physical examination did not reveal the typical localized area of pain and edema. DIAGNOSIS: The subject had rectal cultures obtained, which were positive for Neisseria gonorrhoeae. An HIV ELISA was positive, as was the RNA PCR. DISCUSSION: This patient demonstrates a number of key issues to consider when caring for an adolescent or young adult. First, the patient utilized the emergency department for care as opposed to identifying a primary care provider. Although not ideal in many circumstances, testing for HIV infection is crucial when there is suspicion, since many newly diagnosed patients identify earlier contacts with health care providers when HIV counseling and testing were not performed. Second, this young man has had both male and female sexual partners. As young people explore their sexuality, asking about partners in an open, nonjudgmental manner without applying labels is integral to helping the young person discuss their sexual behaviors. Assuming heterosexuality is a major barrier to disclosure for many young people who have same-sex attractions. Third, screening for STDs must take into account sexual behaviors. Although urine-based screening has expanded testing of young people, it misses anal and pharyngeal infections. If a young person is only having receptive oral or anal intercourse, urine screening is insufficient to rule out STDs. Fourth, this young man had both localized and systemic symptoms. As his anal symptoms were most suggestive of a current STD, performing an HIV test should be part of the standard evaluation. In addition, as acute infection is on the differential diagnosis, PCR testing should also be considered. The care provided to this young man included the following. He was treated presumptively for proctitis with both IM ceftriaxone as well as oral doxycycline to treat N gonorrhoeae and C trachomatis. Ceftriaxone was chosen due to the recent reports of resistant N gonorrhoeae. At the time of the diagnosis, the young man was given the opportunity to meet with the case manager from the adolescent-specific HIV program. The case manager linked this young man directly to care after providing brief counseling and support. The case manager maintained contact with the young man until his first clinical visit four days later. Over the subsequent three months, the young man had two sets of laboratory testing to stage his HIV infection. Set #1 CD4 T-lymphocyte count = 225 cells/mm3, 15% Quantitative RNA PCR = 75,000 copies/mL Set #2 CD4 T-lymphocyte count = 385 cells/mm3, 21% Quantitative RNA PCR = 12,000 copies/mL The risks and benefits of ART were discussed over three clinical visits. This patient agreed with not starting ART and following his CD4 and viral loads every three months."
26,Gastroenterology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Colon polyps. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Universal diverticulosis. 2. Nonsurgical internal hemorrhoids. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Total colonoscopy with photos. ANESTHESIA: Demerol 100 mg IV with Versed 3 mg IV. SPECIMENS: None. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal. INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: The patient is a 62-year-old white male who presents to the office with a history of colon polyps and need for recheck. PROCEDURE: Informed consent was obtained. All risks and benefits of the procedure were explained and all questions were answered. The patient was brought back to the Endoscopy Suite where he was connected to cardiopulmonary monitoring. Demerol 100 mg IV and Versed 3 mg IV was given in a titrated fashion until appropriate anesthesia was obtained. Upon appropriate anesthesia, a digital rectal exam was performed, which showed no masses. The colonoscope was then placed into the anus and the air was insufflated. The scope was then advanced under direct vision into the rectum, rectosigmoid colon, descending colon, transverse colon, ascending colon until it reached the cecum. Upon entering the sigmoid colon and throughout the rest of the colon, there was noted diverticulosis. After reaching the cecum, the scope was fully withdrawn visualizing all walls again noting universal diverticulosis. Upon reaching the rectum, the scope was then retroflexed upon itself and there was noted to be nonsurgical internal hemorrhoids. The scope was then subsequently removed. The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no complications."
27,Gastroenterology," PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS: Esophageal foreign body, no associated comorbidities are noted. PROCEDURE: Esophagoscopy with removal of foreign body. CPT CODE: 43215. PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS: Esophageal foreign body, ICD-9 code 935.1. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: Under general anesthesia, flexible EGD was performed. Esophagus was visualized. The quarter was visualized at the aortic knob, was removed with grasper. Estimated blood loss 0. Intravenous fluids during time of procedure 100 mL. No tissues. No complications. The patient tolerated the procedure well. Dr. X Pipkin attending pediatric surgeon was present throughout the entire procedure. The patient was transferred from OR to PACU in stable condition."
28,Gastroenterology," The patient was placed in left lateral decubitus position and the above medications were administered. The colonoscope was advanced to the cecum, as identified by the ileocecal valve, appendiceal orifice, and blind pouch. The colonoscope was slowly withdrawn and a careful examination of the colonic mucosa was made, including a retroflexed view of the rectum. The remainder of the examination was normal to the cecum. The patient tolerated the procedure well without complication."
29,Gastroenterology," HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Connor is a 50-year-old female who returns to clinic for a wound check. The patient underwent an APR secondary to refractory ulcerative colitis. Subsequently, she developed a wound infection, which has since healed. On our most recent visit to our clinic, she has her perineal stitches removed and presents today for followup of her perineal wound. She describes no drainage or erythema from her bottom. She is having good ostomy output. She does not describe any fevers, chills, nausea, or vomiting. The patient does describe some intermittent pain beneath the upper portion of the incision as well as in the right lower quadrant below her ostomy. She has been taking Percocet for this pain and it does work. She has since run out has been trying extra strength Tylenol, which will occasionally help this intermittent pain. She is requesting additional pain medications for this occasional abdominal pain, which she still experiences. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Temperature 95.8, pulse 68, blood pressure 132/73, and weight 159 pounds. This is a pleasant female in no acute distress. The patient's abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended with a well-healed midline scar. There is an ileostomy in the right hemiabdomen, which is pink, patent, productive, and protuberant. There are no signs of masses or hernias over the patient's abdomen. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: This is a pleasant 50-year-old female who has undergone an APR secondary to refractory ulcerative colitis. Overall, her quality of life has significantly improved since she had her APR. She is functioning well with her ileostomy. She did have concerns or questions about her diet and we discussed the BRAT diet, which consisted of foods that would slow down the digestive tract such as bananas, rice, toast, cheese, and peanut butter. I discussed the need to monitor her ileostomy output and preferential amount of daily output is 2 liters or less. I have counseled her on refraining from soft drinks and fruit drinks. I have also discussed with her that this diet is moreover a trial and error and that she may try certain foods that did not agree with her ileostomy, however others may and that this is something she will just have to perform trials with over the next several months until she finds what foods that she can and cannot eat with her ileostomy. She also had questions about her occasional abdominal pain. I told her that this was probably continue to improve as months went by and I gave her a refill of her Percocet for the continued occasional pain. I told her that this would the last time I would refill the Percocet and if she has continued pain after she finishes this bottle then she would need to start ibuprofen or Tylenol if she had continued pain. The patient then brought up some right hand and arm numbness, which has been there postsurgically and was thought to be from positioning during surgery. This is all primarily gone away except for a little bit of numbness at the tip of the third digit as well as some occasional forearm muscle cramping. I told her that I felt that this would continue to improve as it has done over the past two months since her surgery. I told her to continue doing hand exercises as she has been doing and this seems to be working for her. Overall, I think she has healed from her surgery and is doing very well. Again, her quality of life is significantly improved. She is happy with her performance. We will see her back in six months just for a general routine checkup and see how she is doing at that time."
30,Gastroenterology," ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: Symptomatic cholelithiasis. DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: Symptomatic cholelithiasis. SERVICE: Surgery. CONSULTS: None. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. ABC is a 27-year-old woman who apparently presented with complaint of symptomatic cholelithiasis. She was afebrile. She was taken by Dr. X to the operating room. HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient underwent a procedure. She tolerated without difficulty. She had her pain controlled with p.o. pain medicine. She was afebrile. She is tolerating liquid diet. It was felt that the patient is stable for discharge. She did complain of bladder spasms when she urinated and she did say that she has a history of chronic UTIs. We will check a UA and urine culture prior to discharge. I will give her prescription for ciprofloxacin that she can take for 3 days presumptively and I have discharged her home with omeprazole and Colace to take over-the-counter for constipation and we will send her home with Percocet for pain. Her labs were within normal limits. She did have an elevated white blood cell count, but I believe this is just leukemoid reaction, but she is afebrile, and if she does have UTI, may also be related. Her labs in terms of her bilirubin were within normal limits. Her LFTs were slightly elevated, I do believe this is related to the cautery used on the liver bed. They were 51 and 83 for the AST and ALT respectively. I feel that she looks good for discharge. DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: Clear liquid diet x48 hours and she can return to her Medifast, she may shower. She needs to keep her wound clean and dry. She is not to engage in any heavy lifting greater than 10 pounds x2 weeks. No driving for 1 to 2 weeks. She must be able to stop in an emergency and be off narcotic meds, no strenuous activity, but she needs to maintain mobility. She can resume her medications per med rec sheets. DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: As previously mentioned. FOLLOWUP: We will follow up on both urinalysis and cultures. She is instructed to follow up with Dr. X in 2 weeks. She needs to call for any shortness of breath, temperature greater than 101.5, chest pain, intractable nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, any redness, swelling or foul smelling drainage from her wounds."
31,Gastroenterology," REASON FOR CONSULTATION: Pneumatosis coli in the cecum. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is an 87-year-old gentleman who was admitted on 10/27/07 with weakness and tiredness with aspiration pneumonia. The patient is very difficult to obtain information from; however, he appears to be having frequent nausea and vomiting with an aspiration pneumonia and abdominal discomfort. In addition, this hospitalization, he has undergone an upper endoscopy, which found a small ulcer after dropping his hematocrit and becoming anemic. He had a CT scan on Friday, 11/02/07, which apparently showed pneumatosis and his cecum worrisome for ischemic colitis as well as bilateral hydronephrosis and multiple liver lesions, which could be metastatic disease versus cysts. In discussions with the patient, he had multiple bowel movements yesterday and is currently passing flatus and has epigastric pain. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Obtained from the medical chart. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, history of pneumonia, and aspiration pneumonia, osteoporosis, alcoholism, microcytic anemia. MEDICATIONS: Per his current medical chart. ALLERGIES: NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES. SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient had a long history of smoking but quit many years ago. He does have chronic alcohol use. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: GENERAL: A very thin white male who is dyspneic and having difficulty breathing at the moment. VITAL SIGNS: Afebrile. Heart rate in the 100s to 120s at times with atrial fibrillation. Respiratory rate is 17-20. Blood pressure 130s-150s/60s-70s. NECK: Soft and supple, full range of motion. HEART: Regular. ABDOMEN: Distended with tenderness mainly in the upper abdomen but very difficult to localize due to his difficulty providing information. He does appear to have tenderness but does not have rebound and does not have peritoneal signs. DIAGNOSTICS: A CT scan done on 11/02/07 shows pneumatosis in the cecum with an enlarged cecum filled with stool and air fluid levels with chronically dilated small bowel. ASSESSMENT: Possible ischemic cecum with possible metastatic disease, bilateral hydronephrosis on atrial fibrillation, aspiration pneumonia, chronic alcohol abuse, acute renal failure, COPD, anemia with gastric ulcer. PLAN: The patient appears to have pneumatosis from a CT scan 2 days ago. Nothing was done about it at that time as the patient appeared to not be symptomatic, but he continues to have nausea and vomiting with abdominal pain, but the fact that pneumatosis was found 2 days ago and the patient has survived this long indicates this may be a benign process at the moment, and I would recommend getting a repeat CT scan to assess it further to see if there is worsening of pneumatosis versus resolution to further evaluate the liver lesions and make decisions regarding planning at that time. The patient has frequent desaturations secondary to his aspiration pneumonia, and any surgical procedure or any surgical intervention would certainly require intubation, which would then necessitate long-term ventilator care as he is not someone who would be able to come off of a ventilator very well in his current state. So we will look at the CT scan and make decisions based on the findings as far as that is concerned."
32,Gastroenterology," REASON: Right lower quadrant pain. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a pleasant 48-year-old female with an approximately 24-hour history of right lower quadrant pain, which she describes as being stabbed with a knife, radiating around her side to her right flank.

34,Gastroenterology," EXAM: Ultrasound-guided paracentesis HISTORY: Ascites. TECHNIQUE AND FINDINGS: Informed consent was obtained from the patient after the risks and benefits of the procedure were thoroughly explained. Ultrasound demonstrates free fluid in the abdomen. The area of interest was localized with ultrasonography. The region was sterilely prepped and draped in the usual manner. Local anesthetic was administered. A 5-French Yueh catheter needle combination was taken. Upon crossing into the peritoneal space and aspiration of fluid, the catheter was advanced out over the needle. A total of approximately 5500 mL of serous fluid was obtained. The catheter was then removed. The patient tolerated the procedure well with no immediate postprocedure complications. IMPRESSION: Ultrasound-guided paracentesis as above."
35,Gastroenterology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Screening. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Tiny Polyps. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Colonoscopy. PROCEDURE: The procedure, indications, and risks were explained to the patient, who understood and agreed. He was sedated with Versed 3 mg, Demerol 25 mg during the examination. A digital rectal exam was performed and the Pentax Video Colonoscope was advanced over the examiner's finger into the rectum. It was passed to the level of the cecum. The ileocecal valve was identified, as was the appendiceal orifice. Slowly withdrawal through the colon revealed a small polyp in the transverse colon. This was approximately 3 mm in size and was completely removed using multiple bites with cold biopsy forceps. In addition, there was a 2 mm polyp versus lymphoid aggregate in the descending colon. This was also removed using the cold biopsy forceps. Further detail failed to reveal any other lesions with the exception of small hemorrhoids. IMPRESSION: Tiny polyps. PLAN: If adenomatous, repeat exam in five years. Otherwise, repeat exam in 10 years."
36,Gastroenterology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Antibiotic-associated diarrhea. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Antibiotic-associated diarrhea. OPERATION PERFORMED: Colonoscopy with random biopsies and culture. INDICATIONS: The patient is a 50-year-old woman who underwent hemorrhoidectomy approximately one year ago. She has been having difficulty since that time with intermittent diarrhea and abdominal pain. She states this happens quite frequently and can even happen when she uses topical prednisone for her ears or for her eyes. She presents today for screening colonoscopy, based on the same. OPERATIVE COURSE: The risks and benefits of colonoscopy were explained to the patient in detail. She provided her consent. The morning of the operation, the patient was transported from the preoperative holding area to the endoscopy suite. She was placed in the left lateral decubitus position. In divided doses, she was given 7 mg of Versed and 125 mcg of fentanyl. A digital rectal examination was performed, after which time the scope was intubated from the anus to the level of the hepatic flexure. This was intubated fairly easily; however, the patient was clearly in some discomfort and was shouting out, despite the amount of anesthesia she was provided. In truth, the pain she was experiencing was out of proportion to any maneuver or difficulty with the procedure. While more medication could have been given, the patient is actually a fairly thin woman and diminutive and I was concerned that giving her any more sedation may lead to respiratory or cardiovascular collapse. In addition, she was really having quite some difficulty staying still throughout the procedure and was putting us all at some risk. For this reason, the procedure was aborted at the level of the hepatic flexure. She was noted to have some pools of stool. This was suctioned and sent to pathology for C difficile, ova and parasites, and fecal leukocytes. Additionally, random biopsies were performed of the colon itself. It is unfortunate we were unable to complete this procedure, as I would have liked to have taken biopsies of the terminal ileum. However, given the degree of discomfort she had, again, coupled with the relative ease of the procedure itself, I am very suspicious of irritable bowel syndrome. The patient tolerated the remainder of the procedure fairly well and was sent to the recovery room in stable condition, where it is anticipated she will be discharged to home. PLAN: She needs to follow up with me in approximately 2 weeks' time, both to follow up with her biopsies and cultures. She has been given a prescription for VSL3, a probiotic, to assist with reculturing the rectum. She may also benefit from an antispasmodic and/or anxiolytic. Lastly, it should be noted that when she next undergoes endoscopic procedure, propofol would be indicated."
37,Gastroenterology," PROCEDURE: Gastroscopy. PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Dysphagia and globus. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Normal. MEDICATIONS: MAC. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The Olympus gastroscope was introduced through the oropharynx and passed carefully through the esophagus and stomach, and then through the gastrojejunal anastomosis into the efferent jejunal loop. The preparation was good and all surfaces were well seen. The hypopharynx was normal with no evidence of inflammation. The esophagus had a normal contour and normal mucosa throughout with no sign of stricturing or inflammation or exudate. The GE junction was located at 39 cm from the incisors and appeared normal with no evidence of reflux, damage, or Barrett's. Below this there was a small gastric pouch measuring 6 cm with intact mucosa and no retained food. The gastrojejunal anastomosis was patent measuring about 12 mm, with no inflammation or ulceration. Beyond this there was a side-to-side gastrojejunal anastomosis with a short afferent blind end and a normal efferent end with no sign of obstruction or inflammation. The scope was withdrawn and the patient was sent to recovery room. She tolerated the procedure well. FINAL DIAGNOSES: 1. Normal post-gastric bypass anatomy. 2. No evidence of inflammation or narrowing to explain her symptoms."
38,Gastroenterology," PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a very pleasant 69-year-old Caucasian male whom we are asked to see primarily because of a family history of colon cancer, but the patient also has rectal bleeding on a weekly basis and also heartburn once every 1 or 2 weeks. The patient states that he had his first colonoscopy 6 years ago and it was negative. His mother was diagnosed with colon cancer probably in her 50s, but she died of cancer of the esophagus at age 86. The patient does have hemorrhoidal bleed about once a week. Otherwise, he denies any change in bowel habits, abdominal pain, or weight loss. He gets heartburn mainly with certain food such as raw onions and he has had it for years. It will typically occur every couple of weeks. He has had no dysphagia. He has never had an upper endoscopy. MEDICAL HISTORY: Remarkable for hypertension, adult-onset diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and restless legs syndrome. SURGICAL HISTORY: Appendectomy as a child and cholecystectomy in 2003. MEDICATIONS: His medications are lisinopril 40 mg daily, hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg daily, metformin 1000 mg twice a day, Januvia 100 mg daily, clonazepam 10 mg at bedtime for restless legs syndrome, Crestor 10 mg nightly, and Flomax 0.4 mg daily. ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies. SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is retired. He is married. He had 4 children. He quite smoking 25 years ago after a 35-year history of smoking. He does not drink alcohol. FAMILY HISTORY: Mother had colon cancer in her 50s, esophageal cancer in her 80s. Her mother smoked and drank. Father got a mesothelioma at age 65. There is a brother of 65 with hypertension. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: He has had prostatitis with benign prostatic hypertrophy. He has some increased urinary frequency from a history of prostatitis. He has the heartburn, which is diet dependent and the frequent rectal bleeding. He also has restless legs syndrome at night. No cardio or pulmonary complaints. No weight loss. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Reveals a well-developed, well-nourished man in no acute distress. BP 112/70. Pulse 80 and regular. Respirations non-labored. Height 5 feet 7-1/2 inches. Weight 209 pounds. HEENT exam: Sclerae are anicteric. Pupils equal, conjunctivae clear. No gross oropharyngeal lesions. Neck is supple without lymphadenopathy, thyromegaly, or JVD. Lungs are clear to percussion and auscultation. Heart sounds are regular without murmur, gallop, or rub. The abdomen is soft and nontender. There are no masses. There is no hepatosplenomegaly. The bowel sounds are normal. Rectal examination: Deferred. Extremities have no clubbing, cyanosis or edema. Skin is warm and dry. The patient is alert and oriented with a pleasant affect and no gross motor deficits. IMPRESSION: 1. Family history of colon cancer. 2. Rectal bleeding. 3. Heartburn and a family history of esophageal cancer. PLAN: I agree with the indications for repeat colonoscopy, which should be done at least every 5 years. Also, discussed IRC to treat bleeding and internal hemorrhoids if he is deemed to be an appropriate candidate at the time of his colonoscopy and the patient was agreeable. I am also a little concerned about his family history of esophageal cancer and his personal history of heartburn and suggested that we check him once for Barrett's esophagus. If he does not have it now then it should not be a significant risk in the future. The indications and benefits of EGD, colonoscopy, and IRC were discussed. The risks including sedation, bleeding, infection, and perforation were discussed. The importance of a good bowel prep so as to minimize missing any lesions was discussed. His questions were answered and informed consent obtained. It was a pleasure to care for this nice patient."
39,Gastroenterology," PROCEDURE: Gastroscopy. PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Gastroesophageal reflux disease. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Barrett esophagus. MEDICATIONS: MAC. PROCEDURE: The Olympus gastroscope was introduced into the oropharynx and passed carefully through the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum to the transverse duodenum. The preparation was excellent and all surfaces were well seen. The hypopharynx appeared normal. The esophagus had a normal contour and normal mucosa throughout its distance, but at the distal end, there was a moderate-sized hiatal hernia noted. The GE junction was seen at 40 cm and the hiatus was noted at 44 cm from the incisors. Above the GE junction, there were three fingers of columnar epithelium extending cephalad, to a distance of about 2 cm. This appears to be consistent with Barrett esophagus. Multiple biopsies were taken from numerous areas in this region. There was no active ulceration or inflammation and no stricture. The hiatal hernia sac had normal mucosa except for one small erosion at the hiatus. The gastric body had normal mucosa throughout. Numerous small fundic gland polyps were noted, measuring 3 to 5 mm in size with an entirely benign appearance. Biopsies were taken from the antrum to rule out Helicobacter pylori. A retroflex view of the cardia and fundus confirmed the small hiatal hernia and demonstrated no additional lesions. The scope was passed through the pylorus, which was patent and normal. The mucosa throughout the duodenum in the first, second, and third portions was entirely normal. The scope was withdrawn and the patient was sent to the recovery room. He tolerated the procedure well. FINAL DIAGNOSES: 1. A short-segment Barrett esophagus. 2. Hiatal hernia. 3. Incidental fundic gland polyps in the gastric body. 4. Otherwise, normal upper endoscopy to the transverse duodenum. RECOMMENDATIONS: 1. Follow up biopsy report. 2. Continue PPI therapy. 3. Follow up with Dr. X as needed. 4. Surveillance endoscopy for Barrett in 3 years (if pathology confirms this diagnosis)."
40,Gastroenterology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: History of perforated sigmoid diverticuli with Hartmann's procedure. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. History of perforated sigmoid diverticuli with Hartmann's procedure. 2. Massive adhesions. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: 1. Exploratory laparotomy. 2. Lysis of adhesions and removal. 3. Reversal of Hartmann's colostomy. 4. Flexible sigmoidoscopy. 5. Cystoscopy with left ureteral stent. ANESTHESIA: General. HISTORY: This is a 55-year-old gentleman who had a previous perforated diverticula. Recommendation for reversal of the colostomy was made after more than six months from the previous surgery for a sigmoid colon resection and Hartmann's colostomy. PROCEDURE: The patient was taken to the operating room placed into lithotomy position after being prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. A cystoscope was introduced into the patient's urethra and to the bladder. Immediately, no evidence of cystitis was seen and the scope was introduced superiorly, measuring the bladder and immediately a #5 French ____ was introduced within the left urethra. The cystoscope was removed, a Foley was placed, and wide connection was placed attaching the left ureteral stent and Foley. At this point, immediately the patient was re-prepped and draped and immediately after the ostomy was closed with a #2-0 Vicryl suture, immediately at this point, the abdominal wall was opened with a #10 blade Bard-Parker down with electrocautery for complete hemostasis through the midline. The incision scar was cephalad due to the severe adhesions in the midline. Once the abdomen was entered in the epigastric area, then massive lysis of adhesions was performed to separate the small bowel from the anterior abdominal wall. Once the small bowel was completely free from the anterior abdominal wall, at this point, the ostomy was taken down with an elliptical incision with cautery and then meticulous dissection with Metzenbaum scissors and electrocautery down to the anterior abdominal wall, where a meticulous dissection was carried with Metzenbaum scissors to separate the entire ostomy from the abdominal wall. Immediately at this point, the bowel was dropped within the abdominal cavity, and more lysis of adhesions was performed cleaning the left gutter area to mobilize the colon further down to have no tension in the anastomosis. At this point, the rectal stump, where two previous sutures with Prolene were seen, were brought with hemostats. The rectal stump was free in a 360 degree fashion and immediately at this point, a decision to perform the anastomosis was made. First, a self-retaining retractor was introduced in the abdominal cavity and a bladder blade was introduced as well. Blue towel was placed above the small bowel retracting the bowel to cephalad and at this point, immediately the rectal stump was well visualized, no evidence of bleeding was seen, and the towels were placed along the edges of the abdominal wound. Immediately, the pursestring device was fired approximately 1 inch from the skin and on the descending colon, this was fired. The remainder of the excess tissue was closed with Metzenbaum scissors and immediately after dilating #25 and #29 mushroom tip from the T8 Ethicon was placed within the colon and then #9-0 suture was tied. Immediately from the anus, the dilator #25 and #29 was introduced dilating the rectum. The #29 EEA was introduced all the way anteriorly to the staple line and this spike from the EEA was used to perforate the rectum and then the mushroom from the descending colon was attached to it. The EEA was then fired. Once it was fired and was removed, the pelvis was filled with fluid. Immediately both doughnuts were ____ from the anastomosis. A Doyen was placed in both the anastomosis. Colonoscope was introduced. No bubble or air was seen coming from the anastomosis. There was no evidence of bleeding. Pictures of the anastomosis were taken. The scope then was removed from the patient's rectum. Copious amount of irrigation was used within the peritoneal cavity. Immediately at this point, all complete sponge and instrument count was performed. First, the ostomy site was closed with interrupted figure-of-eight #0 Vicryl suture. The peritoneum was closed with running #2-0 Vicryl suture. Then, the midline incision was closed with a loop PDS in cephalad to caudad and caudad to cephalad tight in the middle. Subq tissue was copiously irrigated and the staples on the skin. The iodoform packing was placed within the old ostomy site and then the staples on the skin as well. The patient did tolerate the procedure well and will be followed during the hospitalization. The left ureteral stent was removed at the end of the procedure. _____ were performed. Lysis of adhesions were performed. Reversal of colostomy and EEA anastomosis #29 Ethicon."
41,Gastroenterology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Congenital chylous ascites and chylothorax. 2. Rule out infradiaphragmatic lymphatic leak. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Diffuse intestinal and mesenteric lymphangiectasia. ANESTHESIA: General. INDICATION: The patient is an unfortunate 6-month-old baby boy, who has been hospitalized most of his life with recurrent chylothoraces and chylous ascites. The patient has been treated somewhat successfully with TPN and voluntary restriction of enteral nutrition, but he had repeated chylothoraces. Last week, Dr. X took the patient to the operating room in hopes that with thoracotomy, a thoracic duct leak could be found, which would be successfully closed surgically. However at the time of his thoracotomy exploration what was discovered was a large amount of transdiaphragmatic transition of chylous ascites coming from the abdomen. Dr. X opened the diaphragm and could literally see a fountain of chylous fluid exiting through the diaphragmatic hole. This was closed, and we decided that perhaps an abdominal exploration as a last stage effort would allow us to find an area of lymphatic leak that could potentially help the patient from this dismal prognostic disease. We met with his parents and talked to them about this, and he is here today for that attempt. OPERATIVE FINDINGS: The patient's abdomen was relatively soft, minimally distended. Exploration through supraumbilical transverse incision immediately revealed a large amount of chylous ascites upon entering into the peritoneal cavity. What we found which explains the chronic chylous ascites and chylothorax was a diffuse lymphangiectatic picture involving the small bowel mesentery approximately two thirds to three quarters of the distal small bowel including all of the ileum, the cecum, and the portion of the ascending colon. It appeared that any attempt to resect this area would have been met with failure because of the extensive lymphatic dilatation all the way down towards the root of the supramesenteric artery. There was about one quarter to one third of the jejunum that did not appear to be grossly involved, but I did not think that resection of three quarters of the patient's small bowel would be viable surgical option. Instead, we opted to close his abdomen and refer for potential small intestine transplantation procedure in the future if he is a candidate for that. The lymphatic abnormality was extensive. They were linear dilated lymphatic channels on the serosal surface of the bowel in the mesentery. They were small aneurysm-like pockets of chyle all along the course of the mesenteric structures and in the mesentery medially adjacent to the bowel as well. No other major retroperitoneal structure or correctable structure was identified. Both indirect inguinal hernias were wide open and could be palpated from an internal aspect as well. DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: The patient was brought from the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit to the operating room within an endotracheal tube im place and with enteral feeds established at full flow to provide maximum fat content and maximum lymphatic flow. We conducted a surgical time-out and reiterated all of the patient's important identifying information and confirmed the operative plan as described above. Preparation and draping of his abdomen was done with chlorhexidine based prep solution and then we opened his peritoneal cavity through a transverse supraumbilical incision dividing both rectus muscles and all layers of the abdominal wall fascia. As the peritoneal cavity was entered, we divided the umbilical vein ligamentum teres remnant between Vicryl ties, and we were able to readily identify a large amount of chylous ascites that had been previously described. The bowel was eviscerated, and then with careful inspection, we were able to identify this extensive area of intestinal and mesenteric lymphangiectasia that was a source of the patient's chylous ascites. The small bowel from the ligament of Treitz to the proximal to mid jejunum was largely unaffected, but did not appear that resection of 75% of the small intestine and colon would be a satisfactory tradeoff for The patient, but would likely render him with significant short bowel and nutritional and metabolic problems. Furthermore, it might burn bridges necessary for consideration of intestinal transplantation in the future if that becomes an option. We suctioned free all of the chylous accumulations, replaced the intestines to their peritoneal cavity, and then closed the patient's abdominal incision with 4-0 PDS on the posterior sheath and 3-0 PDS on the anterior rectus sheath. Subcuticular 5-0 Monocryl and Steri-Strips were used for skin closure. The patient tolerated the procedure well. He lost minimal blood, but did lose approximately 100 mL of chylous fluid from the abdomen that was suctioned free as part of the chylous ascitic leak. The patient was returned to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit with his endotracheal tube in place and to consider the next stage of management, which might be an attempted additional type of feeding or referral to an Intestinal Transplantation Center to see if that is an option for the patient because he has no universally satisfactory medical or surgical treatment for this at this time."

The patient felt relieved after vomiting. The patient was started on aztreonam 1 g IV every 8 hours, Flagyl 500 mg IV every 8 hours. ID consult was called and thoracic surgeon consult was ordered."
43,Gastroenterology," EXAM: Modified barium swallow. SYMPTOM: Dysphagia with possible aspiration. FINDINGS: A cookie deglutition study was performed. The patient was examined in the direct lateral position. Patient was challenged with thin liquids, thick liquid, semisolids and solids. Persistently demonstrable is the presence of penetration with thin liquids. This is not evident with thick liquids, semisolids or solids. There is weakness in the oral phase of deglutition. Subglottic region appears normal. There is no evidence of aspiration demonstrated. IMPRESSION: Penetration demonstrated with thin liquids with weakness of the oral phase of deglutition."
44,Gastroenterology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Nausea and vomiting and upper abdominal pain. POST PROCEDURE DIAGNOSIS: Normal upper endoscopy. OPERATION: Esophagogastroduodenoscopy with antral biopsies for H. pylori x2 with biopsy forceps. ANESTHESIA: IV sedation 50 mg Demerol, 8 mg of Versed. PROCEDURE: The patient was taken to the endoscopy suite. After adequate IV sedation with the above medications, hurricane was sprayed in the mouth as well as in the esophagus. A bite block was placed and the gastroscope placed into the mouth and was passed into the esophagus and negotiated through the esophagus, stomach, and pylorus. The first, second, and third portions of the duodenum were normal. The scope was withdrawn into the antrum which was normal and two bites with the biopsy forceps were taken in separate spots for H. pylori. The scope was retroflexed which showed a normal GE junction from the inside of the stomach and no evidence of pathology or paraesophageal hernia. The scope was withdrawn at the GE junction which was in a normal position with a normal transition zone. The scope was then removed throughout the esophagus which was normal. The patient tolerated the procedure well. The plan is to obtain a HIDA scan as the right upper quadrant ultrasound appeared to be normal, although previous ultrasounds several years ago showed a gallstone."
45,Gastroenterology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Acute cholecystitis. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Acute gangrenous cholecystitis with cholelithiasis. OPERATION PERFORMED: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy with cholangiogram. FINDINGS: The patient had essentially a dead gallbladder with stones and positive wide bile/pus coming from the gallbladder. COMPLICATIONS: None. EBL: Scant. SPECIMEN REMOVED: Gallbladder with stones. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion under general anesthesia. A curvilinear incision was made below the umbilicus. Through this incision, the camera port was able to be placed into the peritoneal cavity under direct visualization. Once this complete, insufflation was begun. Once insufflation was adequate, additional ports were placed in the epigastrium as well as right upper quadrant. Once all four ports were placed, the right upper quadrant was then explored. The patient had significant adhesions of omentum and colon to the liver, the gallbladder constituting definitely an acute cholecystitis. This was taken down using Bovie cautery to free up visualization of the gallbladder. The gallbladder was very thick and edematous and had frank necrosis of most of the anterior gallbladder wall. Adhesions were further taken down between the omentum, the colon, and the gallbladder slowly starting superiorly and working inferiorly towards the cystic duct area. Once the adhesions were fully removed, the cholangiogram was done which did not show any evidence of any common bile duct dilatation or obstruction. At this point, due to the patient's gallbladder being very necrotic, it was deemed that the patient should have a drain placed. The cystic duct and cystic artery were serially clipped and transected. The gallbladder was removed from the gallbladder fossa removing the entire gallbladder. Adequate hemostasis with Bovie cautery was achieved. The gallbladder was then placed into a bag and removed from the peritoneal cavity through the camera port. A JP drain was then run through the anterior port and out of one of the trochar sites and secured to the skin using 3-0 nylon suture. Next, the right upper quadrant was copiously irrigated out using the suction irrigator. Once this was complete, the additional ports were able to be removed. The fascial opening at the umbilicus was reinforced by closing it using a 0 Vicryl suture in a figure-of-8 fashion. All skin incisions were injected using Marcaine 1/4 percent plain. The skin was reapproximated further using 4-0 Monocryl sutures in a subcuticular technique. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was able to be transferred to the recovery room in stable condition."
46,Gastroenterology," PROCEDURE: Colonoscopy. INDICATIONS: Hematochezia, Personal history of colonic polyps. MEDICATIONS: Midazolam 2 mg IV, Fentanyl 100 mcg IV PROCEDURE: A History and Physical has been performed, and patient medication allergies have been reviewed. The patient's tolerance of previous anesthesia has been reviewed. The risks and benefits of the procedure and the sedation options and risks were discussed with the patient. All questions were answered and informed consent was obtained. Mental Status Examination: alert and oriented. Airway Examination: normal oropharyngeal airway and neck mobility. Respiratory Examination: clear to auscultation. CV Examination: RRR, no murmurs, no S3 or S4. ASA Grade Assessment: P1 A normal healthy patient. After reviewing the risks and benefits, the patient was deemed in satisfactory condition to undergo the procedure. The anesthesia plan was to use conscious sedation. Immediately prior to administration of medications, the patient was re-assessed for adequacy to receive sedatives. The heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturations, blood pressure, adequacy of pulmonary ventilation, and response to care were monitored throughout the procedure. The physical status of the patient was re-assessed after the procedure. After I obtained informed consent, the scope was passed under direct vision. Throughout the procedure, the patient's blood pressure, pulse, and oxygen saturations were monitored continuously. The colonoscope was introduced through the anus and advanced to the cecum, identified by appendiceal orifice & IC valve. The quality of the prep was good. The patient tolerated the procedure well. FINDINGS: 1. A sessile, non-bleeding polyp was found in the rectum. The polyp was 5 mm in size. Polypectomy was performed with a saline injection-lift technique using the snare. Resection and retrieval were complete. Estimated blood loss was minimal. 2. One pedunculated, non-bleeding polyp was found in the sigmoid colon. The polyp was 7 mm in size. Polypectomy was performed with a hot forceps. Resection and retrieval were complete. Estimated blood loss was minimal. 3. Multiple large-mouthed diverticula were found in the descending colon. 4. Internal, non-bleeding, prolapsed with spontaneous reduction (grade II) hemorrhoids were found on retroflexion. IMPRESSION: 1. One 5 mm benign appearing polyp in the rectum. Resected and retrieved. 2. One 7 mm polyp in the sigmoid colon. Resected and retrieved. 3. Diverticulosis. 4. Internal hemorrhoids were found. RECOMMENDATION: 1. High fiber diet. 2. Await pathology results. 3. Repeat colonoscopy for surveillance in 3 years. 4. The findings and recommendations were discussed with the patient. CPT CODE(S): 45385, Colonoscopy, flexible, proximal to splenic flexure; with removal of tumor(s), polyp(s), or other lesion(s) by snare technique. 45384, 59, Colonoscopy, flexible, proximal to splenic flexure; with removal of tumor(s), polyp(s), or other lesion(s) by hot biopsy forceps or bipolar cautery. 45381, 59, Colonoscopy, flexible, proximal to splenic flexure; with directed submucosal injection(s), any substance.

47,Gastroenterology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Hematemesis in a patient with longstanding diabetes. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Mallory-Weiss tear, submucosal hemorrhage consistent with trauma from vomiting and grade 2 esophagitis. PROCEDURE: The procedure, indications explained and he understood and agreed. He was sedated with Versed 3, Demerol 25 and topical Hurricane spray to the oropharynx. A bite block was placed. The Pentax video gastroscope was advanced through the oropharynx into the esophagus under direct vision. Esophagus revealed distal ulcerations. Additionally, the patient had a Mallory-Weiss tear. This was subjected to bicap cautery with good ablation. The stomach was entered, which revealed areas of submucosal hemorrhage consistent with trauma from vomiting. There were no ulcerations or erosions in the stomach. The duodenum was entered, which was unremarkable. The instrument was then removed. The patient tolerated the procedure well with no complications. IMPRESSION: Mallory-Weiss tear, successful BICAP cautery. We will keep the patient on proton pump inhibitors. The patient will remain on antiemetics and be started on a clear liquid diet."
48,Gastroenterology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. protein-calorie malnutrition. 2. Intractable nausea, vomiting, and dysphagia. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Protein-calorie malnutrition. 2. Intractable nausea, vomiting, and dysphagia. 3. Enterogastritis. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: EGD with PEG tube placement using Russell technique. ANESTHESIA: IV sedation with 1% lidocaine for local. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: None. COMPLICATIONS: None. BRIEF HISTORY: This is a 44-year-old African-American female who is well known to this service. She has been hospitalized multiple times for intractable nausea and vomiting and dehydration. She states that her decreased p.o. intake has been progressively worsening. She was admitted to the service of Dr. Lang and was evaluated by Dr. Wickless as well all of whom agreed that the best option for supplemental nutrition for this patient was placement of a PEG tube. PROCEDURE: After risks, complications, and benefits were explained to the patient and informed consent was obtained, the patient was taken to the operating room. She was placed in the supine position. The area was prepped and draped in the sterile fashion. After adequate IV sedation was obtained by anesthesia, esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed. The esophagus, stomach, and duodenum were visualized without difficulty. There was no gross evidence of any malignancy. There was some enterogastritis which was noted upon exam. The appropriate location was noted on the anterior wall of the stomach. This area was localized externally with 1% lidocaine. Large gauge needle was used to enter the lumen of the stomach under visualization. A guide wire was then passed again under visualization and the needle was subsequently removed. A scalpel was used to make a small incision, next to the guidewire and ensuring that the underlying fascia was nicked as well. A dilator with break-away sheath was then inserted over the guidewire and under direct visualization was seen to enter the lumen of the stomach without difficulty. The guidewire and dilator were then removed again under visualization and the PEG tube was placed through the break-away sheath and visualized within the lumen of the stomach. The balloon was then insufflated and the break-away sheath was then pulled away. Proper placement of the tube was ensured through visualization with a scope. The tube was then sutured into place using nylon suture. Appropriate sterile dressing was applied. DISPOSITION: The patient was transferred to the recovery in a stable condition. She was subsequently returned to her room on the General Medical Floor. Previous orders will be resumed. We will instruct the Nursing that the PEG tube can be used at 5 p.m. this evening for medications if necessary and bolus feedings."

OPERATIVE FINDINGS: Video laparoscopy revealed dense omental adhesions surrounding the gallbladder circumferentially. These dense adhesions were associated with chronic inflammatory edematous changes. The cystic duct was easily identifiable and seen entering into the gallbladder and clipped two proximally and one distally. The cystic artery was an anomalous branch that was anterior to the cystic duct and was identified, clipped with two clips proximally and one distally. The remainder of the evaluation of the abdomen revealed no evidence of nodularity or masses in the liver. There was no evidence of adhesions from the abdominal wall to the liver. The remainder of the abdomen was unremarkable. BRIEF HISTORY: This is a 17-year-old African-American female who presented to ABCD General Hospital on 08/20/2003 with complaints of intractable right upper quadrant abdominal pain. She had been asked to follow up and scheduled for surgery previously. Her pain had now been intractable associated with anorexia. She was noted on physical examination to be afebrile; however, she was having severe right upper quadrant pain with examination as well as a Murphy's sign and voluntary guarding with examination. Her transaminases were markedly elevated. She also developed pancreatitis secondary to gallstones. Her common bile duct was dilated to 1 cm with no evidence of wall thickening, but evidence of cholelithiasis. She was seen by the gastroenterologist and underwent a sphincterotomy with balloon extraction of gallstones secondary to choledocholithiasis. Following this, she was scheduled for operative laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Her parents were explained the risks, benefits, and complications of the procedure. She gave us informed consent to proceed with surgery. OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: The patient brought to the operative suite and placed in the supine position. Preoperatively, the patient received IV antibiotics of Ancef, sequential compression devices and subcutaneous heparin. The abdomen was prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion with Betadine solution. Utilizing a #15 blade scalpel, a transverse infraumbilical incision was created. Utilizing a Veress needle with anterior traction on the anterior abdominal wall with a towel clamp, the Veress needle was inserted without difficulty. Hanging water drop test was performed with notable air aspiration through the Veress needle and the saline passed through the Veress needle without difficulty. The abdomen was then insufflated to 15 mmHg with carbon-dioxide. Once the abdomen was sufficiently insufflated, a #10 mm bladed trocar was inserted into the abdomen without difficulty. Video laparoscope was inserted and the above notable findings were identified in the operative findings. The patient to proceed with laparoscopic cholecystectomy was decided and a subxiphoid port was placed. A #15 bladed scalpel was used to make a transverse incision in the subxiphoid region within the midline. The trocar was then inserted into the abdomen under direct visualization with the video laparoscope and seen to go to the right of falciform ligament. Next, two 5 mm trocars were inserted under direct visualization, one in the midclavicular and one in the anterior midaxillary line. These were inserted without difficulty. The liver edge was lifted and revealed a markedly edematous gallbladder with severe omental adhesions encapsulating the gallbladder. Utilizing Endoshears scissor, a plane was created circumferentially to the dome of the gallbladder to allow assistance and dissection of these dense adhesions. Next, the omental adhesions adjacent to the infundibulum were taken down and allowed to expose the cystic duct. A small vessel was seen anterior to the cystic duct and this was clipped two proximally and one distally and noted to be an anomalous arterial branch. This was transected with Endoshears scissor and visualized the pulsatile branch with two clips securely in place. Next, the cystic duct was carefully dissected with Maryland dissectors and was visualized clearly both anterior and posteriorly. Endoclips were placed two proximally and one distally and then the cystic duct was transected with Endoshears scissor. Once the clips were noted to be in place, utilizing electrocautery another Dorsey dissector was used to carefully dissect the gallbladder off the liver bed wall. The gallbladder was removed and the bleeding from the gallbladder wall was easily controlled with electrocautery. The abdomen was then irrigated with copious amounts of normal saline. The gallbladder was grasped with a gallbladder grasper and removed from the subxiphoid port. There was noted to be gallstones within the gallbladder. Once the abdomen was re-insufflated after removing the gallbladder and copious irrigation was performed, all ports were then removed under direct visualization with no evidence of bleeding from the anterior abdominal wall. Utilizing #0 Vicryl suture, a figure-of-eight was placed to the subxiphoid and infraumbilical fascia and this was approximated without difficulty. The subxiphoid port was irrigated with copious amounts of normal saline prior to closure of the fascia. A #4-0 Vicryl suture was used to approximate all incisions. The incisions were then injected with local injectable 0.25% Marcaine. All ports were then cleaned dry. Steri-Strips were placed across and sterile pressure dressings were placed on top of this. The patient tolerated the entire procedure well. She was transferred to the Postanesthesia Care Unit in stable condition. She will be followed closely in the postoperative course in General Medical Floor."
51,Gastroenterology," PROCEDURE: Upper endoscopy with biopsy. PROCEDURE INDICATION: This is a 44-year-old man who was admitted for coffee-ground emesis, which has been going on for the past several days. An endoscopy is being done to evaluate for source of upper GI bleeding. Informed consent was obtained. Outlining the risks, benefits and alternatives of the procedure included, but not to risks of bleeding, infection, perforation, the patient agreed for the procedure. MEDICATIONS: Versed 4 mg IV push and fentanyl 75 mcg IV push given throughout the procedure in incremental fashion with careful monitoring of patient's pressures and vital signs. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position. Medications were given. After adequate sedation was achieved, the Olympus video endoscope was inserted into the mouth and advanced towards the duodenum. Mucosa ___________. The duodenum appeared normal. The scope was then brought back to the stomach. The antrum and angularis appeared normal as well. The scope was retroflexed to visualize the mucosa of rugal folds, the body, and fundus of the stomach. At the cardia, there was a large fungating ulcerated mass appreciated, which was oozing blood. Biopsies were taken of this mass, which was very firm and likely representing a carcinoma. The scope was then anteflexed and brought back to the distal esophagus. All the esophageal mucosa appeared normal. The squamocolumnar junction appeared normal as well. The scope was removed and procedure terminated. The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no immediate complications. IMPRESSION: 1. Normal esophagus. 2. Normal duodenum. 3. Ulcerated fungating mass at the cardia of the stomach status post biopsies. RECOMMENDATIONS: 1. CT chest, abdomen and pelvis for staging. 2. Check CEA. 3. Transfuse as needed. 4. Await biopsy results. 5. Oncology consult, pending biopsy results."
52,Gastroenterology," PROCEDURE: Upper endoscopy with removal of food impaction. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: A 92-year-old lady with history of dysphagia on and off for two years. She comes in this morning with complaints of inability to swallow anything including her saliva. This started almost a day earlier. She was eating lunch and had beef stew and suddenly noticed inability to finish her meal and since then has not been able to eat anything. She is on Coumadin and her INR is 2.5. OPERATIVE NOTE: Informed consent was obtained from patient. The risks of aspiration, bleeding, perforation, infection, and serious risk including need for surgery and ICU stay particularly in view of food impaction for almost a day was discussed. Daughter was also informed about the procedure and risks. Conscious sedation initially was administered with Versed 2 mg and fentanyl 50 mcg. The scope was advanced into the esophagus and showed liquid and solid particles from mid esophagus all the way to the distal esophagus. There was a meat bolus in the distal esophagus. This was visualized after clearing the liquid material and small particles of what appeared to be carrots. The patient, however, was not tolerating the conscious sedation. Hence, Dr. X was consulted and we continued the procedure with propofol sedation. The scope was reintroduced into the esophagus after propofol sedation. Initially a Roth net was used and some small amounts of soft food in the distal esophagus was removed with the Roth net. Then, a snare was used to cut the meat bolus into pieces, as it was very soft. Small pieces were grabbed with the snare and pulled out. Thereafter, the residual soft meat bolus was passed into the stomach along with the scope, which was passed between the bolus and the esophageal wall carefully. The patient had severe bruising and submucosal hemorrhage in the esophagus possibly due to longstanding bolus impaction and Coumadin therapy. No active bleeding was seen. There was a distal esophageal stricture, which caused slight resistance to the passage of the scope into the stomach. As this area was extremely inflamed, a dilatation was not attempted. IMPRESSION: Distal esophageal stricture with food impaction. Treated as described above. RECOMMENDATIONS: IV Protonix 40 mg q.12h. Clear liquid diet for 24 hours. If the patient is stable, thereafter she may take soft pureed diet only until next endoscopy, which will be scheduled in three to four weeks. She should take Prevacid SoluTab 30 mg b.i.d. on discharge."
53,Gastroenterology," PROCEDURE: Upper endoscopy with foreign body removal. PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS (ES): Esophageal foreign body. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS (ES): Penny in proximal esophagus. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: None. COMPLICATIONS: None. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: After informed consent was obtained, the patient was taken to the pediatric endoscopy suite. After appropriate sedation by the anesthesia staff and intubation, an upper endoscope was inserted into the mouth, over the tongue, into the esophagus, at which time the foreign body was encountered. It was grasped with a coin removal forcep and removed with an endoscope. At that time, the endoscope was reinserted, advanced to the level of the stomach and stomach was evaluated and was normal. The esophagus was normal with the exception of some mild erythema, where the coin had been sitting. There were no erosions. The stomach was decompressed of air and fluid. The scope was removed without difficulty. SUMMARY: The patient underwent endoscopic removal of esophageal foreign body. PLAN: To discharge home, follow up as needed."
54,Gastroenterology," OPERATIVE PROCEDURES: Colonoscopy and biopsies, epinephrine sclerotherapy, hot biopsy cautery, and snare polypectomy. PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Colon cancer screening. 2. Family history of colon polyps. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Multiple colon polyps (5). 2. Diverticulosis, sigmoid colon. 3. Internal hemorrhoids. ENDOSCOPE USED: EC3870LK. BIOPSIES: Biopsies taken from all polyps. Hot biopsy got applied to one. Epinephrine sclerotherapy and snare polypectomy applied to four polyps. ANESTHESIA: Fentanyl 75 mcg, Versed 6 mg, and glucagon 1.5 units IV push in divided doses. Also given epinephrine 1:20,000 total of 3 mL. The patient tolerated the procedure well. PROCEDURE: The patient was placed in left lateral decubitus after appropriate sedation. Digital rectal examination was done, which was normal. Endoscope was introduced and passed through a rather spastic tortuous sigmoid colon with multiple diverticula seen all the way through transverse colon where about 1 cm x 1 cm sessile polyp was seen. It was biopsied and then in piecemeal fashion removed using snare polypectomy after base was infiltrated with epinephrine. Pedunculated polyp next to it was hard to see and there was a lot of peristalsis. The scope then was advanced through rest of the transverse colon to ascending colon and cecum. Terminal ileum was briefly reviewed, appeared normal and so did cecum after copious amount of fecal material was irrigated out. Ascending colon was unremarkable. At hepatic flexure may be proximal transverse colon, there was a sessile polyp about 1.2 cm x 1 cm that was removed in the same manner with a biopsy taken, base infiltrated with epinephrine and at least two passes of snare polypectomy and subsequent hot biopsy cautery removed to hold polypoid tissue, which could be seen. In transverse colon on withdrawal and relaxation with epinephrine, an additional 1 mm to 2 mm sessile polyp was removed by hot biopsy. Then in the transverse colon, additional larger polyp about 1.3 cm x 1.2 cm was removed in piecemeal fashion again with epinephrine, sclerotherapy, and snare polypectomy. Subsequently pedunculated polyp in distal transverse colon near splenic flexure was removed with snare polypectomy. The rest of the splenic flexure and descending colon were unremarkable. Diverticulosis was again seen with almost constant spasm despite of glucagon. Sigmoid colon did somewhat hinder the inspection of that area. Rectum, retroflexion posterior anal canal showed internal hemorrhoids moderate to large. Excess of air insufflated was removed. The endoscope was withdrawn. PLAN: Await biopsy report. Pending biopsy report, recommendation will be made when the next colonoscopy should be done at least three years perhaps sooner besides and due to multitude of the patient's polyps."
55,Gastroenterology," HISTORY: The patient is a 71-year-old female, who was referred for an outpatient modified barium swallow study to objectively evaluate her swallowing function and safety. The patient complained of globus sensation high in her throat particularly with solid foods and with pills. She denied history of coughing and chocking with meals. The patient's complete medical history is unknown to me at this time. The patient was cooperative and compliant throughout this evaluation. STUDY: Modified barium swallow study was performed in the Radiology Suite in cooperation with Dr. X. The patient was seated upright at a 90-degree angle in a video imaging chair. To evaluate her swallowing function and safety, she was administered graduated amounts of food and liquid mixed with barium in the form of thin liquids (teaspoon x3. cup sip x4); thickened liquid (cup sip x3); puree consistency (teaspoon x3); and solid consistency (1/4 cracker x1). The patient was given 2 additional cup sips of thin liquid following the puree and solid food presentation. ORAL STAGE: The patient had no difficulty with bolus control and transport. No spillage out lips. The patient appears to have pocketing __________ particularly with puree and solid food between her right faucial pillars. The patient did state that she had her tonsil taken out as a child and appears to be a diverticulum located in this state. Further evaluation by an ENT is highly recommended based on the residual and pooling that occurred during this evaluation. We were not able to clear out the residual with alternating cup sips and thin liquid. PHARYNGEAL STAGE: No aspiration or penetration occurred during this evaluation. The patient's hyolaryngeal elevation and anterior movements are within the functional limits. Epiglottic inversion is within functional limits. She had no residual or pooling in the pharynx after the swallow. CERVICAL ESOPHAGEAL STAGE: The patient's upper esophageal sphincter opening is well coordinated with swallow and readily accepted the bolus. DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION: The patient had no aspiration or penetration occurred during this evaluation. She does appear to have a diverticulum in the area between her right faucial pillars. Additional evaluation is needed by an ENT physician. PLAN: Based on this evaluation, the following is recommended: 1. The patient's diet should consist regular consistency food with thin liquids. She needs to take small bites and small sips to help decrease her risk of aspiration and penetration as well as reflux. 2. The patient should be referred to an otolaryngologist for further evaluation of her oral cavity particularly the area between her faucial pillars. The above recommendations and results of the evaluation were discussed with the patient as well as her daughter and both responded appropriately. Thank you for the opportunity to be required the patient's medical care. She is not in need of skilled speech therapy and is discharged from my services."
56,Gastroenterology," HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 48-year-old man who has had abdominal pain since October of last year associated with a 30-pound weight loss and then developed jaundice. He had epigastric pain and was admitted to the hospital. A thin-slice CT scan was performed, which revealed a 4 x 3 x 2 cm pancreatic mass with involved lymph nodes and ring enhancing lesions consistent with liver metastases. The patient, additionally, had a questionable pseudocyst in the tail of the pancreas. The patient underwent ERCP on 04/04/2007 with placement of a stent. This revealed a strictured pancreatic duct, as well as strictured bile duct. A 10-french x 9 cm stent was placed with good drainage. The next morning, the patient felt quite a bit more comfortable. He additionally had a modest drop in his bilirubin and other liver tests. Of note, the patient has been having quite a bit of nausea during his admission. This responded to Zofran. It did not, initially, respond well to Phenergan, though after stent placement, he was significantly more comfortable and had less nausea, and in fact, had better response to the Phenergan itself. At the time of discharge, the patient's white count was 9.4, hemoglobin 10.8, hematocrit 32 with a MCV of 79, platelet count of 585,000. His sodium was 132, potassium 4.1, chloride 95, CO2 27, BUN of 8 with a creatinine of 0.3. His bilirubin was 17.1, alk phos 273, AST 104, ALT 136, total protein 7.8 and albumin of 3.8. He was tolerating a regular diet. The patient had been on oral hypoglycemics as an outpatient, but in hospital, he was simply managed with an insulin sliding scale. The patient will be transferred back to Pelican Bay, under the care of Dr. X at the infirmary. He will be further managed for his diabetes there. The patient will additionally undergo potential end of life meetings. I discussed the potentials of chemotherapy with patient. Certainly, there are modest benefits, which can be obtained with chemotherapy in metastatic pancreatic cancer, though at some cost with morbidity. The patient will consider this and will discuss this further with Dr. X. DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 1. Phenergan 25 mg q.6. p.r.n. 2. Duragesic patch 100 mcg q.3.d. 3. Benadryl 25-50 mg p.o. q.i.d. for pruritus. 4. Sliding scale will be discontinued at the time of discharge and will be reinstituted on arrival at Pelican Bay Infirmary. 5. The patient had initially been on enalapril here. His hypertension will be managed by Dr. X as well. PLAN: The patient should return for repeat ERCP if there are signs of stent occlusion such as fever, increased bilirubin, worsening pain. In the meantime, he will be kept on a regular diet and activity per Dr. X."
57,Gastroenterology," REASON FOR CONSULTATION: Possible free air under the diaphragm. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 77-year-old female who is unable to give any information. She has been sedated with Ativan and came into the emergency room obtunded and unable to give any history. On a chest x-ray for what appeared to be shortness of breath she was found to have what was thought to be free air under the right diaphragm. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for alcohol abuse. Unable to really gather any other information because she is so obtunded. PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Looking at the medical chart, she had an appendectomy, right hip fracture from a fall in 2005, and TAH/BSO. MEDICATIONS: Unable to evaluate. ALLERGIES: UNABLE TO EVALUATE. SOCIAL HISTORY: Significant history of alcohol abuse, according to the emergency room physician, who sees her on a regular basis. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Unable to obtain. PHYSICAL EXAM VITAL SIGNS: Temp 98.3, heart rate 82, respiratory rate 24, and blood pressure 141/70. GENERAL: She is a very obtunded female who upon arousal is not able to provide any information of any use. HEENT: Atraumatic. NECK: Soft and supple. LUNGS: Bilaterally diminished. HEART: Regular. ABDOMEN: Soft, and with deep palpation I am unable to arouse the patient, unable to elicit any tenderness. LABORATORY STUDIES: Show a normal white blood cell count with no shift. Elevated AST at 138, with a normal ALT at 38. Alkaline phosphatase of 96, bilirubin 0.8. Sodium is 107, with 68 chloride and potassium of 2.8. X-ray of the chest shows the possibility of free air; therefore, a CT scan was obtained because of the patient's physical examination, which shows no evidence of intra-abdominal pathology. The etiology of the air under the diaphragm is actually a colonic air that is anterior superior to the dome of the diaphragm, near the dome of the liver. ASSESSMENT: No intra-abdominal pathology. PLAN: Have her admitted to the medical service for treatment of her hyponatremia."
58,Gastroenterology," PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Nissen fundoplication. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: After informed consent was obtained detailing the risks of infection, bleeding, esophageal perforation and death, the patient was brought to the operative suite and placed supine on the operating room table. General endotracheal anesthesia was induced without incident. The patient was then placed in a modified lithotomy position taking great care to pad all extremities. TEDs and Venodynes were placed as prophylaxis against deep venous thrombosis. Antibiotics were given for prophylaxis against surgical infection. A 52-French bougie was placed in the proximal esophagus by Anesthesia, above the cardioesophageal junction. A 2 cm midline incision was made at the junction of the upper two-thirds and lower one-third between the umbilicus and the xiphoid process. The fascia was then cleared of subcutaneous tissue using a tonsil clamp. A 1-2 cm incision was then made in the fascia gaining entry into the abdominal cavity without incident. Two sutures of 0 Vicryl were then placed superiorly and inferiorly in the fascia, and then tied to the special 12 mm Hasson trocar fitted with a funnel-shaped adaptor in order to occlude the fascial opening. Pneumoperitoneum was then established using carbon dioxide insufflation to a steady state of pressure of 16 mmHg. A 30-degree laparoscope was inserted through this port and used to guide the remaining trocars. The remaining trocars were then placed into the abdomen taking care to make the incisions along Langer's line, spreading the subcutaneous tissue with a tonsil clamp, and confirming the entry site by depressing the abdominal wall prior to insertion of the trocar. A total of 4 other 10/11 mm trocars were placed. Under direct vision 1 was inserted in the right upper quadrant at the midclavicular line, at a right supraumbilical position; another at the left upper quadrant at the midclavicular line, at a left supraumbilical position; 1 under the right costal margin in the anterior axillary line; and another laterally under the left costal margin on the anterior axillary line. All of the trocars were placed without difficulty. The patient was then placed in reverse Trendelenburg position. The triangular ligament was taken down sharply, and the left lobe of the liver was retracted superolaterally using a fan retractor placed through the right lateral cannula. The gastrohepatic ligament was then identified and incised in an avascular plane. The dissection was carried anteromedially onto the phrenoesophageal membrane. The phrenoesophageal membrane was divided on the anterior aspect of the hiatal orifice. This incision was extended to the right to allow identification of the right crus. Then along the inner side of the crus, the right esophageal wall was freed by dissecting the cleavage plane. The liberation of the posterior aspect of the esophagus was started by extending the dissection the length of the right diaphragmatic crus. The pars flaccida of the lesser omentum was opened, preserving the hepatic branches of the vagus nerve. This allowed free access to the crura, left and right, and the right posterior aspect of the esophagus, and the posterior vagus nerve. Attention was next turned to the left anterolateral aspect of the esophagus. At its left border, the left crus was identified. The dissection plane between it and the left aspect of the esophagus was freed. The gastrophrenic ligament was incised, beginning the mobilization of the gastric pouch. By dissecting the intramediastinal portion of the esophagus, we elongated the intra-abdominal segment of the esophagus and reduced the hiatal hernia. The next step consisted of mobilization of the gastric pouch. This required ligation and division of the gastrosplenic ligament and several short gastric vessels using the harmonic scalpel. This dissection started on the stomach at the point where the vessels of the greater curvature turned towards the spleen, away from the gastroepiploic arcade. The esophagus was lifted by a Babcock inserted through the left upper quadrant port. Careful dissection of the mesoesophagus and the left crus revealed a cleavage plane between the crus and the posterior gastric wall. Confirmation of having opened the correct plane was obtained by visualizing the spleen behind the esophagus. A one-half inch Penrose drain was inserted around the esophagus and sewn to itself in order to facilitate retraction of the distal esophagus. The retroesophageal channel was enlarged to allow easy passage of the antireflux valve. The 52-French bougie was then carefully lowered into the proximal stomach, and the hiatal orifice was repaired. Two interrupted 0 silk sutures were placed in the diaphragmatic crura to close the orifice. The last part of the operation consisted of the passage and fixation of the antireflux valve. With anterior retraction on the esophagus using the Penrose drain, a Babcock was passed behind the esophagus, from right to left. It was used to grab the gastric pouch to the left of the esophagus and to pull it behind, forming the wrap. The 52-French bougie was used to calibrate the external ring. Marcaine 0.5% was injected 1 fingerbreadth anterior to the anterior superior iliac spine and around the wound for postanesthetic pain control. The skin incision was approximated with skin staples. A dressing was then applied. All surgical counts were reported as correct. Having tolerated the procedure well, the patient was subsequently taken to the recovery room in good and stable condition."
59,Gastroenterology," CHIEF COMPLAINT: Abdominal pain. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 71-year-old female patient of Dr. X. The patient presented to the emergency room last evening with approximately 7- to 8-day history of abdominal pain which has been persistent. She was seen 3 to 4 days ago at ABC ER and underwent evaluation and discharged and had a CT scan at that time and she was told it was &quot;normal.&quot; She was given oral antibiotics of Cipro and Flagyl. She has had no nausea and vomiting, but has had persistent associated anorexia. She is passing flatus, but had some obstipation symptoms with the last bowel movement two days ago. She denies any bright red blood per rectum and no history of recent melena. Her last colonoscopy was approximately 5 years ago with Dr. Y. She has had no definite fevers or chills and no history of jaundice. The patient denies any significant recent weight loss. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for history of atrial fibrillation, under good control and now in normal sinus rhythm and on metoprolol and also on Premarin hormone replacement. PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Significant for cholecystectomy, appendectomy, and hysterectomy. She has a long history of known grade 4 bladder prolapse and she has been seen in the past by Dr. Chip Winkel, I believe that he has not been re-consulted. ALLERGIES: SHE IS ALLERGIC OR SENSITIVE TO MACRODANTIN. SOCIAL HISTORY: She does not drink or smoke. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Otherwise negative for any recent febrile illnesses, chest pains or shortness of breath. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: GENERAL: The patient is an elderly thin white female, very pleasant, in no acute distress. VITAL SIGNS: Her temperature is 98.8 and vital signs are all stable, within normal limits. HEENT: Head is grossly atraumatic and normocephalic. Sclerae are anicteric. The conjunctivae are non-injected. NECK: Supple. CHEST: Clear. HEART: Regular rate and rhythm. ABDOMEN: Generally nondistended and soft. She is focally tender in the left lower quadrant to deep palpation with a palpable fullness or mass and focally tender, but no rebound tenderness. There is no CVA or flank tenderness, although some very minimal left flank tenderness. PELVIC: Currently deferred, but has history of grade 4 urinary bladder prolapse. EXTREMITIES: Grossly and neurovascularly intact. LABORATORY VALUES: White blood cell count is 5.3, hemoglobin 12.8, and platelet count normal. Alkaline phosphatase elevated at 184. Liver function tests otherwise normal. Electrolytes normal. Glucose 134, BUN 4, and creatinine 0.7. DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES: EKG shows normal sinus rhythm. IMPRESSION AND PLAN: A 71-year-old female with greater than one-week history of abdominal pain now more localized to the left lower quadrant. Currently is a nonacute abdomen. The working diagnosis would be sigmoid diverticulitis. She does have a history in the distant past of sigmoid diverticulitis. I would recommend a repeat stat CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis and keep the patient nothing by mouth. The patient was seen 5 years ago by Dr. Y in Colorectal Surgery. We will consult her also for evaluation. The patient will need repeat colonoscopy in the near future and be kept nothing by mouth now empirically. The case was discussed with the patient's primary care physician, Dr. X. Again, currently there is no indication for acute surgical intervention on today's date, although the patient will need close observation and further diagnostic workup."
60,Gastroenterology," REASON FOR CONSULT: Genetic counseling. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a very pleasant 61-year-old female with a strong family history of colon polyps. The patient reports her first polyps noted at the age of 50. She has had colonoscopies required every five years and every time she has polyps were found. She reports that of her 11 brothers and sister 7 have had precancerous polyps. She does have an identical twice who is the one of the 11 who has never had a history of polyps. She also has history of several malignancies in the family. Her father died of a brain tumor at the age of 81. There is no history of knowing whether this was a primary brain tumor or whether it is a metastatic brain involvement. Her sister died at the age of 65 breast cancer. She has two maternal aunts with history of lung cancer both of whom were smoker. Also a paternal grandmother who was diagnosed with breast cancer at 86 and a paternal grandfather who had lung cancer. There is no other cancer history. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for asthma. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Include Serevent two puffs daily and Nasonex two sprays daily. ALLERGIES: Include penicillin.

The patient reports that her siblings have been very diligent about their preventing health and no one besides her sister who presented with the advanced breast cancer add anything more than precancerous adenomas. We will plan on proceeding with testing for adenomatous polyps. I will see her back in clinic once we get the results. I appreciate the referral."
61,Gastroenterology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Refractory dyspepsia. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 1. Hiatal hernia. 2. Reflux esophagitis. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Esophagogastroduodenoscopy with pseudo and esophageal biopsy. ANESTHESIA: Conscious sedation with Demerol and Versed. SPECIMEN: Esophageal biopsy. COMPLICATIONS: None. HISTORY: The patient is a 52-year-old female morbidly obese black female who has a long history of reflux and GERD type symptoms including complications such as hoarseness and chronic cough. She has been on multiple medical regimens and continues with dyspeptic symptoms. PROCEDURE: After proper informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the endoscopy suite. She was placed in the left lateral position and was given IV Demerol and Versed for sedation. When adequate level of sedation achieved, the gastroscope was inserted into the hypopharynx and the esophagus was easily intubated. At the GE junction, a hiatal hernia was present. There were mild inflammatory changes consistent with reflux esophagitis. The scope was then passed into the stomach. It was insufflated and the scope was coursed along the greater curvature to the antrum. The pylorus was patent. There was evidence of bile reflux in the antrum. The duodenal bulb and sweep were examined and were without evidence of mass, ulceration, or inflammation. The scope was then brought back into the antrum. A retroflexion was attempted multiple times, however, the patient was having difficulty holding the air and adequate retroflexion view was not visualized. The gastroscope was then slowly withdrawn. There were no other abnormalities noted in the fundus or body. Once again at the GE junction, esophageal biopsy was taken. The scope was then completely withdrawn. The patient tolerated the procedure and was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition. She will return to the General Medical Floor. We will continue b.i.d proton-pump inhibitor therapy as well as dietary restrictions. She should also attempt significant weight loss."
62,Gastroenterology," PROCEDURE: Colonoscopy. PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: The patient is a 56-year-old female. She was referred for a screening colonoscopy. The patient has bowel movements every other day. There is no blood in the stool, no abdominal pain. She has hypertension, dyslipidemia, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. She has had cesarean section twice in the past. Physical examination is unremarkable. There is no family history of colon cancer. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Diverticulosis. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: Procedure and possible complications were explained to the patient. Ample opportunity was provided to her to ask questions. Informed consent was obtained. She was placed in left lateral position. Inspection of perianal area was normal. Digital exam of the rectum was normal. Video Olympus colonoscope was introduced into the rectum. The sigmoid colon is very tortuous. The instrument was advanced to the cecum after placing the patient in a supine position. The patient was well prepared and a good examination was possible. The cecum was identified by the ileocecal valve and the appendiceal orifice. Images were taken. The instrument was then gradually withdrawn while examining the colon again in a circumferential manner. Few diverticula were encountered in the sigmoid and descending colon. Retroflex view of the rectum was unremarkable. No polyps or malignancy was identified. After obtaining images, the air was suctioned. Instrument was withdrawn from the patient. The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no complications. SUMMARY OF FINDINGS: Colonoscopy was performed to cecum and demonstrates the following: 1. Mild-to-moderate diverticulosis. 2. RECOMMENDATION: 1. The patient was provided information on diverticulosis including dietary advice. 2. She was advised repeat colonoscopy after 10 years."

65,Gastroenterology," CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST AND CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST REASON FOR EXAM: Generalized abdominal pain with swelling at the site of the ileostomy. TECHNIQUE: Axial CT images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained utilizing 100 mL of Isovue-300. CT ABDOMEN: The liver, spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, and kidneys are unremarkable. Punctate calcifications in the gallbladder lumen likely represent a gallstone. CT PELVIS: Postsurgical changes of a left lower quadrant ileostomy are again seen. There is no evidence for an obstruction. A partial colectomy and diverting ileostomy is seen within the right lower quadrant. The previously seen 3.4 cm subcutaneous fluid collection has resolved. Within the left lower quadrant, a 3.4 cm x 2.5 cm loculated fluid collection has not significantly changed. This is adjacent to the anastomosis site and a pelvic abscess cannot be excluded. No obstruction is seen. The appendix is not clearly visualized. The urinary bladder is unremarkable. IMPRESSION: 1. Resolution of the previously seen subcutaneous fluid collection. 2. Left pelvic 3.4 cm fluid collection has not significantly changed in size or appearance. These findings may be due to a pelvic abscess. 3. Right lower quadrant ileostomy has not significantly changed. 4. Cholelithiasis."
66,Gastroenterology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Morbid obesity. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Morbid obesity. PROCEDURE: Laparoscopic antecolic antegastric Roux-en-Y gastric bypass with EEA anastomosis. ANESTHESIA: General with endotracheal intubation. INDICATION FOR PROCEDURE: This is a 30-year-old female, who has been overweight for many years. She has tried many different diets, but is unsuccessful. She has been to our Bariatric Surgery Seminar, received some handouts, and signed the consent. The risks and benefits of the procedure have been explained to the patient. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating room table. All pressure points were carefully padded. She was given general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation. SCD stockings were placed on both legs. Foley catheter was placed for bladder decompression. The abdomen was then prepped and draped in standard sterile surgical fashion. Marcaine was then injected through umbilicus. A small incision was made. A Veress needle was introduced into the abdomen. CO2 insufflation was done to a maximum pressure of 15 mmHg. A 12-mm VersaStep port was placed through the umbilicus. I then placed a 5-mm port just anterior to the midaxillary line and just subcostal on the right side. I placed another 5-mm port in the midclavicular line just subcostal on the right side, a few centimeters below and medial to that, I placed a 12-mm VersaStep port. On the left side, just anterior to the midaxillary line and just subcostal, I placed a 5-mm port. A few centimeters below and medial to that, I placed a 15-mm port. I began by lifting up the omentum and identifying the transverse colon and lifting that up and thereby identifying my ligament of Treitz. I ran the small bowel down approximately 40 cm and divided the small bowel with a white load GIA stapler. I then divided the mesentery all the way down to the base of the mesentery with a LigaSure device. I then ran the distal bowel down, approximately 100 cm, and at 100 cm, I made a hole at the antimesenteric portion of the Roux limb and a hole in the antimesenteric portion of the duodenogastric limb, and I passed a 45 white load stapler and fired a stapler creating a side-to-side anastomosis. I reapproximated the edges of the defect. I lifted it up and stapled across it with another white load stapler. I then closed the mesenteric defect with interrupted Surgidac sutures. I divided the omentum all the way down to the colon in order to create a passageway for my small bowel to go antecolic. I then put the patient in reverse Trendelenburg. I placed a liver retractor, identified, and dissected the angle of His. I then dissected on the lesser curve, approximately 2.5 cm below the gastroesophageal junction, and got into a lesser space. I fired transversely across the stomach with a 45 blue load stapler. I then used two fires of the 60 blue load with SeamGuard to go up into my angle of His, thereby creating my gastric pouch. I then made a hole at the base of the gastric pouch and had Anesthesia remove the bougie and place the OG tube connected to the anvil. I pulled the anvil into place, and I then opened up my 15-mm port site and passed my EEA stapler. I passed that in the end of my Roux limb and had the spike come out antimesenteric. I joined the spike with the anvil and fired a stapler creating an end-to-side anastomosis, then divided across the redundant portion of my Roux limb with a white load GI stapler, and removed it with an Endocatch bag. I put some additional 2-0 Vicryl sutures in the anastomosis for further security. I then placed a bowel clamp across the bowel. I went above and passed an EGD scope into the mouth down to the esophagus and into the gastric pouch. I distended gastric pouch with air. There was no air leak seen. I could pass the scope easily through the anastomosis. There was no bleeding seen through the scope. We closed the 15-mm port site with interrupted 0 Vicryl suture utilizing Carter-Thomason. I copiously irrigated out that incision with about 2 L of saline. I then closed the skin of all incisions with running Monocryl. Sponge, instrument, and needle counts were correct at the end of the case. The patient tolerated the procedure well without any complications."
67,Gastroenterology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Dysphagia and esophageal spasm. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Esophagitis and esophageal stricture. PROCEDURE: Gastroscopy. MEDICATIONS: MAC. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The Olympus gastroscope was introduced into the oropharynx and passed carefully through the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum, to the third portion of the duodenum. The hypopharynx was normal and the upper esophageal sphincter was unremarkable. The esophageal contour was normal, with the gastroesophageal junction located at 38 cm from the incisors. At this point, there were several linear erosions and a sense of stricturing at 38 cm. Below this, there was a small hiatal hernia with the hiatus noted at 42 cm from the incisors. The mucosa within the hernia was normal. The gastric lumen was normal with normal mucosa throughout. The pylorus was patent permitting passage of the scope into the duodenum, which was normal through the third portion. During withdrawal of the scope, additional views were obtained of the cardia, confirming the presence of a small hiatal hernia. It was decided to attempt dilation of the strictured area, so an 18-mm TTS balloon was placed across the stricture and inflated to the recommended diameter. When the balloon was fully inflated, the lumen appeared to be larger than 18 mm diameter, suggesting that the stricture was in fact not a significant one. No stretching of the mucosa took place. The balloon was deflated and the scope was withdrawn. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was sent to the recovery room. FINAL DIAGNOSES: 1. Esophagitis. 2. Minor stricture at the gastroesophageal junction. 3. Hiatal hernia. 4. Otherwise normal upper endoscopy to the transverse duodenum. RECOMMENDATIONS: Continue proton pump inhibitor therapy."
68,Gastroenterology," SUBJECTIVE: She is a 79-year-old female who came in with acute cholecystitis and underwent attempted laparoscopic cholecystectomy 8 days ago. The patient has required conversion to an open procedure due to difficult anatomy. Her postoperative course has been lengthened due to a prolonged ileus, which resolved with tetracycline and Reglan. The patient is starting to improve, gain more strength. She is tolerating her regular diet. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Today, her temperature is 98.4, heart rate 84, respirations 20, and BP is 140/72. LUNGS: Clear to auscultation. No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi. HEART: Regular rhythm and rate. ABDOMEN: Soft, less tender. LABORATORY DATA: Her white count continues to come down. Today, it is 11.6, H&H of 8.8 and 26.4, platelets 359,000. We have ordered type and cross for 2 units of packed red blood cells. If it drops below 25, she will receive a transfusion. Her electrolytes today show a glucose of 107, sodium 137, potassium 4.0, chloride 103.2, bicarbonate 29.7. Her AST is 43, ALT is 223, her alkaline phosphatase is 214, and her bilirubin is less than 0.10. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: She had a bowel movement today and is continuing to improve. I anticipate another 3 days in the hospital for strengthening and continued TPN and resolution of elevated white count."
69,Gastroenterology," HISTORY: A is a 55-year-old who I know well because I have been taking care of her husband. She comes for discussion of a screening colonoscopy. Her last colonoscopy was in 2002, and at that time she was told it was essentially normal. Nonetheless, she has a strong family history of colon cancer, and it has been almost four to five years so she wants to have a repeat colonoscopy. I told her that the interval was appropriate and that it made sense to do so. She denies any significant weight change that she cannot explain. She has had no hematochezia. She denies any melena. She says she has had no real change in her bowel habit but occasionally does have thin stools. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: On today's visit we reviewed her entire health history. Surgically she has had a stomach operation for ulcer disease back in 1974, she says. She does not know exactly what was done. It was done at a hospital in California which she says no longer exists. This makes it difficult to find out exactly what she had done. She also had her gallbladder and appendix taken out in the 1970s at the same hospital. Medically she has no significant problems and no true medical illnesses. She does suffer from some mild gastroparesis, she says. MEDICATIONS: Reglan 10 mg once a day. ALLERGIES: She denies any allergies to medications but is sensitive to medications that cause her to have ulcers, she says. SOCIAL HISTORY: She still smokes one pack of cigarettes a day. She was counseled to quit. She occasionally uses alcohol. She has never used illicit drugs. She is married, is a housewife, and has four children. FAMILY HISTORY: Positive for diabetes and cancer. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Essentially as mentioned above. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: GENERAL: A is a healthy appearing female in no apparent distress. VITAL SIGNS: Her vital signs reveal a weight of 164 pounds, blood pressure 140/90, temperature of 97.6 degrees F. HEENT: No cervical bruits, thyromegaly, or masses. She has no lymphadenopathy in the head and neck, supraclavicular, or axillary spaces bilaterally. LUNGS: Clear to auscultation bilaterally with no wheezes, rubs, or rhonchi. HEART: Regular rate and rhythm without murmur, rub, or gallop. ABDOMEN: Soft, nontender, nondistended. EXTREMITIES: No cyanosis, clubbing, or edema, with good pulses in the radial arteries bilaterally. NEURO: No focal deficits, is intact to soft touch in all four. ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS: In light of her history and physical, clearly the patient would be well served with an upper and lower endoscopy. We do not know what the anatomy is, and if she did have an antrectomy, she needs to be checked for marginal ulcers. She also complains of significant reflux and has not had an upper endoscopy in over five to six years as well. I discussed the risks, benefits, and alternatives to upper and lower endoscopy, and these include over sedation, perforation, and dehydration, and she wants to proceed. We will schedule her for an upper and lower endoscopy at her convenience."
70,Gastroenterology," CT ABDOMEN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST AND CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST REASON FOR EXAM: Generalized abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, and recent colonic resection in 11/08. TECHNIQUE: Axial CT images of the abdomen were obtained without contrast. Axial CT images of the abdomen and pelvis were then obtained utilizing 100 mL of Isovue-300. FINDINGS: The liver is normal in size and attenuation. The gallbladder is normal. The spleen is normal in size and attenuation. The adrenal glands and pancreas are unremarkable. The kidneys are normal in size and attenuation. No hydronephrosis is detected. Free fluid is seen within the right upper quadrant within the lower pelvis. A markedly thickened loop of distal small bowel is seen. This segment measures at least 10-cm long. No definite pneumatosis is appreciated. No free air is apparent at this time. Inflammatory changes around this loop of bowel. Mild distention of adjacent small bowel loops measuring up to 3.5 cm is evident. No complete obstruction is suspected, as there is contrast material within the colon. Postsurgical changes compatible with the partial colectomy are noted. Postsurgical changes of the anterior abdominal wall are seen. Mild thickening of the urinary bladder wall is seen. IMPRESSION: 1. Marked thickening of a segment of distal small bowel is seen with free fluid within the abdomen and pelvis. An inflammatory process such as infection or ischemia must be considered. Close interval followup is necessary. 2. Thickening of the urinary bladder wall is nonspecific and may be due to under distention. However, evaluation for cystitis is advised."
71,Gastroenterology," EXAM: CT pelvis with contrast and ct abdomen with and without contrast. INDICATIONS: Abnormal liver enzymes and diarrhea. TECHNIQUE: CT examination of the abdomen and pelvis was performed after 100 mL of intravenous contrast administration and oral contrast administration. Pre-contrast images through the abdomen were also obtained. COMPARISON: There were no comparison studies. FINDINGS: The lung bases are clear. The liver demonstrates mild intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. These findings may be secondary to the patient's post cholecystectomy state. The pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands, and kidneys are unremarkable. There is a 13 mm peripheral-enhancing fluid collection in the anterior pararenal space of uncertain etiology. There are numerous nonspecific retroperitoneal and mesenteric lymph nodes. These may be reactive; however, an early neoplastic process would be difficult to totally exclude. There is a right inguinal hernia containing a loop of small bowel. This may produce a partial obstruction as there is mild fluid distention of several small bowel loops, particularly in the right lower quadrant. The large bowel demonstrates significant diverticulosis coli of the sigmoid and distal descending colon without evidence of diverticulitis. There is diffuse osteopenia along with significant degenerative changes in the lower lumbar spine. The urinary bladder is unremarkable. The uterus is not visualized. IMPRESSION: 1. Right inguinal hernia containing small bowel. Partial obstruction is suspected. 2. Nonspecific retroperitoneal and mesenteric lymph nodes. 3. Thirteen millimeter of circumscribed fluid collection in the anterior pararenal space of uncertain etiology. 4. Diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis. 5. Status post cholecystectomy with mild intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. 6. Osteopenia and degenerative changes of the spine and pelvis."
72,Gastroenterology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Abdominal aortic aneurysm. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Abdominal aortic aneurysm. OPERATION PERFORMED: Endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. FINDINGS: The patient was brought to the OR with the known 4 cm abdominal aortic aneurysm + 2.5 cm right common iliac artery aneurysm. A Gore exclusive device was used 3 pieces were used to effect the repair. We had to place an iliac extender down in to right external iliac artery to manage the right common iliac artery aneurysm. The right hypogastric artery had been previously coiled off. Left common femoral artery was used for the _____ side. We had small type 2 leak right underneath the take off the renal arteries, this was not felt to be type I leak and this was very delayed filling and it was felt that this was highly indicative of type 2 leak from a lumbar artery, which commonly come off in this area. It was felt that this would seal after reversal of the anticoagulation given sufficient time. PROCEDURE: With the patient supine position under general anesthesia, the abdomen and lower extremities were prepped and draped in a sterile fashion. Bilateral groin incisions were made, and the common femoral arteries were dissected out bilaterally. The patient was then heparinized. The 7-French sheaths were then placed retrograde bilaterally. A stiff Amplatz wires were then placed up the right femoral artery and a stiff Amplatz were placed left side a calibrated catheter was placed up the right side. The calibrated aortogram was the done. We marked the renal arteries aortic bifurcation and bifurcation, common iliac arteries. We then preceded placement of the main trunk, by replacing the 7 French sheath in the left groin area with 18-french sheath and then deployed the trunk body just below the take off renal arteries. Once the main trunk has been deployed within wired _____ then deployed an iliac limb down in to the right common iliac artery. As noted above, we then had to place an iliac extension, down in the external iliac artery to exclude the right common iliac artery and resume completely. Following completion of the above all arteries were ballooned appropriately. A completion angiogram was done which showed late small type 2 leak just under the take off renal arteries. The area was ballooned aggressively. It was felt that this would dissolve as discussed above. Following completion of the above all wire sheaths etc., were removed from both groin areas. Both femoral arteries were repaired by primary suture technique. Flow was then reestablished to the lower extremities, and protamine was given to reverse the heparin. Both surgical sites were then irrigated thoroughly. Meticulous hemostasis was achieved. Both wounds were then closed in a routine layered fashion. Sterile antibiotic dressings were applied. Sponge and needle counts were reported as correct. The patient tolerated the procedure well the patient was taken to the recovery room in satisfactory condition."

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: AF's symptoms began 2 days ago, and he has not passed gas or had any bowel movements. He has not eaten anything, and has vomited 8 times. AF reports 10/10 pain in the LLQ. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: AF's past medical history is significant for an abdominal injury during the Vietnam War which required surgery, and multiple episodes of small bowel obstruction and abdominal pain. Other elements of his history include alcoholism, cocaine abuse, alcoholic hepatitis, hepatitis C positive, acute pancreatitis, chronic pancreatitis, appendicitis, liver hematoma/contusion, Hodgkin's Disease, constipation, diarrhea, paralytic ileus, anemia, multiple blood transfusions, chorioretinitis, pneumonia, and &quot;crack chest pain&quot; PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: AF has had multiple abdominal surgeries, including Bill Roth Procedure Type 1 (partial gastrectomy) during Vietnam War, at least 2 exploratory laparotomies and enterolysis procedures (1993; 2000), and appendectomy MEDICATIONS: None. ALLERGIES: Iodine, IV contrast (anaphylaxis), and seafood/shellfish. FAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory. SOCIAL HISTORY: AF was born and raised in San Francisco. His father was an alcoholic. He currently lives with his sister, and does not work; he collects a pension. HEALTH-RELATED BEHAVIORS: AF reports that he smokes 1 to 2 cigarettes per day, and drinks 40 ounces of beer per day. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Noncontributory, except that patient reports a 6 pound weight loss since his symptoms began, and reports multiple transfusions for anemia. PHYSICAL EXAM: Vital Signs: T: 37.1 BP: 127/94 HR: 125 RR: 16 O2 Sat: 95% room air. General: 50 year old African-American man in acute distress, writhing on gurney and rubbing abdomen. Skin: well healed abdominal scar extending along the linea alba, from the xiphoid process to the pubic tubercle; another scar at McBurney's Point, about 3 or 4 inches long. HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, O/P clear-dry. Neck: Supple, no LAD. Heart: Tachycardic, regular rhythm; nl S1 & S2; 2/6 systolic murmur heard best over left sternal border. Lungs: CTAB. Abdomen: Multiple scars (see Skin); firm and distended; TTP, especially in LLQ, with rebound tenderness; guarding difficult to assess secondary to distention; tinkling and high-pitched bowel sounds, particularly in upper quadrants; ventral hernia near umbilicus. Rectal: Normal tone, guiac negative. Extremities: Mormal. Vascular: Normal distal pulses. Lymphatics: Enlarged, nontender anterior cervical and inguinal lymph nodes. Neurological: A&OX4 and cooperative. STUDIES: CXR: Clear lung fields; NGT in stomach. Abdominal CT: Low attenuation signal in internal superior left lobe of the liver, distended sludge-filled gallbladder, 8mm dilated CBD, no free air, no free fluid, small bowel loops consistent with but not definitive of obstruction. ASSESSMENT: AF is a 50-year-old African-American man with abdominal pain and distention, obstipation, and vomiting. The differential diagnosis includes paralytic ileus and mechanical obstruction. Paralytic ileus, which is characterized by absence of bowel sounds, gas scattered in the GI tract, dilation of the entire bowel, and a recent abdominal surgery, is unlikely in this case. AF is more likely suffering from a bowel obstruction: he has multiple risk factors (past abdominal surgery, multiple episodes of obstruction from adhesions) and symptoms and signs (bowel sounds, vomiting) consistent with obstruction. Mechanical bowel obstruction can be caused by: 1. Adhesions (most cases): typically from prior surgeries. 2. Hernias (second most common cause). 3. Tumors (15% of cases): rare in small intestine; most common cause of large intestine obstruction. 4. Intussusception (especially in kids). 5. Volvulus (especially in elderly). 6. Obturation: fecal impactions, gallstone ileus, parasitic infections. 7. Inflammatory lesions: TB, regional enteritis, ulcerative colitis, amebiasis. 8. Vascular obstruction: embolism, increased venous pressure, hypercoagulability, vascular disease; especially in elderly. Given the patient's history of multiple abdominal surgeries and adhesions causing small bowel obstruction, AF's obstruction is most likely caused by adhesions. One question to answer in any patient presenting with bowel obstruction is whether the obstruction is in the small or large intestine. In small bowel obstruction, the pain is sharp and frequent, with early vomiting and electrolyte imbalance. In contrast, large bowel obstruction may present in elderly patients without vomiting, and typically without hernias or a history of abdominal surgery. Radiographic studies can definitively locate the site of the obstruction. In this patient, though the radiographic evidence was equivocal, the presence of vomiting and the quality and frequency of his pain suggested small bowel obstruction. PLAN: There has been a great deal of debate about the best way to treat patients with mechanical obstruction. I will focus on the question of whether a patient should be managed conservatively or with an operation. This question is vital because mechanical obstruction may lead to strangulation and perforation, life-threatening consequences. There is no reliable way to determine whether the patient is already suffering from strangulated bowel, and next to impossible to predict which patients will suffer from strangulation. Patients that have hernias are sent immediately to the operating room for a repair; the surgeon will resect any nonviable bowel. For patients suffering from an obstruction due to adhesions, the decision becomes difficult. Fifteen percent of these patients may have strangulating obstruction. Simple (nonstrangulating) bowel obstruction typically presents with intermittent, colicky pain. Strangulating obstruction, in contrast, usually presents with steady unrelenting pain. Other signs include a palpable mass, increased temperature and heart rate, and lab studies indicating acute inflammation. Several studies have examined the ability of these signs to predict when strangulation is present. After a study of 238 patients with small bowel obstruction, Stewardson et al. (1978) suggest that physicians, instead of considering individual signs, look at a combination of &quot;classic findings&quot; including leukocytosis, fever, tachycardia, and localized tenderness. They recommend conservative treatment only for patients with none or only one of these signs. Ninety percent of patients with strangulated bowel had two or more signs. Bizer et al. (1981), on the other hand, found no correlation between these signs and the presence of strangulation. They did find a correlation with age, feculent vomiting, peristaltitic sounds, and a white cell count above 18,000. It is clear that there are no absolute guidelines determining whether a patient can be treated conservatively or must get an operation. Improvements in imaging techniques in the recent past have aided in these critical decisions. Computed tomography can frequently be used to diagnose strangulation, however in the majority of cases misses the diagnosis. Apparently, the decision to operate ultimately falls on the judgment of the surgeon who must take into account all of the findings in combination. The operative treatment of mechanical obstruction is removing the obstruction resecting nonviable bowel, and creating a bypass if necessary. Conservative treatment primarily includes decompression, rehydration, and frequent monitoring. The physician must also decide on what type of tube should be used to decompress, and how long the nonoperative treatment will be attempted before resorting to surgery. The question of the tube has been a controversy for years, some advocating the nasogastric tube for all patients, others advocating a nasointestinal tube for distal obstructions. Maglinte et al. (2001) explain that nasointestinal tubes are more effective at decompressing distal obstructions, and suggest that physicians use a multipurpose tube that can be used as a nasogatric tube, a nasointestinal tube, and a diagnostic tool (can provide route for enteroclysis). Nasogastric tubes are especially unable to decompress distal distention in patients with a competent pyloric sphincter. Finally, the length of the trial period of nonoperative management is also debatable. Seror et al. (1993) suggest a 5-day trial to allow time for spontaneous resolution, and report a 73% success rate in a study of patients with a history of bowel surgery. In contrast, Deutsch et al. (1989) suggest only a 24 hour trial of conservative therapy, and only for patients with partial obstruction. Again, it appears as though this decision presently is at the discretion of the surgeon caring for the patient. In the case of patient AF, his findings made the decision to operate particularly difficult. He was clearly tachycardic; his WBC was elevated, but not above 18,000. His abdominal pain was steady and unrelenting, and could be localized to the LLQ, but he was afebrile. His abdominal CT was consistent with small bowel obstruction, but not definitive. In the end, based on the team's desire to avoid another abdominal surgery that could lead to more adhesions and another obstruction, we chose conservative management, with nasogastric tube decompression, rehydration, and close observation."
74,Gastroenterology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: History of colitis. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Small left colon polyp. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Total colonoscopy and polypectomy. ANESTHESIA: IV Versed 8 mg and 175 mcg of IV fentanyl. CLINICAL HISTORY: This patient had a tough time with colitis 10 years ago and has intermittent problems with bleeding. He has been admitted to the hospital now for colonoscopy and polyp surveillance. PROCEDURE: The patient was prepped and draped in a left lateral decubitus position. The flexible 165 cm CF video Olympus colonoscope was inserted through the anus and passed under TV-directed monitor through the area of the rectum, sigmoid colon, left colon, transverse colon, right colon, and cecum. He had an excellent prep. He had a 2-3 mm polyp in the left colon that was removed with a jumbo biopsy forceps. He tolerated the procedure well. There was no other evidence of any cancer, growth, tumor, colitis, or problems throughout the entire colon. His exam that he had in 1997 showed a small amount of colitis at that time and he has had some intermittent symptoms since. Representative pictures were taken throughout the entire exam. There was no other evidence any problems. On withdrawal of the scope, the same findings were noted. FINAL IMPRESSION: Small, left colon polyp in a patient with intermittent colitis-like symptoms and bleeding."
75,Gastroenterology," PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: Following instructions and completion of an oral colonoscopy prep, the patient, having been properly informed of, with signature consenting to total colonoscopy and indicated procedures, the patient received premedications of Vistaril 50 mg, Atropine 0.4 mg IM, and then intravenous medications of Demerol 50 mg and Versed 5 mg IV. Perirectal inspection was normal. The Olympus video colonoscope then was introduced into the rectum and passed by directed vision to the cecum and into the terminal ileum. No abnormalities were seen of the terminal ileum, the ileocecal valve, cecum, ascending colon, hepatic flexure, transverse colon, splenic flexure, descending colon, rectosigmoid and rectum. Retroflexion exam in the rectum revealed no other abnormality and withdrawal terminated the procedure."
76,Gastroenterology," INDICATION: Rectal bleeding. PREMEDICATION: See procedure nurse NCS form. PROCEDURE: After informed consent was obtained from the patient, the patient was placed in the left lateral position. Digital rectal exam was performed revealing normal sphincter tone and no external hemorrhoids. A Pentax video endoscope was then inserted into rectum. The quality of the preparation was good. Under direct visualization, the endoscope was advanced to 60 cm from the anus without difficulty, and then slowly withdrawn, with careful examination of the colonic mucosa. The mucosa was normal with the normal vascular pattern and no granularity, friability, or ulceration. There was no evidence of other polyps, masses, diverticula, or angiodysplasia. Retroflexion was performed in the rectum, and there were a few small white patches just at the anal verge. These were biopsied to rule out any abnormality and also internal hemorrhoids were noted. The colonoscope was then removed and the procedure was terminated. The endoscope was removed and the procedure terminated. The patient tolerated the procedure well without complications. IMPRESSION: 1. White plaques at the anal verge, biopsied to rule out abnormality. 2. Internal hemorrhoids, otherwise normal flexible sigmoidoscopy. PLAN: Continue fiber supplement as well as hyoscyamine. Await laboratory results. I will see her back in July 2005 when I return from maternity leave. If she has any problems during the interval when I am gone, she will follow up with any other physicians here in the office."
77,Gastroenterology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Acute appendicitis. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Acute appendicitis. OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: Laparoscopic appendectomy. INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS: Include inflamed, non-perforated appendix. OPERATIVE NOTE: The patient was seen by me in the preoperative holding area. The risks of the procedure were explained. She was taken to the operating room and given perioperative antibiotics prior to coming to the surgery. General anesthesia was carried out without difficulty and a Foley catheter was inserted. The left arm was tucked and the abdomen was prepped with Betadine and draped in sterile fashion. A 5-mm blunt port was inserted infra-umbilically at the level of the umbilicus under direct vision of a 5-mm 0-degree laparoscope. Once we were inside the abdominal cavity, CO2 was instilled to attain an adequate pneumoperitoneum. A left lower quadrant 5-mm port was placed under direct vision and a 12-mm port in the suprapubic region. The 5-mm scope was introduced at the umbilical port and the appendix was easily visualized. The base of the cecum was acutely inflamed but not perforated. I then was easily able to grasp the mesoappendix and create a window between the base of the mesoappendix and the base of the appendix. The window is big enough to get an Endo GIA blue cartridge through it and fired across the base of the mesoappendix without difficulty. I reloaded with a red vascular cartridge, came across the mesoappendix without difficulty. I then placed the appendix in an Endobag and brought out through the suprapubic port without difficulty. I reinserted the suprapubic port and irrigated out the right lower quadrant until dry. One final inspection revealed no bleeding from the staple line. We then removed all ports under direct vision, and there was no bleeding from the abdominal trocar sites. The pneumoperitoneum was then deflated and the suprapubic fascial defect was closed with 0-Vicryl suture. The skin incision was injected with 0.25% Marcaine and closed with 4-0 Monocryl suture. Steri-strips and sterile dressings were applied. No complications. Minimal blood loss. Specimen is the appendix. Brought to the recovery room in stable condition."
78,Gastroenterology," ADMITTING DIAGNOSES: Hiatal hernia, gastroesophageal reflux disease reflux. DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: Hiatal hernia, gastroesophageal reflux disease reflux. SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS: Postoperative ileus. PROCEDURES DONE: Hiatal hernia repair and Nissen fundoplication revision. BRIEF HISTORY: The patient is an 18-year-old male who has had a history of a Nissen fundoplication performed six years ago for gastric reflux. Approximately one year ago, he was involved in a motor vehicle accident and CT scan at that time showed that he had a hiatal hernia. Over the past year, this has caused him an increasing number of problems, including chest pain when he eats, and shortness of breath after large meals. He is also having reflux symptoms again. He presents to us for repair of the hiatal hernia and revision of the Nissen fundoplication. HOSPITAL COURSE: Mr. A was admitted to the adolescent floor by Brenner Children's Hospital after his procedure. He was stable at that time. He did complain of some nausea. However, he did not have any vomiting at that time. He had an NG tube in and was n.p.o. He also had a PCA for pain management as well as Toradol. On postoperative day #1, he complained of not being able to urinate, so a Foley catheter was placed. Over the next several days, his hospital course proceeded as follows. He continued to complain of some nausea; however, he did not ever have any vomiting. Eventually, the Foley catheter was discontinued and he had excellent urine output without any complications. He ambulated frequently. He remained n.p.o. for three days. He also had the NG tube in during that time. On postoperative day #4, he began to have some flatus, and the NG tube was discontinued. He was advanced to a liquid diet and tolerated this without any complications. At this time, he was still using the PCA for pain control. However, he was using it much less frequently than on days #1 and #2 postoperatively. After tolerating the full liquid diet without any complications, he was advanced to a soft diet and his pain medications were transitioned to p.o. medications rather than the PCA. The PCA was discontinued. He tolerated the soft diet without any complications and continued to have flatus frequently. On postoperative day #6, it was determined that he was stable for discharge to home as he was taking p.o. without any complications. His pain was well controlled with p.o. pain medications. He was passing gas frequently, had excellent urine output, and was ambulating frequently without any issues. DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable. DISPOSITION: Discharged to home. DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: The patient was discharged to home with instructions for maintaining a soft diet. It was also recommended that he does not drink any soda postoperatively. He is instructed to keep his incision site clean and dry and it was also recommended that he avoid any heavy lifting. He will be able to attend school when it starts in a few weeks. However, he is not going to be able to play football in the near future. He was given prescription for pain medication upon discharge. He is instructed to contact Pediatric Surgery if he has any fevers, any nausea and vomiting, any chest pain, any constipation, or any other concerns."
79,Gastroenterology," PROCEDURE: Esophagogastroduodenoscopy with biopsy. PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: A 1-year-10-month-old with a history of dysphagia to solids. The procedure was done to rule out organic disease. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Loose lower esophageal sphincter and duodenal ulcers. CONSENT: The consent is signed. MEDICATIONS: The procedure was done under general anesthesia given by Dr. Marino Fernandez. COMPLICATIONS: None. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: A history and physical examination were performed, and the procedure, indications, potential complications including bleeding, perforation, the need for surgery, infection, adverse medical reaction, risks, benefits, and alternatives available were explained to the parents, who stated good understanding and consented to go ahead with the procedure. The opportunity for questions was provided, and informed consent was obtained. Once the consent was obtained, the patient was sedated with IV medications and intubated by Dr. Fernandez and placed in the supine position. Then, the tip of the XP-160 videoscope was introduced into the oropharynx, and under direct visualization, we could advance the endoscope into the upper, mid, and lower esophagus. We did not find any strictures in the upper esophagus, but the patient had the lower esophageal sphincter totally loose. Then the tip of the endoscope was advanced down into the stomach and guided into the pylorus, and then into the first portion of the duodenum. We noticed that the patient had several ulcers in the first portion of the duodenum. Then the tip of the endoscope was advanced down into the second portion of the duodenum, one biopsy was taken there, and then, the tip of the endoscope was brought back to the first portion, and two biopsies were taken there. Then, the tip of the endoscope was brought back to the antrum, where two biopsies were taken, and one biopsy for CLOtest. By retroflexed view, at the level of the body of the stomach, I could see that the patient had the lower esophageal sphincter loose. Finally, the endoscope was unflexed and was brought back to the lower esophagus, where two biopsies were taken. At the end, air was suctioned from the stomach, and the endoscope was removed out of the patient's mouth. The patient tolerated the procedure well with no complications. FINAL IMPRESSION: 1. Duodenal ulcers. 2. Loose lower esophageal sphincter. PLAN: 1. To start omeprazole 20 mg a day. 2. To review the biopsies. 3. To return the patient back to clinic in 1 to 2 weeks."
80,Gastroenterology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Acute appendicitis. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Perforated Meckel's diverticulum. PROCEDURES PERFORMED: 1. Diagnostic laparotomy. 2. Exploratory laparotomy. 3. Meckel's diverticulectomy. 4. Open incidental appendectomy. 5. Peritoneal toilet. ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 300 ml. URINE OUTPUT: 200 ml. TOTAL FLUID: 1600 mL. DRAIN: JP x1 right lower quadrant and anterior to the rectum. TUBES: Include an NG and a Foley catheter. SPECIMENS: Include Meckel's diverticulum and appendix. COMPLICATIONS: Ventilator-dependent respiratory failure with hypoxemia following closure. BRIEF HISTORY: This is a 45-year-old Caucasian gentleman presented to ABCD General Hospital with acute onset of right lower quadrant pain that began 24 hours prior to this evaluation. The pain was very vague and progressed in intensity. The patient has had anorexia with decrease in appetite. His physical examination revealed the patient to be febrile with the temperature of 102.4. He had right lower quadrant and suprapubic tenderness with palpation with Rovsing sign and rebound consistent with acute surgical abdomen. The patient was presumed acute appendicitis and was placed on IV antibiotics and recommended that he undergo diagnostic laparoscopy with possible open exploratory laparotomy. He was explained the risks, benefits, and complications of the procedure and gave informed consent to proceed. OPERATIVE FINDINGS: Diagnostic laparoscopy revealed purulent drainage within the region of the right lower quadrant adjacent to the cecum and terminal ileum. There was large amounts of purulent drainage. The appendix was visualized, however, it was difficult to be visualized secondary to the acute inflammatory process, purulent drainage, and edema. It was decided given the signs of perforation and purulent drainage within the abdomen that we would convert to an open exploratory laparotomy. Upon exploration of the ileum, there was noted to be a ruptured Meckel's diverticulum, this was resected. Additionally, the appendix appeared normal without evidence of perforation and/or edema and a decision to proceed with incidental appendectomy was performed. The patient was irrigated with copious amounts of warmth normal saline approximately 2 to 3 liters. The patient was closed and did develop some hypoxemia after closure. He remained ventilated and was placed on a large amount of ________. His hypoxia did resolve and he remained intubated and proceed to the Critical Care Complex or postop surgical care. OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the operative suite and placed in the supine position. He did receive preoperative IV antibiotics, sequential compression devices, NG tube placement with Foley catheter, and heparin subcutaneously. The patient was intubated by the Anesthesia Department. After adequate anesthesia was obtained, the abdomen was prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion with Betadine solution. Utilizing a #10 blade scalpel, an infraumbilical incision was created. The Veress needle was inserted into the abdomen. The abdomen was insufflated to approximately 15 mmHg. A #10 mm ablated trocar was inserted into the abdomen and a video laparoscope was inserted and the abdomen was explored and the above findings were noted. A right upper quadrant 5 mm port was inserted to help with manipulation of bowel and to visualize the appendix. Decision was then made to convert to exploratory laparotomy given the signs of acute perforation. The instruments were then removed. The abdomen was then deflated. Utilizing ________ #10 blade scalpel, a midline incision was created from the xiphoid down to level of the pubic symphysis. The incision was carried down with a #10 blade scalpel and the bleeding was controlled along the way with electrocautery. The posterior layer of the rectus fascia and peritoneum was opened carefully with the scissors as the peritoneum had already been penetrated during laparoscopy. Incision was carried down to the midline within the linea alba. Once the abdomen was opened, there was noted to be gross purulent drainage. The ileum was explored and there was noted to be a perforated Meckel's diverticulum. Decision to resect the diverticulum was performed. The blood supply to the Meckel's diverticulum was carefully dissected free and a #3-0 Vicryl was used to tie off the blood supply to the Meckel's diverticulum. Clamps were placed to the proximal supply to the Meckel's diverticulum was tied off with #3-0 Vicryl sutures. The Meckel's diverticulum was noted to be completely free and was grasped anteriorly and utilizing a GIA stapling device, the diverticulum was transected. There was noted to be a hemostatic region within the transection and staple line looked intact without evidence of perforation and/or leakage. Next, decision was decided to go ahead and perform an appendectomy. Mesoappendix was doubly clamped with hemostats and cut with Metzenbaum scissors. The appendiceal artery was identified and was clamped between two hemostats and transected as well. Once the appendix was completely freed of the surrounding inflammation and adhesion. A plain gut was placed at the base of the appendix and tied down. The appendix was milked distally with a straight stat and clamped approximately halfway. A second piece of plain gut suture was used to ligate above and then was transected with a #10 blade scalpel. The appendiceal stump was then inverted with a pursestring suture of #2-0 Vicryl suture. Once the ________ was completed, decision to place a JP drain within the right lower quadrant was performed. The drain was positioned within the right lower quadrant and anterior to the rectum and brought out through a separate site in the anterior abdominal wall. It was sewn in place with a #3-0 nylon suture. The abdomen was then irrigated with copious amounts of warmed normal saline. The remainder of the abdomen was unremarkable for pathology. The omentum was replaced over the bowel contents and utilizing #1-0 PDS suture, the abdominal wall, anterior and posterior rectus fascias were closed with a running suture. Once the abdomen was completely closed, the subcutaneous tissue was irrigated with copious amounts of saline and the incision was closed with staples. The previous laparoscopic sites were also closed with staples. Sterile dressings were placed over the wound with Adaptic and 4x4s and covered with ABDs. JPs replaced with bulb suction. NG tube and Foley catheter were left in place. The patient tolerated this procedure well with exception of hypoxemia which resolved by the conclusion of the case. The patient will proceed to the Critical Care Complex where he will be closely evaluated and followed in his postoperative course. To remain on IV antibiotics and we will manage ventilatory-dependency of the patient."
81,Gastroenterology," PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Umbilical hernia repair. PROCEDURE: After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the operative suite and placed supine on the operating table. The patient was sedated, and an adequate local anesthetic was administered using 1% lidocaine without epinephrine. The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner. A standard curvilinear umbilical incision was made, and dissection was carried down to the hernia sac using a combination of Metzenbaum scissors and Bovie electrocautery. The sac was cleared of overlying adherent tissue, and the fascial defect was delineated. The fascia was cleared of any adherent tissue for a distance of 1.5 cm from the defect. The sac was then placed into the abdominal cavity and the defect was closed primarily using simple interrupted 0 Vicryl sutures. The umbilicus was then re-formed using 4-0 Vicryl to tack the umbilical skin to the fascia. The wound was then irrigated using sterile saline, and hemostasis was obtained using Bovie electrocautery. The skin was approximated with 4-0 Vicryl in a subcuticular fashion. The skin was prepped with benzoin, and Steri-Strips were applied. A dressing was then applied. All surgical counts were reported as correct. Having tolerated the procedure well, the patient was subsequently taken to the recovery room in good and stable condition."
82,Gastroenterology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Esophageal rupture. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Esophageal rupture. OPERATION PERFORMED 1. Left thoracotomy with drainage of pleural fluid collection. 2. Esophageal exploration and repair of esophageal perforation. 3. Diagnostic laparoscopy and gastrostomy. 4. Radiographic gastrostomy tube study with gastric contrast, interpretation. ANESTHESIA: General anesthesia. INDICATIONS OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient is a 47-year-old male with a history of chronic esophageal stricture who is admitted with food sticking and retching. He has esophageal rupture on CT scan and comes now for a thoracotomy and gastrostomy. DETAILS OF THE PROCEDURE: After an extensive informed consent discussion process, the patient was brought to the operating room. He was placed in a supine position on the operating table. After induction of general anesthesia and placement of a double lumen endotracheal tube, he was turned and placed in a right lateral decubitus position on a beanbag with appropriate padding and axillary roll. Left chest was prepped and draped in a usual sterile fashion. After administration of intravenous antibiotics, a left thoracotomy incision was made, dissection was carried down to the subcutaneous tissues, muscle layers down to the fifth interspace. The left lung was deflated and the pleural cavity entered. The Finochietto retractor was used to help provide exposure. The sixth rib was shingled in the posterior position and a careful expiration of the left pleural cavity was performed. Immediately encountered was left pleural fluid including some purulent fluid. Cultures of this were sampled and sent for microbiology analysis. The left pleural space was then copiously irrigated. A careful expiration demonstrated that the rupture appeared to be sealed. There was crepitus within the mediastinal cavity. The mediastinum was opened and explored and the esophagus was explored. The tissues of the esophagus appeared to show some friability and an area of the rupture in the distal esophagus. It was not possible to place any stitches in this tissue and instead a small intercostal flap was developed and placed to cover the area. The area was copiously irrigated, this provided nice coverage and repair. After final irrigation and inspection, two chest tubes were placed including a #36 French right angled tube at the diaphragm and a posterior straight #36 French. These were secured at the left axillary line region at the skin level with #0-silk. The intercostal sutures were used to close the chest wall with a #2 Vicryl sutures. Muscle layers were closed with running #1 Vicryl sutures. The wound was irrigated and the skin was closed with skin staples. The patient was then turned and placed in a supine position. A laparoscopic gastrostomy was performed and then a diagnostic laparoscopy performed. A Veress needle was carefully inserted into the abdomen, pneumoperitoneum was established in the usual fashion, a bladeless 5-mm separator trocar was introduced. The laparoscope was introduced. A single additional left-sided separator trocar was introduced. It was not possible to safely pass a nasogastric or orogastric tube, pass the stricture and perforation and so the nasogastric tube was left right at the level where there was some stricture or narrowing or resistance. The stomach however did have some air insufflation and we were able to place our T-fasteners through the anterior abdominal wall and through the anterior gastric wall safely. The skin incision was made and the gastric lumen was then accessed with the Seldinger technique. Guide wire was introduced into the stomach lumen and series of dilators was then passed over the guide wire. #18 French Gastrostomy was then passed into the stomach lumen and the balloon was inflated. We confirmed that we were in the gastric lumen and the balloon was pulled up, creating apposition of the gastric wall and the anterior abdominal wall. The T-fasteners were all crimped and secured into position. As was in the plan, the gastrostomy was secured to the skin and into the tube. Sterile dressing was applied. Aspiration demonstrated gastric content. Gastrostomy tube study, with interpretation. Radiographic gastrostomy tube study with gastric contrast, with interpretation: A gastric contrast study was then performed. Approximately 25 mL Gastrografin was introduced into the gastric lumen. The abdominal films then demonstrated intragastric content with no extravasation. After final inspection, the trocars were removed, the trocar sites were irrigated and closed with 4-0 Vicryl sutures. Steri-strips and sterile dressings were applied. Needle, sponge and instrument counts correct. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal. COMPLICATIONS: None."
83,Gastroenterology," HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Briefly, this is a 17-year-old male, who has had problems with dysphagia to solids and recently had food impacted in the lower esophagus. He is now having upper endoscopy to evaluate the esophagus after edema and inflammation from the food impaction has resolved, to look for any stricture that may need to be dilated, or any other mucosal abnormality. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: EGD. PREP: Cetacaine spray, 100 mcg of fentanyl IV, and 5 mg of Versed IV. FINDINGS: The tip of the endoscope was introduced into the esophagus, and the entire length of the esophagus was dotted with numerous, white, punctate lesions, suggestive of eosinophilic esophagitis. There were come concentric rings present. There was no erosion or flame hemorrhage, but there was some friability in the distal esophagus. Biopsies throughout the entire length of the esophagus from 25-40 cm were obtained to look for eosinophilic esophagitis. There was no stricture or Barrett mucosa. The bony and the antrum of the stomach are normal without any acute peptic lesions. Retroflexion of the tip of the endoscope in the body of the stomach revealed a normal cardia. There were no acute lesions and no evidence of ulcer, tumor, or polyp. The pylorus was easily entered, and the first, second, and third portions of the duodenum are normal. Adverse reactions: None. FINAL IMPRESSION: Esophageal changes suggestive of eosinophilic esophagitis. Biopsies throughout the length of the esophagus were obtained for microscopic analysis. There was no evidence of stricture, Barrett, or other abnormalities in the upper GI tract."
84,Gastroenterology," PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Colonoscopy and biopsy. INDICATIONS: The patient is a 50-year-old female who has had a history of a nonspecific colitis, who was admitted 3 months ago at Hospital because of severe right-sided abdominal pains, was found to have multiple ulcers within the right colon, and was then readmitted approximately 2 weeks later because of a cecal volvulus, and had a right hemicolectomy. Since then, she has had persistent right abdominal pains, as well as diarrhea, with up to 2-4 bowel movements per day. She has had problems with recurrent seizures and has been seen by Dr. XYZ, who started her recently on methadone. MEDICATIONS: Fentanyl 200 mcg, Versed 10 mg, Phenergan 25 mg intravenously given throughout the procedure. INSTRUMENT: PCF-160L. PROCEDURE REPORT: Informed consent was obtained from the patient, after the risks and benefits of the procedure were carefully explained, which included but were not limited to bleeding, infection, perforation, and allergic reaction to the medications, as well as the possibility of missing polyps within the colon. A colonoscope was then passed through the rectum, all the way toward the ileal colonic anastomosis, seen within the proximal transverse colon. The distal ileum was examined, which was normal in appearance. Random biopsies were obtained from the ileum and placed in jar #1. Random biopsies were obtained from the normal-appearing colon and placed in jar #2. Small internal hemorrhoids were noted within the rectum on retroflexion. COMPLICATIONS: None. ASSESSMENT: 1. Small internal hemorrhoids. 2. Ileal colonic anastomosis seen in the proximal transverse colon. 3. Otherwise normal colonoscopy and ileum examination. PLAN: Followup results of biopsies. If the biopsies are unremarkable, the patient may benefit from a trial of tricyclic antidepressants, if it's okay with Dr. XYZ, for treatment of her chronic abdominal pains."
85,Gastroenterology," EXAM: CT examination of the abdomen and pelvis with intravenous contrast. INDICATIONS: Abdominal pain. TECHNIQUE: CT examination of the abdomen and pelvis was performed after 100 mL of intravenous Isovue-300 contrast administration. Oral contrast was not administered. There was no comparison of studies. FINDINGS CT PELVIS: Within the pelvis, the uterus demonstrates a thickened-appearing endometrium. There is also a 4.4 x 2.5 x 3.4 cm hypodense mass in the cervix and lower uterine segment of uncertain etiology. There is also a 2.5 cm intramural hypodense mass involving the dorsal uterine fundus likely representing a fibroid. Several smaller fibroids were also suspected. The ovaries are unremarkable in appearance. There is no free pelvic fluid or adenopathy. CT ABDOMEN: The appendix has normal appearance in the right lower quadrant. There are few scattered diverticula in the sigmoid colon without evidence of diverticulitis. The small and large bowels are otherwise unremarkable. The stomach is grossly unremarkable. There is no abdominal or retroperitoneal adenopathy. There are no adrenal masses. The kidneys, liver, gallbladder, and pancreas are in unremarkable appearance. The spleen contains several small calcified granulomas, but no evidence of masses. It is normal in size. The lung bases are clear bilaterally. The osseous structures are unremarkable other than mild facet degenerative changes at L4-L5 and L5-S1. IMPRESSION: 1. Hypoattenuating mass in the lower uterine segment and cervix of uncertain etiology measuring approximately 4.4 x 2.5 x 3.4 cm. 2. Multiple uterine fibroids. 3. Prominent endometrium. 4. Followup pelvic ultrasound is recommended."
86,Gastroenterology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES 1. Adrenal mass, right sided. 2. Umbilical hernia. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES 1. Adrenal mass, right sided. 2. Umbilical hernia. OPERATION PERFORMED: Laparoscopic hand-assisted left adrenalectomy and umbilical hernia repair. ANESTHESIA: General. CLINICAL NOTE: This is a 52-year-old inmate with a 5.5 cm diameter nonfunctioning mass in his right adrenal. Procedure was explained including risks of infection, bleeding, possibility of transfusion, possibility of further treatments being required. Alternative of fully laparoscopic are open surgery or watching the lesion. DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: In the right flank-up position, table was flexed. He had a Foley catheter in place. Incision was made from just above the umbilicus, about 5.5 cm in diameter. The umbilical hernia was taken down. An 11 mm trocar was placed in the midline, superior to the GelPort and a 5 mm trocar placed in the midaxillary line below the costal margin. A liver retractor was placed to this. The colon was reflected medially by incising the white line of Toldt. The liver attachments to the adrenal kidney were divided and the liver was reflected superiorly. The vena cava was identified. The main renal vein was identified. Coming superior to the main renal vein, staying right on the vena cava, all small vessels were clipped and then divided. Coming along the superior pole of the kidney, the tumor was dissected free from top of the kidney with clips and Bovie. The harmonic scalpel was utilized superiorly and laterally. Posterior attachments were divided between clips and once the whole adrenal was mobilized, the adrenal vein and one large adrenal artery were noted, doubly clipped, and divided. Specimen was placed in a collection bag, removed intact. Hemostasis was excellent. The umbilical hernia had been completely taken down. The edges were freshened up. Vicryl #1 was utilized to close the incision and 2-0 Vicryl was used to close the fascia of the trocar. Skin closed with clips. He tolerated the procedure well. All sponge and instrument counts were correct. Estimated blood loss less than 100 mL. The patient was awakened, extubated, and returned to recovery room in satisfactory condition."

We will send his stool for C. diff toxin, culture, blood for RAST test for cow milk, soy, wheat and egg. Monitor hemoglobin."
88,Gastroenterology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Acute appendicitis. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Acute appendicitis, gangrenous. PROCEDURE: Appendectomy. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was taken to the operating room under urgent conditions. After having obtained an informed consent, he was placed in the operating room and under anesthesia. Followed by a time-out process, his abdominal wall was prepped and draped in the usual fashion. Antibiotics had been given prior to incision. A McBurney incision was performed and it carried out through the peritoneal cavity. Immediately there was purulent material seen in the area. Samples were taken for culture and sensitivity of aerobic and anaerobic sets. The appendix was markedly swollen particularly in its distal three-fourth, where the distal appendix showed an abscess formation and devitalization of the wall. There was quite a bit of local peritonitis. The mesoappendix was clamped, divided and ligated, and then the appendix was ligated and divided, and the stump buried with a pursestring suture of Vicryl and then a Z stitch. The area was abundantly irrigated with normal saline and also the pelvis. The distal foot of small bowel had been explored and because it delivered itself __________ the incision and showed no pathology. Then the peritoneal and internal fascia were approximated with a suture of 0 Vicryl and then the incision was closed in layers and after each layer the wound was irrigated with normal saline. The skin was closed with a combination of a subcuticular suture of fine Monocryl followed by the application of Dermabond. The patient tolerated the procedure well. Estimated blood loss was minimal, and the patient was sent to the recovery room for recovery in satisfactory condition."
89,Gastroenterology, INDICATIONS: Dysphagia. PREMEDICATION: Topical Cetacaine spray and Versed IV. PROCEDURE:: The scope was passed into the esophagus under direct vision. The esophageal mucosa was all unremarkable. There was no evidence of any narrowing present anywhere throughout the esophagus and no evidence of esophagitis. The scope was passed on down into the stomach. The gastric mucosa was all examined including a retroflexed view of the fundus and there were no abnormalities seen. The scope was then passed into the duodenum and the duodenal bulb and second and third portions of the duodenum were unremarkable. The scope was again slowly withdrawn through the esophagus and no evidence of narrowing was present. The scope was then withdrawn. IMPRESSION: Normal upper GI endoscopy without any evidence of anatomical narrowing.
90,Gastroenterology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Chronic cholecystitis. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Chronic cholecystitis. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy. BLOOD LOSS: Minimal. ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal anesthesia. COMPLICATIONS: None. CONDITION: Stable. DRAINS: None. DISPOSITION: To recovery room and to home. FLUIDS: Crystalloid. FINDINGS: Consistent with chronic cholecystitis. Final pathology is pending. INDICATIONS FOR THE PROCEDURE: Briefly, the patient is a 38-year-old male referred with increasingly severe more frequent right upper quadrant abdominal pain, more after meals, had a positive ultrasound for significant biliary sludge. He presented now after informed consent for the above procedure. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was identified in the preanesthesia area, then taken to the operating room, placed in the supine position on the operating table, and induced under general endotracheal anesthesia. The patient was correctly positioned, padded at all pressure points, had antiembolic TED hose and Flowtrons in the lower extremities. The anterior abdomen was then prepared and draped in a sterile fashion. Preemptive local anesthetic was infiltrated with 1% lidocaine and 0.5% ropivacaine. The initial incision was made sharply at the umbilicus with a #15-scalpel blade and carried down through deeper tissues with Bovie cautery, down to the midline fascia with a #15 scalpel blade. The blunt-tipped Hasson introducer cannula was placed into the abdominal cavity under direct vision where it was insufflated using carbon dioxide gas to a pressure of 15 mmHg. The epigastric and right subcostal trocars were placed under direct vision. The right upper quadrant was well visualized. The gallbladder was noted to be significantly distended with surrounding dense adhesions. The fundus of the gallbladder was grasped and retracted anteriorly and superiorly, and the surrounding adhesions were then taken down off the gallbladder using a combination of the bullet-nose Bovie dissector and the blunt Kittner peanut dissector. Further dissection allowed identification of the infundibulum and cystic duct junction where the cystic duct was identified and dissected out further using a right-angle clamp. The cystic duct was clipped x3 and then divided. The cystic artery was dissected out in like fashion, clipped x3, and then divided. The gallbladder was then taken off the liver bed in a retrograde fashion using the hook-tip Bovie cautery with good hemostasis. Prior to removal of the gallbladder, all irrigation fluid was clear. No active bleeding or oozing was seen. All clips were noted to be secured and intact and in place. The gallbladder was placed in a specimen pouch after placing the camera in the epigastric port. The gallbladder was retrieved through the umbilical fascial defect and submitted to Pathology. The camera was placed back once again into the abdominal cavity through the umbilical port, and all areas remained clean and dry and the trocar was removed under direct visualization. The insufflation was allowed to escape. The umbilical fascia was closed using interrupted #1 Vicryl sutures. Finally, the skin was closed in a layered subcuticular fashion with interrupted 3-0 and 4-0 Monocryl. Sterile dressings were applied. The patient tolerated the procedure well."
91,Gastroenterology," INDICATIONS: This is a 55-year-old female who is having a colonoscopy to screen for colon cancer. There is no family history of colon cancer and there has been no blood in the stool. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Colonoscopy. PREP: Fentanyl 100 mcg IV and 3 mg Versed IV. PROCEDURE: The tip of the endoscope was introduced into the rectum. Retroflexion of the tip of the endoscope failed to reveal any distal rectal lesions. The rest of the colon through to the cecum was well visualized. The cecal strap, ileocecal valve, and light reflex in the right lower quadrant were all identified. There was no evidence of tumor, polyp, mass, ulceration, or other focus of inflammation. Adverse reactions none. IMPRESSION: Normal colonic mucosa through to the cecum. There was no evidence of tumor or polyp."
92,Gastroenterology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Melena. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Solitary erosion over a fold at the GE junction, gastric side. PREMEDICATIONS: Versed 5 mg IV. REPORTED PROCEDURE: The Olympus gastroscope was used. The scope was placed in the upper esophagus under direct visit. The esophageal mucosa was entirely normal. There was no evidence of erosions or ulceration. There was no evidence of varices. The body and antrum of the stomach were normal. They pylorus duodenum bulb and descending duodenum are normal. There was no blood present within the stomach. The scope was then brought back into the stomach and retroflexed in order to inspect the upper portion of the body of the stomach. When this was done, a prominent fold was seen lying along side the GE junction along with gastric side and there was a solitary erosion over this fold. The lesion was not bleeding. If this fold were in any other location of the stomach, I would consider the fold, but at this location, one would have to consider that this would be an isolated gastric varix. As such, the erosion may be more significant. There was no bleeding. Obviously, no manipulation of the lesion was undertaken. The scope was then straightened, withdrawn, and the procedure terminated. ENDOSCOPIC IMPRESSION: 1. Solitary erosion overlying a prominent fold at the gastroesophageal junction, gastric side � may simply be an erosion or may be an erosion over a varix. 2. Otherwise unremarkable endoscopy - no evidence of a bleeding lesion of the stomach. PLAN: 1. Liver profile today. 2. Being Nexium 40 mg a day. 3. Scheduled colonoscopy for next week."
93,Gastroenterology," PROCEDURE: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy. DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: 1. Acute cholecystitis. 2. Status post laparoscopic cholecystectomy. 3. End-stage renal disease on hemodialysis. 4. Hyperlipidemia. 5. Hypertension. 6. Congestive heart failure. 7. Skin lymphoma 5 years ago. 8. Hypothyroidism. HOSPITAL COURSE: This is a 78-year-old female with past medical condition includes hypertension, end-stage renal disease, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, and skin lymphoma who had a left AV fistula done about 3 days ago by Dr. X and the patient went later on home, but started having epigastric pain and right upper quadrant pain and mid abdominal pain, some nauseated feeling, and then she could not handle the pain, so came to the emergency room, brought by the family. The patient's initial assessment, the patient's vital signs were stable, showed temperature 97.9, pulse was 106, and blood pressure was 156/85. EKG was not available and ultrasound of the abdomen showed there is a renal cyst about 2 cm. There is sludge in the gallbladder wall versus a stone in the gallbladder wall. Thickening of the gallbladder wall with positive Murphy sign. She has a history of cholecystitis. Urine shows positive glucose, but negative for nitrite and creatinine was 7.1, sodium 131, potassium was 5.2, and lipase and amylase were normal. So, the patient admitted to the Med/Surg floor initially and the patient was started on IV fluid as well as low-dose IV antibiotic and 2-D echocardiogram and EKG also was ordered. The patient also had history of CHF in the past and recently had some workup done. The patient does not remember initially. Surgical consult also requested and blood culture and urine culture also ordered. The same day, the patient was seen by Dr. Y and the patient should need cholecystectomy, but the patient also needs dialysis and also needs to be cleared by the cardiologist, so the patient later on seen by Dr. Z and cleared the patient for the surgery with moderate risk and the patient underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The patient also seen by nephrologist and underwent dialysis. The patient's white count went down 6.1, afebrile. On postop day #1, the patient started eating and also walking. The patient also had chronic bronchitis. The patient was later on feeling fine, discussed with surgery. The patient was then able to discharge to home and follow with the surgeon in about 3-5 days. Discharged home with Synthroid 0.5 mg 1 tablet p.o. daily, Plavix 75 mg p.o. daily, folic acid 1 mg p.o. daily, Diovan 80 mg p.o. daily, Renagel 2 tablets 800 mg p.o. twice a day, Lasix 40 mg p.o. 2 tablets twice a day, lovastatin 20 mg p.o. daily, Coreg 3.125 mg p.o. twice a day, nebulizer therapy every 3 hours as needed, also Phenergan 25 mg p.o. q.8 hours for nausea and vomiting, Pepcid 20 mg p.o. daily, Vicodin 1 tablet p.o. q.6 hours p.r.n. as needed, and Levaquin 250 mg p.o. every other day for the next 5 days. The patient also had Premarin that she was taking, advised to discontinue because of increased risk of heart disease and stroke explained to the patient. Discharged home."

95,Gastroenterology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Morbid obesity. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Morbid obesity. PROCEDURE: Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, antecolic, antegastric with 25-mm EEA anastamosis, esophagogastroduodenoscopy. ANESTHESIA: General with endotracheal intubation. INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: This is a 50-year-old male who has been overweight for many years and has tried multiple different weight loss diets and programs. The patient has now begun to have comorbidities related to the obesity. The patient has attended our bariatric seminar and met with our dietician and psychologist. The patient has read through our comprehensive handout and understands the risks and benefits of bypass surgery as evidenced by the signing of our consent form. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The risks and benefits were explained to the patient. Consent was obtained. The patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating room table. General anesthesia was administered with endotracheal intubation. A Foley catheter was placed for bladder decompression. All pressure points were carefully padded, and sequential compression devices were placed on the legs. The abdomen was prepped and draped in standard, sterile, surgical fashion. Marcaine was injected into the umbilicus. A small incision was made, and a Veress needle was introduced into the abdomen. CO2 insufflation was done to a maximum pressure of 15 mmHg. Then a 12-mm VersaStep port was placed in the umbilicus. Laparoscopic examination showed no injuries from entry. I then placed a 5-mm port in the left side just subcostal and just anterior to the mid-axillary line. A few centimeters below and medial to that, I placed a 15-mm port. On the right side just subcostal and anterior to the mid-axillary line, I placed another 5-mm port. Another 5-mm port was placed just to the right of the midline and just subxiphoid, and a few centimeters below that, a 12-mm VersaStep port was placed. We began by identifying the colon and lifting the transverse colon up and thereby identifying the ligament of Treitz. I ran the small bowel down approximately 40 cm. I divided the small bowel with a white load GIA stapler. I then divided across the mesentery utilizing a LigaSure device all the way down to its base. I then ran the distal bowel down 100 cm, and at 100 cm I made a hole in the Roux limb and a hole in the duodenogastric limb. I placed a 45 white load stapler into the abdomen and put 1 side of the white load stapler in the duodenogastric limb and 1 side in the Roux limb. I fired the stapler, thereby creating a side-to-side anastomosis. I reapproximated the defect with interrupted Surgidac sutures and then stapled across it with a white load GIA stapler. I then did a Brolin anti-obstruction stitch with an interrupted Surgidac suture. I then closed the mesenteric defect with interrupted Surgidac sutures. I then divided the omentum all the way down to the transverse colon in order to create a pathway to place the Roux limb antecolic, antegastric. I then placed the patient in reverse Trendelenburg position and placed a liver retractor. I first identified the angle of His and made sure that it was clearly visible. I then had Anesthesia drop a balloon into the stomach and blow it up to 30 cc. Below that, I then cleared the mesentery at the lesser curve and got behind the stomach into the lesser space. I then fired a blue load stapler transversely across the stomach, after checking with Anesthesia that everything had been removed from the stomach. I then made a hole into the stomach at the mid portion of the superior staple line. I then made an incision on the greater curve and made a gastrotomy. I then brought a 25 EEA anvil with a stitch attached to it into the abdominal cavity. I placed an angulating grasper into the gastrotomy above my staple line and had it come out through the gastrotomy at the greater curve. I grabbed the anvil and pulled it through the greater curve gastrotomy and had the stem come out through the superior staple line so that the stem was now coming out through the base of my soon-to-be gastric pouch. I then completed my pouch by firing 60 blue loads with SeamGuard cephalad up and through the angle of His. After creating the pouch, I then closed the gastrotomy on the greater curve by firing across it with blue load stapler. Once this had been done, I brought up the Roux limb. I cut a hole in the antimesenteric portion of the Roux limb and passed a 25 EEA stapler into the abdomen through the 15-mm port site and had it go in through the enterotomy. I had a spike come out on the antimesenteric portion of the small bowel. I removed the spike and joined the stapler with the anvil and fired the stapler, thereby creating the anastomosis, and then removed the EEA stapler. I divided the end of the redundant portion of the Roux limb that had the enterotomy utilizing a white load stapler and removed that through the 15-mm port site. I then had a pretty straight shot from the pouch into the small bowel. I put additional 3-0 Vicryl sutures in the corners in order to take off any tension and further secure the wound. I then put a bowel clamp on the bowel. I went above and performed an esophagogastroduodenoscopy. I placed a scope into the mouth and down through the esophagus with ease. I passed it into the stomach pouch. I distended up the pouch with air. There was no air leak seen laparoscopically. I was able to pass the scope easily across the anastomosis. No bleeding was seen. I then withdrew the scope and scrubbed back into the case. I closed the 15-mm port site with interrupted 0 Vicryl suture utilizing Carter-Thomason. I then put a 10-flat Jackson-Pratt through the left upper quadrant incision and sutured that in place using nylon. I then closed the skin of all incisions with a running Monocryl. Prior to closing, I irrigated the 15-mm port site with dilute Betadine. Sponge, instrument, and needle counts were correct at the end of the case. The patient tolerated the procedure well without any complications."
96,Gastroenterology," EXAM: Ultrasound abdomen, complete. HISTORY: 38-year-old male admitted from the emergency room 04/18/2009, decreased mental status and right upper lobe pneumonia. The patient has diffuse abdominal pain. There is a history of AIDS. TECHNIQUE: An ultrasound examination of the abdomen was performed. FINDINGS: The liver has normal echogenicity. The liver is normal sized. The gallbladder has a normal appearance without gallstones or sludge. There is no gallbladder wall thickening or pericholecystic fluid. The common bile duct has a normal caliber at 4.6 mm. The pancreas is mostly obscured by gas. A small portion of the head of pancreas is visualized which has a normal appearance. The aorta has a normal caliber. The aorta is smooth walled. No abnormalities are seen of the inferior vena cava. The right kidney measures 10.8 cm in length and the left kidney 10.5 cm. No masses, cysts, calculi, or hydronephrosis is seen. There is normal renal cortical echogenicity. The spleen is somewhat prominent with a maximum diameter of 11.2 cm. There is no ascites. The urinary bladder is distended with urine and shows normal wall thickness without masses. The prostate is normal sized with normal echogenicity. IMPRESSION: 1. Spleen size at the upper limits of normal. 2. Except for small portions of pancreatic head, the pancreas could not be visualized because of bowel gas. The visualized portion of the head had a normal appearance. 3. The gallbladder has a normal appearance without gallstones. There are no renal calculi."
97,Gastroenterology," Informed consent was obtained from the patient after the risks and benefits of the procedure were explained. The risks that were explained were bleeding, infection, perforation, and allergic reaction to the medications, as well as the possibility of missing small polyps within the colon. Conscious sedation was achieved with the patient lying in the left lateral decubitus position. A colonoscope was then passed through the rectum, all the way toward the cecum, which was identified by the presence of the appendiceal orifice and ileocecal valve. This was done without difficulty and the bowel preparation was good. The ileocecal valve was intubated and the distal 2 to 3 cm of terminal ileum was inspected and was normal. The colonoscope was then slowly withdrawn and a careful examination of the mucosa was performed. COMPLICATIONS: None."
98,Gastroenterology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Acute acalculous cholecystitis. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Acute acalculous cholecystitis. PROCEDURE: Placement of cholecystostomy tube under ultrasound guidance. ANESTHESIA: Xylocaine 1% With Epinephrine. INDICATIONS: Patient is a pleasant 75-year-old gentleman who is about one week status post an acute MI who also has acute cholecystitis. Because it is not safe to take him to the operating room for general anesthetic, I recommended he undergo the above-named procedure. Procedure, purpose, risks, expected benefits, potential complications, and alternative forms of therapy were discussed with him and he was agreeable to surgery. TECHNIQUE: Patient was identified, then taken to the Radiology suite, where the area of interest was identified using ultrasound and prepped with Betadine solution, draped in sterile fashion. After infiltration with 1% Xylocaine and after multiple attempts, the gallbladder was finally cannulated by Dr. Kindred using the Cook 18-French needle. The guidewire was then placed and via Seldinger technique, a 10-French pigtail catheter was placed within the gallbladder, secured using the Cook catheter method, and dressings were applied and patient was taken to recovery room in stable condition."
99,Gastroenterology," SUBJECTIVE: The patient is a 60-year-old female, who complained of coughing during meals. Her outpatient evaluation revealed a mild-to-moderate cognitive linguistic deficit, which was completed approximately 2 months ago. The patient had a history of hypertension and TIA/stroke. The patient denied history of heartburn and/or gastroesophageal reflux disorder. A modified barium swallow study was ordered to objectively evaluate the patient's swallowing function and safety and to rule out aspiration. OBJECTIVE: Modified barium swallow study was performed in the Radiology Suite in cooperation with Dr. ABC. The patient was seated upright in a video imaging chair throughout this assessment. To evaluate the patient's swallowing function and safety, she was administered graduated amounts of liquid and food mixed with barium in the form of thin liquid (teaspoon x2, cup sip x2); nectar-thick liquid (teaspoon x2, cup sip x2); puree consistency (teaspoon x2); and solid food consistency (1/4 cracker x1). ASSESSMENT ORAL STAGE: Premature spillage to the level of the valleculae and pyriform sinuses with thin liquid. Decreased tongue base retraction, which contributed to vallecular pooling after the swallow. PHARYNGEAL STAGE: No aspiration was observed during this evaluation. Penetration was noted with cup sips of thin liquid only. Trace residual on the valleculae and on tongue base with nectar-thick puree and solid consistencies. The patient's hyolaryngeal elevation and anterior movement are within functional limits. Epiglottic inversion is within functional limits. CERVICAL ESOPHAGEAL STAGE: The patient's upper esophageal sphincter opening is well coordinated with swallow and readily accepted the bolus. Radiologist noted reduced peristaltic action of the constricted muscles in the esophagus, which may be contributing to the patient's complaint of globus sensation. DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION: No aspiration was noted during this evaluation. Penetration with cup sips of thin liquid. The patient did cough during this evaluation, but that was noted related to aspiration or penetration. PROGNOSTIC IMPRESSION: Based on this evaluation, the prognosis for swallowing and safety is good. PLAN: Based on this evaluation and following recommendations are being made: 1. The patient to take small bite and small sips to help decrease the risk of aspiration and penetration. 2. The patient should remain upright at a 90-degree angle for at least 45 minutes after meals to decrease the risk of aspiration and penetration as well as to reduce her globus sensation. 3. The patient should be referred to a gastroenterologist for further evaluation of her esophageal function. The patient does not need any skilled speech therapy for her swallowing abilities at this time, and she is discharged from my services."
100,Gastroenterology," PROCEDURE: Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with brush cytology and biopsy. INDICATION FOR THE PROCEDURE: Patient with a history of chronic abdominal pain and CT showing evidence of chronic pancreatitis, with a recent upper endoscopy showing an abnormal-appearing ampulla. MEDICATIONS: General anesthesia. The risks of the procedure were made aware to the patient and consisted of medication reaction, bleeding, perforation, aspiration, and post ERCP pancreatitis. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: After informed consent and appropriate sedation, the duodenoscope was inserted into the oropharynx, down the esophagus, and into the stomach. The scope was then advanced through the pylorus to the ampulla. The ampulla had a markedly abnormal appearance, as it was enlarged and very prominent. It extended outward with an almost polypoid shape. It had what appeared to be adenomatous-appearing mucosa on the tip. There also was ulceration noted on the tip of this ampulla. The biliary and pancreatic orifices were identified. This was located not at the tip of the ampulla, but rather more towards the base. Cannulation was performed with a Wilson-Cooke TriTome sphincterotome with easy cannulation of the biliary tree. The common bile duct was mildly dilated, measuring approximately 12 mm. The intrahepatic ducts were minimally dilated. There were no filling defects identified. There was felt to be a possible stricture within the distal common bile duct, but this likely represented an anatomic variant given the abnormal shape of the ampulla. The patient has no evidence of obstruction based on lab work and clinically. Nevertheless, it was decided to proceed with brush cytology of this segment. This was done without any complications. There was adequate drainage of the biliary tree noted throughout the procedure. Multiple efforts were made to access the pancreatic ductal anatomy; however, because of the shape of the ampulla, this was unsuccessful. Efforts were made to proceed in a long scope position, but still were unsuccessful. Next, biopsies were obtained of the ampulla away from the biliary orifice. Four biopsies were taken. There was some minor oozing which had ceased by the end of the procedure. The stomach was then decompressed and the endoscope was withdrawn. FINDINGS: 1. Abnormal papilla with bulging, polypoid appearance, and looks adenomatous with ulceration on the tip; biopsies taken. 2. Cholangiogram reveals mildly dilated common bile duct measuring 12 mm and possible distal CBD stricture, although I think this is likely an anatomic variant; brush cytology obtained. 3. Unable to access the pancreatic duct. RECOMMENDATIONS: 1. NPO except ice chips today. 2. Will proceed with MRCP to better delineate pancreatic ductal anatomy. 3. Follow up biopsies and cytology."
101,Gastroenterology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Appendicitis. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Appendicitis, nonperforated. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Appendectomy. ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal. PROCEDURE: After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the operative suite and placed supine on the operating table. General endotracheal anesthesia was induced without incident. The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner. A transverse right lower quadrant incision was made directly over the point of maximal tenderness. Sharp dissection utilizing Bovie electrocautery was used to expose the external oblique fascia. The fascia of the external oblique was incised in the direction of the fibers, and the muscle was spread with a clamp. The internal oblique fascia was similarly incised and its muscular fibers were similarly spread. The transversus abdominis muscle, transversalis fascia and peritoneum were incised sharply gaining entrance into the abdominal cavity without incident. Upon entering the peritoneal cavity, the peritoneal fluid was noted to be clean. The cecum was then grasped along the taenia with a moist gauze sponge and was gently mobilized into the wound. After the appendix was fully visualized, the mesentery was divided between Kelly clamps and ligated with 2-0 Vicryl ties. The base of the appendix was crushed with a clamp and then the clamp was reapplied proximally on the appendix. The base was ligated with 2-0 Vicryl tie over the crushed area, and the appendix amputated along the clamp. The stump of the appendix was cauterized and the cecum was returned to the abdomen. The peritoneum was irrigated with warm sterile saline. The mesoappendix and cecum were examined for hemostasis which was present. The wound was closed in layers using 2-0 Vicryl for the peritoneum and 0 Vicryl for the internal oblique and external oblique layers. The skin incision was approximated with 4-0 Monocryl in a subcuticular fashion. The skin was prepped with benzoin, and Steri-Strips were applied. A dressing was placed on the wound. All surgical counts were reported as correct. Having tolerated the procedure well, the patient was subsequently extubated and taken to the recovery room in good and stable condition."
102,Gastroenterology," MEDICATIONS: 1. Versed intravenously. 2. Demerol intravenously. DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: After informed consent was obtained, the patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position and sedated with the above medications. The Olympus video colonoscope was inserted through the anus and was advanced in retrograde fashion through the sigmoid colon, descending colon, around the splenic flexure, into the transverse colon, around the hepatic flexure, down the ascending colon, into the cecum. The cecum was identified by the presence of the appendiceal orifice and the ileocecal valve. The colonoscope was then advanced through the ileocecal valve into the terminal ileum, which was normal on examination. The scope was then pulled back into the cecum and then slowly withdrawn. The mucosa was examined in detail. The mucosa was entirely normal. Upon reaching the rectum, retroflex examination of the rectum was normal. The scope was then straightened out, the air removed and the scope withdrawn. The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no apparent complications."
103,Gastroenterology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Bleeding after transanal excision five days ago. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Bleeding after transanal excision five days ago. PROCEDURE: Exam under anesthesia with control of bleeding via cautery. ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal. INDICATION: The patient is a 42-year-old gentleman who is five days out from transanal excision of a benign anterior base lesion. He presents today with diarrhea and bleeding. Digital exam reveals bright red blood on the finger. He is for exam under anesthesia and control of hemorrhage at this time. FINDINGS: There was an ulcer where most of the polypoid lesion had been excised before. In a near total fashion the wound had opened and again there was a raw ulcer surface in between the edges of the mucosa. There were a few discrete sites of mild oozing, which were treated with cautery and #1 suture. No other obvious bleeding was seen. TECHNIQUE: The patient was taken to the operating room and placed on the operative table in supine position. After adequate general anesthesia was induced, the patient was then placed in modified prone position. His buttocks were taped, prepped and draped in a sterile fashion. The anterior rectal wall was exposed using a Parks anal retractor. The entire wound was visualized with a few rotations of the retractor and a few sites along the edges were seen to be oozing and were touched up with cautery. There was one spot in the corner that was oozing and this may have been from simply opening the retractor enough to see well. This was controlled with a 3-0 Monocryl figure-of-eight suture. At the completion, there was no bleeding, no oozing, it was completely dry, and we removed our retractor, and the patient was then turned and extubated and taken to the recovery room in stable condition."
104,Gastroenterology," INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: A 79-year-old Filipino woman referred for colonoscopy secondary to heme-positive stools. Procedure done to rule out generalized diverticular change, colitis, and neoplasia. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was explained the procedure in detail, possible complications including infection, perforation, adverse reaction of medication, and bleeding. Informed consent was signed by the patient. With the patient in left decubitus position, had received a cumulative dose of 4 mg of Versed and 75 mg of Demerol, using Olympus video colonoscope under direct visualization was advanced to the cecum. Photodocumentation of appendiceal orifice and the ileocecal valve obtained. Cecum was slightly obscured with stool but the colon itself was adequately prepped.

107,Gastroenterology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Chronic cholecystitis. 2. Cholelithiasis. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Chronic cholecystitis. 2. Cholelithiasis. 3. Liver cyst. PROCEDURES PERFORMED: 1. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy. 2. Excision of liver cyst. ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal and injectable 0.25% Marcaine with 1% lidocaine. SPECIMENS: Include 1. Gallbladder. 2. Liver cyst. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal. COMPLICATIONS: None. OPERATIVE FINDINGS: Exploration of the abdomen revealed multiple adhesions of omentum overlying the posterior aspect of the gallbladder. Additionally, there was a notable liver cyst. The remainder of the abdomen remained free of any adhesions. BRIEF HISTORY: This is a 66-year-old Caucasian female who presented to ABCD General Hospital for an elective cholecystectomy. The patient complained of intractable nausea, vomiting, and abdominal bloating after eating fatty foods. She had had multiple attacks in the past of these complaints. She was discovered to have had right upper quadrant pain on examination. Additionally, she had an ultrasound performed on 08/04/2003, which revealed cholelithiasis. The patient was recommended to undergo laparoscopic cholecystectomy for her recurrent symptoms. She was explained the risks, benefits, and complications of the procedure and she gave informed consent to proceed. OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the operative suite and placed in the supine position. The patient received preoperative antibiotics with Kefzol. The abdomen was prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion with Betadine solution. The patient did undergo general endotracheal anesthesia. Once the adequate sedation was achieved, a supraumbilical transverse incision was created with a #10 blade scalpel. Utilizing a Veress needle, the Veress needle was inserted intra-abdominally and was hooked to the CO2 insufflation. The abdomen was insufflated to 15 mmHg. After adequate insufflation was achieved, the laparoscopic camera was inserted into the abdomen and to visualize a distended gallbladder as well as omental adhesion adjacent to the gallbladder. Decision to proceed with laparoscopic cystectomy was decided. A subxiphoid transverse incision was created with a #10 blade scalpel and utilizing a bladed 12 mm trocar, the trocar was inserted under direct visualization into the abdomen. Two 5 mm ports were placed, one at the midclavicular line 2 cm below the costal margin and a second at the axillary line, one hand length approximately below the costal margin. All ports were inserted with bladed 5 mm trocar then under direct visualization. After all trocars were inserted, the gallbladder was grasped at the fundus and retracted superiorly and towards the left shoulder. Adhesions adjacent were taken down with a Maryland dissector. Once this was performed, the infundibulum of the gallbladder was grasped and retracted laterally and anteriorly. This helped to better delineate the cystic duct as well as the cystic artery. Utilizing Maryland dissector, careful dissection of the cystic duct and cystic artery were created posteriorly behind each one. Utilizing Endoclips, clips were placed on the cystic duct and cystic artery, one proximal to the gallbladder and two distally. Utilizing endoscissors, the cystic duct and cystic artery were ligated. Next, utilizing electrocautery, the gallbladder was carefully dissected off the liver bed. Electrocautery was used to stop any bleeding encountered along the way. The gallbladder was punctured during dissection and cleared, biliary contents did drained into the abdomen. No evidence of stones were visualized. Once the gallbladder was completely excised from the liver bed, an EndoCatch was placed and the gallbladder was inserted into EndoCatch and removed from the subxiphoid port. This was sent off as an specimen, a gallstone was identified within the gallbladder. Next, utilizing copious amounts of irrigation, the abdomen was irrigated. A small liver cyst that have been identified upon initial aspiration was grasped with a grasper and utilizing electrocautery was completely excised off the left lobe of the liver. This was also taken and sent off as specimen. The abdomen was then copiously irrigated until clear irrigation was identified. All laparoscopic ports were removed under direct visualization. The abdomen was de-insufflated. Utilizing #0 Vicryl suture, the abdominal fascia was approximated with a figure-of-eight suture in the supraumbilical and subxiphoid region. All incisions were then closed with #4-0 undyed Vicryl. Two midline incisions were closed with a running subcuticular stitch and the lateral ports were closed with interrupted sutures. The areas were cleaned and dried. Steri-Strips were placed. On the incisions, sterile dressing was applied. The patient tolerated the procedure well. She was extubated following procedure. She is seen to tolerate the procedure well and she will follow up with Dr. X within one week for a follow-up evaluation."
108,Gastroenterology," PROCEDURE: Esophagogastroduodenoscopy with biopsy. REASON FOR PROCEDURE: The child with history of irritability and diarrhea with gastroesophageal reflux. Rule out reflux esophagitis, allergic enteritis, and ulcer disease, as well as celiac disease. He has been on Prevacid 7.5 mg p.o. b.i.d. with suboptimal control of this irritability. Consent history and physical examinations were performed. The procedure, indications, alternatives available, and complications i.e. bleeding, perforation, infection, adverse medication reactions, possible need for blood transfusion, and surgery associated complication occur were discussed with the mother who understood and indicated this. Opportunity for questions was provided and informed consent was obtained. MEDICATIONS: General anesthesia. INSTRUMENT: Olympus GIF-XQ 160. COMPLICATIONS: None. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Less than 5 mL. FINDINGS: With the patient in the supine position intubated under general anesthesia, the endoscope was inserted without difficulty into the hypopharynx. The proximal, mid, and distal esophagus had normal mucosal coloration and vascular pattern. Lower esophageal sphincter appeared normal and was located at 25 cm from the central incisors. A Z-line was identified within the lower esophageal sphincter. The endoscope was advanced into the stomach, which was distended with excess air. The rugal folds flattened completely. The gastric mucosa was entirely normal. No hiatal hernia was seen and the pyloric valve appeared normal. The endoscope was advanced into first, second, and third portion of the duodenum, which had normal mucosal coloration and fold pattern. Ampule of Vater was identified and found to be normal. Biopsies were obtained x2 in the second portion of duodenum, antrum, and distal esophagus at 22 cm from the central incisors for histology. Additional two antral biopsies were obtained for CLO testing. Excess air was evacuated from the stomach. The scope was removed from the patient who tolerated the procedure well. The patient was taken to recovery room in satisfactory condition. IMPRESSION: Normal esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. PLAN: Histologic evaluation and CLO testing. Continue Prevacid 7.5 mg p.o. b.i.d. I will contact the parents next week with biopsy results and further management plans will be discussed at that time."
109,Gastroenterology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Colovesical fistula. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Colovesical fistula. 2. Intraperitoneal abscess. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: 1. Exploratory laparotomy. 2. Low anterior colon resection. 3. Flexible colonoscopy. 4. Transverse loop colostomy and JP placement. ANESTHESIA: General. HISTORY: This 74-year-old female who had a recent hip fracture and the patient was in rehab when she started having some stool coming out of the urethra. The patient had retrograde cystogram, which revealed colovesical fistula. Recommendation for a surgery was made. The patient was explained the risks and benefits as well as the two sons and the daughter. They understood that the patient can even die from this procedure. All the three procedures were explained, without a colostomy, with Hartmann's colostomy, and with a transverse loop colostomy, and out of the three procedures, the patient's requested to have the loop colostomy and stated that the Hartmann's colostomy leaving the anastomosis with the risk of leaking. PROCEDURE DETAILS: The patient was taken to the operating room, prepped and draped in the sterile fashion and was given general anesthetic. An incision was performed in the midline below the umbilicus to the pubis with a #10 blade Bard Parker. Electrocautery was used for hemostasis down to the fascia. The fascia was grasped with Ochsner's and then immediately the peritoneum was entered and the incision was carried cephalad and caudad with electrocautery. Once within the peritoneum, adhesiolysis was performed to separate the small bowel from the attachment of the anterior abdominal wall. At this point, immediately a small bowel was retracted cephalad. The patient was taken to a slightly Trendelenburg position and the descending colon was seen. The white line of Toldt was opened all the way down to the area of inflammation. At this point, meticulous dissection was carried to separate the small bowel from the attachment to the abscess. When the small bowel was completely freed of abscess, bulk of the bladder was seen anteriorly to the uterus. The abscess was cultured and sent it back to Bacteriology Department and immediately the opening into the bladder was visualized. At this point, the entire sigmoid colon was separated posteriorly as well as laterally and it was all the way down to sigmoid down to the rectum. At this point, decision to place a moist towel and retract old intestine superiorly as well as to place first self-retaining retractor in the abdominal cavity with a bladder blade was placed. Immediately, a GIA was fired right across the descending colon and sigmoid colon junction and then with peons within the mesentery were placed all the way down to the rectosigmoid junction where a TA-55 balloon Roticulator was fired. The specimen was cut with #10 blade Bard-Parker and sent it to Pathology. Immediately copious amount of irrigation was used and the staple line in the descending colon was brought with Allis. A pursestring device was fired. The staple line was cut. The dilators were used using #25 and #29, then _________ #29 EEA was placed and the suture was tied. At this point, attention was directed down to the rectal stump where dilators #25 and #29 were passed from the anus into the rectum and then the #29 Ethicon GIA was introduced. The spike came posteriorly through the staple line to avoid the inflammatory process anteriorly that was present in the area of the cul-de-sac as well as the uterine was present in this patient. Immediately, the EEA was connected with a mushroom. It was tied, fired, and a Doyen was placed above the anastomosis approximately four inches. Fluid was placed within the _________ and immediately a colonoscope was introduced from the patient's anus insufflating air. No air was seen evolving from the staple line. All fluid was removed and pictures of the staple line were taken. The scope was removed at this point. The case was passed to Dr. X for repair of the vesicle fistula. Dr. X did repair down the perforation of the bladder that was communicating with an abscess secondary to the perforated diverticulitis and the colon. After this was performed, copious amount of irrigation was used again. More lysis of adhesions were performed and decision to make a loop transverse colostomy was made to protect the anastomosis in a phase of a severe inflammatory process in the pelvis in the infected area. The incision was performed in the right upper quadrant. This incision was performed with cutting in the cautery, down into the fascia splitting the muscle and then the Penrose was passed under transverse colon, and was grasped on pulling the transverse colon at the level of the skin. The wire was passed under the transverse colon. It was left in place. Moderate irrigation was used in the peritoneal cavity and in the right lower quadrant, a JP was placed in the pelvis posteriorly to the abscess cavity that was down on the pelvis. At this point, immediately, yellow fluid was removed from the peritoneal cavity and the abdomen was closed with cephalad to caudad and caudad to cephalad with a loop PDS suture and then tied. Electrocautery for hemostasis and the subcutaneous tissue. Copious amount of irrigation was used. The skin was approximated with staples. At this point, immediately, the wound was covered with a moist towel and decision to mature the loop colostomy was made. The colostomy was opened longitudinally and then matured with interrupted #3-0 Vicryl suture through the skin edge. One it was completely matured, immediately the index finger was probed proximally and distally and both loops were completely opened. As previously mentioned, the Penrose was removed and the Bard was secured with a #3-0 nylon suture. The JP was secured with #3-0 nylon suture as well. At this point, dressings were applied. The patient tolerated the procedure well. The stent from the left ureter was removed and the Foley was left in place. The patient did tolerate the procedure well and will be followed up during the hospitalization."

112,Gastroenterology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Prior history of neoplastic polyps. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Small rectal polyps/removed and fulgurated. PREMEDICATIONS: Prior to the colonoscopy, the patient complained of a sever headache and she was concerned that she might become ill. I asked the nurse to give her 25 mg of Demerol IV. Following the IV Demerol, she had a nausea reaction. She was then given 25 mg of Phenergan IV. Following this, her headache and nausea completely resolved. She was then given a total of 7.5 mg of Versed with adequate sedation. Rectal exam revealed no external lesions. Digital exam revealed no mass. REPORTED PROCEDURE: The P160 colonoscope was used. The scope was placed in the rectal ampulla and advanced to the cecum. Navigation through the sigmoid colon was difficult. Beginning at 30 cm was a very tight bend. With gentle maneuvering, the scope passed through and then entered the cecum. The cecum, ascending colon, hepatic flexure, transverse colon, splenic flexure, and descending colon were normal. The sigmoid colon was likewise normal. There were five very small (punctate) polyps in the rectum. One was resected using the electrocautery snare and the other four were ablated using the snare and cautery. There was no specimen because the polyps were so small. The scope was retroflexed in the rectum and no further abnormality was seen, so the scope was straightened, withdrawn, and the procedure terminated. ENDOSCOPIC IMPRESSION: 1. Five small polyps as described, all fulgurated. 2. Otherwise unremarkable colonoscopy."
113,Gastroenterology," PREPROCEDURE DIAGNOSIS: Colon cancer screening. POSTPROCEDURE DIAGNOSIS: Colon polyps, diverticulosis, hemorrhoids. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Colonoscopy, conscious sedation, and snare polypectomy. INDICATIONS: The patient is a 63-year-old male who has myelodysplastic syndrome, who was referred for colonoscopy. He has had previous colonoscopy. There is no family history of bleeding, no current problems with his bowels. On examination, he has internal hemorrhoids. His prostate is enlarged and increased somewhat in firmness. He has scattered diverticular disease of a moderate degree and he has two polyps, one 1 cm in the mid ascending colon, and one in the left transverse colon, which is also 1 cm. These were removed with snare polypectomy technique. I would recommend that the patient have an increased fiber diet and repeat colonoscopy in 5 years or sooner if he develops bowel habit change or bleeding. PROCEDURE: After explaining the operative procedure, the risks and potential complications of bleeding and perforation, the patient was given 175 mcg fentanyl, and 8 mg Versed intravenously for conscious sedation. Blood pressure 115/60, pulse 98, respiration 18, and saturation 92%. A rectal examination was done and then the colonoscope was inserted through the anorectum, rectosigmoid, descending, transverse, and ascending colon, to the ileocecal valve. The scope was withdrawn to the mid ascending colon, where the polyp was encircled with a snare and removed with a mixture of cutting and coagulating current, then retrieved through the suction port. The scope was withdrawn into the left transverse colon, where the second polyp was identified. It was encircled with a snare and removed with a mixture of cutting and coagulating current, and then removed through the suction port as well. The scope was then gradually withdrawn the remaining distance and removed. The patient tolerated the procedure well."

118,Gastroenterology," PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy with attempted intraoperative cholangiogram. PROCEDURE: After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the operating room and placed supine on the operating room table. General endotracheal anesthesia was induced without incident. The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner. A 2 cm infraumbilical midline incision was made. The fascia was then cleared of subcutaneous tissue using a tonsil clamp. A 1-2 cm incision was then made in the fascia, gaining entry into the abdominal cavity without incident. Two sutures of 0 Vicryl were then placed superiorly and inferiorly in the fascia, and then tied to the special 12 mm Hasson trocar fitted with a funnel-shaped adapter in order to occlude the fascial opening. Pneumoperitoneum was then established using carbon dioxide insufflation to a steady pressure of 16 mmHg. The remaining trocars were then placed into the abdomen under direct vision of the 30 degree laparoscope taking care to make the incisions along Langer's lines, spreading the subcutaneous tissues with a tonsil clamp, and confirming the entry site by depressing the abdominal wall prior to insertion of the trocar. A total of 3 other trocars were placed. The first was a 10/11 mm trocar in the upper midline position. The second was a 5 mm trocar placed in the anterior axillary line approximately 3 cm above the anterior superior iliac spine. The third was a 5 mm trocar placed to bisect the distance between the second and upper midline trocars. All of the trocars were placed without difficulty. The patient was then placed in reverse Trendelenburg position and was rotated slightly to the left. The gallbladder was then grasped through the second and third trocars and retracted cephalad toward the right shoulder. A laparoscopic dissector was then placed through the upper midline cannula, fitted with a reducer, and the structures within the triangle of Calot were meticulously dissected free. A laparoscopic clip applier was introduced through the upper midline cannula and used to doubly ligate the cystic duct close to the gallbladder. The gallbladder was then grasped through the upper midline cannula and a fine-tipped scissors introduced through the third cannula and used to make a small ductotomy in the cystic duct near the clips. Several attempts at passing the cholangiocatheter into the ductotomy were made. Despite numerous attempts at several angles, the cholangiocatheter could not be inserted into the cystic duct. After several such attempts, and due to the fact that the anatomy was clear, we aborted any further attempts at cholangiography. The distal cystic duct was doubly clipped. The duct was divided between the clips. The clips were carefully placed to avoid occluding the juncture with the common bile duct. The port sites were injected with 0.5% Marcaine. The cystic artery was found medially and slightly posteriorly to the cystic duct. It was carefully dissected free from its surrounding tissues. A laparoscopic clip applier was introduced through the upper midline cannula and used to doubly ligate the cystic artery proximally and distally. The artery was divided between the clips. The port sites were injected with 0.5% Marcaine. After the cystic duct and artery were transected, the gallbladder was dissected from the liver bed using Bovie electrocautery. Prior to complete dissection of the gallbladder from the liver, the peritoneal cavity was copiously irrigated with saline and the operative field was examined for persistent blood or bile leaks of which there were none. After the complete detachment of the gallbladder from the liver, the video laparoscope was removed and placed through the upper 10/11 mm cannula. The neck of the gallbladder was grasped with a large penetrating forceps placed through the umbilical 12 mm Hasson cannula. As the gallbladder was pulled through the umbilical fascial defect, the entire sheath and forceps were removed from the abdomen. The neck of the gallbladder was then secured with a Kocher clamp, and the gallbladder was removed from the abdomen. Following gallbladder removal, the remaining carbon dioxide was expelled from the abdomen. Both midline fascial defects were then approximated using 0 Vicryl suture. All skin incisions were approximated with 4-0 Vicryl in a subcuticular fashion. The skin was prepped with benzoin, and Steri-Strips were applied. Dressings were applied. All surgical counts were reported as correct. Having tolerated the procedure well, the patient was subsequently extubated and taken to the recovery room in good and stable condition."
119,Gastroenterology," REASON FOR EXAM: Right-sided abdominal pain with nausea and fever. TECHNIQUE: Axial CT images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained utilizing 100 mL of Isovue-300. CT ABDOMEN: The liver, spleen, pancreas, gallbladder, adrenal glands, and kidney are unremarkable. CT PELVIS: Within the right lower quadrant, the appendix measures 16 mm and there are adjacent inflammatory changes with fluid in the right lower quadrant. Findings are compatible with acute appendicitis. The large and small bowels are normal in course and caliber without obstruction. The urinary bladder is normal. The uterus appears unremarkable. Mild free fluid is seen in the lower pelvis. No destructive osseous lesions are seen. The visualized lung bases are clear. IMPRESSION: Acute appendicitis."
120,Gastroenterology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Cholelithiasis. 2. Acute cholecystitis. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Acute on chronic cholecystitis. 2. Cholelithiasis. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy with cholangiogram. ANESTHESIA: General. INDICATIONS: This is a 38-year-old diabetic Hispanic female patient, with ongoing recurrent episodes of right upper quadrant pain, associated with nausea. Ultrasound revealed cholelithiasis. The patient also had somewhat thickened gallbladder wall. The patient was admitted through emergency room last night with acute onset right upper quadrant pain. Clinically, it was felt the patient had acute cholecystitis. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy with cholangiogram was advised. Procedure, indication, risk, and alternative were discussed with the patient in detail preoperatively and informed consent was obtained. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was put in supine position on the operating table under satisfactory general anesthesia, and abdomen was prepped and draped. A small transverse incision was made just above the umbilicus under local anesthesia. Fascia was opened vertically. Stay sutures were placed in the fascia. Peritoneal cavity was carefully entered. Hasson cannula was inserted and peritoneal cavity was insufflated with CO2. Laparoscopic camera was inserted, and the patient was placed in reverse Trendelenburg, rotated to the left. A 11-mm trocar was placed in the subxiphoid space and two 5-mm in the right subcostal region. Examination at this time showed no free fluid, no acute inflammatory changes. Liver was grossly normal. Gallbladder was noted to be thickened. Gallbladder wall with a stone stuck in the neck of the gallbladder and pericholecystic edema, consistent with acute cholecystitis. The fundus of the gallbladder was retracted superiorly, and dissection was carried at the neck of the gallbladder where a cystic duct was identified and isolated. It was clipped distally and using C-arm fluoroscopy, intraoperative cystic duct cholangiogram was done, which was interpreted as normal. There was slight dilatation noted at the junction of the right and left hepatic duct, but no filling defects or any other pathology was noted. It was presumed that this was probably a congenital anomaly. The cystic duct was clipped twice proximally and divided beyond the clips. Cystic artery was identified, isolated, clipped twice proximally, once distally, and divided. The gallbladder was then removed from its bed using cautery dissection and subsequently delivered through the umbilical port. Specimen was sent for histopathology. Subhepatic and subdiaphragmatic spaces were irrigated with sterile saline solution. Hemostasis was good. Trocars were removed under direct vision and peritoneal cavity was evacuated with CO2. Umbilical area fascia was closed with 0-Vicryl figure-of-eight sutures, required extra sutures to close the fascial defect. Some difficulty was encountered closing the fascia initially because of the patient's significant amount of subcutaneous fat. In the end, the repair appears to be quite satisfactory. Rest of the incisions closed with 3-0 Vicryl for the subcutaneous tissues and staples for the skin. Sterile dressing was applied. The patient transferred to recovery room in stable condition."
121,Gastroenterology," REASON FOR EXAM: Lower quadrant pain with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. TECHNIQUE: Noncontrast axial CT images of the abdomen and pelvis are obtained. FINDINGS: Please note evaluation of the abdominal organs is secondary to the lack of intravenous contrast material. Gallstones are seen within the gallbladder lumen. No abnormal pericholecystic fluid is seen. The liver is normal in size and attenuation. The spleen is normal in size and attenuation. A 2.2 x 1.8 cm low attenuation cystic lesion appears to be originating off of the tail of the pancreas. No pancreatic ductal dilatation is seen. There is no abnormal adjacent stranding. No suspected pancreatitis is seen. The kidneys show no stone formation or hydronephrosis. The large and small bowels are normal in course and caliber. There is no evidence for obstruction. The appendix appears within normal limits. In the pelvis, the urinary bladder is unremarkable. There is a 4.2 cm cystic lesion of the right adnexal region. No free fluid, free air, or lymphadenopathy is detected. There is left basilar atelectasis. IMPRESSION: 1. A 2.2 cm low attenuation lesion is seen at the pancreatic tail. This is felt to be originating from the pancreas, a cystic pancreatic neoplasm must be considered and close interval followup versus biopsy is advised. Additionally, when the patient's creatinine improves, a contrast-enhanced study utilizing pancreatic protocol is needed. Alternatively, an MRI may be obtained. 2. Cholelithiasis. 3. Left basilar atelectasis. 4. A 4.2 cm cystic lesion of the right adnexa, correlation with pelvic ultrasound is advised."
122,Gastroenterology," EXAM: CT of the abdomen and pelvis without contrast. HISTORY: Lower abdominal pain. FINDINGS: Limited views of the lung bases demonstrate linear density most likely representing dependent atelectasis. There is a 1.6 cm nodular density at the left posterior sulcus. Noncontrast technique limits evaluation of the solid abdominal organs. Cardiomegaly and atherosclerotic calcifications are seen. Hepatomegaly is observed. There is calcification within the right lobe of the liver likely related to granulomatous changes. Subtle irregularity of the liver contour is noted, suggestive of cirrhosis. There is splenomegaly seen. There are two low-attenuation lesions seen in the posterior aspect of the spleen, which are incompletely characterized that may represent splenic cyst. The pancreas appears atrophic. There is a left renal nodule seen, which measures 1.9 cm with a Hounsfield unit density of approximately 29, which is indeterminate. There is mild bilateral perinephric stranding. There is an 8-mm fat density lesion in the anterior inner polar region of the left kidney, compatible in appearance with angiomyolipoma. There is a 1-cm low-attenuation lesion in the upper pole of the right kidney, likely representing a cyst, but incompletely characterized on this examination. Bilateral ureters appear normal in caliber along their visualized course. The bladder is partially distended with urine, but otherwise unremarkable. Postsurgical changes of hysterectomy are noted. There are pelvic phlebolith seen. There is a calcified soft tissue density lesion in the right pelvis, which may represent an ovary with calcification, as it appears continuous with the right gonadal vein. Scattered colonic diverticula are observed. The appendix is within normal limits. The small bowel is unremarkable. There is an anterior abdominal wall hernia noted containing herniated mesenteric fat. The hernia neck measures approximately 2.7 cm. There is stranding of the fat within the hernia sac. There are extensive degenerative changes of the right hip noted with changes suggestive of avascular necrosis. Degenerative changes of the spine are observed. IMPRESSION: 1. Anterior abdominal wall hernia with mesenteric fat-containing stranding, suggestive of incarcerated fat. 2. Nodule in the left lower lobe, recommend follow up in 3 months. 3. Indeterminate left adrenal nodule, could be further assessed with dedicated adrenal protocol CT or MRI. 4. Hepatomegaly with changes suggestive of cirrhosis. There is also splenomegaly observed. 5. Low-attenuation lesions in the spleen may represent cyst, that are incompletely characterized on this examination. 6. Fat density lesion in the left kidney, likely represents angiomyolipoma. 7. Fat density soft tissue lesion in the region of the right adnexa, this contains calcifications and may represent an ovary or possibly dermoid cyst."
123,Gastroenterology," EXAM: CT abdomen and pelvis without contrast, stone protocol, reconstruction. REASON FOR EXAM: Flank pain. TECHNIQUE: Noncontrast CT abdomen and pelvis with coronal reconstructions. FINDINGS: There is no intrarenal stone bilaterally. However, there is very mild left renal pelvis and proximal ureteral dilatation with a small amount of left perinephric stranding asymmetric to the right. The right renal pelvis is not dilated. There is no stone along the course of the ureter. I cannot exclude the possibility of recent stone passage, although the findings are ultimately technically indeterminate and clinical correlation is advised. There is no obvious solid-appearing mass given the lack of contrast. Scans of the pelvis disclose no evidence of stone within the decompressed bladder. No pelvic free fluid or adenopathy. There are few scattered diverticula. There is a moderate amount of stool throughout the colon. There are scattered diverticula, but no CT evidence of acute diverticulitis. The appendix is normal. There are mild bibasilar atelectatic changes. Given the lack of contrast, visualized portions of the liver, spleen, adrenal glands, and the pancreas are grossly unremarkable. The gallbladder is present. There is no abdominal free fluid or pathologic adenopathy. There are degenerative changes of the lumbar spine. IMPRESSION: 1.Very mild left renal pelvic dilatation and proximal ureteral dilatation with mild left perinephric stranding. There is no stone identified along the course of the left ureter or in the bladder. Could this patient be status post recent stone passage? Clinical correlation is advised. 2.Diverticulosis. 3.Moderate amount of stool throughout the colon. 4.Normal appendix."
124,Gastroenterology," PROCEDURES: 1. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy. 2. Colonoscopy with polypectomy. PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. History of esophageal cancer. 2. History of colonic polyps. POSTOPERATIVE FINDINGS: 1. Intact surgical intervention for a history of esophageal cancer. 2. Melanosis coli. 3. Transverse colon polyps in the setting of surgical changes related to partial and transverse colectomy. MEDICATIONS: Fentanyl 250 mcg and 9 mg of Versed. INDICATIONS: The patient is a 55-year-old dentist presenting for surveillance upper endoscopy in the setting of a history of esophageal cancer with staging at T2N0M0. He also has a history of adenomatous polyps and presents for surveillance of this process. Informed consent was obtained after explanation of the procedures, as well as risk factors of bleeding, perforation, and adverse medication reaction. ESOPHAGOGASTRODUODENOSCOPY: The patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position and medicated with the above medications to achieve and maintain a conscious sedation. Vital signs were monitored throughout the procedure without evidence of hemodynamic compromise or desaturation. The Olympus single-channel endoscope was passed under direct visualization, through the oral cavity, and advanced to the second portion of the duodenum. FINDINGS: 1. ESOPHAGUS: Anatomy consistent with esophagectomy with colonic transposition. 2. STOMACH: Revealed colonic transposition with normal mucosa. 3. DUODENUM: Normal. IMPRESSION: Intact surgical intervention with esophagectomy colonic transposition. COLONOSCOPY: The patient was then turned and a colonic 140-series colonoscope was passed under direct visualization through the anal verge and advanced to the cecum as identified by the appendiceal orifice. Circumferential visualization the colonic mucosa revealed the following: 1. Cecum revealed melanosis coli. 2. Ascending, melanosis coli. 3. Transverse revealed two diminutive sessile polyps, excised by cold forceps technique and submitted to histology as specimen #1 with surgical changes consistent with partial colectomy related to the colonic transposition. 4. Descending, melanosis coli. 5. Sigmoid, melanosis coli. 6. Rectum, melanosis coli. IMPRESSION: Diffuse melanosis coli with incidental finding of transverse colon polyps. RECOMMENDATION: Follow-up histology. Continue fiber with avoidance of stimulant laxatives."
125,Gastroenterology," The tip of the endoscope was inserted in the rectum. Retroflexion of the tip of the endoscope failed to reveal any distal rectal lesions. The rest of the colon, through to the cecum, was well visualized. The cecal strap and ileocecal valve were both identified. There was no evidence of tumor, polyp, mass, ulceration, or other focus of inflammation. Adverse reactions none."
126,Gastroenterology," PROCEDURE: Colonoscopy. PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Change in bowel habits and rectal prolapse. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Normal colonoscopy. PROCEDURE: The Olympus pediatric variable colonoscope was introduced through the rectum and advanced carefully through the colon to the cecum identified by the ileocecal valve and the appendiceal orifice. The preparation was poor, but mucosa was visible after lavage and suction. Small lesions might have been missed in certain places, but no large lesions are likely to have been missed. The mucosa was normal, was visualized. In particular, there was no mucosal abnormality in the rectum and distal sigmoid, which is reported to be prolapsing. Biopsies were taken from the rectal wall to look for microscopic changes. The anal sphincter was considerably relaxed, with no tone and a gaping opening. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was sent to recovery room. FINAL DIAGNOSIS: Normal colonic mucosa to the cecum. No contraindications to consideration of a repair of the prolapse."
127,Gastroenterology," TITLE OF PROCEDURE: Percutaneous liver biopsy. ANALGESIA: 2% Lidocaine. ALLERGIES: The patient denied any allergy to iodine, lidocaine or codeine. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The procedure was described in detail to the patient at a previous clinic visit and by the medical staff today. The patient was told of complications which might occur consisting of bleeding, bile peritonitis, bowel perforation, pneumothorax, or death. The risks and benefits of the procedure were understood, and the patient signed the consent form freely. With the patient lying in the supine position and the right hand underneath the head, an area of maximal dullness was identified in the mid-axillary location by percussion. The area was prepped and cleaned with povidone iodine following which the skin, subcutaneous tissue, and serosal surfaces were infiltrated with 2% lidocaine down to the capsule of the liver. Next, a small incision was made with a Bard-Parker #11 scalpel. A 16-gauge modified Klatskin needle was inserted through the incision and into the liver on one occasion with the patient in deep expiration. Liver cores measuring *** cm were obtained and will be sent to Pathology for routine histologic study. POST-PROCEDURE COURSE AND DISPOSITION: The patient will remain under close observation in the medical treatment room for four to six hours and then be discharged home without medication. Normal activities can be resumed tomorrow. The patient is to contact me if severe abdominal or chest pain, fever, melena, light-headedness or any unusual symptoms develop. An appointment will be made for the patient to see me in the clinic in the next few weeks to discuss the results of the liver biopsy so that management decisions can be made. COMPLICATIONS: None. RECOMMENDATIONS: Prior to discharge, hepatitis A and B vaccines will be recommended. Risks and benefits for vaccination have been addressed and the patient will consider this option."
128,Gastroenterology," PREPROCEDURE DIAGNOSIS: Change in bowel function. POSTPROCEDURE DIAGNOSIS: Proctosigmoiditis. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Colonoscopy with biopsy. ANESTHESIA: IV sedation. POSTPROCEDURE CONDITION: Stable. INDICATIONS: The patient is a 33-year-old with a recent change in bowel function and hematochezia. He is here for colonoscopy. He understands the risks and wishes to proceed. PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the endoscopy suite where he was placed in left lateral Sims position, underwent IV sedation. Digital rectal examination was performed, which showed no masses, and a boggy prostate. The colonoscope was placed in the rectum and advanced, under direct vision, to the cecum. In the rectum and sigmoid, there were ulcerations, edema, mucosal abnormalities, and loss of vascular pattern consistent with proctosigmoiditis. Multiple random biopsies were taken of the left and right colon to see if this was in fact pan colitis. RECOMMENDATIONS: Follow up with me in 2 weeks and we will begin Canasa suppositories."
129,Gastroenterology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Acute appendicitis. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Acute appendicitis. PROCEDURE: Laparoscopic appendectomy. ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal. INDICATIONS: Patient is a pleasant 31-year-old gentleman who presented to the hospital with acute onset of right lower quadrant pain. History as well as signs and symptoms are consistent with acute appendicitis as was his CAT scan. I evaluated the patient in the emergency room and recommended that he undergo the above-named procedure. The procedure, purpose, risks, expected benefits, potential complications, alternative forms of therapy were discussed with him and he was agreeable with surgery. FINDINGS: Patient was found to have acute appendicitis with an inflamed appendix, which was edematous, but essentially no suppuration. TECHNIQUE: The patient was identified and then taken into the operating room, where after induction of general endotracheal anesthesia, the abdomen was prepped with Betadine solution and draped in sterile fashion. An infraumbilical incision was made and carried down by blunt dissection to the level of the fascia, which was grasped with an Allis clamp and two stay sutures of 2-0 Vicryl were placed on either side of the midline. The fascia was tented and incised and the peritoneum entered by blunt finger dissection. A Hasson cannula was placed and a pneumoperitoneum to 15 mmHg pressure was obtained. Patient was placed in the Trendelenburg position, rotated to his left, whereupon under direct vision, the 12-mm midline as well as 5-mm midclavicular and anterior axillary ports were placed. The appendix was easily visualized, grasped with a Babcock's. A window was created in the mesoappendix between the appendix and the cecum and the Endo GIA was introduced and the appendix was amputated from the base of the cecum. The mesoappendix was divided using the Endo GIA with vascular staples. The appendix was placed within an Endo bag and delivered from the abdominal cavity. The intra-abdominal cavity was irrigated. Hemostasis was assured within the mesentery and at the base of the cecum. All ports were removed under direct vision and then wounds were irrigated with saline antibiotic solution. The infraumbilical defect was closed with a figure-of-eight 0 Vicryl suture. The remaining wounds were irrigated and then everything was closed subcuticular with 4-0 Vicryl suture and Steri-Strips. Patient tolerated the procedure well, dressings were applied, and he was taken to recovery room in stable condition."
130,Gastroenterology," REASON FOR ADMISSION: Cholecystitis with choledocholithiasis. DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: Cholecystitis, choledocholithiasis. ADDITIONAL DIAGNOSES 1. Status post roux-en-y gastric bypass converted to an open procedure in 01/07. 2. Laparoscopic paraventral hernia in 11/07. 3. History of sleep apnea with reversal after 100-pound weight loss. 4. Morbid obesity with bmi of 39.4. PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy with laparoscopy converted to open common bile duct exploration and stone extraction. HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient is a 33-year-old female admitted with elevated bilirubin and probable common bile duct stone. She was admitted through the emergency room with abdominal pain, elevated bilirubin, and gallstones on ultrasound with a dilated common bile duct. She subsequently went for a HIDA scan to rule out cholecystitis. Gallbladder was filled but was unable to empty into the small bowel consistent with the common bile duct blockage. She was taken to the operating room that night for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. We proceeded with laparoscopic cholecystectomy and during the cholangiogram there was no contrast. It was able to be extravasated into the duodenum with the filling defect consistent with the distal common bile duct stone. The patient had undergone a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass but could not receive an ERCP and stone extraction, therefore, common bile duct exploration was performed and a stone was extracted. This necessitated conversion to an open operation. She was transferred to the medical surgical unit postoperatively. She had a significant amount of incisional pain following morning, but no nausea. A Jackson-Pratt drain, which was left in place in two places showed serosanguineous fluid. White blood cell count was down to 7500 and bilirubin decreased to 2.1. Next morning she was started on a liquid diet. Foley catheter was discontinued. There was no evidence of bile leak from the drains. She was advanced to a regular diet on postoperative day #3, which was 12/09/07. The following morning she was tolerating regular diet. Her bowels had begun to function, and she was afebrile with her pain control with oral pain medications. Jackson-Pratt drain was discontinued from the wound. The remaining Jackson-Pratt drain was left adjacent to her cystic duct. Following morning, her laboratory studies were better. Her bilirubin was down to normal and white blood cell count was normal with an H&H of 9 and 26.3. Jackson-Pratt drain was discontinued, and she was discharged home. Followup was in 3 days for staple removal. She was given iron 325 mg p.o. t.i.d. and Lortab elixir 15 cc p.o. q.4 h. p.r.n. for pain."
131,Gastroenterology," Patient complains of constipation, severe at times. Has not had BM for two days. Denies chest pain. Has been ambulating well. No history suggestive of angina. Will be seeing cardiologist this afternoon. Patient was informed by Dr. ABC that he does not need sleep study as per patient. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: General: Pleasant, brighter. Vital signs: 117/78, 12, 56. Abdomen: Soft, nontender. Bowel sounds normal. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 1. Constipation. Milk of Magnesia 30 mL daily p.r.n., Dulcolax suppository twice a week p.r.n. 2. CAD/angina. See cardiologist this afternoon. Call me if constipation not resolved by a.m., consider a Fleet enema then as discussed."
132,Gastroenterology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Epigastric hernia. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Epigastric hernia. OPERATIONS: Epigastric herniorrhaphy. ANESTHESIA: General inhalation. PROCEDURE: Following attainment of satisfactory anesthesia, the patient's abdomen was prepped with Hibiclens and draped sterilely. The hernia mass had been marked preoperatively. This area was anesthetized with a mixture of Marcaine and Xylocaine. A transverse incision was made over the hernia and dissection carried down to the entrapped fat. Sharp dissection was carried around the fat down to the fascial edge. The preperitoneal fat could not be reduced; therefore, it is trimmed away and the small fascial defect then closed with interrupted 0-Ethibond sutures. The fascial edges were injected with the local anesthetic mixture. Subcutaneous tissues were then closed with interrupted 4-0 Vicryl and skin edges closed with running subcuticular 4-0 Vicryl. Steri-Strips and a sterile dressing were applied to complete the closure. The patient was then awakened and taken to the PACU in satisfactory condition. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 10 mL. SPONGE AND NEEDLE COUNT: Reported as correct. COMPLICATIONS: None."
133,Gastroenterology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Gastroesophageal reflux disease. 2. Hiatal hernia. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Gastroesophageal reflux disease. 2. Hiatal hernia. 3. Enterogastritis. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Esophagogastroduodenoscopy, photography, and biopsy. GROSS FINDINGS: The patient has a history of epigastric abdominal pain, persistent in nature. She has a history of severe gastroesophageal reflux disease, takes Pepcid frequently. She has had a history of hiatal hernia. She is being evaluated at this time for disease process. She does not have much response from Protonix. Upon endoscopy, the gastroesophageal junction is approximately 40 cm. There appeared to be some inflammation at the gastroesophageal junction and a small 1 cm to 2 cm hiatal hernia. There is no advancement of the gastric mucosa up into the lower one-third of the esophagus. However there appeared to be inflammation as stated previously in the gastroesophageal junction. There was some mild inflammation at the antrum of the stomach. The fundus of the stomach was within normal limits. The cardia showed some laxity to the lower esophageal sphincter. The pylorus is concentric. The duodenal bulb and sweep are within normal limits. No ulcers or erosions. OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: The patient is taken to the Endoscopy Suite, prepped and draped in the left lateral decubitus position. The patient was given IV sedation using Demerol and Versed. Olympus videoscope was inserted into the hypopharynx and upon deglutition passed into the esophagus. Using air insufflation, panendoscope was advanced down the esophagus into the stomach along the greater curvature of the stomach through the pylorus into the duodenal bulb and sweep and the above gross findings were noted. Panendoscope was slowly withdrawn carefully examining the lumen of the bowel. Photographs were taken with the pathology present. Biopsy was obtained of the antrum of the stomach and also CLO test. The biopsy is also obtained of the gastroesophageal junction at 12, 3, 6 and 9 o' clock positions to rule out occult Barrett's esophagitis. Air was aspirated from the stomach and the panendoscope was removed. The patient sent to recovery room in stable condition."
134,Gastroenterology," HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 55-year-old Hispanic male who was seen initially in the office February 15, 2006, with epigastric and right upper quadrant abdominal pain, nausea, dizziness, and bloating. The patient at that time stated that he had established diagnosis of liver cirrhosis. Since the last visit the patient was asked to sign a lease of information form and we sent request for information from the doctor the patient saw before, Dr. X in Las Cruces and his primary care physician in Silver City, and unfortunately we did not get any information from anybody. Also the patient had admission in Gila Medical Center with epigastric pain, diarrhea, and confusion. He spent 3 days in the hospital. He was followed by Dr. X and unfortunately we also do not have the information of what was wrong with the patient. From the patient's report he was diagnosed with some kind of viral infection. At the time of admission he had a lot of epigastric pain, nausea, vomiting, fever, and chills. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION VITAL SIGNS: Weight 107, height 6 feet 1 inch, blood pressure 128/67, heart rate 74, saturation 98%; pain is 3/10 with localization of the pain in the epigastric area. HEENT: PERRLA. EOM intact. Oropharynx is clear of lesions. NECK: Supple. No lymphadenopathy. No thyromegaly. LUNGS: Clear to auscultation and percussion bilateral. CARDIOVASCULAR: Regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs, rubs, or gallops. ABDOMEN: Not tender, not distended. Splenomegaly about 4 cm under the costal margin. No hepatomegaly. Bowel sounds present. MUSCULOSKELETAL: No cyanosis, no clubbing, no pitting edema. NEUROLOGIC: Nonfocal. No asterixis. No costovertebral tenderness. PSYCHE: The patient is oriented x4, alert and cooperative. LABORATORY DATA: We were able to collect lab results from Medical Center; we got only CMP from the hospital which showed glucose level 79, BUN 9, creatinine 0.6, sodium 136, potassium 3.5, chloride 104, CO2 23.7, calcium 7.3, total protein 5.9, albumin 2.5, total bilirubin 5.63. His AST 56, ALT 37, alkaline phosphatase 165, and his ammonia level was 53. We do not have any other results back. No hepatitis panels. No alpha-fetoprotein level. The patient told me today that he also got an ultrasound of the abdomen and the result was not impressive, but we do not have this result despite calling medical records in the hospital to release this information. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: The patient is a 55-year-old with established diagnosis of liver cirrhosis, unknown cause. 1. Epigastric pain. The patient had chronic pain syndrome, he had multiple back surgeries, and he has taken opiate for a prolonged period of time. In the office twice the patient did not have any abdominal pain on physical exam. His pain does not sound like obstruction of common bile duct and he had these episodes of abdominal pain almost continuously. He probably requires increased level of pain control with increased dose of opiates, which should be addressed with his primary care physician. 2. End-stage liver disease. Of course, we need to find out the cause of the liver cirrhosis. We do not have hepatitis panel yet and we do not have information about the liver biopsy which was performed before. We do not have any information of any type of investigation in the past. Again, patient was seen by gastroenterologist already in Las Cruces, Dr. X. The patient was advised to contact Dr. X by himself to convince him to send available information because we already send release information form signed by the patient without any result. It will be not reasonable to repeat unnecessary tests in that point in time. We are waiting for the hepatitis panel and alpha-fetoprotein level. We will also need to get information about ultrasound which was done in Gila Medical Center, but obviously no tumor was found on this exam of the liver. We have to figure out hepatitis status for another reason if he needs vaccination against hepatitis A and B. Until now we do not know exactly what the cause of the patient's end-stage liver disease is and my differential diagnosis probably is hepatitis C. The patient denied any excessive alcohol intake, but I could not preclude alcohol-related liver cirrhosis also. We will need to look for nuclear antibody if it is not done before. PSC is extremely unlikely but possible. Wilson disease also possible diagnosis but again, we first have to figure out if these tests were done for the patient or not. Alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency will be extremely unlikely because the patient has no lung problem. On his end-stage liver disease we already know that he had low platelet count splenomegaly. We know that his bilirubin is elevated and albumin is very low. I suspect that at the time of admission to the hospital the patient presented with encephalopathy. We do not know if INR was checked to look for coagulopathy. The patient had an EGD in 2005 as well as colonoscopy in Silver City. We have to have this result to evaluate if the patient had any varices and if he needs any intervention for that. At this point in time, I recommended the patient to continue to take lactulose 50 mL 3 times daily. The patient tolerated it well; no diarrhea at this point in time. I also recommended for him to contact his primary care physician for increased dose of opiates for him. As a primary prophylaxis of GI bleeding in patient with end-stage liver disease we will try to use Inderal. The patient got a prescription for 10 mg pills. He will take 10 mg twice daily and we will gradually increase his dose until his heart rate will drop to 25% from 75% to probably 60-58. The patient was educated how to use Inderal and he was explained why we decided to use this medication. The patient will hold this medication if he is orthostatic or bradycardic. Again, the patient and his wife were advised to contact all offices they have seen before to get information about what tests were already done and if on the next visit in 2 weeks we still do not have any information we will need to repeat all these tests I mentioned above. We also discussed nutrition issues. The patient was provided information that his protein intake is supposed to be about 25 g per day. He was advised not to over-eat protein and advised not to starve. He also was advised to stay away from alcohol. His next visit is in 2 weeks with all results available."
135,Gastroenterology," PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy. PROCEDURE: After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the operating room and placed supine on the operating room table. General endotracheal anesthesia was induced without incident. The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner. A 2 cm infraumbilical midline incision was made. The fascia was then cleared of subcutaneous tissue using a tonsil clamp. A 1-2 cm incision was then made in the fascia, gaining entry into the abdominal cavity without incident. Two sutures of 0 Vicryl were then placed superiorly and inferiorly in the fascia, and then tied to the special 12 mm Hasson trocar fitted with a funnel-shaped adapter in order to occlude the fascial opening. Pneumoperitoneum was then established using carbon dioxide insufflation to a steady pressure of 16 mmHg. The remaining trocars were then placed into the abdomen under direct vision of the 30 degree laparoscope taking care to make the incisions along Langer's lines, spreading the subcutaneous tissues with a tonsil clamp, and confirming the entry site by depressing the abdominal wall prior to insertion of the trocar. A total of 3 other trocars were placed. The first was a 10/11 mm trocar in the upper midline position. The second was a 5 mm trocar placed in the anterior iliac spine. The third was a 5 mm trocar placed to bisect the distance between the second and upper midline trocars. All of the trocars were placed without difficulty. The patient was then placed in reverse Trendelenburg position and was rotated slightly to the left. The gallbladder was then grasped through the second and third trocars and retracted cephalad toward the right shoulder. A laparoscopic dissector was then placed through the upper midline cannula, fitted with a reducer, and the structures within the triangle of Calot were meticulously dissected free. A laparoscopic clip applier was introduced through the upper midline cannula and used to doubly ligate the cystic duct proximally and distally. The duct was divided between the clips. The clips were carefully placed to avoid occluding the juncture with the common bile duct. The cystic artery was found medially and slightly posterior to the cystic duct. It was carefully dissected free from its surrounding tissues. A laparoscopic clip applier was introduced through the upper midline cannula and used to doubly ligate the cystic artery proximally and distally. The artery was divided between the clips. The 2 midline port sites were injected with 5% Marcaine. After the complete detachment of the gallbladder from the liver, the video laparoscope was removed and placed through the upper 10/11 mm cannula. The neck of the gallbladder was grasped with a large penetrating forceps placed through the umbilical 12 mm Hasson cannula. As the gallbladder was pulled through the umbilical fascial defect, the entire sheath and forceps were removed from the abdomen. The neck of the gallbladder was removed from the abdomen. Following gallbladder removal, the remaining carbon dioxide was expelled from the abdomen. Both midline fascial defects were then approximated using 0 Vicryl suture. All skin incisions were approximated with 4-0 Vicryl in a subcuticular fashion. The skin was prepped with benzoin, and Steri-Strips were applied. Dressings were applied. All surgical counts were reported as correct. Having tolerated the procedure well, the patient was subsequently extubated and taken to the recovery room in good and stable condition."
136,Gastroenterology," CHIEF COMPLAINT: Colostomy failure. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This patient had a colostomy placed 9 days ago after resection of colonic carcinoma. Earlier today, he felt nauseated and stated that his colostomy stopped filling. He also had a sensation of &quot;heartburn.&quot; He denies vomiting but has been nauseated. He denies diarrhea. He denies hematochezia, hematemesis, or melena. He denies frank abdominal pain or fever. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: As above. Also, hypertension. ALLERGIES: &quot;Fleet enema.&quot; MEDICATIONS: Accupril and vitamins. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: SYSTEMIC: The patient denies fever or chills. HEENT: The patient denies blurred vision, headache, or change in hearing. NECK: The patient denies dysphagia, dysphonia, or neck pain. RESPIRATORY: The patient denies shortness of breath, cough, or hemoptysis. CARDIAC: The patient denies history of arrhythmia, swelling of the extremities, palpitations, or chest pain. GASTROINTESTINAL: See above. MUSCULOSKELETAL: The patient denies arthritis, arthralgias, or joint swelling. NEUROLOGIC: The patient denies difficulty with balance, numbness, or paralysis. GENITOURINARY: The patient denies dysuria, flank pain, or hematuria. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Blood pressure 183/108, pulse 76, respirations 16, temperature 98.7. HEENT: Cranial nerves are grossly intact. There is no scleral icterus. NECK: No jugular venous distention. CHEST: Clear to auscultation bilaterally. CARDIAC: Regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs. ABDOMEN: Soft, nontender, nondistended. Bowel sounds are decreased and high-pitched. There is a large midline laparotomy scar with staples still in place. There is no evidence of wound infection. Examination of the colostomy port reveals no obvious fecal impaction or site of obstruction. There is no evidence of infection. The mucosa appears normal. There is a small amount of nonbloody stool in the colostomy bag. There are no masses or bruits noted. EXTREMITIES: There is no cyanosis, clubbing, or edema. Pulses are 2+ and equal bilaterally. NEUROLOGIC: The patient is alert and awake with no focal motor or sensory deficit noted. MEDICAL DECISION MAKING: Failure of colostomy to function may repre- sent an impaction; however, I did not appreciate this on physical examination. There may also be an adhesion or proximal impaction which I cannot reach, which may cause a bowel obstruction, failure of the shunt, nausea, and ultimately vomiting. An abdominal series was obtained, which confirmed this possibility by demonstrating air-fluid levels and dilated bowel. The CBC showed WBC of 9.4 with normal differential. Hematocrit is 42.6. I interpret this as normal. Amylase is currently pending. I have discussed this case with Dr. S, the patient's surgeon, who agrees that there is a possibility of bowel obstruction and the patient should be admitted to observation. Because of the patient's insurance status, the patient will actually be admitted to Dr. D on observation. I have discussed the case with Dr. P, who is the doctor on call for Dr. D. Both Dr. S and Dr. P have been informed of the patient's condition and are aware of his situation. FINAL IMPRESSION: Bowel obstruction, status post colostomy. DISPOSITION: Admission to observation. The patient's condition is good. He is hemodynamically stable."
137,Gastroenterology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Positive peptic ulcer disease. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Gastritis. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Esophagogastroduodenoscopy with photography and biopsy. GROSS FINDINGS: The patient had a history of peptic ulcer disease, epigastric abdominal pain x2 months, being evaluated at this time for ulcer disease. Upon endoscopy, gastroesophageal junction was at 40 cm, no esophageal tumor, varices, strictures, masses, or no reflux esophagitis was noted. Examination of the stomach reveals mild inflammation of the antrum of the stomach, no ulcers, erosions, tumors, or masses. The profundus and the cardia of the stomach were unremarkable. The pylorus was concentric. The duodenal bulb and sweep with no inflammation, tumors, or masses. OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: The patient taken to the Endoscopy Suite, prepped and draped in the left lateral decubitus position. She was given IV sedation using Demerol and Versed. Olympus videoscope was inserted in the hypopharynx, upon deglutition passed into the esophagus. Using air insufflation, the scope was advanced down through the esophagus into the stomach along the greater curvature of the stomach to the pylorus to the duodenal bulb and sweep. The above gross findings noted. The panendoscope was withdrawn back from the stomach, deflected upon itself. The lesser curve fundus and cardiac were well visualized. Upon examination of these areas, panendoscope was returned to midline. Photographs and biopsies were obtained of the antrum of the stomach. Air was aspirated from the stomach and panendoscope was slowly withdrawn carefully examining the lumen of the bowel. Photographs and biopsies were obtained as appropriate. The patient is sent to recovery room in stable condition."
138,Gastroenterology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Chronic abdominal pain and heme positive stool. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Antral gastritis. 2. Duodenal polyp. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Esophagogastroduodenoscopy with photos and antral biopsy. ANESTHESIA: Demerol and Versed. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: Consent was obtained after all risks and benefits were described. The patient was brought back into the Endoscopy Suite. The aforementioned anesthesia was given. Once the patient was properly anesthetized, bite block was placed in the patient's mouth. Then, the patient was given the aforementioned anesthesia. Once he was properly anesthetized, the endoscope was placed in the patient's mouth that was brought down to the cricopharyngeus muscle into the esophagus and from the esophagus to his stomach. The air was insufflated down. The scope was passed down to the level of the antrum where there was some evidence of gastritis seen. The scope was passed into the duodenum and then duodenal sweep where there was a polyp seen. The scope was pulled back into the stomach in order to flex upon itself and straightened out. Biopsies were taken for CLO and histology of the antrum. The scope was pulled back. The junction was visualized. No other masses or lesions were seen. The scope was removed. The patient tolerated the procedure well. We will recommend the patient be on some type of a H2 blocker. Further recommendations to follow."
139,Gastroenterology," PROCEDURE: Esophagogastroduodenoscopy with biopsy and colonoscopy with biopsy. INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: A 17-year-old with history of 40-pound weight loss, abdominal pain, status post appendectomy with recurrent abscess formation and drainage. Currently, he has a fistula from his anterior abdominal wall out. It does not appear to connect to the gastrointestinal tract, but merely connect from the ventral surface of the rectus muscles out the abdominal wall. CT scans show thickened terminal ileum, which suggest that we are dealing with Crohn's disease. Endoscopy is being done to evaluate for Crohn's disease. MEDICATIONS: General anesthesia. INSTRUMENT: Olympus GIF-160 and PCF-160. COMPLICATIONS: None. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Less than 5 mL. FINDINGS: With the patient in the supine position, intubated under general anesthesia. The endoscope was inserted without difficulty into the hypopharynx. The scope was advanced down the esophagus, which had normal mucosal coloration and vascular pattern. Lower esophageal sphincter was located at 40 cm from the central incisors. It appeared normal and appeared to function normally. The endoscope was advanced into the stomach, which was distended with excess air. Rugal folds were flattened completely. There were multiple superficial erosions scattered throughout the fundus, body, and antral portions consistent with Crohn's involvement of the stomach. The endoscope was advanced through normal-appearing pyloric valve into the first, second, and third portion of the duodenum, which had normal mucosal coloration and fold pattern. Biopsies were obtained x2 in the second portion of the duodenum, antrum, body, and distal esophagus at 37 cm from the central incisors for histology. Two additional biopsies were obtained in the antrum for CLO testing. Excess air was evacuated from the stomach. The scope was removed from the patient who tolerated that part of the procedure well. The patient was turned and scope was changed for colonoscopy. Prior to colonoscopy, it was noted that there was a perianal fistula at 7 o'clock. The colonoscope was then inserted into the anal verge. The colonic clean out was excellent. The scope was advanced without difficulty to the cecum. The cecal area had multiple ulcers with exudate. The ileocecal valve was markedly distorted. Biopsies were obtained x2 in the cecal area and then the scope was withdrawn through the ascending, transverse, descending, sigmoid, and rectum. The colonic mucosa in these areas was well seen and there were a few scattered aphthous ulcers in the ascending and descending colon. Biopsies were obtained in the cecum at 65 cm, transverse colon 50 cm, rectosigmoid 20 cm, and rectum at 5 cm. No fistulas were noted in the colon. Excess air was evacuated from the colon. The scope was removed. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to recovery in satisfactory condition. IMPRESSION: Normal esophagus and duodenum. There were multiple superficial erosions or aphthous ulcers in the stomach along with a very few scattered aphthous ulcers in the colon with marked cecal involvement with large ulcers and a very irregular ileocecal valve. All these findings are consistent with Crohn's disease. PLAN: Begin prednisone 30 mg p.o. daily. Await PPD results and chest x-ray results, as well as cocci serology results. If these are normal, then we would recommend Remicade 5 mg/kg IV infusion. We would start Modulon 50 mL/h for 20 hours to reverse the malnutrition state of this boy. Check CMP and phosphate every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday for receding syndrome noted by following potassium and phosphate. We will discuss with Dr. X possibly repeating the CT fistulogram if the findings on the previous ones are inconclusive as far as the noting whether we can rule in or out an enterocutaneous fistula. He will need an upper GI to rule out small intestinal strictures and involvement of the small intestine that cannot be seen with upper and lower endoscopy. If he has no stricture formation in the small bowel, we would then recommend a video endoscopy capsule to further evaluate any mucosal lesions consistent with Crohn's in the small intestine that we cannot visualize with endoscopy."
140,Gastroenterology," EXAM: CT Abdomen & Pelvis W&WO Contrast REASON FOR EXAM: Status post aortobiiliac graft repair. TECHNIQUE: 5 mm spiral thick spiral CT scanning was performed through the entire abdomen and pelvis utilizing intravenous dynamic bolus contrast enhancement. No oral or rectal contrast was utilized. Comparison is made with the prior CT abdomen and pelvis dated 10/20/05. There has been no significant change in size of the abdominal aortic aneurysm centered roughly at the renal artery origin level which has dimensions of 3.7 cm transversely x 3.4 AP. Just below this level is the top of the endoluminal graft repair with numerous surrounding surgical clips. The size of the native aneurysm component at this level is stable at 5.5 cm in diameter with mural thrombus surrounding the enhancing endolumen. There is no abnormal entrance of contrast agent into the mural thrombus to indicate an endoluminal leak. Further distally, there is extension of the graft into both proximal common iliac arteries without evidence for endoluminal leak at this level either. No exoluminal leakage is identified at any level. There is no retroperitoneal hematoma present. The findings are unchanged from the prior exam. The liver, spleen, pancreas, adrenals and right kidney are unremarkable with moderate diffuse atrophy of the pancreas present. There is advanced atrophy of the left kidney. No hydronephrosis is present. No acute findings are identified elsewhere in the abdomen. The lung bases are clear. Concerning the remainder of the pelvis, no acute pathology is identified. There is prominent streak artifact from the left total hip replacement. There is diffuse moderate sigmoid diverticulosis without evidence for diverticulitis. The bladder grossly appears normal. A hysterectomy has been performed. IMPRESSION: 1. No complications identified regarding endoluminal aortoiliac graft repair as described. The findings are stable compared to the study of 10/20/04. 2. Stable mild aneurysm of aortic aneurysm, centered roughly at renal artery level. 3. No other acute findings noted. 4. Advanced left renal atrophy."
141,Gastroenterology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Neuromuscular dysphagia. 2. Protein-calorie malnutrition. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Neuromuscular dysphagia. 2. Protein-calorie malnutrition. PROCEDURES PERFORMED: 1. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy with photo. 2. Insertion of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube. ANESTHESIA: IV sedation and local. COMPLICATIONS: None. DISPOSITION: The patient tolerated the procedure well without difficulty. BRIEF HISTORY: The patient is a 50-year-old African-American male who presented to ABCD General Hospital on 08/18/2003 secondary to right hemiparesis from a CVA. The patient deteriorated with several CVAs and had became encephalopathic requiring a ventilator-dependency with respiratory failure. The patient also had neuromuscular dysfunction. After extended period of time, per the patient's family request and requested by the ICU staff, decision to place a feeding tube was decided and scheduled for today. INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS: The patient was found to have esophagitis as well as gastritis via EGD and was placed on Prevacid granules. PROCEDURE: After informed written consent, the risks and benefits of the procedure were explained to the patient and the patient's family. First, the EGD was to be performed. The Olympus endoscope was inserted through the mouth, oropharynx and into the esophagus. Esophagitis was noted. The scope was then passed through the esophagus into the stomach. The cardia, fundus, body, and antrum of the stomach were visualized. There was evidence of gastritis. The scope was passed into the duodenal bulb and sweep via the pylorus and then removed from the duodenum retroflexing on itself in the stomach looking at the hiatus. Next, attention was made to transilluminating the anterior abdominal wall for the PEG placement. The skin was then anesthetized with 1% lidocaine. The finder needle was then inserted under direct visualization. The catheter was then grasped via the endoscope and the wire was pulled back up through the patient's mouth. The Ponsky PEG tube was attached to the wire. A skin nick was made with a #11 blade scalpel. The wire was pulled back up through the abdominal wall point and Ponsky PEG back up through the abdominal wall and inserted into position. The endoscope was then replaced confirming position. Photograph was taken. The Ponsky PEG tube was trimmed and the desired attachments were placed and the patient did tolerate the procedure well. We will begin tube feeds later this afternoon."
142,Gastroenterology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Alternating hard and soft stools. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Sigmoid diverticulosis. Sessile polyp of the sigmoid colon. Pedunculated polyp of the sigmoid colon. PROCEDURE: Total colonoscopy with biopsy and snare polypectomy. PREP: 4/4. DIFFICULTY: 1/4. PREMEDICATION AND SEDATION: Fentanyl 100, midazolam 5. INDICATION FOR PROCEDURE: A 64-year-old male who has developed alternating hard and soft stools. He has one bowel movement a day. FINDINGS: There is extensive sigmoid diverticulosis, without evidence of inflammation or bleeding. There was a small, sessile polyp in the sigmoid colon, and a larger pedunculated polyp in the sigmoid colon, both appeared adenomatous. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: Preoperative counseling, including an explicit discussion of the risk and treatment of perforation was provided. Preoperative physical examination was performed. Informed consent was obtained. The patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position. Premedications were given slowly by intravenous push. Rectal examination was performed, which was normal. The scope was introduced and passed with minimal difficulty to the cecum. This was verified anatomically and video photographs were taken of the ileocecal valve and appendiceal orifice. The scope was slowly withdrawn, the mucosa carefully visualized. It was normal in its entirety until reaching the sigmoid colon. Sigmoid colon had extensive diverticular disease, small-mouth, without inflammation or bleeding. In addition, there was a small sessile polyp, which was cold biopsied and recovered, and approximately an 8 mm pedunculated polyp. A snare was placed on the stalk of the polyp and divided with electrocautery. The polyp was recovered and sent for pathologic examination. Examination of the stalk showed good hemostasis. The scope was slowly withdrawn and the remainder of the examination was normal. ASSESSMENT: Diverticular disease. A diverticular disease handout was given to the patient's wife and a high fiber diet was recommended. In addition, 2 polyps, one of which is assuredly an adenoma. Patient needs a repeat colonoscopy in 3 years."
143,Gastroenterology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Iron deficiency anemia. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Diverticulosis. PROCEDURE: Colonoscopy. MEDICATIONS: MAC. PROCEDURE: The Olympus pediatric variable colonoscope was introduced into the rectum and advanced carefully through the colon to the cecum identified by the ileocecal valve and the appendiceal orifice. Preparation was good, although there was some residual material in the cecum that was difficult to clear completely. The mucosa was normal throughout the colon. No polyps or other lesions were identified, and no blood was noted. Some diverticula were seen of the sigmoid colon with no luminal narrowing or evidence of inflammation. A retroflex view of the anorectal junction showed no hemorrhoids. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was sent to the recovery room. FINAL DIAGNOSES: 1. Diverticulosis in the sigmoid. 2. Otherwise normal colonoscopy to the cecum. RECOMMENDATIONS: 1. Follow up with Dr. X as needed. 2. Screening colonoscopy in 2 years. 3. Additional evaluation for other causes of anemia may be appropriate."
144,Gastroenterology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Prior history of anemia, abdominal bloating. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: External hemorrhoids, otherwise unremarkable colonoscopy. PREMEDICATIONS: Versed 5 mg, Demerol 50 mg IV. REPORT OF PROCEDURE: Digital rectal exam revealed external hemorrhoids. The colonoscope was inserted into the rectal ampulla and advanced to the cecum. The position of the scope within the cecum was verified by identification of the appendiceal orifice. The cecum, the ascending colon, hepatic flexure, transverse colon, splenic flexure, descending colon, and rectum were normal. The scope was retroflexed in the rectum and no abnormality was seen. So the scope was straightened, withdrawn, and the procedure terminated. ENDOSCOPIC IMPRESSION: 1. Normal colonoscopy. 2. External hemorrhoids."
145,Gastroenterology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Cholecystitis and cholelithiasis. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Cholecystitis and cholelithiasis. TITLE OF PROCEDURE 1. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy. 2. Intraoperative cholangiogram. ANESTHESIA: General. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was taken to the operative suite and placed in the supine position under general endotracheal anesthetic. The patient received 1 gm of IV Ancef intravenously piggyback. The abdomen was prepared and draped in routine sterile fashion. A 1-cm incision was made at the umbilicus and a Veress needle was inserted. Saline test was performed. Satisfactory pneumoperitoneum was achieved by insufflation of CO2 to a pressure of 14 mmHg. The Veress needle was removed. A 10- to 11-mm cannula was inserted. Inspection of the peritoneal cavity revealed a gallbladder that was soft and without adhesions to it. It was largely mobile. The liver had a normal appearance as did the peritoneal cavity. A 5-mm cannula was inserted in the right upper quadrant anterior axillary line. A second 5-mm cannula was inserted in the subcostal space. A 10- to 11-mm cannula was inserted into the upper midline. The gallbladder was reflected in a cephalad direction. The gallbladder was punctured with the aspirating needle, and under C-arm fluoroscopy was filled with contrast, filling the intra- and extrahepatic biliary trees, which appeared normal. Extra contrast was aspirated and the aspirating needle was removed. The ampulla was grasped with a second grasper, opening the triangle of Calot. The cystic duct was dissected and exposed at its junction with the ampulla, was controlled with a hemoclip, digitally controlled with two clips and divided. This was done while the common duct was in full visualization. The cystic artery was similarly controlled and divided. The gallbladder was dissected from its bed and separated from the liver, brought to the outside through the upper midline cannula and removed. The subhepatic and subphrenic spaces were irrigated thoroughly with saline solution. There was oozing and bleeding from the lateral 5-mm cannula site, but this stopped spontaneously with removal of the cannula. The subphrenic and subhepatic spaces were again irrigated thoroughly with saline until clear. Hemostasis was excellent. CO2 was evacuated and the camera removed. The umbilical fascia was closed with 2-0 Vicryl, the subcu with 3-0 Vicryl, and the skin was closed with 4-0 nylon. Sterile dressings were applied. Sponge and needle counts were correct."
146,Gastroenterology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. 2. Ethanol and alcohol abuse. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. 2. Ethanol and alcohol abuse. PROCEDURE: 1. Failed percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement. 2. Open Stamm gastrotomy tube. 3. Lysis of adhesions. 4. Closure of incidental colotomy. ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal anesthesia. IV FLUIDS: Crystalloid 1400 ml. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Thirty ml. DRAINS: Gastrostomy tube was placed to Foley. SPECIMENS: None. FINDINGS: Stomach located high in the peritoneal cavity. Multiple adhesions around the stomach to the diaphragm and liver. HISTORY: The patient is a 59-year-old black male who is indigent, an ethanol and tobacco abuse. He presented initially to the emergency room with throat and bleeding. Following evaluation by ENT and biopsy, it was determined to be squamous cell carcinoma of the right tonsil and soft palate, The patient is to undergo radiation therapy and possibly chemotherapy and will need prolonged enteral feeding with a bypass route from the mouth. The malignancy was not obstructing. Following obtaining informed consent for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube with possible conversion to open procedure, we elected to proceed following diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma and election for radiation therapy. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was placed in the supine position and general endotracheal anesthesia was induced. Preoperatively, 1 gram of Ancef was given. The abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. After anesthesia was achieved, an endoscope was placed down into the stomach, and no abnormalities were noted. The stomach was insufflated with air and the endoscope was positioned in the midportion and directed towards the anterior abdominal wall. With the room darkened and intensity turned up on the endoscope, a light reflex was noted on the skin of the abdominal wall in the left upper quadrant at approximately 2 fingerbreadths inferior from the most inferior rib. Finger pressure was applied to the light reflex with adequate indentation on the stomach wall on endoscopy. A 21-gauge 1-1/2 inch needle was initially placed at the margin of the light reflex, and this was done twice. Both times it was not visualized on the endoscopy. At this point, repositioning was made and, again, what was felt to be adequate light reflex was obtained, and the 14-gauge angio catheter was placed. Again, after two attempts, we were unable to visualize the needle in the stomach endoscopically. At this point, decision was made to convert the procedure to an open Stamm gastrostomy. OPEN STAMM GASTROSTOMY: A short upper midline incision was made and deepened through the subcutaneous tissues. Hemostasis was achieved with electrocautery. The linea alba was identified and incised, and the peritoneal cavity was entered. The abdomen was explored. Adhesions were lysed with electrocautery under direct vision. The stomach was identified, and a location on the anterior wall near the greater curvature was selected. After lysis of adhesions was confirmed, we sufficiently moved the original chosen site without tension. A pursestring suture of #3-0 silk was placed on the interior surface of the stomach, and a second #3-0 pursestring silk stitch was placed exterior to that pursestring suture. An incision was then made at the location of the anterior wall which was near the greater curvature and was dissected down to the anterior abdominal wall. A Vanderbilt was used to pass through the abdominal wall in through the skin and then returned to the level of the skin and pulled the Bard feeding tube through the anterior wall into the field. An incision in the center of the pursestring suture on the anterior surface of the stomach was then made with electrocautery. The interior pursestring suture was sutured into place in such a manner as to inkwell the stomach around the catheter. The second outer concentric pursestring suture was then secured as well and tied to further inkwell the stomach. The stomach was then tacked to the anterior abdominal wall at the catheter entrance site with four #2-0 silk sutures in such a manner as to prevent leakage or torsion. The catheter was then secured to the skin with two #2-0 silk sutures. Hemostasis was checked and the peritoneal cavity was washed out and brought to the surgical field. Prior to the initiation of the gastrotomy, the bowel was run and at that time there was noted to be one incidental colotomy. This was oversewn with three #4-0 silk Lembert sutures. At the completion of the operation, the fascia was closed with #1 interrupted Vicryl suture, and the skin was closed with staples. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to the postanesthesia care unit in stable condition."
147,Gastroenterology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Acute pain. 2. Fever postoperatively. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 1. Acute pain. 2. Fever postoperatively. 3. Hemostatic uterine perforation. 4. No bowel or vascular trauma. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: 1. Diagnostic laparoscopy. 2. Rigid sigmoidoscopy by Dr. X. ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal. COMPLICATIONS: None. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Scant. SPECIMEN: None. INDICATIONS: This is a 17-year-old African-American female, gravida-1, para-1, and had a hysteroscopy and dilation curettage on 09/05/03. The patient presented later that evening after having increasing abdominal pain, fever and chills at home with a temperature up to 101.2. The patient denied any nausea, vomiting or diarrhea. She does complain of some frequent urination. Her vaginal bleeding is minimal. FINDINGS: On bimanual exam, the uterus is approximately 6-week size, anteverted, and freely mobile with no adnexal masses appreciated. On laparoscopic exam, there is a small hemostatic perforation noted on the left posterior aspect of the uterus. There is approximately 40 cc of serosanguineous fluid in the posterior cul-de-sac. The bilateral tubes and ovaries appeared normal. There is no evidence of endometriosis in the posterior cul-de-sac or along the bladder flap. There is no evidence of injury to the bowel or pelvic sidewall. The liver margin, gallbladder and remainder of the bowel including the appendix appeared normal. PROCEDURE: After consent was obtained, the patient was taken to the Operating Room where general anesthetic was administered. The patient was placed in the dorsal lithotomy position and prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion. A sterile speculum was placed in the patient's vagina and the anterior lip of the cervix was grasped with a vulsellum tenaculum. The uterine manipulator was then placed into the patient's cervix and the vulsellum tenaculum and sterile speculum were removed. Gloves were changed and attention was then turned to the abdomen where approximately 10 mm transverse infraumbilical incision was made. Veress needle was placed through this incision and the gas turned on. When good flow and low abdominal pressures were noted, the gas was turned up and the abdomen was allowed to insufflate. A 11 mm trocar was then placed through this incision. The camera was placed with the above findings noted. A 5 mm step trocar was placed 2 cm superior to the pubic bone and along the midline. A blunt probe was placed through this trocar to help for visualization of the pelvic and abdominal organs. The serosanguineous fluid of the cul-de-sac was aspirated and the pelvis was copiously irrigated with sterile saline. At this point, Dr. X was consulted. He performed a rigid sigmoidoscopy, please see his dictation for further details. There does not appear to be any evidence of colonic injury. The saline in the pelvis was then suctioned out using Nezhat-Dorsey. All instruments were removed. The 5 mm trocar was removed under direct visualization with excellent hemostasis noted. The camera was removed and the abdomen was allowed to desufflate. The 11 mm trocar introducer was replaced and the trocar removed. The skin was then closed with #4-0 undyed Vicryl in a subcuticular fashion. Approximately 10 cc of 0.25% Marcaine was injected into the incision sites for postoperative pain relief. Steri-Strips were then placed across the incision. The uterine manipulator was then removed from the patient's cervix with excellent hemostasis noted. The patient tolerated the procedure well. Sponge, lap, and needle counts were correct at the end of the procedure. The patient was taken to the recovery room in satisfactory condition. She will be followed immediately postoperatively within the hospital and started on IV antibiotics."
148,Gastroenterology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Leaking anastomosis from esophagogastrectomy. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Leaking anastomosis from esophagogastrectomy. PROCEDURE: Exploratory laparotomy and drainage of intra-abdominal abscesses with control of leakage. COMPLICATIONS: None. ANESTHESIA: General oroendotracheal intubation. PROCEDURE: After adequate general anesthesia was administered, the patient's abdomen was prepped and draped aseptically. Sutures and staples were removed. The abdomen was opened. The were some very early stage adhesions that were easy to separate. Dissection was carried up toward the upper abdomen where the patient was found to have a stool filled descended colon. This was retracted caudally to expose the stomach. There were a number of adhesions to the stomach. These were carefully dissected to expose initially the closure over the gastrotomy site. Initially this looked like this was leaking but it was actually found to be intact. The pyloroplasty was identified and also found to be intact with no evidence of leakage. Further dissection up toward the hiatus revealed an abscess collection. This was sent for culture and sensitivity and was aspirated and lavaged. Cavity tracked up toward the hiatus. Stomach itself appeared viable, there was no necrotic sections. Upper apex of the stomach was felt to be viable also. I did not pull the stomach and esophagus down into the abdomen from the mediastinum, but placed a sucker up into the mediastinum where additional turbid fluid was identified. Carefully placed a 10 mm flat Jackson-Pratt drain into the mediastinum through the hiatus to control this area of leakage. Two additional Jackson-Pratt drains were placed essentially through the gastrohepatic omentum. This was the area that most of the drainage had collected in. As I had previously discussed with Dr. Sageman I did not feel that mobilizing the stomach to redo the anastomosis in the chest would be a recoverable situation for the patient. I therefore did not push to visualize any focal areas of the anastomosis with the intent of repair. Once the drains were secured, they were brought out through the anterior abdominal wall and secured with 3-0 silk sutures and secured to bulb suction. The midline fascia was then closed using running #2 Prolene sutures bolstered with retention sutures. Subcutaneous tissue was copiously lavaged and then the skin was closed with loosely approximated staples. Dry gauze dressing was placed. The patient tolerated the procedure well, there were no complications."
149,Gastroenterology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Malnutrition and dysphagia. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Malnutrition and dysphagia with two antral polyps and large hiatal hernia. PROCEDURES: Esophagogastroduodenoscopy with biopsy of one of the polyps and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement. ANESTHESIA: IV sedation, 1% Xylocaine locally. CONDITION: Stable. OPERATIVE NOTE IN DETAIL: After risk of operation was explained to this patient's family, consent was obtained for surgery. The patient was brought to the GI lab. There, she was placed in partial left lateral decubitus position. She was given IV sedation by Anesthesia. Her abdomen was prepped with alcohol and then Betadine. Flexible gastroscope was passed down the esophagus, through the stomach into the duodenum. No lesions were noted in the duodenum. There appeared to be a few polyps in the antral area, two in the antrum. Actually, one appeared to be almost covering the pylorus. The scope was withdrawn back into the antrum. On retroflexion, we could see a large hiatal hernia. No other lesions were noted. Biopsy was taken of one of the polyps. The scope was left in position. Anterior abdominal wall was prepped with Betadine, 1% Xylocaine was injected in the left epigastric area. A small stab incision was made and a large bore Angiocath was placed directly into the anterior abdominal wall, into the stomach, followed by a thread, was grasped with a snare using the gastroscope, brought out through the patient's mouth. Tied to the gastrostomy tube, which was then pulled down and up through the anterior abdominal wall. It was held in position with a dressing and a stent. A connector was applied to the cut gastrostomy tube, held in place with a 2-0 silk ligature. The patient tolerated the procedure well. She was returned to the floor in stable condition."
150,Gastroenterology," PROCEDURE: Repair of juxtarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm with 14 mm Hemashield tube graft. PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Large juxtarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Large juxtarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm. ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal anesthesia. OPERATIVE TIME: Three hours. ANESTHESIA TIME: Four hours. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: After thorough preoperative evaluation, the patient was brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table in supine position and after placement of upper extremity IV access and radial A-line, general endotracheal anesthesia was induced. A Foley catheter was placed and a right internal jugular central line was placed. The chest, abdomen, both groin, and perineum were prepped widely with Betadine and draped as a sterile field with an Ioban drape. A long midline incision from xiphoid to pubis was created with a scalpel and the abdomen was carefully entered. A sterile Omni-Tract was introduced into the field to retract the abdominal wall and gentle exploration of the abdomen was performed. With the exception of the vascular findings to be described, there were no apparent intra-abdominal abnormalities. The transverse colon retracted superiorly. The small bowel was wrapped in moist green towel and retracted in the right upper quadrant. The posterior peritoneum overlying the aneurysm was scribed mobilizing the ligament of Treitz thoroughly ligating and dividing the inferior mesenteric vein. Dissection continued superiorly to identify the left renal vein and the right and left inferior renal arteries. The mid left renal artery was likewise identified. The perirenal aorta was prepared for clamp superior to the inferior left renal artery. During this portion of the dissection, the patient was given multiple small doses of intravenous mannitol to establish an osmotic diuresis. The distal dissection was then completed exposing each common iliac artery. The arteries were suitable for control. The patient was then given 8000 units of intravenous sodium heparin and systemic anticoagulation verified by activated clotting time. The aneurysm was repaired. First, the common carotid arteries were controlled with atraumatic clamps. The inferior left renal artery was controlled with a microvascular clamp and a straight aortic clamp was used to control the aorta superior to this renal artery. The aneurysm was opened on the right anterior lateral aspect and an endarterectomy of the aneurysm sac was performed. There was a high-grade stenosis at the origin of the inferior mesenteric artery and an eversion endarterectomy was performed at this site. The vessel was controlled with a microvascular clamp. Two pairs of lumbar arteries were oversewn with 2-0 silk. A 14 mm Hemashield tube graft was selected and sewn end-to-end fashion to the proximal aorta using a semi continuous 3-0 Prolene suture. At the completion of anastomosis three patch stitches of 3-0 Prolene were required for hemostasis. The graft was cut to appropriate length and sewn end-to-end at the iliac bifurcation using semi-continuous 3-0 Prolene suture. Prior to completion of this anastomosis, the graft was flushed of air and debris and blood flow was reestablished slowly to the distal native circulation first to the pelvis with external compression on the femoral vessels and finally to the distal native circulation. The distal anastomosis was competent without leak. The patient was then given 70 mg of intravenous protamine and final hemostasis obtained using electrocoagulation. The back bleeding from the inferior mesenteric artery was assessed and was pulsatile and vigorous. The colon was normal in appearance and this vessel was oversewn using 2-0 silk. The aneurysm sac was then closed about the grafts snuggly using 3-0 PDS in a vest-over-pants fashion. The posterior peritoneum was reapproximated using running 3-0 PDS. The entire large and small bowel were inspected and these structures were well perfused with a strong pulse within the SMA normal appearance of the entire viscera. The NG tube was positioned in the fundus of the stomach and the viscera returned to their anatomic location. The midline fascia was then reapproximated using running #1 PDS suture. The subcutaneous tissues were irrigated with bacitracin and kanamycin solution. The skin edges coapted using surgical staples. At the conclusion of the case, sponge and needle counts were correct and a sterile occlusive compressive dressing was applied."
151,Gastroenterology," CHIEF COMPLAINT: Blood in toilet. HISTORY: Ms. ABC is a 77-year-old female who is brought down by way of ambulance from XYZ Nursing Home after nursing staff had noted there to be blood in the toilet after she had been sitting on the toilet. They did not note any urine or stool in the toilet and the patient had no acute complaints. The patient is unfortunately a poor historian in that she has dementia and does not recall any of the events. The patient herself has absolutely no complaints, such as abdominal pain or back pain, urinary and GI complaints. There is no other history provided by the nursing staff from XYZ. There apparently were no clots noted within there. She does not have a history of being on anticoagulants. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Actually quite limited, includes that of dementia, asthma, anemia which is chronic, hypothyroidism, schizophrenia, positive PPD in the past. PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Unknown. SOCIAL HISTORY: No tobacco or alcohol. MEDICATIONS: Listed in the medical records. ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Stable. GENERAL: This is a well-nourished, well-developed female who is alert, oriented in all spheres, pleasant, cooperative, resting comfortably, appearing otherwise healthy and well in no acute distress. HEENT: Visually normal. Pupils are reactive. TMs, canals, nasal mucosa, and oropharynx are intact. NECK: No lymphadenopathy or JVD. HEART: Regular rate and rhythm. S1, S2. No murmurs, gallops, or rubs. LUNGS: Clear to auscultation. No wheeze, rales, or rhonchi. ABDOMEN: Benign, flat, soft, nontender, and nondistended. Bowel sounds active. No organomegaly or mass noted. GU/RECTAL: External rectum was normal. No obvious blood internally. There is no stool noted within the vault. There is no gross amount of blood noted within the vault. Guaiac was done and was trace positive. Visual examination anteriorly during the rectal examination noted no blood within the vaginal region. EXTREMITIES: No significant abnormalities. WORKUP: CT abdomen and pelvis was negative. CBC was entirely within normal limits without any signs of anemia with an H and H of 14 and 42%. CMP also within normal limits. PTT, PT, and INR were normal. Attempts at getting the patient to give A urine were unsuccessful and the patient was very noncompliant, would not allow us to do any kind of Foley catheterization. ER COURSE: Uneventful. I have discussed the patient in full with Dr. X who agrees that she does not require any further workup or evaluation as an inpatient. We have decided to send the patient back to XYZ with observation by the staff there. She will have a CBC done daily for the next 3 days with results to Dr. X. They are to call him if there is any recurrences of blood or worsening of symptoms and they are to do a urinalysis at XYZ for blood. ASSESSMENT: Questionable gastrointestinal bleeding at this time, stable without any obvious signs otherwise of significant bleed."
152,Gastroenterology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Blood loss anemia. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Normal colon with no evidence of bleeding. 2. Hiatal hernia. 3. Fundal gastritis with polyps. 4. Antral mass. ANESTHESIA: Conscious sedation with Demerol and Versed. SPECIMEN: Antrum and fundal polyps. HISTORY: The patient is a 66-year-old African-American female who presented to ABCD Hospital with mental status changes. She has been anemic as well with no gross evidence of blood loss. She has had a decreased appetite with weight loss greater than 20 lb over the past few months. After discussion with the patient and her daughter, she was scheduled for EGD and colonoscopy for evaluation. PROCEDURE: After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the endoscopy suite. She was placed in the left lateral position and was given IV Demerol and Versed for sedation. When adequate level of sedation was achieved, a digital rectal exam was performed, which demonstrated no masses and no hemorrhoids. The colonoscope was inserted into the rectum and air was insufflated. The scope was coursed through the rectum and sigmoid colon, descending colon, transverse colon, ascending colon to the level of the cecum. There were no polyps, masses, diverticuli, or areas of inflammation. The scope was then slowly withdrawn carefully examining all walls. Air was aspirated. Once in the rectum, the scope was retroflexed. There was no evidence of perianal disease. No source of the anemia was identified. Attention was then taken for performing an EGD. The gastroscope was inserted into the hypopharynx and was entered into the hypopharynx. The esophagus was easily intubated and traversed. There were no abnormalities of the esophagus. The stomach was entered and was insufflated. The scope was coursed along the greater curvature towards the antrum. Adjacent to the pylorus, towards the anterior surface, was a mass like lesion with a central _______. It was not clear if this represents a healing ulcer or neoplasm. Several biopsies were taken. The mass was soft. The pylorus was then entered. The duodenal bulb and sweep were examined. There was no evidence of mass, ulceration, or bleeding. The scope was then brought back into the antrum and was retroflexed. In the fundus and body, there was evidence of streaking and inflammation. There were also several small sessile polyps, which were removed with biopsy forceps. Biopsy was also taken for CLO. A hiatal hernia was present as well. Air was aspirated. The scope was slowly withdrawn. The GE junction was unremarkable. The scope was fully withdrawn. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to recovery room in stable condition. She will undergo a CAT scan of her abdomen and pelvis to further assess any possible adenopathy or gastric obstructional changes. We will await the biopsy reports and further recommendations will follow."
153,Gastroenterology," PROCEDURE: Colonoscopy. PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Follow up adenomas. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Two colon polyps, removed. 2. Small internal hemorrhoids. 3. Otherwise normal examination of cecum. MEDICATIONS: Fentanyl 150 mcg and Versed 7 mg slow IV push. INDICATIONS: This is a 60-year-old white female with a history of adenomas. She does have irregular bowel habits. FINDINGS: The patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position and the above medications were administered. The colonoscope was advanced to the cecum as identified by the ileocecal valve, appendiceal orifice, and blind pouch. The colonoscope was slowly withdrawn and a careful examination of the colonic mucosa was made, including a retroflexed view of the rectum. There was a 4 mm descending colon polyp, which was removed with jumbo forceps, and sent for histology in bottle one. There was a 10 mm pale, flat polyp in the distal rectum, which was removed with jumbo forceps, and sent for histology in bottle 2. There were small internal hemorrhoids. The remainder of the examination was normal to the cecum. The patient tolerated the procedure well without complication. IMPRESSION: 1. Two colon polyps, removed. 2. Small internal hemorrhoids. 3. Otherwise normal examination to cecum. PLAN: I will await the results of the colon polyp histology. The patient was told the importance of daily fiber."
154,Gastroenterology," PROCEDURES PERFORMED: Endoscopy. INDICATIONS: Dysphagia. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Esophageal ring and active reflux esophagitis. PROCEDURE: Informed consent was obtained prior to the procedure from the parents and patient. The oral cavity is sprayed with lidocaine spray. A bite block is placed. Versed IV 5 mg and 100 mcg of IV fentanyl was given in cautious increments. The GIF-160 diagnostic gastroscope used. The patient was alert during the procedure. The esophagus was intubated under direct visualization. The scope was advanced toward the GE junction with active reflux esophagitis involving the distal one-third of the esophagus noted. The stomach was unremarkable. Retroflexed exam unremarkable. Duodenum not intubated in order to minimize the time spent during the procedure. The patient was alert although not combative. A balloon was then inserted across the GE junction, 15 mm to 18 mm, and inflated to 3, 4.7, and 7 ATM, and left inflated at 18 mm for 45 seconds. The balloon was then deflated. The patient became uncomfortable and a good-size adequate distal esophageal tear was noted. The scope and balloon were then withdrawn. The patient left in good condition. IMPRESSION: Successful dilation of distal esophageal fracture in the setting of active reflux esophagitis albeit mild. PLAN: I will recommend that the patient be on lifelong proton pump inhibition and have repeat endoscopy performed as needed. This has been discussed with the parents. He was sent home with a prescription for omeprazole."
155,Gastroenterology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Abdominal mass. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Abdominal mass. PROCEDURE: Paracentesis. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: This 64-year-old female has stage II endometrial carcinoma, which had been resected before and treated with chemotherapy and radiation. At the present time, the patient is under radiation treatment. Two weeks ago or so, she developed a large abdominal mass, which was cystic in nature and the radiologist inserted a pigtail catheter in the emergency room. We proceeded to admit the patient and drained a significant amount of clear fluid in the subsequent days. The cytology of the fluid was negative and the culture was also negative. Eventually, the patient was sent home with the pigtail shut off and the patient a week later underwent a repeat CAT scan of the abdomen and pelvis. The CAT scan showed accumulation of the fluid and the mass almost achieving 80% of the previous size. Therefore, I called the patient home and she came to the emergency department where the service was provided. At that time, I proceeded to work on the pigtail catheter after obtaining an informed consent and preparing and draping the area in the usual fashion. Unfortunately, the catheter was open. I did not have a drainage system at that time. So, I withdrew directly with a syringe 700 mL of clear fluid. The system was connected to the draining bag, and the patient was instructed to keep a log and how to use equipment. She was given an appointment to see me in the office next Monday, which is three days from now."
156,Gastroenterology," PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: Following premedication with Vistaril 50 mg and Atropine 0.4 mg IM, the patient received Versed 5.0 mg intravenously after Cetacaine spray to the posterior palate. The Olympus video gastroscope was then introduced into the upper esophagus and passed by direct vision to the descending duodenum. The upper, mid and lower portions of the esophagus; the lesser and greater curves of the stomach; anterior and posterior walls; body and antrum; pylorus; duodenal bulb; and duodenum were all normal. No evidence of friability, ulceration or tumor mass was encountered. The instrument was withdrawn to the antrum, and biopsies taken for CLO testing, and then the instrument removed."
157,Neurology," CC: Difficulty with word finding. HX: This 27y/o RHF experienced sudden onset word finding difficulty and slurred speech on the evening of 2/19/96. She denied any associated dysphagia, diplopia, numbness or weakness of her extremities. She went to sleep with her symptoms on 2/19/96, and awoke with them on 2/20/96. She also awoke with a headache (HA) and mild neck stiffness. She took a shower and her HA and neck stiffness resolved. Throughout the day she continued to have difficulty with word finding and had worsening of her slurred speech. That evening, she began to experience numbness and weakness in the lower right face. She felt like there was a &quot;rubber-band&quot; wrapped around her tongue. For 3 weeks prior to presentation, she experienced transient episodes of a &quot;boomerang&quot; shaped field cut in the left eye. The episodes were not associated with any other symptoms. One week prior to presentation, she went to a local ER for menorrhagia. She had just resumed taking oral birth control pills one week prior to the ER visit after having stopped their use for several months. Local evaluation included an unremarkable carotid duplex scan. However, a HCT with and without contrast reportedly revealed a left frontal gyriform enhancing lesion. An MRI brain scan on 2/20/96 revealed nonspecific white matter changes in the right periventricular region. EEG reportedly showed diffuse slowing. CRP was reportedly &quot;too high&quot; to calibrate. MEDS: Ortho-Novum 7-7-7 (started 2/3/96), and ASA (started 2/20/96). PMH: 1)ventral hernia repair 10 years ago, 2)mild &quot;concussion&quot; suffered during a MVA; without loss of consciousness, 5/93, 3) Anxiety disorder, 4) One childbirth. FHX: She did not know her father and was not in contact with her mother. SHX: Lives with boyfriend. Smokes one pack of cigarettes every three days and has done so for 10 years. Consumes 6 bottles of beers, one day a week. Unemployed and formerly worked at an herbicide plant. EXAM: BP150/79, HR77, RR22, 37.4C. MS: A&O to person, place and time. Speech was dysarthric with mild decreased fluency marked by occasional phonemic paraphasic errors. Comprehension, naming and reading were intact. She was able to repeat, though her repetition was occasionally marked by phonemic paraphasic errors. She had no difficulty with calculation. CN: VFFTC, Pupils 5/5 decreasing to 3/3. EOM intact. No papilledema or hemorrhages seen on fundoscopy. No RAPD or INO. There was right lower facial weakness. Facial sensation was intact, bilaterally. The rest of the CN exam was unremarkable. MOTOR: 5/5 strength throughout with normal muscle bulk and tone. Sensory: No deficits. Coord/Station/Gait: unremarkable. Reflexes 2/2 throughout. Plantar responses were flexor, bilaterally. Gen Exam: unremarkable. COURSE: CRP 1.2 (elevated), ESR 10, RF 20, ANA 1:40, ANCA &lt;1:40, TSH 2.0, FT4 1.73, Anticardiolipin antibody IgM 10.8GPL units (normal &lt;10.9), Anticardiolipin antibody IgG 14.8GPL (normal&lt;22.9), SSA and SSB were normal. Urine beta-hCG pregnancy and drug screen were negative. EKG, CXR and UA were negative. MRI brain, 2/21/96 revealed increased signal on T2 imaging in the periventricular white matter region of the right hemisphere. In addition, there were subtle T2 signal changes in the right frontal, right parietal, and left parietal regions as seen previously on her local MRI can. In addition, special FLAIR imaging showed increased signal in the right frontal region consistent with ischemia. She underwent Cerebral Angiography on 2/22/96. This revealed decreased flow and vessel narrowing the candelabra branches of the RMCA supplying the right frontal lobe. These changes corresponded to the areas of ischemic changes seen on MRI. There was also segmental narrowing of the caliber of the vessels in the circle of Willis. There was a small aneurysm at the origin of the LPCA. There was narrowing in the supraclinoid portion of the RICA and the proximal M1 and A1 segments. The study was highly suggestive of vasculitis. 2/23/96, Neuro-ophthalmology evaluation revealed no evidence of retinal vasculitic change. Neuropsychologic testing the same day revealed slight impairment of complex attention only. She was started on Prednisone 60mg qd and Tagamet 400mg qhs. On 2/26/96, she underwent a right frontal brain biopsy. Pathologic evaluation revealed evidence of focal necrosis (stroke/infarct), but no evidence of vasculitis. Immediately following the brain biopsy, while still in the recovery room, she experienced sudden onset right hemiparesis and transcortical motor type aphasia. Initial HCT was unremarkable. An EEG was consistent with a focal lesion in the left hemisphere. However, a 2/28/96 MRI brain scan revealed new increased signal on T2 weighted images in a gyriform pattern from the left precentral gyrus to the superior frontal gyrus. This was felt consistent with vasculitis. She began q2month cycles of Cytoxan (1,575mg IV on 2/29/96. She became pregnant after her 4th cycle of Cytoxan, despite warnings to the contrary. After extensive discussions with OB/GYN it was recommended she abort the pregnancy. She underwent neuropsychologic testing which revealed no significant cognitive deficits. She later agreed to the abortion. She has undergone 9 cycles of Cytoxan ( one cycle every 2 months) as of 4/97. She had complained of one episode of paresthesias of the LUE in 1/97. MRI then showed no new signs ischemia."
158,Neurology," REASON FOR VISIT: Ms. ABC is a 67-year-old woman with adult hydrocephalus who returns to clinic for a routine evaluation. She comes to clinic by herself. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: She has been followed for her hydrocephalus since 2002. She also had an anterior cervical corpectomy and fusion from C3 though C5 in March 2007. She was last seen by us in clinic in March 2008 and she was experiencing little bit of head fullness and ringing in the ears at that time; however, we decided to leave her shunt setting at 1.0. We wanted her to followup with Dr. XYZ regarding the MRI of the cervical spine. Today, she tells me that with respect to her bladder last week she had some episodes of urinary frequency, however, this week she is not experiencing the same type of episodes. She reports no urgency, incontinence, and feels that she completely empties her bladder when she goes. She does experience some leakage with coughing. She wears the pad on a daily basis. She does not think that her bladder has changed much since we saw her last. With respect to her thinking and memory, she reports no problems at this time. She reports no headaches at this time. With respect to her walking and balance, she says that it feels worse. In the beginning of May, she had a coughing spell and at that time she developed buttock pain, which travels down the legs. She states that her leg often feel like elastic and she experiences a tingling radiculopathy. She says that this tingling is constant and at times painful. She feels that she is walking slower for this reason. She does not use the cane at this time. Most of the time, she is able to walk over uneven surfaces. She is able to walk up and down stairs and has no trouble getting in and out of a car. MEDICATIONS: Rhinocort 32 mg two sprays a day, Singulair 10 mg once a day, Xyzal 5 mg in the morning, Spiriva once a day, Advair twice a day, Prevacid 30 mg twice a day, Os-Cal 500 mg once a day, multivitamin once a day, and aspirin 81 mg a day. MAJOR FINDINGS: On exam today, this is a pleasant 67-year-old woman who comes back from the clinic waiting area with little difficulty. She is well developed, well nourished, and kempt. The shunt site is clean, dry, and intact and confirmed at a setting of 1.0. Mental Status: Assessed and appears intact for orientation, recent and remote memory, attention span, concentration, language, and fund of knowledge. Her Mini-Mental Status exam score was 26/30 when attention was tested with calculations and 30/30 when attention was tested with spelling. Cranial Nerves: Extraocular movements are somewhat inhibited. She does not display any nystagmus at this time. Facial movement, hearing, head turning, tongue, and palate movement are all intact. Gait: Assessed using the Tinetti assessment tool, which showed a balance score of 13/16 and a gait score of 11/12 for a total score of 24/28. ASSESSMENT: Ms. ABC has been experiencing difficulty with walking over the past several months. PROBLEMS/DIAGNOSES: 1. Hydrocephalus. 2. Cervical stenosis and retrolisthesis. 3. Neuropathy in the legs. PLAN: Before we recommend anything more, we would like to get a hold of the notes from Dr. XYZ to try to come up with a concrete plan as to what we can do next for Ms. ABC. We believe that her walking is most likely not being effected by the hydrocephalus. We would like to see her back in clinic in two and a half months or so. We also talked to her about having her obtain cane training so that she knows how to properly use her cane, which she states she does have one. I suggested that she use the cane at her on discretion."
159,Neurology," EXAM:MRI CERVICAL SPINE CLINICAL: A57-year-old male. Received for outside consultation is an MRI examination performed on 11/28/2005. FINDINGS: Normal brainstem-cervical cord junction. Normal cisterna magna with no tonsillar ectopia. Normal clivus with a normal craniovertebral junction. Normal anterior atlantoaxial articulation. C2-3: Normal intervertebral disc with no spondylosis or uncovertebral joint arthrosis. Normal central canal and intervertebral neural foramina with no cord or radicular impingement.

161,Neurology," CC: Decreasing visual acuity. HX: This 62 y/o RHF presented locally with a 2 month history of progressive loss of visual acuity, OD. She had a 2 year history of progressive loss of visual acuity, OS, and is now blind in that eye. She denied any other symptomatology. Denied HA. PMH: 1) depression. 2) Blind OS MEDS: None. SHX/FHX: unremarkable for cancer, CAD, aneurysm, MS, stroke. No h/o Tobacco or ETOH use. EXAM: T36.0, BP121/85, HR 94, RR16 MS: Alert and oriented to person, place and time. Speech fluent and unremarkable. CN: Pale optic disks, OU. Visual acuity: 20/70 (OD) and able to detect only shadow of hand movement (OS). Pupils were pharmacologically dilated earlier. The rest of the CN exam was unremarkable. MOTOR: 5/5 throughout with normal bulk and tone. Sensory: no deficits to LT/PP/VIB/PROP. Coord: FNF-RAM-HKS intact bilaterally. Station: No pronator drift. Gait: ND Reflexes: 3/3 BUE, 2/2 BLE. Plantar responses were flexor bilaterally. Gen Exam: unremarkable. No carotid/cranial bruits. COURSE: CT Brain showed large, enhancing 4 x 4 x 3 cm suprasellar-sellar mass without surrounding edema. Differential dx: included craniopharyngioma, pituitary adenoma, and aneurysm. MRI Brain findings were consistent with an aneurysm. The patient underwent 3 vessel cerebral angiogram on 12/29/92. This clearly revealed a supraclinoid giant aneurysm of the left internal carotid artery. Ten minutes following contrast injection the patient became aphasic and developed a right hemiparesis. Emergent HCT showed no evidence of hemorrhage or sign of infarct. Emergent carotid duplex showed no significant stenosis or clot. The patient was left with an expressive aphasia and right hemiparesis. SPECT scans were obtained on 1/7/93 and 2/24/93. They revealed hypoperfusion in the distribution of the left MCA and decreased left basal-ganglia perfusion which may represent in part a mass effect from the LICA aneurysm. She was discharged home and returned and underwent placement of a Selverstone Clamp on 3/9/93. The clamp was gradually and finally closed by 3/14/93. She did well, and returned home. On 3/20/93 she developed sudden confusion associated with worsening of her right hemiparesis and right expressive aphasia. A HCT then showed SAH around her aneurysm, which had thrombosed. She was place on Nimodipine. Her clinical status improved; then on 3/25/93 she rapidly deteriorated over a 2 hour period to the point of lethargy, complete expressive aphasia, and right hemiplegia. An emergent HCT demonstrated a left ACA and left MCA infarction. She required intubation and worsened as cerebral edema developed. She was pronounced brain dead. Her organs were donated for transplant."
162,Neurology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Rule out temporal arteritis. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Rule out temporal arteritis. PROCEDURE: Bilateral temporal artery biopsy. ANESTHESIA: Local anesthesia 1% Xylocaine with epinephrine. INDICATIONS: I was consulted by Dr. X for this patient with bilateral temporal headaches to rule out temporal arteritis. I explained fully the procedure to the patient. PROCEDURE: Both sides were done exactly the same way. After 1% Xylocaine infiltration, a 2 to 3-cm incision was made over the temporal artery. The temporal artery was identified and was grossly normal on both sides. Proximal and distal were ligated with both of 3-0 silk suture and Hemoccult. The specimen of temporal artery was taken from both sides measuring at least 2 to 3 cm. They were sent as separate specimens, right and left labeled. The wound was then closed with interrupted 3-0 Monocryl subcuticular sutures and Dermabond. She tolerated the procedure well."
163,Neurology," REASON FOR REFERRAL: Ms. A is a 60-year-old African-American female with 12 years of education who was referred for neuropsychological evaluation by Dr. X after she demonstrated mild cognitive deficits on a neuropsychological screening evaluation during a followup appointment with him for stroke in July. A comprehensive evaluation was requested to assess current cognitive functioning and assist with diagnostic decisions and treatment planning. RELEVANT BACKGROUND INFORMATION: Historical information was obtained from a review of available medical records and clinical interview with Ms. A. A summary of pertinent information is presented below. Please refer to the patient's medical chart for a more complete history. HISTORY OF PRESENTING PROBLEM: Ms. A presented to the ABC Hospital emergency department on 07/26/2009 reporting that after she had woken up that morning she noticed numbness and weakness in her left hand, slurred speech, and left facial droop. Neurological evaluation with Dr. X confirmed left hemiparesis. Brain CT showed no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect and that she received TPA and had moderate improvement in left-sided weakness. These symptoms were thought to be due to a right middle cerebral artery stroke. She was transferred to the ICU for monitoring. Ultrasound of the carotids showed 20% to 30% stenosis of the right ICA and 0% to 19% stenosis of the left ICA. On 07/29/2009, she was admitted for acute inpatient rehabilitation for the treatment of residual functional deficits of her acute ischemic right MCA/CVA. At discharge on 08/06/2009, she was mainly on supervision for all ADLs and walking with a rolling walker, but tolerating increased ambulation with a cane. She was discharged home with recommendations for outpatient physical therapy. She returned to the Sinai ER on 08/2009/2009 due to reported left arm pain, numbness, and weakness, which lasted 10 to 15 minutes and she reported that it felt &quot;just like the stroke.&quot; Brain CT on 08/2009/2009 was read as showing &quot;mild chronic microvascular ischemic change of deep white matter,&quot; but no acute or significant interval change compared to her previous scan. Neurological examination with Dr. Y was within normal limits, but she was admitted for a more extensive workup. Due to left arm pain an ultrasound was completed on her left upper extremity, but it did not show deep vein thrombosis. Followup CT on 08/10/2009 showed no significant interval change. MRI could not be completed due to the patient's weight. She was discharged on 08/11/2009 in stable condition after it was determined that this event was not neurological in origin; however, note that Ms. A referred to this as a second stroke. Ms. A presented for a followup outpatient neurological evaluation with Dr. X on 09/22/2009, at which time a brief neuropsychological screening was also conducted. She demonstrated significant impairments in confrontation naming, abstract verbal reasoning, and visual and verbal memory and thus a more comprehensive evaluation was suggested due to her intent to return to her full-time work duty. During the current interview, Ms. A reported that she noticed mild memory problems including some difficultly remembering conversations, events, and at times forgetting to take her medications. She also reported mild difficulty finding words in conversation, solving novel problems and tasks (e.g. difficulty learning to use her camcorder), but overall denied significant cognitive deficits in attention, concentration, language or other areas of cognitive functioning. When asked about her return to work, she said that she was still on light duty due to limited physical activity because of residual left leg weakness. She reported that no one had indicated to her that she appeared less capable of performing her job duties, but said that she was also receiving fewer files to process and enter data into the computer at the Social Security Agency that she works at. Note also that she had some difficulty explaining exactly what her job involved. She also reported having problems falling asleep at work and that she is working full-time although on light duty. OTHER MEDICAL HISTORY: As mentioned, Ms. A continues to have some residual left leg weakness and continues to use a rolling walker for ambulation, but she reported that her motor functioning had improved significantly. She was diagnosed with sleep apnea approximately two years ago and was recently counseled by Dr. X on the need to use her CPAP because she indicated she never used it at night. She reported that since her appointment with Dr. X, she has been using it &quot;every other night.&quot; When asked about daytime fatigue, Ms. A initially denied that she was having any difficulties, but repeatedly indicated that she was falling asleep at work and thought that it was due to looking at a computer screen. She reported at times &quot;snoring&quot; and forgetting where she is at and said that a supervisor offered to give her coffee at one point. She receives approximately two to five hours of sleep per night. Other current untreated risk factors include obesity and hypercholesterolemia. Her medical history is also significant for hypertension, asthma, abdominal adenocarcinoma status post hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, colonic benign polyps status post resection, benign lesions of the breast status post lumpectomy, and deep vein thrombosis in the left lower extremity status post six months of anticoagulation (which she had discontinued just prior to her stroke). CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 81 mg daily, Colace 100 mg b.i.d., Lipitor 80 mg daily, and albuterol MDI p.r.n. SUBSTANCE USE: Ms. A denied drinking alcohol or using illicit drugs. She used to smoke a pack of cigarettes per day, but quit five to six years ago. FAMILY MEDICAL HISTORY: Ms. A had difficulty providing information on familial medical history. She reported that her mother died three to four years ago from lung cancer. Her father has gout and blood clots. Siblings have reportedly been treated for asthma and GI tumors. She was unsure of familial history of other conditions such as hypertension, high cholesterol, stroke, etc. SOCIAL HISTORY: Ms. A completed high school degree. She reported that she primarily obtained B's and C's in school. She received some tutoring for algebra in middle school, but denied ever having been held back a grade failing any classes or having any problems with attention or hyperactivity. She currently works for the Social Security Administration in data processing. As mentioned, she has returned to full-time work, but continues to perform only light duties due to her physical condition. She is now living on her own. She has never driven. She reported that she continues to perform ADLs independently such as cooking and cleaning. She lost her husband in 2005 and has three adult daughters. She previously reported some concerns that her children wanted her to move into assisted living, but she did not discuss that during this current evaluation. She also reported number of other family members who had recently passed away. She has returned to activities she enjoys such as quire, knitting, and cooking and plans to go on a cruise to the Bahamas at the end of October. PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY: Ms. A did not report a history of psychological or psychiatric treatment. She reported that her current mood was good, but did describe some anxiety and nervousness about various issues such as her return to work, her upcoming trip, and other events. She reported that this only &quot;comes and goes.&quot; TASKS ADMINISTERED: Clinical Interview Adult History Questionnaire Wechsler Test of Adult Reading (WTAR) Mini Mental Status Exam (MMSE) Cognistat Neurobehavioral Cognitive Status Examination Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS; Form XX) Mattis Dementia Rating Scale, 2nd Edition (DRS-2) Neuropsychological Assessment Battery (NAB) Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Third Edition (WAIS-III) Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Fourth Edition (WAIS-IV) Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI) Test of Variables of Attention (TOVA) Auditory Consonant Trigrams (ACT) Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT) Ruff 2 & 7 Selective Attention Test Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) Multilingual Aphasia Examination, Second Edition (MAE-II) Token Test Sentence Repetition Visual Naming Controlled Oral Word Association Spelling Test Aural Comprehension Reading Comprehension Boston Naming Test, Second Edition (BNT-2) Animal Naming Test Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT: F-A-S) The Beery-Buktenica Developmental Test of Visual-Motor Integration (VMI) The Beery-Buktenica Developmental Test of Motor Coordination The Beery-Buktenica Developmental Test of Visual Perception Hooper Visual Organization Test (VOT) Judgment of Line Orientation (JOLO) Rey Complex Figure Test (RCFT) Wechsler Memory Scale, Third Edition (WMS-III) Wechsler Memory Scale, Fourth Edition (WMS-IV) California Verbal Learning Test, Second Edition (CVLT-II) Rey Auditory-Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (D-KEFS) Trail Making Test Verbal Fluency (Letter & Category) Design Fluency Color-Word Interference Test Tower Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) Stroop Color-Word Test Color Trails Trail Making Test A & B Wide Range Achievement Test, Fourth Edition (WRAT-IV) Woodcock Johnson Tests of Achievement, Third Edition (WJ-III) Nelson-Denny Reading Test Grooved Pegboard Purdue Pegboard Finger Tapping Test Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) Mood Assessment Scale (MAS) State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, Second Edition (MMPI-2) Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory, Third Edition (MCMI-III) Millon Behavioral Medicine Diagnostic (MBMD) Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) Adaptive Behavior Assessment System, Second Edition (ABAS-II) BEHAVIORAL OBSERVATIONS: Ms. A arrived alone and on time for her appointment. She walked with a cane and was short of breath while walking. No other significant psychomotor abnormalities were noted. Vision and hearing appeared to be adequate for testing, although she did indicate that she needed to update her eyeglass prescription. She was appropriately dressed and groomed. Rapport was easily established and eye contact was appropriate. She was oriented to person and place, but not fully oriented to time as she said that it was Monday rather than Tuesday. She was very talkative and speech tended to be somewhat disorganized and circumstantial. She had difficulty answering questions in a concise and succinct manner with notable difficulties in generalizing her experience (e.g. tended to respond to general questions in a very specific manner with a high level of detail). She would at times talk while completing tasks and was reminded to focus on the task at hand. Receptive language abilities appeared to be within broad normal limits as she was able to appropriately respond to the examiner's questions and instructions. Thought processes were somewhat circumstantial as already noted, but no overt thought disturbances were noted. Mood appeared to be euthymic. Affect was full ranged. She was noted to be somewhat impulsive and disinhibited and the vowel receptive language abilities were intact. In general, she had difficulty responding to more abstract or general questions. She was noted to be very tired throughout the evaluation. She said that she fell asleep during a sustained attention task, although this was not noted by the examiner. The examiner did observe her falling asleep at points during task instructions and she also slept in the lobby throughout lunchtime and had to be awoken to resume testing. Her fatigue likely affected her performance on certain tasks. Overall, Ms. A appeared to put full effort into all the tasks during this evaluation although as noted her fatigue likely impacted her performance to some degree and these test results will be interpreted with that in mind. The patient did not recognize this examiner when she returned for this evaluation. GENERAL COGNITIVE ABILITY: Premorbid intellectual functioning as assessed with the word reading test fell in the average to low average range. Her performances on measures assessing current intellectual functioning suggested some weaknesses in stored verbal knowledge and both verbal and visual abstract reasoning (all borderline). Visuospatial construction was in the low average range. ATTENTION: Ms. A demonstrated weaknesses in certain aspects of attention and concentration. For auditory verbal information, she was able to accurately process basic immediate information, but had more difficulty when active attentional abilities were required and she had to manipulate information in mind. On visually-based tasks, again simple attentional abilities such as visual scanning and basic processing of information were within the average range; however, it was noted that there was a trade-off between speed and accuracy in her performances on more complex attentional tasks that required greater levels of focus as she tended to complete the task slowly in order to accurately discriminate between target and nontarget visual stimuli. On a visual sustained attention task, her overall number of errors and response rate were within broad normal limits, but it was noted that her response speed slowed and the accuracy of her responses became less consistent as the test progressed suggesting weaknesses in vigilance. It was also noted that she was slower to respond and there was more variability in response accuracy when stimuli were presented with longer interstimulus intervals suggesting some weaknesses in arousal and activation when information was presented at a slower rate. Taking together these results highlight deficits in working memory (e.g. complex attention and mental manipulation), sustained attention and vigilance while her more basic and immediate attentional abilities were within broad normal limits. Fatigue was likely a factor in these results. It is unlikely that Ms. A actually fell asleep during this task as her error rate is not very high; however, there were noted decreases in measures that are sensitive to arousal and activation. INFORMATION PROCESSING SPEED: As mentioned, Ms. A tended to perform within expected limits on brief verbal and visual tasks that involved basic processing. She had more difficulty maintaining consistency in her response rate and tended to become slower on tasks that require sustained attention and more complex discrimination of stimuli. LANGUAGE: Confrontation naming was in the impaired range, but this may be in part due to lack of familiarity with certain objects given her weak performance on tasks assessing stored verbal knowledge. Minor errors were noted on sentence repetition task, but this may be due to weaknesses in attention and working memory. Similarly, her low average performance on a verbal comprehension task may have been due to some weaknesses in vigilance as she was noted to fall asleep at times during this task. Verbal fluency for both phonemic and semantic cues was within the average range. As taken together some weaknesses in aspects of language appear to have been due to limitations in attention and verbal knowledge store. VISUOSPATIAL PERCEPTION AND ORGANIZATION: Ms. A performed within the average range and within expected limits on visuospatial construction tasks that involved matching to a sample using either blocks or drawing; however, she had notable difficulties when we attempted to assess her perception of angular line orientations. These results suggest some reliance on external cues and information for accurate interpretation of visuospatial stimuli and difficulty with perception when such cues are not present to structure her perception. Note that fatigue may have also been a factor here as well. LEARNING & MEMORY SKILLS: VERBAL LEARNING AND MEMORY: On contextual memory task (i.e. stories), Ms. A performed in the borderline range in immediate recall. Following a delay, she retained 62% of the information that she originally learned and recall was again in the borderline range. Delayed recognition was low average. On a task assessing her ability to learn large amounts of seemingly unorganized information (i.e. list), her initial acquisition of information was in the low average range. With repetition, her performance improved and her overall immediate learning fell in the average range. Following a short delay, she was only able to spontaneously recall about a third of the information that she had initially learned and her overall performance fell in the borderline range. With cueing, she was able to recall more information, but relative to her same age peers this performance still fell in the borderline range. Recall following a long delay was in the borderline to low average range and recognition was borderline as she did not recognize a number of the original target stimuli. Of note, she made a number of repetitions and intrusion errors some of which were semantically related to the list target items and were repeatedly given suggesting some difficulty in correcting her responses with feedback and in monitoring or organizing her responses. Taken together these results highlight difficulties in learning large amounts of verbal information due primarily to difficulties with the initial organizing or learning of the information, although some weaknesses in retrieval were also noted. These results are likely due to the above noted attention and working memory deficits as she was able to at least recognize most of the information that she had initially learned. NON-VERBAL/VISUAL LEARNING AND MEMORY: Ms. A's initial recall of the details in spatial location of the series of visual designs is in the low average range. She retained most of this information following a delay with recall and recognition falling in the average range. Immediate recall of a complex figure drawing was in the average range. Following a 30-minute delay, she retained most of this information although statistically her result fell in the low average range. Recognition of the individual component parts of the larger figure fell in the low average range. Taken together these results suggest that Ms. A was mildly limited in the amount of information that she could initially learn, but the fact that she was able to retain most of that information over time suggests that any difficulties in learning visual information occurred during initial encoding. This pattern of results is similar to those found for verbal information. EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONING: Ms. A performed within the low average-to-average range on tasks assessing verbal fluency, cognitive set shifting, and inhibition of prepotent responses; however, it should be noted that Ms. A made a number of errors on these tasks particularly for inhibition, although she was able to successfully correct those errors. Across tasks and during interactions it was noted that Ms. A had some weaknesses in organization. Visual and verbal abstract reasoning were in the borderline range and deficits in working memory were noted. Taken together these results highlight some weaknesses in executive functioning. MOTOR/PSYCHOMOTOR FUNCTIONING: Ms. A performed in the impaired range with her dominant right hand and her nondominant hand on a task assessing speeded fine motor coordination. EMOTIONAL FUNCTIONING: Ms. A's overall score on a self-report effective screening measure suggested that she is currently experiencing mild levels of depression. She endorsed symptoms related to dysphoria, anxiety, lack of energy, anhedonia, hopelessness, and cognitive problems. SUMMARY & IMPRESSIONS: Ms. A was referred for a neuropsychological evaluation by Dr. X, M.D. to follow up noted cognitive weaknesses following a right middle cerebral artery stroke that was seen on a neuropsychological screening. Test results suggested that Ms. A was premorbidly performing in the low average to average range. Based on this estimate, she performed within expected limits on tasks assessing immediate attention and speed for processing brief, simple, and straightforward information. Most aspects of language (i.e. repetition, comprehension, and fluency), and visuospatial construction (i.e. matching to sample). Deficits were seen primarily in the areas of complex attention or working memory and sustained attention. She had difficulty mentally manipulating information in mind and on longer task that required focus. She demonstrated poor vigilance, difficulty with discrimination of stimuli, and declines in arousal and activation. These attentional deficits affected her ability to learn verbal and visual information. Weaknesses in executive functioning were also noted based on her performances across tasks as well as behavioral observations as she demonstrated weaknesses in abstract thinking, organization, inhibition, and behavioral and response regulation. Combined with the deficits seen for fine motor skills, these results are consistent with frontal subcortical changes as were seen on her CAT scan. In addition, Ms. A demonstrated some difficulty completing a task that involved interpreting directionally based visuospatial stimuli in the absence of other cues to aid with perception and these findings may be consistent with the involvement of the right hemisphere in her recent stroke; however, given that no MRI was conducted it is difficult to say whether or not there are specific regions of infarct in her right hemisphere. Overall, these results are consistent with those seen on her recent neuropsychological screening. This evaluation was requested in order to further clarify those results. As noted above, Ms. A does have a number of areas of deficit; however, these results do not support a dementing process at this time. The pattern of findings as mentioned are consistent with subcortical changes, but may also be secondary to her poorly treated sleep apnea as she was noticeably tired and particular deficits were noticed on tasks that required complex or sustained attention. Thus it will be important for Ms. A to increase compliance with treatment for sleep apnea and also to ensure that other cardiovascular risk factors are monitored and controlled through diet, exercise, and medication. Given that she is working full-time and these cognitive deficits could create significant problems on the job, it will be important that Ms. A address these issues while she is still completing a lighter load at work. Additional recommendations are provided below. RECOMMENDATIONS: 1. It is imperative that Ms. A address her sleep apnea and comply consistently i.e. every evening with wearing her CPAP. Given that she continues to complain about it and report the claustrophobia prevents her from using it regularly, Ms. A should see a sleep specialist in order to determine alternate ways to address this problem. 2. Ms. A reported mild levels of depression and anxiety on this evaluation and it was previously recommended that she contact XYZ to inquire about counseling and management of multiple life stressors. 3. Ms. A should see an ophthalmologist to update her eyeglass prescription. It may have contributed to the noted deficits on one visuospatial task. 4. Continued PT and home exercises I recommended to improve physical abilities. 5. Ms. A is likely not obtaining enough physical exercise and it is suggested that she work with her physical therapist and primary care physician to determine exercise regimen in order to help her lose weight. 6. The following recommendations are provided to aid Ms. A with the noted difficulties with attention and memory. She may also benefit from cognitive therapy in order to learn to apply these strategies at work. 7. Ms. A's cardio and cerebrovascular risk factors should be closely monitored and the results of this evaluation should be shared with all of her physicians. Thank you for referring this interesting patient for evaluation. A neuropsychological reevaluation is recommended in one to two years in order to monitor cognitive functioning. Reevaluation should occur earlier if there is any worsening of cognitive functioning."
164,Neurology," REASON FOR EXAM: Left arm and hand numbness. TECHNIQUE: Noncontrast axial CT images of the head were obtained with 5 mm slice thickness. FINDINGS: There is an approximately 5-mm shift of the midline towards the right side. Significant low attenuation is seen throughout the white matter of the right frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes. There is loss of the cortical sulci on the right side. These findings are compatible with edema. Within the right parietal lobe, a 1.8 cm, rounded, hyperintense mass is seen. No hydrocephalus is evident. The calvarium is intact. The visualized paranasal sinuses are clear. IMPRESSION: A 5 mm midline shift to the left side secondary to severe edema of the white matter of the right frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes. A 1.8 cm high attenuation mass in the right parietal lobe is concerning for hemorrhage given its high density. A postcontrast MRI is required for further characterization of this mass. Gradient echo imaging should be obtained."

167,Neurology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Brain tumor left temporal lobe. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Brain tumor left temporal lobe - glioblastoma multiforme. OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: 1. Left temporal craniotomy. 2. Removal of brain tumor. OPERATING MICROSCOPE: Stealth. PROCEDURE: The patient was placed in the supine position, shoulder roll, and the head was turned to the right side. The entire left scalp was prepped and draped in the usual fashion after having being placed in 2-point skeletal fixation. Next, we made an inverted-U fashion base over the asterion over temporoparietal area of the skull. A free flap was elevated after the scalp that was reflected using the burr hole and craniotome. The bone flap was placed aside and soaked in the bacitracin solution. The dura was then opened in an inverted-U fashion. Using the Stealth, we could see that this large cystic mass was just below the cortex in the white matter just anterior to the trigone of the ventricle. We head through the vein of Labbe, and we made great care to preserve this. We saw where the tumor almost made to the surface. Here we made a small corticectomy using the Stealth for guidance. We left small corticectomy entered large cavity with approximately 15 cc of yellowish necrotic liquid. This was submitted to pathology. We biopsied this very abnormal tissue and submitted it to pathology. They gave us a frozen section diagnosis of glioblastoma multiforme. With the operating microscope and Greenwood bipolar forceps, we then systematically debulked this tumor. It was very vascular and we really continued to remove this tumor until all visible tumors was removed. We appeared to get two gliotic planes circumferentially. We could see it through the ventricle. After removing all visible tumor grossly, we then irrigated this cavity multiple times and obtained meticulous hemostasis and then closed the dura primarily with 4-0 Nurolon sutures with the piece of DuraGen placed over this in order to increase our chances for a good watertight seal. The bone flap was then replaced and sutured with the Lorenz titanium plate system. The muscle fascia galea was closed with interrupted 2-0 Vicryl sutures. Skin staples were used for skin closure. The blood loss of the operation was about 200 cc. There were no complications of the surgery per se. The needle count, sponge count, and the cottonoid count were correct. COMMENT: Operating microscope was quite helpful in this; as we could use the light as well as the magnification to help us delineate the brain tumor - gliotic interface and while it was vague at sometimes we could I think clearly get a good cleavage plane in most instances so that we got a gross total removal of this very large and necrotic-looking tumor of the brain."
168,Neurology," PROCEDURE: Placement of left ventriculostomy via twist drill. PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Massive intraventricular hemorrhage with hydrocephalus and increased intracranial pressure. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Massive intraventricular hemorrhage with hydrocephalus and increased intracranial pressure. INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: The patient is a man with a history of massive intracranial hemorrhage and hydrocephalus with intraventricular hemorrhage. His condition is felt to be critical. In a desperate attempt to relieve increased intracranial pressure, we have proposed placing a ventriculostomy. I have discussed this with patient's wife who agrees and asked that we proceed emergently. After a sterile prep, drape, and shaving of the hair over the left frontal area, this area is infiltrated with local anesthetic. Subsequently a 1 cm incision was made over Kocher's point. Hemostasis was obtained. Then a twist drill was made over this area. Bones strips were irrigated away. The dura was perforated with a spinal needle. A Camino monitor was connected and zeroed. This was then passed into the left lateral ventricle on the first pass. Excellent aggressive very bloody CSF under pressure was noted. This stopped, slowed, and some clots were noted. This was irrigated and then CSF continued. Initial opening pressures were 30, but soon arose to 80 or a 100. The patient tolerated the procedure well. The wound was stitched shut and the ventricular drain was then connected to a drainage bag. Platelets and FFP as well as vitamin K have been administered and ordered simultaneously with the placement of this device to help prevent further clotting or bleeding."
169,Neurology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right frontotemporal chronic subacute subdural hematoma. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right frontotemporal chronic subacute subdural hematoma. TITLE OF THE OPERATION: Right frontotemporal craniotomy and evacuation of hematoma, biopsy of membranes, microtechniques. ASSISTANT: None. INDICATIONS: The patient is a 75-year-old man with a 6-week history of decline following a head injury. He was rendered unconscious by the head injury. He underwent an extensive syncopal workup in Mississippi. This workup was negative. The patient does indeed have a heart pacemaker. The patient was admitted to ABCD three days ago and yesterday underwent a CT scan, which showed a large appearance of subdural hematoma. There is a history of some bladder tumors and so a scan with contrast was obtained that showed some enhancement in the membranes. I decided to perform a craniotomy rather than burr hole drainage because of the enhancing membranes and the history of a bladder tumor undefined as well as layering of the blood within the cavity. The patient and the family understood the nature, indications, and risk of the surgery and agreed to go ahead. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the operating room where general and endotracheal anesthesia was obtained. The head was turned over to the left side and was supported on a cushion. There was a roll beneath the right shoulder. The right calvarium was shaved and prepared in the usual manner with Betadine-soaked scrub followed by Betadine paint. Markings were applied. Sterile drapes were applied. A linear incision was made more or less along the coronal suture extending from just above the ear up to near the midline. Sharp dissection was carried down into subcutaneous tissue and Bovie electrocautery was used to divide the galea and the temporalis muscle and fascia. Weitlaner retractors were inserted. A single bur hole was placed underneath the temporalis muscle. I placed the craniotomy a bit low in order to have better cosmesis. A cookie cutter type craniotomy was then carried out in dimensions about 5 cm x 4 cm. The bone was set aside. The dura was clearly discolored and very tense. The dura was opened in a cruciate fashion with a #15 blade. There was immediate flow of a thin motor oil fluid under high pressure. Literally the fluid shot out several inches with the first nick in the membranous cavity. The dura was reflected back and biopsy of the membranes was taken and sent for permanent section. The margins of the membrane were coagulated. The microscope was brought in and it was apparent there were septations within the cavity and these septations were for the most part divided with bipolar electrocautery. The wound was irrigated thoroughly and was inspected carefully for any sites of bleeding and there were none. The dura was then closed in a watertight fashion using running locking 4-0 Nurolon. Tack-up sutures had been placed at the beginning of the case and the bone flap was returned to the wound and fixed to the skull using the Lorenz plating system. The wound was irrigated thoroughly once more and was closed in layers. Muscle fascia and galea were closed in separate layers with interrupted inverted 2-0 Vicryl. Finally, the skin was closed with running locking 3-0 nylon. Estimated blood loss for the case was less than 30 mL. Sponge and needle counts were correct. FINDINGS: Chronic subdural hematoma with multiple septations and thickened subdural membrane. I might add that the arachnoid was not violated at all during this procedure. Also, it was noted that there was no subarachnoid blood but only subdural blood."
170,Neurology," EXAM: CT cervical spine (C-spine) for trauma. FINDINGS: CT examination of the cervical spine was performed without contrast. Coronal and sagittal reformats were obtained for better anatomical localization. Cervical vertebral body height, alignment and interspacing are maintained. There is no evidence of fractures or destructive osseous lesions. There are no significant degenerative endplate or facet changes. No significant osseous central canal or foraminal narrowing is present. IMPRESSION: Negative cervical spine."
171,Neurology," DATE OF EXAMINATION: Start: 12/29/2008 at 1859 hours. End: 12/30/2008 at 0728 hours. TOTAL RECORDING TIME: 12 hours, 29 minutes. PATIENT HISTORY: This is a 46-year-old female with a history of events concerning for seizures. The patient has a history of epilepsy and has also had non-epileptic events in the past. Video EEG monitoring is performed to assess whether it is epileptic seizures or non-epileptic events. VIDEO EEG DIAGNOSES 1. Awake: Normal. 2. Sleep: Activation of a single left temporal spike seen maximally at T3. 3. Clinical events: None. DESCRIPTION: Approximately 12 hours of continuous 21-channel digital video EEG monitoring was performed. During the waking state, there is a 9-Hz dominant posterior rhythm. The background of the record consists primarily of alpha frequency activity. At times, during the waking portion of the record, there appears to be excessive faster frequency activity. No activation procedures were performed. Approximately four hours of intermittent sleep was obtained. A single left temporal, T3, spike is seen in sleep. Vertex waves and sleep spindles were present and symmetric. The patient had no clinical events during the recording. CLINICAL INTERPRETATION: This is abnormal video EEG monitoring for a patient of this age due to the presence of a single left temporal spike seen during sleep. The patient had no clinical events during the recording period. Clinical correlation is required."
172,Neurology," CC: Seizure D/O HX: 29 y/o male with cerebral palsy, non-shunted hydrocephalus, spastic quadriplegia, mental retardation, bilateral sensory neural hearing loss, severe neurogenic scoliosis and multiple contractures of the 4 extremities, neurogenic bowel and bladder incontinence, and a history of seizures. He was seen for evaluation of seizures which first began at age 27 years, two years before presentation. His typical episodes consist of facial twitching (side not specified), unresponsive pupils, and moaning. The episodes last approximately 1-2 minutes in duration and are followed by post-ictal fatigue. He was placed on DPH, but there was no record of an EEG prior to presentation. He had had no seizure events in over 1 year prior to presentation while on DPH 100mg--O--200mg. He also complained of headaches for the past 10 years. BIRTH HX: Spontaneous Vaginal delivery at 36weeks gestation to a G2P1 mother. Birth weight 7#10oz. No instrumentation required. Labor = 11hours. &quot;Light gas anesthesia&quot; given. Apgars unknown. Mother reportedly had the &quot;flu&quot; in the 7th or 8th month of gestation. Patient discharged 5 days post-partum. Development: spoke first words between 1 and 2 years of age. Rolled side to side at age 2, but did not walk. Fed self with hands at age 2 years. Never toilet trained. PMH: 1)Hydrocephalus manifested by macrocephaly by age 2-3 months. Head circumference 50.5cm at 4 months of age (wide sutures and bulging fontanels). Underwent ventriculogram, age 4 months, which illustrated massive enlargement of the lateral ventricles and normal sized aqueduct and 4th ventricle. The cortex of the cerebral hemisphere was less than 1cm. in thickness; especially in the occipital regions where only a thin rim of tissue was left. Neurosurgical intervention was not attempted and the patient deemed inoperable at the time. By 31 months of age the patients head circumference was 68cm, at which point the head size arrested. Other problems mentioned above. SHX: institutionalized at age 18 years. FHX: unremarkable. EXAM: Vitals unknown. MS: awake with occasional use of intelligible but inappropriately used words. CN: Rightward beating nystagmus increase on leftward gaze. Right gaze preference. Corneal responses were intact bilaterally. Fundoscopic exam not noted. Motor: spastic quadriparesis. moves RUE more than other extremities. Sensory: withdrew to PP in 4 extremities. Coord: ND Station: ND Gait: ND, wheel chair bound. Reflexes: RUE 2+, LUE 3+, RLE 4+ with sustained cross adductor clonus in the right quadriceps. LLE 3+. Other: Macrocephaly (measurement not given). Scoliosis. Rest of general exam unremarkable except for numerous abdominal scars. COURSE: EEG 8/26/92: Abnormal with diffuse slowing and depressed background (left worse than right) and poorly formed background activity at 5-7hz. Right posterior sharp transients, and rhythmic delta-theta bursts from the right temporal region. The findings are consistent with diffuse cerebral dysfunction and underlying seizure tendency of multifocal origin."
173,Neurology," DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: 1. Bilateral lower extremity cellulitis secondary to bilateral tinea pedis. 2. Prostatic hypertrophy with bladder outlet obstruction. 3. Cerebral palsy. DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: The patient would be discharged on his usual Valium 10-20 mg at bedtime for spasticity, Flomax 0.4 mg daily, cefazolin 500 mg q.i.d., and Lotrimin cream between toes b.i.d. for an additional two weeks. He will be followed in the office. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a pleasant 62-year-old male with cerebral palsy. The patient was recently admitted to Hospital with lower extremity cellulitis. This resolved, however, recurred in both legs. Examination at the time of this admission demonstrated peeling of the skin and excoriation between all of his toes on both feet consistent with tinea pedis. PAST MEDICAL/FAMILY/SOCIAL HISTORY: As per the admission record. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: As per the admission record. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: As per the admission record. LABORATORY STUDIES: At the time of admission, his white blood cell count was 8200 with a normal differential, hemoglobin 13.6, hematocrit 40.6 with normal indices, and platelet count was 250,000. Comprehensive metabolic profile was unremarkable, except for a nonfasting blood sugar of 137, lactic acid was 0.8. Urine demonstrated 4-9 red blood cells per high-powered field with 2+ bacteria. Blood culture and wound cultures were unremarkable. Chest x-ray was unremarkable. HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the General Medical floor and treated with intravenous ceftriaxone and topical Lotrimin. On this regimen, his lower extremity edema and erythema resolved quite rapidly. Because of urinary frequency, a bladder scan was done suggesting about 600 cc of residual urine. A Foley catheter was inserted and was productive of approximately 500 cc of urine. The patient was prescribed Flomax 0.4 mg daily. 24 hours later, the Foley catheter was removed and a bladder scan demonstrated 60 cc of residual urine after approximately eight hours. At the time of this dictation, the patient was ambulating minimally, however, not sufficiently to resume independent living."
174,Neurology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Squamous cell carcinoma of right temporal bone/middle ear space. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Squamous cell carcinoma of right temporal bone/middle ear space. PROCEDURE: Right temporal bone resection; rectus abdominis myocutaneous free flap for reconstruction of skull base defect; right selective neck dissection zones 2 and 3. ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was brought into the operating room, placed on the table in supine position. General endotracheal anesthesia was obtained in the usual fashion. The Neurosurgery team placed the patient in pins and after they positioned the patient the right lateral scalp was prepped with Betadine after shave as well as the abdomen. The neck was prepped as well. After this was performed, I made a wide ellipse of the conchal bowl with the Bovie and cutting current down through the cartilage of the conchal bowl. A wide postauricular incision well beyond the mastoid tip extending into the right neck was then incised with the Bovie with the cutting current and a postauricular skin flap developed leaving the excise conchal bowl in place as the auricle was reflected over anterior to the condyle. After this was performed, I used the Bovie to incise the soft tissue around the temporal bone away from the tumor on to the mandible. The condyle was skeletonized so that it could be easily seen. The anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid was dissected out and the spinal accessory nerve was identified and spared. The neck contents to the hyoid were dissected out. The hypoglossal nerve, vagus nerve, and spinal accessory nerve were dissected towards the jugular foramen. The neck contents were removed as a separate specimen. The external carotid artery was identified and tied off as it entered the parotid and tied with a Hemoclip distally for the future anastomosis. A large posterior facial vein was identified and likewise clipped for later use. I then used the cutting and diamond burs to incise the skull above the external auditory canal so as to expose the dura underneath this and extended it posteriorly to the sigmoid sinus, dissecting or exposing the dura to the level of the jugular bulb. It became evident there was two tumor extending down the eustachian tube medial to the condyle and therefore I did use the router, I mean the side cutting bur to resect the condyle and the glenoid fossa to expose the medial extent of the eustachian tube. The internal carotid artery was dissected out of the parapharyngeal space into the carotid canal and I drilled carotid canal up until it made. I dissected the vertical segment of the carotid out as it entered the temporal bone until it made us turn to the horizontal portion. Once this was dissected out, Dr. X entered the procedure for completion of the resection with the craniotomy. For details, please see his operative note. After Dr. X had completed the resection, I then harvested the rectus free flap. A skin paddle was drawn out next to the umbilicus about 4 x 4 cm. The skin paddle was incised with the Bovie and down to the anterior rectus sheath. Sagittal incisions were made up superiorly and inferiorly to the skin paddle and the anterior rectus sheath dissected out above and below the skin paddle. The sheath was incised to the midline and a small ellipse was made around the fascia to provide blood supply to the overlying skin. The skin paddle was then sutured to the fascia and muscle with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl. The anterior rectus sheath was then reflected off the rectus muscle, which was then divided superiorly with the Bovie and reflected out of the rectus sheath to an inferior direction. The vascular pedicle could be seen entering the muscle in usual fashion. The muscle was divided inferior to the pedicle and then the pedicle was dissected to the groin to the external iliac artery and vein where it was ligated with two large Hemoclips on each vessel. The wound was then packed with saline impregnated sponges. The rectus muscle with attached skin paddle was then transferred into the neck. The inferior epigastric artery was sutured to the end of the external carotid with interrupted 9-0 Ethilon with standard microvascular technique. Ischemia time was less than 10 minutes. Likewise, the inferior epigastric vein was sutured to the end of the posterior facial vein with interrupted 9-0 Ethilon as well. There was excellent blood flow through the flap and there were no or any issues with the vascular pedicle throughout the remainder of the case. The wound was irrigated with copious amounts of saline. The eustachian tube was obstructed with bone wax. The muscle was then laid into position with the skin paddle underneath the conchal bowl. I removed most the skin of the conchal bowl de-epithelializing and leaving the fat in place. The wound was closed in layers overlying the muscle, which was secured superiorly to the muscle overlying the temporal skull. The subcutaneous tissues were closed with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl. The skin was closed with skin staples. There was small incision made in the postauricular skin where the muscle could be seen and the skin edges were sewn directly to the muscle as to the rectus muscle itself. The skin paddle was closed with interrupted 4-0 Prolene to the edges of the conchal bowl. The abdomen was irrigated with copious amounts of saline and the rectus sheath was closed with #1 Prolene with the more running suture, taking care to avoid injury to the posterior rectus sheath by the use of ribbon retractors. The subcutaneous tissues were closed with interrupted 2-0 Vicryl and skin was closed with skin staples. The patient was then turned over to the Neurosurgery team for awakening after the patient was appropriately awakened. The patient was then transferred to the PACU in stable condition with spontaneous respirations, having tolerated the procedure well."
175,Neurology," EEG during wakefulness demonstrates background activity consisting of beta rhythms in the 12- to 14-Hz range. Some EKG artifact is noted intermittently. The background activity appears to be bilaterally symmetric and consistent throughout. The recording time is 22 minutes and 57 seconds. There is some attenuation of the background activity during drowsiness. Some late sleep is recorded. Photic stimulation induced no abnormal changes in the record. No paroxysmal or focal abnormalities are seen in this recording. IMPRESSION: EEG during wakefulness, drowsiness, and sleep with synchronous video monitoring demonstrated no evidence of focal or epileptogenic activity."
176,Neurology," A 21-channel digital electroencephalogram is performed on the patient, predominantly in a drowsy and sleepy state. In brief periods of wakefulness, significant muscle artifact is noted bilaterally. With drowsiness, the recording slows, and with the sleep, vertex activity is noted. Recording is somewhat disorganized for age with intermixed theta and alpha activity. At times, higher voltage slowing is noted over the right compared to the left hemisphere head regions. Rare sharp wave activity is noted generally on the right over the C4 electrode, but rarely on the left over the T3 electrode. No spike-and-wave activity is noted. IMPRESSION: Abnormal electroencephalogram revealing generalized poorly organized slowing, with more prominent slowing noted at the right compared to the left hemisphere head regions and rare sharp wave activity noted bilaterally, somewhat more prevalent on the right. Clinical correlation is suggested."
177,Neurology," CC: Headache HX: 37 y/o RHF presented to her local physician with a one month history of intermittent predominantly left occipital headaches which were awakening her in the early morning hours. The headachese were dull to throbbing in character. She was initially treated with Parafon-forte for tension type headaches, but the pain did not resolve. She subsequently underwent HCT in early 12/90 which revealed a right frontal mass lesion. PMH: 1)s/p tonsillectomy. 2)s/p elective abortion. FHX: Mother with breast CA, MA with &quot;bone cancer.&quot; AODM both sides of family. SHX: Denied tobacco or illicit drug use. Rarely consumes ETOH. Married with 2 teenage children. EXAM: VItal signs unremarkable. MS: Alert and oriented to person, place, time. Lucid thought process per NSG note. CN: unremarkable. Motor: full strength with normal muscle bulk and tone. Sensory: unremarkable. Coordination: unremarkable. Station/Gait: unremarkable. Reflexes: unremarkable. Gen. Exam: unremarkable. COURSE: MRI Brain: large solid and cystic right frontal lobe mass with a large amount of surrounding edema. There is apparent tumor extension into the corpus callosum across the midline. Tumor extension is also suggested in the anterior limb of the interanl capsule on the right. There is midline mass shift to the left with effacement of the anterior horn of the right lateral ventricle. The MRI findings are most consistent with glioblastoma. The patient underwent right frontal lobectomy. The pathological diagnosis was xanthomatous astrocytoma. The literature at the time was not clear as to optimal treatment protocol. People have survived as long as 25 years after diagnosis with this type of tumor. XRT was deferred until 11/91 when an MRI and PET Scan suggested extension of the tumor. She then received 5580 cGy of XRT in divided segments. She developed olfactory auras shortly after lobectomy at was treated with PB with subsequent improvement. She was treated with BCNU chemotherapy protocol in 1992."
178,Neurology," ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS: Encephalopathy related to normal-pressure hydrocephalus. CHIEF COMPLAINT: Diminished function secondary to above. HISTORY: This pleasant gentleman was recently admitted to ABCD Medical Center and followed by the neurosurgical staff, including Dr. X, where normal-pressure hydrocephalus was diagnosed. He had a shunt placed and was stabilized medically. He has gotten a return of function to the legs and was started on some early therapy. Significant functional limitations have been identified and ongoing by the rehab admission team. Significant functional limitations have been ongoing. He will need to be near-independent at home for periods of time, and he is brought in now for rehabilitation to further address functional issues, maximize skills and safety and allow a safe disposition home. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Positive for prostate cancer, intermittent urinary incontinence and left hip replacement. ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies. CURRENT MEDICATIONS 1. Tylenol as needed. 2. Peri-Colace b.i.d. SOCIAL HISTORY: He is a nonsmoker and nondrinker. Prior boxer. He lives in a home where he would need to be independent during the day. Family relatives intermittently available. Goal is to return home to an independent fashion to that home setting. FUNCTIONAL HISTORY: Prior to admission was independent with activities of daily living and ambulatory skills. Presently, he has resumed therapies and noted to have supervision levels for most activities of daily living. Memory at minimal assist. Walking at supervision. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Negative for headaches, nausea, vomiting, fevers, chills, shortness of breath or chest pain currently. He has had some dyscoordination recently and headaches on a daily basis, most days, although the Tylenol does seem to control that pain. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION VITAL SIGNS: The patient is afebrile with vital signs stable. HEENT: Oropharynx clear, extraocular muscles are intact. CARDIOVASCULAR: Regular rate and rhythm, without murmurs, rubs or gallops. LUNGS: Clear to auscultation bilaterally. ABDOMEN: Nontender, nondistended, positive bowel sounds. EXTREMITIES: Without clubbing, cyanosis, or edema. The calves are soft and nontender bilaterally. NEUROLOGIC: No focal, motor or sensory losses through the lower extremities. He moves upper and lower extremities well. Bulk and tone normal in the upper and lower extremities. Cognitively showing intact with appropriate receptive and expressive skills. IMPRESSION 1. Normal-pressure hydrocephalus. 2. History of cervical spondylosis. 3. History of urinary incontinence. 4. History of prostate cancer. 5. History of left hip replacement. RECOMMENDATIONS: Given the significant functional limitations and medical comorbidities as noted, he is appropriate for inpatient rehabilitation stay to try and maximize functional skills and ensure a safe disposition home. Anticipated length of stay between 1 to 1-1/2 weeks. Prognosis good for independent disposition home within this time frame."
179,Neurology," TECHNIQUE: Sequential axial CT images were obtained through the cervical spine without contrast.

The vertebral body heights and disc spaces are maintained. The central canal is patent. The pedicles and posterior elements are intact. The paravertebral soft tissues are within normal limits. The atlanto-dens interval and the dens are intact. The visualized lung apices are clear. IMPRESSION: No acute abnormalities."
180,Neurology," REASON FOR VISIT: Mr. A is an 86-year-old man who returns for his first followup after shunt surgery. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: I have followed Mr. A since May 2008. He presented with eight to ten years of progressive gait impairment, cognitive impairment, and decreased bladder control. We established a diagnosis of adult hydrocephalus with the spinal catheter protocol in June of 2008 and Mr. A underwent shunt surgery performed by Dr. X on August 1st. A Medtronic Strata programmable shunt in the ventriculoperitoneal configuration programmed at level 2.0 was placed. Mr. A comes today with his daughter, Pam and together they give his history. Mr. A has had no hospitalizations or other illnesses since I last saw him. With respect to his walking, his daughter tells me that he is now able to walk to the dining room just fine, but could not before his surgery. His balance has improved though he still has some walking impairment. With respect to his bladder, initially there was some improvement, but he has leveled off and he wears a diaper. With respect to his cognition, both Pam and the patient say that his thinking has improved. The other daughter, Patty summarized it best according to two of them. She said, &quot;I feel like I can have a normal conversation with him again.&quot; Mr. A has had no headaches and no pain at the shunt site or at the abdomen. MEDICATIONS: Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d., metoprolol 25 mg p.o. q.d., Flomax 0.4 mg p.o. q.d., Zocor 20 mg p.o. q.d., Detrol LA 4 mg p.o. q.d., lisinopril 10 mg p.o. q.d., Imodium daily, Omega-3, fish oil, and Lasix. MAJOR FINDINGS: Mr. A is a pleasant and cooperative man who is able to converse easily though his daughter adds some details. Vital Signs: Blood pressure 124/80, heart rate is 64, respiratory rate is 18, weight 174 pounds, and pain is 0/10. The shunt site was clean, dry, and intact and confirmed at a setting of 2.0. Mental Status: Tested for recent and remote memory, attention span, concentration, and fund of knowledge. He scored 26/30 on the MMSE when tested with spelling and 25/30 when tested with calculations. Of note, he was able to get two of the three memory words with cuing and the third one with multiple choice. This was a slight improvement over his initial score of 23/30 with calculations and 24/30 with spelling and at that time he was unable to remember any memory words with cuing and only one with multiple choice. Gait: Tested using the Tinetti assessment tool. He was tested without an assistive device and received a gait score of 6-8/12 and a balance of score of 12/16 for a total score of 18-20/28. This has slightly improved from his initial score of 15-17/28. Cranial Nerves: Pupils are equal. Extraocular movements are intact. Face symmetric. No dysarthria. Motor: Normal for bulk and strength. Coordination: Slow for finger-to-nose. IMAGING: CT scan was reviewed from 10/15/2008. It shows a frontal horn span at the level of foramen of Munro of 4.6 cm with a 3rd ventricular contour that is flat with the span of 10 mm. By my reading, there is a tiny amount of blood in the right frontal region with just a tiny subdural collection. This was not noticed by the radiologist who stated no extraaxial fluid collections. There is also substantial small vessel ischemic change. ASSESSMENT: Mr. A has made some improvement since shunt surgery. PROBLEMS/DIAGNOSES: 1. Adult hydrocephalus (331.5). 2. Gait impairment (781.2). 3. Urinary incontinence and urgency (788.33). 4. Cognitive impairment (290.0). PLAN: I had a long discussion with Mr. A and his daughter. We are all pleased that he has started to make some improvement with his hydrocephalus because I believe I see a tiny fluid collection in the right parietal region, I would like to leave the setting at 2.0 for another three months before we consider changing the shunt. I do not believe that this tiny amount of fluid is symptotic and it was not documented by the radiologist when he read the CT scan. Mr. A asked me about whether he will be able to drive again. Unfortunately, I think it is unlikely that his speed of movement will improve to a level that he will be able to pass a driver's safety evaluation, however, occasionally patients surprise me by improving enough over 9 to 12 months that they are able to pass such a test. I would certainly be happy to recommend such a test if I believe Mr. A is likely to pass it and he is always welcome to enroll in a driver's safety program without my recommendation, however, I think it is exceeding unlikely that he has the capability of passing this rigorous test at this time. I also think it is quite likely he will not regain sufficient speed of motion to pass such a test."
181,Neurology," X Y, MD City, State Dear Dr. Y: I had the pleasure of seeing ABC today back in Neurology Clinic where he has been followed previously by Dr. Z. His last visit was in June 2006, and he carries a diagnosis of benign rolandic epilepsy. To review, his birth was unremarkable. He is a second child born to a G3, P1 to 2 female. He has had normal development, and is a bright child in 7th grade. He began having seizures, however, at 9 years of age. It is manifested typically as generalized tonic-clonic seizures upon awakening or falling into sleep. He also had smaller spells with more focal convulsion and facial twitching. His EEGs have shown a pattern consistent with benign rolandic epilepsy (central temporal sharp waves both of the right and left hemisphere). Most recent EEG in May 2006 shows the same abnormalities. ABC initially was placed on Tegretol, but developed symptoms of toxicity (hallucinations) on this medication, he was switched to Trileptal. He has done very well taking 300 mg twice a day without any further seizures. His last event was the day of his last EEG when he was sleep deprived and was off medication. That was a convulsion lasting 5 minutes. He has done well otherwise. Parents deny that he has any problems with concentration. He has not had any behavior issues. He is an active child and participates in sports and some motocross activities. He has one older sibling and he lives with his parents. Father manages Turkey farm with foster farms. Mother is an 8th grade teacher. Family history is positive for a 3rd cousin, who has seizures, but the specific seizure type is not known. There is no other relevant family history. Review of systems is positive for right heel swelling and tenderness to palpation. This is perhaps due to sports injury. He has not sprained his ankle and does not have any specific acute injury around the time that this was noted. He does also have some discomfort in the knees and ankles in the general sense with activities. He has no rashes or any numbness, weakness or loss of skills. He has no respiratory or cardiovascular complaints. He has no nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or abdominal complaints. Past medical history is otherwise unremarkable. Other workup includes CT scan and MRI scan of the brain, which are both normal. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: GENERAL: The patient is a well-nourished, well-hydrated male in no acute distress. VITAL SIGNS: His weight today is 80.6 pounds. Height is 58-1/4 inches. Blood pressure 113/66. Head circumference 36.3 cm. HEENT: Atraumatic, normocephalic. Oropharynx shows no lesions. NECK: Supple without adenopathy. CHEST: Clear auscultation. CARDIOVASCULAR: Regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs. ABDOMEN: Benign without organomegaly. EXTREMITIES: No clubbing, cyanosis or edema. NEUROLOGIC: The patient is alert and oriented. His cognitive skills appear normal for his age. His speech is fluent and goal-directed. He follows instructions well. His cranial nerves reveal his pupils equal, round, and reactive to light. Extraocular movements are intact. Visual fields are full. Disks are sharp bilaterally. Face moves symmetrically with normal sensation. Palate elevates midline. Tongue protrudes midline. Hearing is intact bilaterally. Motor exam reveals normal strength and tone. Sensation intact to light touch and vibration. His gait is nonataxic with normal heel-toe and tandem. Finger-to-nose, finger-nose-finger, rapid altering movements are normal. Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ and symmetric. IMPRESSION: This is an 11-year-old male with benign rolandic epilepsy, who is followed over the past 2 years in our clinic. Most recent electroencephalogram still shows abnormalities, but it has not been done since May 2006. The plan at this time is to repeat his electroencephalogram, follow his electroencephalogram annually until it reveres to normal. At that time, he will be tapered off of medication. I anticipate at some point in the near future, within about a year or so, he will actually be taken off medication. For now, I will continue on Trileptal 300 mg twice a day, which is a low starting dose for him. There is no indication that his dose needs to be increased. Family understands the plan. We will try to obtain an electroencephalogram in the near future in Modesto and followup is scheduled for 6 months. Parents will contact us after the electroencephalogram is done so they can get the results. Thank you very much for allowing me to access ABC for further management."
182,Neurology," EXAM: 1. Diagnostic cerebral angiogram. 2. Transcatheter infusion of papaverine. ANESTHESIA: General anesthesia FLUORO TIME: 19.5 minutes CONTRAST: Visipaque-270, 100 mL INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: The patient is a 13-year-old boy who had clipping for a left ICA bifurcation aneurysm. He was referred for a routine postop check angiogram. He is doing fine clinically. All questions were answered, risks explained, informed consent taken and patient was brought to angio suite. TECHNIQUE: After informed consent was taken patient was brought to angio suite, both groin sites were prepped and draped in sterile manner. Patient was placed under general anesthesia for entire duration of the procedure. Groin access was obtained with a stiff micropuncture wire and a 4-French sheath was placed in the right common femoral artery and connected to a continuous heparinized saline flush. A 4-French angled Glide catheter was then taken up into the descending thoracic aorta was double flushed and connected to a continuous heparinized saline flush. The catheter was then taken up into the aortic arch and both common and internal carotid arteries were selectively catheterized followed by digital subtraction imaging in multiple projections. The images showed spasm of the left internal carotid artery and the left A1, it was thought planned to infused papaverine into the ICA and the left A1. After that the diagnostic catheter was taken up into the distal internal carotid artery. SL-10 microcatheter was then prepped and was taken up with the support of Transcend platinum micro guide wire. The microcatheter was then taken up into the internal carotid artery under biplane roadmapping and was taken up into the distal internal carotid artery and was pointed towards the A1. 60 mg of papaverine was then slowly infused into the internal carotid artery and the anterior cerebral artery. Post-papaverine infusion images showed increased caliber of the internal carotid artery as well as the left A1. The catheter was then removed from the patient, pressure was held for 10 minutes leading to hemostasis. Patient was then transferred back to the ICU in the Children's Hospital where he was extubated without any deficits. INTERPRETATION OF IMAGES: 1. LEFT COMMON/INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY INJECTIONS: The left internal carotid artery is of normal caliber. In the intracranial projection there is moderate spasm of the left internal carotid artery and moderately severe spasm of the left A1. There is poor filling of the A2 through left internal carotid artery injection. There is opacification of the ophthalmic and the posterior communicating artery MCA along with the distal branches are filling normally. Capillary filling and venous drainage in MCA distribution is normal and it is very slow in the ACA distribution 2. RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY INJECTION: The right internal carotid artery is of normal caliber. There is opacification of the right ophthalmic and the posterior communicating artery. The right ACA A1 is supplying bilateral A2 and there is no spasm of the distal anterior cerebral artery. Right MCA along with the distal branches are filling normally. Capillary filling and venous drainage are normal. 3. POST-PAPAVERINE INJECTION: The post-papaverine injection shows increased caliber of the internal carotid artery as well as the anterior cerebral artery. Of note the previously clipped internal carotid ICA bifurcation aneurysm is well clipped and there is no residual neck or filling of the dome of the aneurysm. IMPRESSION: 1. Well clipped left ICA bifurcation aneurysm. 2. Moderately severe spasm of the internal carotid artery and left A1. 60 milligrams of papaverine infused leading to increased flow in the aforementioned vessels."

185,Neurology," HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 63-year-old left-handed gentleman who presents for further evaluation of multiple neurological symptoms. I asked him to discuss each symptom individually as he had a very hard time describing the nature of his problems. He first mentioned that he has neck pain. He states that he has had this for at least 15 years. It is worse with movement. It has progressed very slowly over the course of 15 years. It is localized to the base of his neck and is sharp in quality. He also endorses a history of gait instability. This has been present for a few years and has been slightly progressively worsening. He describes that he feels unsteady on his feet and &quot;walks like a duck.&quot; He has fallen about three or four times over the past year and a half. He also describes that he has numbness in his feet. When I asked him to describe this in more detail, the numbness is actually restricted to his toes. Left is slightly more affected than the right. He denies any tingling or paresthesias. He also described that he is slowly losing control of his hands. He thinks that he is dropping objects due to weakness or incoordination in his hands. This has also been occurring for the past one to two years. He has noticed that buttoning his clothes is more difficult for him. He also does not have any numbness or tingling in the hands. He does have a history of chronic low back pain. At the end of the visit, when I asked him which symptom was most bothersome to him, he actually stated that his fatigue was most troublesome. He did not even mention this on the initial part of my history taking. When I asked him to describe this further, he states that he experiences a general exhaustion. He basically lays in bed all day everyday. I asked him if he was depressed, he states that he is treated for depression. He is unsure if this is optimally treated. As I just mentioned, he stays in bed almost all day long and does not engage in any social activities. He does not think that he is necessarily sad. His appetite is good. He has never undergone any psychotherapy for depression. When I took his history, I noticed that he is very slow in responding to my questions and also had a lot of difficulty recalling details of his history as well as names of physicians who he had seen in the past. I asked if he had ever been evaluated for cognitive difficulties and he states that he did undergo testing at Johns Hopkins a couple of years ago. He states that the results were normal and that specifically he did not have any dementia. When I asked him when he was first evaluated for his current symptoms, he states that he saw Dr. X several years ago. He believes that he was told that he had neuropathy but that it was unclear if it was due to his diabetes. He told me that more recently he was evaluated by you after Dr. Y referred him for this evaluation. He also saw Dr. Z for neurosurgical consultation a couple of weeks ago. He reports that she did not think there was any surgical indication in his neck or back at this point in time. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: He has had diabetes for five years. He also has had hypercholesterolemia. He has had Crohn's disease for 25 or 30 years. He has had a colostomy for four years. He has arthritis, which is reportedly related to the Crohn's disease. He has hypertension and coronary artery disease and is status post stent placement. He has depression. He had a kidney stone removed about 25 years ago. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: He takes Actos, Ambien, baby aspirin, Coreg, Entocort, folic acid, Flomax, iron, Lexapro 20 mg q.h.s., Lipitor, Pentasa, Plavix, Protonix, Toprol, Celebrex and Zetia. ALLERGIES: He states that Imuran caused him to develop tachycardia. SOCIAL HISTORY: He previously worked with pipeline work, but has been on disability for five years. He is unsure which symptoms led him to go on disability. He has previously smoked about two packs of cigarettes daily for 20 years, but quit about 20 years ago. He denies alcohol or illicit drug use. He lives with his wife. He does not really have any hobbies. FAMILY HISTORY: His father died of a cerebral hemorrhage at age 49. His mother died in her 70s from complications of congestive heart failure. He has one sister who died during a cardiac surgery two years ago. He has another sister with diabetes. He has one daughter with hypercholesterolemia. He is unaware of any family members with neurological disorders. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: He has dyspnea on exertion. He states that he was evaluated by a pulmonologist and had a normal evaluation. He has occasional night sweats. His hearing is poor. He occasionally develops bloody stools, which he attributes to his Crohn's disease. He also was diagnosed with sleep apnea. He does not wear his CPAP machine on a regular basis. He has a history of anemia. Otherwise, a complete review of systems was obtained and was negative except for as mentioned above. This is documented in the handwritten notes from today's visit. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital Signs: Blood pressure 160/86 HR 100 RR 16 Wt 211 pounds Pain 3/10 General Appearance: He is well appearing in no acute distress. He has somewhat of a flat affect. Cardiovascular: He has a regular rhythm without murmurs, gallops, or rubs. There are no carotid bruits. Chest: The lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Skin: There are no rashes or lesions. Musculoskeletal: He has no joint deformities or scoliosis. NEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION: Mental Status: His speech is fluent without dysarthria or aphasia. He is alert and oriented to name, place, and date. Attention, concentration, and fund of knowledge are intact. He has 3/3 object registration and 1/3 recall in 5 minutes. Cranial Nerves: Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation. Visual fields are full. Optic discs are normal. Extraocular movements are intact without nystagmus. Facial sensation is normal. There is no facial, jaw, palate, or tongue weakness. Hearing is grossly intact. Shoulder shrug is full. Motor: He has normal muscle bulk and tone. There is no atrophy. He has few fasciculations in his calf muscles bilaterally. Manual muscle testing reveals MRC grade 5/5 strength in all proximal and distal muscles of the upper and lower extremities. There is no action or percussion myotonia or paramyotonia. Sensory: He has absent vibratory sensation at the left toe. This is diminished at the right toe. Joint position sense is intact. There is diminished sensation to light touch and temperature at the feet to the knees bilaterally. Pinprick is intact. Romberg is absent. There is no spinal sensory level. Coordination: This is intact by finger-nose-finger or heel-to-shin testing. He does have a slight tremor of the head and outstretched arms. Deep Tendon Reflexes: They are 2+ at the biceps, triceps, brachioradialis, patellas, and ankles. Plantar reflexes are flexor. There is no ankle clonus, finger flexors, or Hoffman's signs. He has crossed adductors bilaterally. Gait and Stance: He has a slightly wide-based gait. He has some difficulty with toe walking, but he is able to walk on his heels and tandem walk. He has difficulty with toe raises on the left. RADIOLOGIC DATA: MRI of the cervical spine, 09/30/08: Chronic spondylosis at C5-C6 causing severe bilateral neuroforamining and borderline-to-mold cord compression with normal cord signal. Spondylosis of C6-C7 causing mild bilateral neuroforamining and left paracentral disc herniation causing borderline cord compression. Thoracic MRI spine without contrast: Minor degenerative changes without stenosis. I do not have the MRI of the lumbar spine available to review. LABORATORY DATA: 10/07/08: Vitamin B1 210 (87-280), vitamin B6 6, ESR 6, AST 25, ALT 17, vitamin B12 905, CPK 226 (0-200), T4 0.85, TSH 3.94, magnesium 1.7, RPR nonreactive, CRP 4, Lyme antibody negative, SPEP abnormal (serum protein electrophoresis), but no paraprotein by manifestation, hemoglobin A1c 6.0, aldolase 3.9 and homocystine 9.0. ASSESSMENT: The patient is a 63-year-old gentleman with multiple neurologic and nonneurologic symptoms including numbness, gait instability, decreased dexterity of his arms and general fatigue. His neurological examination is notable for sensory loss in a length-dependent fashion in his feet and legs with scant fasciculations in his calves. He has fairly normal or very mild increased reflexes including notably the presence of normal ankle jerks. I think that the etiology of his symptoms is multifactorial. He probably does have a mild peripheral neuropathy, but the sparing of ankle jerks suggested either the neuropathy is mild or that there is a superimposed myelopathic process such as a cervical or lumbosacral myelopathy. He really is most concerned about the fatigue and I think it is possible due to suboptimally treated depression and suboptimally treated sleep apnea. Whether he has another underlying muscular disorder such as a primary myopathy remains to be seen. RECOMMENDATIONS: 1. I scheduled him for repeat EMG and nerve conduction studies to evaluate for evidence of neuropathy or myopathy. 2. I will review his films at our spine conference tomorrow although I am confident in Dr. Z's opinion that there is no surgical indication. 3. I gave him a prescription for physical therapy to help with gait imbalance training as well as treatment for his neck pain. 4. I believe that he needs to undergo psychotherapy for his depression. It may also be worthwhile to adjust his medications, but I will defer to his primary care physician for managing this or for referring him to a therapist. The patient is very open about proceeding with this suggestion. 5. He does need to have his sleep apnea better controlled. He states that he is not compliant because the face mask that he uses does not fit him well. This should also be addressed. 6. I also am checking another CPK to see if there is any elevation."
186,Neurology," HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 36-year-old female with past medical history of migraine headaches, who was brought to the ER after she was having uncontrolled headaches. In the ER, the patient had a CT scan done, which was reported negative, and lumbar puncture with normal pressure and the cell count, and was admitted for followup. Neurology consult was called to evaluate the patient in view of the current symptomatology. The headaches were refractory to the treatment. The patient has been on Topamax and Maxalt in the past, but did not work and according to the patient she got more confused. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: History of migraine.

The patient is a registered nurse by profession. MEDICATIONS: Currently taking no medication. ALLERGIES: No known allergies. FAMILY HISTORY: Nothing significant. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: The patient was considered to ask systemic review including neurology, psychiatry, sleep, ENT, ophthalmology, pulmonary, cardiology, gastroenterology, genitourinary, hematology, rheumatology, dermatology, allergy, immunology, endocrinology, toxicology, oncology, and was found to be positive for the symptoms mentioned in the history of the presenting illness. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION VITAL SIGNS: Blood pressure of 115/66, heart rate of 69, respiratory rate of 13, temperature normal, and pulse oximetry 98% on room air at the time of initial evaluation. HEENT: Head, normocephalic, atraumatic. Neck supple. Throat clear. No discharge from the ears or nose. No discoloration of conjunctivae and sclerae.

Memory and insight is normal. No abnormality with thought processing and thought content. Cranial nerve examination intact II through XII. Motor examination: Normal bulk, tone and power. Deep tendon reflexes symmetrical. Downgoing toes. No sign of any myelopathy. Cortical sensation intact. Peripheral sensation grossly intact. Vibratory sense not tested. Gait not tested. Coordination is normal with no dysmetria. IMPRESSION: Intractable headaches, by description to be migraines. Complicated migraines by clinical criteria. Rule out sinusitis. Rule out vasculitis including temporal and arthritis, lupus, polyarthritis, moyamoya disease, Takayasu and Kawasaki disease. PLAN AND RECOMMENDATIONS: The patient to be given a trial of the prednisone with a plan to taper off in 6 days, as she already had received 50 mg today. Depakote as a part of migraine prophylaxis and Fioricet on p.r.n. basis. The patient to get vasculitis workup, as it has not been ordered by the primary care physician initially. The patient already had MRI of the brain and the cervical spine. MRI of the brain reported negative and cervical spine as shown signs of disk protrusion at C5 and C6 level, which will not explain of the temporal headache. Plan and followup discussed with the patient in detail."
187,Neurology," CC: Progressive memory and cognitive decline. HX: This 73 y/o RHF presented on 1/12/95, with progressive memory and cognitive decline since 11/94. Her difficulties were first noted by family the week prior to Thanksgiving, when they were taking her to Vail, Colorado to play &quot;Murder She Wrote&quot; at family gathering. Unbeknownst to the patient was the fact that she had been chosen to be the &quot;assassin.&quot; Prior to boarding the airplane her children hid a toy gun in her carry-on luggage. As the patient walked through security the alarm went off and within seconds she was surrounded, searched and interrogated. She and her family eventually made their flight, but she seemed unusually flustered and disoriented by the event. In prior times they would have expected her to have brushed off the incident with a &quot;chuckle.&quot; While in Colorado her mentation seemed slow and she had difficulty reading the lines to her part while playing &quot;Murder She Wrote.&quot; She needed assistance to complete the game. The family noted no slurring of speech, difficulty with vision, or focal weakness at the time. She returned to work at a local florist shop the Monday following Thanksgiving, and by her own report, had difficulty carrying out her usual tasks of flower arranging and operating the cash register. She quit working the next day and never went back. Her mental status appeared to remain relatively stable throughout the month of November and December and during that time she was evaluated by a local neurologist. Serum VDRL, TFTs, GS, B12, Folate, CBC, CXR, and MRI of the Brain were all reportedly unremarkable. The working diagnosis was &quot;Dementia of the Alzheimer's Type.&quot; One to two weeks prior to her 1/12/95 presentation, she became repeatedly lost in her own home. In addition, she, and especially her family, noticed increased difficulty with word finding, attention, and calculation. Furthermore, she began expressing emotional lability unusual for her. She also tended to veer toward the right when walking and often did not recognize the location of people talking to her. MEDS: None. PMH: Unremarkable. FHX: Father and mother died in their 80's of &quot;old age.&quot; There was no history of dementing illness, stroke, HTN, DM, or other neurological disease in her family. She has 5 children who were alive and well. SHX: She attained a High School education and had been widowed for over 30 years. She lived alone for 15 years until to 12/94, when her daughters began sharing the task of caring for her. She had no history of tobacco, alcohol or illicit drug use. EXAM: Vitals signs were within normal limits. MS: A&O to person place and time. At times she seemed in absence. She scored 20/30 on MMSE and had difficulty with concentration, calculation, visuospatial construction. Her penmanship was not normal, and appeared &quot;child-like&quot; according to her daughters. She had difficulty writing a sentence and spoke in a halting fashion; she appeared to have difficulty finding words. In addition, while attempting to write, she had difficulty finding the right margin of the page. CN: Right homonymous inferior quadrantanopsia bordering on a right homonymous hemianopsia. The rest of the CN exam was unremarkable. Motor: 5/5 strength throughout with normal muscle tone and bulk. Sensory: extinguishing of RUE sensation on double simultaneous stimulation, and at times she appeared to show sign of RUE neglect. There were no unusual spontaneous movements noted. Coord: unremarkable except for difficulty finding the target on FNF exercise when the target was moved into the right side visual field. Station: No sign of Romberg or pronator drift. There was no truncal ataxia. Gait: decreased RUE swing and a tendency to veer and circumambulate to the right when asked to walk toward a target. Reflexes: 2/2 and symmetric throughout all four extremities. Plantar responses were equivocal, bilaterally. COURSE: CBC, GS, PT, PTT, ESR, UA, CRP, TSH, FT4, and EKG were unremarkable. CSF analysis revealed: 38 RBC, 0 WBC, Protein 36, glucose 76. The outside MRI was reviewed and was found to show increased signal on T2 weighted images in the gyri of the left parietal-occipital regions. Repeat MRI, at UIHC, revealed the same plus increased signal on T2 weighted images in the left frontal region as well. CXR, transthoracic echocardiogram and 4 vessel cerebral angiogram were unremarkable. A 1/23/95, left frontal brain biopsy revealed spongiform changes without sign of focal necrosis, vasculitis or inflammatory changes. The working diagnosis became Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (Heidenhaim variant). The patient died on 2/15/95. Brain tissue was sent to the University of California at San Francisco. Analysis there revealed diffuse vacuolization throughout most of the cingulate gyrus, frontal cortex, hypothalamus, globus pallidus, putamen, insula, amygdala, hippocampus, cerebellum and medulla. This vacuolization was most severe in the entorhinal cortex and parahippocampal gyrus. Hydrolytic autoclaving technique was used with PrP-specific antibodies to identify the presence of protease resistant PrP (CJD). The patient's brain tissue was strongly positive for PrP (CJD)."
188,Neurology," CC: Left hemibody numbness. HX: This 44y/o RHF awoke on 7/29/93 with left hemibody numbness without tingling, weakness, ataxia, visual or mental status change.

MRI C-spine, 7/145/93, showed an area of decreased T1 and increased T2 signal at the C4-6 levels within the right lateral spinal cord. The lesion appeared intramedullary and eccentric, and peripherally enhanced with gadolinium. Lumbar puncture, 7/16/93, revealed the following CSF analysis results: RBC 0, WBC 1 (lymphocyte), Protein 28mg/dl, Glucose 62mg/dl, CSF Albumin 16 (normal 14-20), Serum Albumin 4520 (normal 3150-4500), CSF IgG 4.1mg/dl (normal 0-6.2), CSF IgG, % total CSF protein 15% (normal 1-14%), CSF IgG index 1.1 (normal 0-0.7), Oligoclonal bands were present. She was discharged home. The patient claimed her symptoms resolved within one month. She did not return for a scheduled follow-up MRI C-spine."
189,Neurology," CC: Left-sided weakness. HX: This 28y/o RHM was admitted to a local hospital on 6/30/95 for a 7 day history of fevers, chills, diaphoresis, anorexia, urinary frequency, myalgias and generalized weakness. He denied foreign travel, IV drug abuse, homosexuality, recent dental work, or open wound. Blood and urine cultures were positive for Staphylococcus Aureus, oxacillin sensitive. He was place on appropriate antibiotic therapy according to sensitivity.. A 7/3/95 transthoracic echocardiogram revealed normal left ventricular function and a damaged mitral valve with regurgitation. Later that day he developed left-sided weakness and severe dysarthria and aphasia. HCT, on 7/3/95 revealed mild attenuated signal in the right hemisphere. On 7/4/95 he developed first degree AV block, and was transferred to UIHC. MEDS: Nafcillin 2gm IV q4hrs, Rifampin 600mg q12hrs, Gentamicin 130mg q12hrs. PMH: 1) Heart murmur dx age 5 years.

COURSE: 7/6/95, HCT showed a large RMCA stroke with mass shift. His neurologic exam worsened and he was intubated, hyperventilated, and given IV Mannitol. He then underwent emergent left craniectomy and duraplasty. He tolerated the procedure well and his brain was allowed to swell. He then underwent mitral valve replacement on 7/11/95 with a St. Judes valve. His post-operative recovery was complicated by pneumonia, pericardial effusion and dysphagia. He required temporary PEG placement for feeding. The 7/27/95, 8/6/95 and 10/18/96 HCT scans show the chronologic neuroradiologic documentation of a large RMCA stroke. His 10/18/96 Neurosurgery Clinic visit noted that he can ambulate without assistance with the use of a leg brace to prevent left foot drop. His proximal LLE strength was rated at a 4. His LUE was plegic. He had a seizure 6 days prior to his 10/18/96 evaluation. This began as a Jacksonian march of shaking in the LUE; then involved the LLE. There was no LOC or tongue-biting. He did have urinary incontinence. He was placed on DPH. His speech was dysarthric but fluent. He appeared bright, alert and oriented in all spheres."
190,Neurology," CC: Falls. HX: This 51y/o RHF fell four times on 1/3/93, because her &quot;legs suddenly gave out.&quot; She subsequently noticed weakness involving the right leg, and often required the assistance of her arms to move it. During some of these episodes she appeared mildly pale and felt generally weak; her husband would give her 3 teaspoons of sugar and she would appear to improve, thought not completely. During one episode she held her RUE in an &quot;odd fisted posture.&quot; She denied any other focal weakness, sensory change, dysarthria, diplopia, dysphagia or alteration of consciousness. She did not seek medical attention despite her weakness. Then, last night, 1/4/93, she fell again ,and because her weakness did not subsequently improve she came to UIHC for evaluation on 1/5/93. MEDS: Micronase 5mg qd, HCTZ, quit ASA 6 months ago (tired of taking it). PMH: 1)DM type 2, dx 6 months ago. 2)HTN. 3)DJD. 4)s/p Vitrectomy and retinal traction OU for retinal detachment 7/92. 5) s/p Cholecystemomy,1968. 6) Cataract implant, OU,1992. 7) s/p C-section.

Intact naming, comprehension, reading. CN: Pupils 4.5 (irregular)/4.0 (irregular) and virtually fixed. Optic disks flat. EOM intact. VFFTC. Right lower facial weakness. The rest of the CN exam was unremarkable. Motor: 5/5 BUE with some question of breakaway. LE: HF and HE 4+/5, KF5/5, AF and AE 5/5. Normal muscle bulk and tone. Sensory: intact PP/VIB/PROP/LT/T/graphesthesia. Coord: slowed FNF and HKS (worse on right). Station: no pronator drift or Romberg sign. Gait: Unsteady wide-based gait. Unable to heel walk on right. Reflexes: 2/2+ throughout (Slightly more brisk on right). Plantar responses were downgoing bilaterally. HEENT: N0 Carotid or cranial bruits. Gen Exam: unremarkable. COURSE: CBC, GS (including glucose), PT/PTT, EKG, CXR on admission, 1/5/93, were unremarkable. HCT, 1/5/93, revealed a hypodensity in the left caudate consistent with ischemic change. Carotid Duplex: 0-15%RICA, 16-49%LICA; antegrade vertebral artery flow, bilaterally. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed borderline LV hypertrophy and normal LV function. No valvular abnormalities or thrombus were seen. The patient's history and exam findings of right facial and RLE weakness with sparing of the RUE would invoke a RACA territory stroke with recurrent artery of Heubner involvement causing the facial weakness."
191,Neurology," PROBLEMS AND ISSUES: 1. Headaches, nausea, and dizziness, consistent with a diagnosis of vestibular migraine, recommend amitriptyline for prophylactic treatment and Motrin for abortive treatment. 2. Some degree of peripheral neuropathy, consistent with diabetic neuropathy, encouraged her to watch her diet and exercise daily. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient comes in for a neurology consultation regarding her difficult headaches, tunnel vision, and dizziness. I obtained and documented a full history and physical examination. I reviewed the new patient questionnaire, which she completed prior to her arrival today. I also reviewed the results of tests, which she had brought with her. Briefly, she is a 60-year-old woman initially from Ukraine, who had headaches since age 25. She recalls that in 1996 when her husband died her headaches became more frequent. They were pulsating. She was given papaverine, which was successful in reducing the severity of her symptoms. After six months of taking papaverine, she no longer had any headaches. In 2004, her headaches returned. She also noted that she had &quot;zig-zag lines&quot; in her vision. Sometimes she would not see things in her peripheral visions. She had photophobia and dizziness, which was mostly lightheadedness. On one occasion she almost had a syncope. Again she has started taking Russian medications, which did help her. The dizziness and headaches have become more frequent and now occur on average once to twice per week. They last two hours since she takes papaverine, which stops the symptoms within 30 minutes. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Her past medical history is significant for injury to her left shoulder, gastroesophageal reflux disorder, diabetes, anxiety, and osteoporosis. MEDICATIONS: Her medications include hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril, glipizide, metformin, vitamin D, Centrum multivitamin tablets, Actos, lorazepam as needed, Vytorin, and Celexa. ALLERGIES: She has no known drug allergies. FAMILY HISTORY: There is family history of migraine and diabetes in her siblings. SOCIAL HISTORY: She drinks alcohol occasionally. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Her review of systems was significant for headaches, pain in her left shoulder, sleeping problems and gastroesophageal reflex symptoms. Remainder of her full 14-point review of system was unremarkable. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On examination, the patient was pleasant. She was able to speak English fairly well. Her blood pressure was 130/84. Heart rate was 80. Respiratory rate was 16. Her weight was 188 pounds. Her pain score was 0/10. Her general exam was completely unremarkable. Her neurological examination showed subtle weakness in her left arm due to discomfort and pain. She had reduced vibration sensation in her left ankle and to some degree in her right foot. There was no ataxia. She was able to walk normally. Reflexes were 2+ throughout. She had had a CT scan with constant, which per Dr. X's was unremarkable. She reports that she had a brain MRI two years ago which was also unremarkable. IMPRESSION AND PLAN: The patient is a delightful 60-year-old chemist from Ukraine who has had episodes of headaches with nausea, photophobia, and dizziness since her 20s. She has had some immigration problems in recent months and has experienced increased frequency of her migraine symptoms. Her diagnosis is consistent with vestibular migraine. I do not see evidence of multiple sclerosis, M&eacute;ni&egrave;re's disease, or benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. I talked to her in detail about the importance of following a migraine diet. I gave her instructions including a list of foods times, which worsen migraine. I reviewed this information for more than half the clinic visit. I would like to start her on amitriptyline at a dose of 10 mg at time. She will take Motrin at a dose of 800 mg as needed for her severe headaches. She will make a diary of her migraine symptoms so that we can find any triggering food items, which worsen her symptoms. I encouraged her to walk daily in order to improve her fitness, which helps to reduce migraine symptoms."
192,Neurology," CHIEF COMPLAINT: &quot;A lot has been thrown at me.&quot; The patient is interviewed with husband in room. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 69-year-old Caucasian woman with a history of Huntington disease, who presented to Hospital four days ago after an overdose of about 30 Haldol tablets 5 mg each and Tylenol tablet 325 mg each, 40 tablets. She has been on the medical floor for monitoring and is medically stable and was transferred to the psychiatric floor today. The patient states she had been thinking about suicide for a couple of weeks. Felt that her Huntington disease had worsened and she wanted to spare her family and husband from trouble. Reports she has been not socializing with her family because of her worsening depression. Husband notes that on Monday after speaking to Dr. X, they had been advised to alternate the patient's Pamelor (nortriptyline) to every other day because the patient was reporting dry mouth. They did as they have instructed and husband feels this may have had some factor on her worsening depression. The patient decided to ingest the pills when her husband went to work on Friday. She thought Friday would be a good day because there would be less medical people working so her chances of receiving medical care would be lessened. Her husband left around 7 in the morning and returned around 11 and found her sleeping. About 30 minutes after his arrival, he found the empty bottles and woke up the patient to bring her to the hospital. She says she wishes she would have died, but is happy she is alive and is currently not suicidal because she notes her sons may be have to be tested for the Huntington gene. She does not clearly explain how this has made her suicidality subside. This is the third suicide attempt in the last two months for this patient. About two months ago, the patient took an overdose of Tylenol and some other medication, which the husband and the patient are not able to recall. She was taken to Southwest Memorial Hermann Hospital. A few weeks ago, the patient tried to shoot herself and the gun was fired and there is a blow-hole in the floor. Husband locked the gun after that and she was taken to Bellaire Hospital. The patient has had three psychiatric admissions in the past two months, two to Southwest Memorial and one to Bellaire Hospital for 10 days. She sees Dr. X once or twice weekly. He started seeing her after her first suicide attempt. The patient's husband and the patient state that until March 2009, the patient was independent, was driving herself around and was socially active. Since then she has had worsening of her Huntington symptoms including short-term memory loss. At present, the patient could not operate the microwave or operate her cell phone and her husband says that she is progressively more withdrawn, complains about anxiety, and complains about shortness of breath. The patient notes that she has had depressive symptoms of quitting social life, the patient being withdrawn for the past few months and excessive worry about her Huntington disease. The patient's mother passed away 25 years ago from Huntington's. Her grandmother passed away 50 years ago and two brothers also passed away of Huntington's. The patient has told her husband that she does not want to go that way. The patient denies auditory or visual hallucinations, denies paranoid ideation. The husband and the patient deny any history of manic or hypomanic symptoms in the past. PAST PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY: As per the HPI, this is her third suicide attempt in the last two months and started seeing Dr. X. She has a remote history of being on Lexapro for depression. MEDICATIONS: Her medications on admission, alprazolam 0.5 mg p.o. b.i.d., Artane 2 mg p.o. b.i.d., Haldol 2.5 mg p.o. t.i.d., Norvasc 10 mg p.o. daily, nortriptyline 50 mg p.o. daily. Husband has stated that the patient's chorea becomes better when she takes Haldol. Alprazolam helps her with anxiety symptoms. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Huntington disease, symptoms of dementia and hypertension. She has an upcoming appointment with the Neurologist. Currently, does have a primary care physician and _______ having an outpatient psychiatrist, Dr. X, and her current Neurologist, Dr. Y. ALLERGIES: CODEINE AND KEFLEX. FAMILY MEDICAL HISTORY: Strong family history for Huntington disease as per the HPI. Mother and grandmother died of Huntington disease. Two young brothers also had Huntington disease. FAMILY PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY: The patient denies history of depression, bipolar, schizophrenia, or suicide attempts. SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives with her husband of 48 years. She used to be employed as a registered nurse. Her husband states that she does have a pattern of self-prescribing for minor illness, but does not think that she has ever taken muscle relaxants or sedative medications without prescriptions. She rarely drinks socially. She denies any illicit substance usage. Her husband reportedly gives her medication daily. Has been proactive in terms of seeking mental health care and medical care. The patient and husband report that from March 2009, she has been relatively independent, more socially active. MENTAL STATUS EXAM: This is an elderly woman appearing stated age.

193,Neurology," CC: Difficulty with speech. HX: This 84 y/o RHF presented with sudden onset word finding and word phonation difficulties. She had an episode of transient aphasia in 2/92 during which she had difficulty with writing, written and verbal comprehension, and exhibited numerous semantic and phonemic paraphasic errors of speech. These problems resolved within 24 hours of onset and she had no subsequent speech problems prior to this presentation. Workup at that time revealed a right to left shunt on trans-thoracic echocardiogram. Carotid doppler studies showed 0-15% BICA stenosis and a LICA aneurysm (mentioned above). Brain CT was unremarkable. She was placed on ASA after the 2/92 event. In 5/92 she was involved in a motor vehicle accident and suffered a fractured left humerus and left occipital scalp laceration. HCT at that time showed a small area of slightly increased attenuation at the posterior right claustrum only. This was not felt to be a contusion; nevertheless, she was placed on Dilantin seizure prophylaxis. Her left arm was casted and she returned home. 5 hours prior to presentation today, the patient began having difficulty finding words and putting them into speech. She was able to comprehend speech. This continued for an hour; then partially resolved for one hour; then returned; then waxed and waned. There was no reported weakness, numbness, incontinence, seizure-like activity, incoordination, HA, nausea, vomiting, or lightheadedness MEDS: ASA , DPH, Tenormin, Premarin, HCTZ PMH: 1)transient fluent aphasia 2/92 (which resolved), 2)bilateral carotid endarterectomies 1986, 3)HTN, 4)distal left internal carotid artery aneurysm. EXAM: BP 168/70, Pulse 82, RR 16, 35.8F MS:A & O x 3, Difficulty following commands, Speech fluent, and without dysarthria. There were occasional phonemic paraphasic errors. CN: Unremarkable. Motor: 5/5 throughout except for 4+ right wrist extension and right knee flexion. Sensory: unremarkable. Coordination: mild left finger-nose-finger dysynergia and dysmetria. Gait: mildly unsteady tandem walk. Station: no Romberg sign. Reflexes: slightly more brisk at the left patella than on the right. Plantar responses were flexor bilaterally. The remainder of the neurologic exam and the general physical exam were unremarkable. LABS: CBC WNL, Gen Screen WNL, , PT/PTT WNL, DPH 26.2mcg/ml, CXR WNL, EKG: LBBB, HCT revealed a left subdural hematoma. COURSE: Patient was taken to surgery and the subdural hematoma was evacuated. Her mental status, language skills, improved dramatically. The DPH dosage was adjusted appropriately."
194,Neurology," AB CD, M.D. XYZ Street City, State Dear Dr. CD: Thank you for seeing Mr. XYZ, a pleasant 19-year-old male who has seen you in 2005 for suspected seizure activity. He comes to my office today continuing on Dilantin 300 mg daily and has been seizure episode free for the past 2 1/2 years. He is requesting to come off the Dilantin at this point. Upon reviewing your 2005 note there was some discrepancy as to the true nature of his episodes to the emergency room and there was consideration to reconsider medication use. His physical exam, neurologically, is normal at this time. His Dilantin level is slightly low at 12.5. I will appreciate your evaluation and recommendation as to whether we need to continue the Dilantin at this time. I understand this will probably entail repeating his EEG and so please coordinate this through Health Center. I await your response and whether we should continue this medication. If you require any laboratory, we use ABC Diagnostic and any further testing that is needed should be coordinated at Health Center prior to scheduling."
195,Neurology," CC: Progressive left visual field loss. HX: This 46y/o RHF with polymyositis since 1988, presented with complaint of visual field loss since 12/94. The visual field loss was of gradual onset and within a month of onset became a left homonymous hemianopsia. She began experiencing stiffness, numbness, tingling and incoordination of her left hand, 6 weeks prior to this admission,. These symptoms were initially attributed to carpal tunnel syndrome. MRI scan of the brain (done locally) on 6/23/95 revealed increased periventricular white matter signal on T2 images, particularly in the left temporo-occipital and right parietal lobes. There was ring enhancement of a lesion in the left occipital lobe on T1 gadolinium contrast enhanced images. There was gyral enhancement near the right Sylvian fissure. Cerebral angiogram on 7/19/95 (done locally) was unremarkable. Lumbar puncture on 7/19/95 was unremarkable. She complained of frequent holocranial throbbing headaches for the past 6 months; the HA's are associated with photophobia, phonophobia and nausea, but no vomiting. She has also been experiencing chills and night sweats for the past 2-3 weeks. She denies weight loss, but acknowledged decreased appetite and increased generalized fatigue for the past 3-4 months. She was diagnosed with polymyositis in 1988 with slowly progressive bilateral lower extremity weakness. She has been on immunosuppressive drugs since 1988, including Prednisone, Prednisone and methotrexate, Cyclosporin, Imuran, Cytoxan, and Plaquenil. At present she in ambulatory with use of walker. Her last CK=3,125 and ESR=16, on 6/28/95. MEDS: Prednisone 20mg qd, Cytoxan 75mg qd, Zantac 150mg bid, Vasotec 10mg bid, Premarin 0.625 qd, Provera 2.5mg qd, CaCO3 500mg bid, Vit D 50,000units qweek, Vit E qd, MVI 1 tab qd. PMH: 1)polymyositis diagnosed in 1988 by muscle biopsy. 2)hypertension. 3)lichen planus. 4)Lower extremity deep venous thrombosis one year ago--placed on Coumadin and this resulted in postmenopausal bleeding. FHX: Mother is alive and has a h/o HTN and stroke. Father died in motor vehicle accident at age 40 years. SHX: Married, 3 children who are healthy. She denied any Tobacco/ETOH/Illicit drug use. EXAM: BP160/74 HR95 RR12 35.8C Wt. 86.4kg Ht. 5'6&quot; MS: A&O to person, place and time. Speech was normal. Mood euthymic with appropriate affect. CN: Pupils 4/4 decreasing to 2/2 on exposure to light. No RAPD noted. Optic Disk were flat. EOM testing unremarkable. Confrontational visual field testing revealed a left homonymous hemianopsia. The rest of the CN exam was unremarkable. MOTOR: Upper extremities: 5/5 proximally, 5/4 @ elbow/wrist/hand. Lower extremities: 4/4 proximally and 5/5 @ and below knees. SENSORY: unremarkable. COORD: Dyssynergia of LUE FNF movement. Slowed finger tapping on left. HNS movements were normal, bilaterally. Station: LUE drift and fix on arm roll. No Romberg sign elicited. Gait: Waddling gait, but could TT and stand on both heels. She had difficulty with tandem walking, but did not fall to any particular side. Reflexes: 2/2 brachioradialis and biceps. 2/2+ triceps, 1+/1+ patellae, 1/1 Achilles. Plantar responses were flexor on the right and withdrawal response on the left. GEN EXAM: No rashes. II/VI systolic ejection murmur at the left sternal border. COURSE: Electrolytes, PT/PTT, Urinalysis and CXR were normal. ESR=38 (normal&lt;20), CRP1.4 (normal&lt;0.4). CK 2,917, LDH 356, AST 67. MRI Brain, 8/8/95, revealed slight improvement of the abnormal white matter changes seen on previous outside MRI. In addition new sphenoid sinus disease suggestive of sinusitis was seen. She underwent stereotactic biopsy of the right parietal region on 8/10/95 which on H&E and LFB stained sections revealed multiple discrete areas of demyelination, containing dense infiltrates of foamy macrophages in association with scattered large oligodendroglia with deeply basophilic, ground-glass nuclei, enlarged astrocytes, and sparse perivascular lymphocytic infiltrates. In situ hybridization performed on block A2 (at the university of Pittsburgh) is positive for JC virus. The ultrastructural studies demonstrated no viral particles. She was tapered off all immunosuppressive medications and her polymyositis remained clinically stable. She had a seizure in 12/95 and was placed on Dilantin. Her neurologic deficits worsened slightly, but reached a plateau by 10/96, as indicated by a 4/14/97 Neurology clinic visit note. 1/22/96, MRI Brain demonstrated widespread hyperintense signal on T2 and Proton Density weighted images throughout the deep white matter in both hemispheres, worse on the right side. There was interval progression of previously noted abnormalities and extension into the right frontal and left parieto-occipital regions. There was progression of abnormal signal in the Basal Ganglia, worse on the right, and new involvement of the brainstem."
196,Neurology," REASON FOR VISIT: Followup cervical spinal stenosis. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. ABC returns today for followup regarding her cervical spinal stenosis. I have last seen her on 06/19/07. Her symptoms of right greater than left upper extremity pain, weakness, paresthesias had been worsening after an incident on 06/04/07, when she thought she had exacerbated her conditions while lifting several objects. I referred her to obtain a cervical spine MRI. She returns today stating that she continues to have right upper extremity pain, paresthesias, weakness, which she believes radiates from her neck. She had some physical therapy, which has been helping with the neck pain. The right hand weakness continues. She states she has a difficult time opening jars, and doors, and often drops items from her right greater than left upper extremity. She states she have several occasions when she is sleeping at night, she has had sharp shooting radicular pain and weakness down her left upper extremity and she feels that these symptoms somewhat scare her. She has been undergoing nonoperative management by Dr. X and feels this has been helping her neck pain, but not the upper extremity symptoms. She denies any bowel and bladder dysfunction. No lower back pain, no lower extremity pain, and no instability with ambulation. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Negative for fevers, chills, chest pain, and shortness of breath. FINDINGS: On examination, Ms. ABC is a very pleasant well-developed, well-nourished female in no apparent distress. Alert and oriented x3. Normocephalic and atraumatic. Afebrile to touch. She ambulates with a normal gait. Motor strength is 4 plus out of 5 in the bilateral deltoids, biceps, triceps muscle groups, 4 out of 5 in the bilateral hand intrinsic muscle groups, grip strength 4 out of 5, 4 plus out of 5 bilateral wrist extension and wrist flexion. Light touch sensation decreased in the right greater than left C6 distribution. Biceps and brachioradialis reflexes are 3 plus. Hoffman sign normal bilaterally. Lower extremity strength is 5 out of 5 in all muscle groups. Patellar reflex is 3 plus. No clonus. Cervical spine radiographs dated 06/21/07 are reviewed. They demonstrate evidence of spondylosis including degenerative disk disease and anterior and posterior osteophyte formation at C4-5, C5-6, C6-7, and C3-4 demonstrates only minimal if any degenerative disk disease. There is no significant instability seen on flexion-extension views. Updated cervical spine MRI dated 06/21/07 is reviewed. It demonstrates evidence of moderate stenosis at C4-5, C5-6. These stenosis is in the bilateral neural foramina and there is also significant disk herniation noted at the C6-7 level. Minimal degenerative disk disease is seen at the C6-7. This stenosis is greater than C5-6 and the next level is more significantly involved at C4-5. Effacement of the ventral and dorsal CSF space is seen at C4-5, C5-6. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Ms. ABC's history, physical examination, and radiographic findings are compatible with C4-5, C5-6 cervical spinal stenosis with associated right greater than left upper extremity radiculopathy including weakness. I spent a significant amount of time today with the patient discussing the diagnosis, prognosis, natural history, nonoperative, and operative treatment options. I laid out the options as continued nonoperative management with physical therapy, the same with the addition of cervical epidural steroid injections and surgical interventions. The patient states she would like to avoid injections and is somewhat afraid of having these done. I explained to her that they may help to improve her symptoms, although they may not help with the weakness. She feels that she is failing maximum nonoperative management and would like to consider surgical intervention. I described the procedure consisting of C4-5, C5-6 anterior cervical decompression and fusion to the patient in detail on a spine model. I explained the rationale for doing so including the decompression of the spinal cord and improvement of her upper extremity weakness and pain. She understands. I discussed the risks, benefits, and alternative of the procedure including material risks of bleeding, infection, neurovascular injury, dural tear, singular or multiple muscle weakness, paralysis, hoarseness of voice, difficulty swallowing, pseudoarthrosis, adjacent segment disease, and the risk of this given the patient's relatively young age. Of note, the patient does have a hoarse voice right now, given the fact that she feels she has allergies. I also discussed the option of disk arthroplasty. She understands. She would like to proceed with the surgery, relatively soon. She has her birthday coming up on 07/20/07 and would like to hold off, until after then. Our tentative date for the surgery is 08/01/07. She will go ahead and continue the preoperative testing process."
197,Neurology," TECHNIQUE: Sequential axial CT images were obtained from the vertex to the skull base without contrast. FINDINGS: There is mild generalized atrophy. Scattered patchy foci of decreased attenuation are seen within the sub cortical and periventricular white matter compatible with chronic small vessel ischemic changes. The brain parenchyma is otherwise normal in attenuation with no evidence of mass, hemorrhage, midline shift, hydrocephalus, extra-axial fluid, or acute infarction. The visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear. The bony calvarium and skull base are within normal limits. IMPRESSION: No acute abnormalities."
198,Neurology," CC: Headache HX: This 16 y/o RHF was in good health, until 11:00PM, the evening of 11/27/87, when she suddenly awoke from sleep with severe headache. Her parents described her as holding her head between her hands. She had no prior history of severe headaches. 30 minutes later she felt nauseated and vomited. The vomiting continued every 30 minutes and she developed neck stiffness. At 2:00AM on 11/28/97, she got up to go to the bathroom and collapsed in her mother's arms. Her mother noted she appeared weak on the left side. Shortly after this she experienced fecal and urinary incontinence. She was taken to a local ER and transferred to UIHC. PMH/FHX/SHX: completely unremarkable FHx. Has boyfriend and is sexually active. Denied drug/ETOH/Tobacco use. MEDS: Oral Contraceptive pill QD. EXAM: BP152/82 HR74 RR16 T36.9C MS: Somnolent and difficult to keep awake. Prefer to lie on right side because of neck pain/stiffness. Answers appropriately though when questioned. CN: No papilledema noted. Pupils 4/4 decreasing to 2/2. EOM Intact. Face: ?left facial weakness. The rest of the CN exam was unremarkable. Motor: Upper extremities: 5/3 with left pronator drift. Lower extremities: 5/4 with LLE weakness evident throughout. Coordination: left sided weakness evident. Station: left pronator drift. Gait: left hemiparesis. Reflexes: 2/2 throughout. No clonus. Plantars were flexor bilaterally. Gen Exam: unremarkable. COURSE: The patient underwent emergent CT Brain. This revealed a perimesencephalic subarachnoid hemorrhage and contrast enhancing structures in the medial aspect of the parietotemporal region. She then underwent a 4-vessel cerebral angiogram. This study was unremarkable except for delayed transit of the contrast material through the vascular system of the brain and poor opacification of the straight sinus. This suggested straight sinus thromboses. MRI Brain was then done; this was unremarkable and did not show sign of central venous thrombosis. CBC/Blood Cx/ESR/PT/PTT/GS/CSF Cx/ANA were negative. Lumbar puncture on 12/1/87 revealed an opening pressure of 55cmH20, RBC18550, WBC25, 18neutrophils, 7lymphocytes, Protein25mg/dl, Glucose47mg/dl, Cx negative. The patient was assumed to have had a SAH secondary to central venous thrombosis due to oral contraceptive use. She recovered well, but returned to Neurology at age 32 for episodic blurred vision and lightheadedness. EEG was compatible with seizure tendency (right greater than left theta bursts from the mid-temporal regions), and she was recommended an anticonvulsant which she refused."
199,Neurology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left acoustic neuroma. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left acoustic neuroma. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Left retrosigmoid craniotomy and excision of acoustic neuroma. ANESTHESIA: General. OPERATIVE FINDINGS: This patient had a 3-cm acoustic neuroma. The tumor was incompletely excised leaving a remnant of the tumor along the cerebellopontine angle portion of the facial nerve. The facial nerve was stimulated at the brainstem at 0.05 milliamperes at the conclusion of the dissections. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: Following induction of adequate general anesthetic, the patient was positioned for surgery. She was placed in a lateral position and her head was maintained with Mayfield pins. The left periauricular area was shaved, prepped, and draped in the sterile fashion. Transdermal electrodes for continuous facial nerve EMG monitoring were placed, and no response was verified. The proposed incision was injected with 1% Xylocaine with epinephrine. Next, T-shaped incision was made approximately 5 cm behind the postauricular crease. The incision was undermined at the level of temporalis fascia, and the portion of the fascia was harvested for further use. Incision was made along the inferior aspect of the temporalis muscle and then extended inferiorly over the mastoid tip. Periosteal elevator was used to elevate periosteum in order to expose the mastoid and anterior aspect of the occipital bone. Emissary veins posterior to the sigmoid sinus were controlled with electrocautery and bone wax. Bergen retractors were used to maintain exposure. Using a cutting bur with continuous suction and irrigation of craniotomy was performed. The sigmoid sinus was identified anteriorly and the transverse sites were identified superiorly. From these structures approximately 4 x 4 cm, a window of bone was removed. Bone shavings were collected during the dissection and placed in Siloxane suspension for later use. The bone flap was also left at the site for further use. Dissection was extended along the inferior aspect of the sigmoid sinus to provide additional exposure of the skull base. Bone wax was used to occlude air cells lateral to the sigmoid sinus. There was extensively aerated temporal bone. At this point, Dr. Trask entered the case in order to open the dura and expose the tumor. The cerebellum was retracted away from the tumor, and the retractor was placed to help maintain exposure. Once initial exposure was completed, attention was directed to the posterior aspect of the temporal bone. The dura was excised from around the porous acusticus extending posteriorly along the bone. Then, using diamond burs, the internal auditory canal was dissected out. The bone was removed laterally for distance of approximately 8 mm. There was considerable aeration around the internal auditory canal as well. The dura was then incised over the internal auditory canal exposing the intracanalicular portion of the tumor. The tumor extended all the way to the fundus such that initial exposure of the facial nerve around the tumor was difficult. Therefore, Dr. Trask returned in order to further release the tumor from the brainstem and to debulk the central portions of the tumor. With dissection, he released the tumor from the trigeminal nerve superiorly and elevated the tumor away from the dorsal brainstem. The eighth nerve was identified and transected. Tumor debulking allowed for retraction of the tumor capsule away from the brainstem. The facial nerve was difficult to identify at the brainstem as well. It was identified by using an electrical stimulator but dissection attempted at this time was the plane between the nerve and the tumor proximally but this was difficult to achieve. Attention was then redirected to the internal auditory canal where this portion of the tumor was removed. The superior and inferior vestibular nerves were evulsed laterally and dissection proceeded along the facial nerve to the porous acusticus. At this point, plane of dissection was again indistinct. The tumor had been released from the porous and could be rotated. The tumor was further debulked and thinned, but could not crucially visualize the nerve on the anterior face of the tumor. The nerve could be stimulated, but was quite splayed over the anterior face. Further debulking of the tumor proceeded and additional attempts were made to establish point of dissection along the nerve, both proximally and distally. However, the cerebellopontine angle portion of the nerve was not usually delineated. However, the tumor was then thinned using CUSA down to fine sheath measuring only about 1 to 2 mm in thickness. It was released from the brainstem ventrally. The tumor was then cauterized with bipolar electrocautery. The facial nerve was stimulated at the brainstem and stimulated easily at 0.05 milliamperes. Overall, the remaining tumor volume would be of small percentage of the original volume. At this point, Dr. Trask re-inspected the posterior fossa to ensure complete hemostasis. The air cells around the internal auditory canal were packed off with muscle and bone wax. A piece of fascia was then laid over the bone defect. Next, the dura was closed with DuraGen and DuraSeal. The bone flap and bone ***** were then placed in the bone defect. Postauricular musculature was then reapproximated using interrupted 3-0 Vicryl sutures. The skin was also closed using interrupted subdermal 3-0 Vicryl sutures. Running 4-0 nylon suture was placed at the skin levels. Sterile mastoid dressing was then placed. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transported to the PACU in a stable condition. All counts were correct at the conclusion of the procedure. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 100 mL."
200,Neurology," SUBJECTIVE: The patient is a 75-year-old female who comes in today with concerns of having a stroke. She states she feels like she has something in her throat. She started with some dizziness this morning and some left hand and left jaw numbness. She said that she apparently had something about three weeks ago where she was dizzy and ended up falling down and she saw Dr. XYZ for that who gave her some Antivert. She said that today though she woke up in the middle of the night and her left hand was numb and she was having numbness on the left side of her face, as well as the left side of her neck. She said she had an earache a day or so ago. She has not had any cold symptoms. ALLERGIES: Demerol and codeine. MEDICATIONS: Lotensin, Lopid, metoprolol, and Darvocet. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: The patient says that she feels little bit nauseated at times. She denies chest pain or shortness of breath and again feels like she has something in her throat. She has been able to swallow liquids okay. She said that she did brush her teeth this morning and did not have any fluid dripping out of her mouth. She does say that she occasionally has numbness in her left hand prior to today. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: General: She is awake and alert, no acute distress. Vital Signs: Blood pressure: 175/86. Temperature: She is afebrile. Pulse: 78. Respiratory rate: 20. O2 sat: 93% on room air. HEENT: Her TMs are normal bilaterally. Posterior pharynx is unremarkable. It should be noted that her uvula did not deviate and neither did her tongue. When she smiles though she has some drooping of the left side of her face, as well as some mild nasolabial fold flattening. Neck: Without adenopathy or thyromegaly. Carotids pulses are brisk without bruits. Lungs: Clear to auscultation. Heart: Regular rate and rhythm without murmur. Extremities: Her muscle strength is symmetrical and intact bilaterally. DTRs are 2+/4+ bilaterally and muscle strength is intact in the upper extremities. She has a positive Tinel�s sign on her left wrist. Neurological: I also took monofilament and she could sense it easily when testing her sensation on her face. ASSESSMENT: Bell�s Palsy. PLAN: We did get an EKG showed some ST segment changes anterolaterally. The only EKG I have here is from 1998 and she actually had bypass in 1999, but there certainly does not appear to be anything acute on his EKG. I assured her that it does not look like she has a stroke. If she wants to prevent a stroke, obviously quitting her smoking would help. It should be noted she also takes Synthroid and Zocor. We are going to give her Valtrex 1 g t.i.d. for seven days and then if she starts noticing any other drooping or worsening of her symptoms on the left side of her face, she needs to come back, but I will not start her on steroids at this time, which she agreed with."
201,Neurology," NERVE CONDUCTION STUDIES: Bilateral ulnar sensory responses are absent. Bilateral median sensory distal latencies are prolonged with a severely attenuated evoked response amplitude. The left radial sensory response is normal and robust. Left sural response is absent. Left median motor distal latency is prolonged with attenuated evoked response amplitude. Conduction velocity across the forearm is mildly slowed. Right median motor distal latency is prolonged with a normal evoked response amplitude and conduction velocity. The left ulnar motor distal latency is prolonged with a severely attenuated evoked response amplitude both below and above the elbow. Conduction velocities across the forearm and across the elbow are prolonged. Conduction velocity proximal to the elbow is normal. The right median motor distal latency is normal with normal evoked response amplitudes at the wrist with a normal evoked response amplitude at the wrist. There is mild diminution of response around the elbow. Conduction velocity slows across the elbow. The left common peroneal motor distal latency evoked response amplitude is normal with slowed conduction velocity across the calf and across the fibula head. F-waves are prolonged. NEEDLE EMG: Needle EMG was performed on the left arm and lumbosacral and cervical paraspinal muscles as well as middle thoracic muscles using a disposable concentric needle. It revealed spontaneous activity in lower cervical paraspinals, left abductor pollicis brevis, and first dorsal interosseous muscles. There were signs of chronic reinnervation in triceps, extensor digitorum communis, flexor pollicis longus as well first dorsal interosseous and abductor pollicis brevis muscles. IMPRESSION: This electrical study is abnormal. It reveals the following: 1. A sensory motor length-dependent neuropathy consistent with diabetes. 2. A severe left ulnar neuropathy. This is probably at the elbow, although definitive localization cannot be made. 3. Moderate-to-severe left median neuropathy. This is also probably at the carpal tunnel, although definitive localization cannot be made. 4. Right ulnar neuropathy at the elbow, mild. 5. Right median neuropathy at the wrist consistent with carpal tunnel syndrome, moderate. 6. A left C8 radiculopathy (double crush syndrome). 7. There is no evidence for thoracic radiculitis. The patient has made very good response with respect to his abdominal pain since starting Neurontin. He still has mild allodynia and is waiting for authorization to get insurance coverage for his Lidoderm patch. He is still scheduled for MRI of C-spine and T-spine. I will see him in followup after the above scans."
202,Neurology," CC: Dysarthria HX: This 52y/o RHF was transferred from a local hospital to UIHC on 10/28/94 with a history of progressive worsening of vision, dysarthria, headache, and incoordination beginning since 2/94. Her husband recalled her first difficulties became noticeable after a motor vehicle accident in 2/94. She was a belted passenger in a car struck at a stop. There was no reported head or neck injury or alteration of consciousness. She was treated and released from a local ER the same day. Her husband noted the development of mild dysarthria, incoordination, headache and exacerbation of preexisting lower back pain within 2 week of the accident. In 4/94 she developed stress urinary incontinence which spontaneously resolved in June. In 8/94, her HA changed from a dull constant aching in the bitemporal region to a sharper constant pain in the nuchal/occipital area. She also began experiencing increased blurred vision, worsening dysarthria and difficulty hand writing. In 9/94 she was evaluated by a local physician. Examination then revealed incoordination, generalized fatigue, and dysarthria. Soon after this she became poorly arousable and increasingly somnolent. She had difficulty walking and generalized weakness. On 10/14/94, she lost the ability to walk by herself. Evaluation at a local hospital revealed: 1)Normal electronystagmography, 2)two lumbar punctures which revealed some atypical mononuclear cells suggestive of &quot;tumor or reactive lymphocytosis.&quot; One of these CSF analysis showed: Glucose 16, Protein 99, WBC 14, RBC 114. Echocardiogram was normal. Bone marrow biopsy was normal except for decreased iron. Abdominal-Pelvic CT scan, CXR, Mammogram, PPD, ANA, TFT, and RPR were unremarkable. A 10/31/94 MRI brain scan a 5x10mm area of increased signal on T2 weighted images in the right remporal lobe lateral to the anterior aspect of the temporal horn, right posterolateral aspect of the midbrain, pons, and bilateral inferior surface of the cerebellum involving gray and white matter. These areas did not enhance with gadolinium contrast on T1 weighted images. MEDS: none. PMH: 1)G3P3, 2)last menses one year ago. FHX: Mother suffered stroke in her 70's. DM and Htn in family. SHX: Married, Secretary, No h/o tobacco/ETOH/illicit drug use. ROS: no weight loss, fever, chills, nightsweats, cough, dysphagia. EXAM: BP139/74, HR 90, RR20, 36.8C MS: Drowsy to somnolent, occasionally &quot;giddy.&quot; Oriented to person, place, time. Minimal dysarthric speech, but appropriate. MMSE 27/30 (copy of exam not in chart). CN: Pupils 4/4 decreasing to 2/2 on exposure to light. Optic disks were flat and without sign of papilledema. VFFTC. EOM intact. No nystagmus. The rest of the CN exam was unremarkable. Motor: 5/5 strength throughout. Normal muscle tone and bulk. Sensory: No deficit to LT/PP/VIB/PROP. Coord: difficulty with RAM in BUE, and ataxia on FNF and HKS in all extremities. Station: Romberg sign present. Gait: unsteady, wide-based, with notable difficulty on TW, TT and HW. Reflexes: 2/2 BUE, 0/1 patellae, trace at both archilles, Plantars responses were flexor, bilaterally. Gen Exam: unremarkable. COURSE: CSF analysis by lumbar puncture, 10/31/94: Protein 131mg/dl (normal 15-45), Albumin 68 (normal 14-20), IgG10mg/dl (normal &lt;6.2), IgG index -O.1mg/24hr (normal), No oligoclonal bands seen, WBC 33 (19lymphocytes, 1 neutrophil), RBC 29, Glucose 13, Cultures (bacteria, fungal, AFB) were negative, crytococcal Ag negative. The elevated CSF total protein, IgG, and albumin suggested breakdown of the blood brain barrier or blockage of CSF flow. The normal IgG synthesis rate and lack of oligoclonal banding did not suggest demylination. A second CSF analysis on 11/2/94 revealed similar findings; and in addition Anti-purkinje cell and Anti-neuronal antibodies (Yo and Ho) were not found; Beta-2 microglobulin was 1.8 (normal); histoplasmosis Ag negative. Serum ACE, SPEP, Urine histoplasmin were negative. Neuropsychologic assessment, 10/28/94, raised a question of a demential syndrome, but given her response style on the MMPI (marked defensiveness, with unwillingness to admit to even very common human faults) prevented such a diagnosis. Severe defects in memory, fine motor skills, and constructional praxis were noted. Chest-Abdominal-Pelvic CT scans were negative. 11/4/94 cerebral angiogram noted variable caliber in the RMCA, LACA and Left AICA distributions. It was intially thought that thismight be suggestive of a vasculopathy and she was treated with a short course of IV steroids. Temporal artery biopsy was unremarkable. She underwent multiple MRI brain scans at UIHC: 11/4/94, 11/9/94, 11/16/94. All scans consistently showed increase in T2 signal in the brainstem, cerebellar peduncles and temporal lobes bilaterally. These areas did not enhance with gadolinium contrast. These findings were felt most suggestive of glioma. She underwent left temporal lobe brain biopsy on 11/10/94: This study was inconclusive and showed evidence of atypical mononuclear cells and lymphocytes in the perivascular and subarachnoid spaces. Despite cytologic atypia the cells were felt to be reactive in nature, since immunohistochemical stains failed to disclose lymphoid clonality or non-leukocytic phenomena. Little sign of vasculopathy or tumor was found. Bacterial, fungal , HSV, CMV and AFB cultures were negative. HSV, and VZV antigen was negative. Her neurological state progressively worsened throughout her hospital stay. By time of discharge, 12/2/94, she was very somnolent and difficult to arouse and required NGT feeding and 24hour supportive care. She was made DNR after family request prior to transfer to a care facility."
203,Neurology," CC: Confusion and slurred speech. HX (primarily obtained from boyfriend): This 31 y/o RHF experienced a &quot;flu-like illness 6-8 weeks prior to presentation. 3-4 weeks prior to presentation, she was found &quot;passed out&quot; in bed, and when awoken appeared confused, and lethargic. She apparently recovered within 24 hours. For two weeks prior to presentation she demonstrated emotional lability, uncharacteristic of her ( outbursts of anger and inappropriate laughter). She left a stove on. She began slurring her speech 2 days prior to admission. On the day of presentation she developed right facial weakness and began stumbling to the right. She denied any associated headache, nausea, vomiting, fever, chills, neck stiffness or visual change. There was no history of illicit drug/ETOH use or head trauma. PMH: Migraine Headache. FHX: Unremarkable. SHX: Divorced. Lives with boyfriend. 3 children alive and well. Denied tobacco/illicit drug use. Rarely consumes ETOH. ROS: Irregular menses. EXAM: BP118/66. HR83. RR 20. T36.8C. MS: Alert and oriented to name only. Perseverative thought processes. Utilized only one or two word answers/phrases. Non-fluent. Rarely followed commands. Impaired writing of name. CN: Flattened right nasolabial fold only. Motor: Mild weakness in RUE manifested by pronator drift. Other extremities were full strength. Sensory: withdrew to noxious stimulation in all 4 extremities. Coordination: difficult to assess. Station: Right pronator drift. Gait: unremarkable. Reflexes: 2/2BUE, 3/3BLE, Plantars were flexor bilaterally. General Exam: unremarkable. INITIAL STUDIES: CBC, GS, UA, PT, PTT, ESR, CRP, EKG were all unremarkable. Outside HCT showed hypodensities in the right putamen, left caudate, and at several subcortical locations (not specified). COURSE: MRI Brian Scan, 2/11/92 revealed an old lacunar infarct in the right basal ganglia, edema within the head of the left caudate nucleus suggesting an acute ischemic event, and arterial enhancement of the left MCA distribution suggesting slow flow. The latter suggested a vasculopathy such as Moya Moya, or fibromuscular dysplasia. HIV, ANA, Anti-cardiolipin Antibody titer, Cardiac enzymes, TFTs, B12, and cholesterol studies were unremarkable. She underwent a cerebral angiogram on 2/12/92. This revealed an occlusion of the left MCA just distal to its origin. The distal distribution of the left MCA filled on later films through collaterals from the left ACA. There was also an occlusion of the right MCA just distal to the temporal branch. Distal branches of the right MCA filled through collaterals from the right ACA. No other vascular abnormalities were noted. These findings were felt to be atypical but nevertheless suspicious of a large caliber vasculitis such as Moya Moya disease. She was subsequently given this diagnosis. Neuropsychologic testing revealed widespread cognitive dysfunction with particular impairment of language function. She had long latencies responding and understood only simple questions. Affect was blunted and there was distinct lack of concern regarding her condition. She was subsequently discharged home on no medications. In 9/92 she was admitted for sudden onset right hemiparesis and mental status change. Exam revealed the hemiparesis and in addition she was found to have significant neck lymphadenopathy. OB/GYN exam including cervical biopsy, and abdominal/pelvic CT scanning revealed stage IV squamous cell cancer of the cervix. She died 9/24/92 of cervical cancer."
204,Neurology," CC: Left third digit numbness and wrist pain. HX: This 44 y/o LHM presented with a one month history of numbness and pain of the left middle finger and wrist. The numbness began in the left middle finger and gradually progressed over the course of a day to involve his wrist as well. Within a few days he developed pain in his wrist. He had been working as a cook and cut fish for prolonged periods of time. This activity exacerbated his symptoms. He denied any bowel/bladder difficulties, neck pain, or weakness. He had no history of neck injury. SHX/FHX: 1-2 ppd Cigarettes. Married. Off work for two weeks due to complaints. EXAM: Vital signs unremarkable. MS: A & O to person, place, time.

SENSORY: Decreased PP in third digit of left hand only (palmar and dorsal sides). STATION/GAIT/COORD: Unremarkable. REFLEXES: 1+ throughout, plantar responses were downgoing bilaterally. GEN EXAM: Unremarkable. Tinel's manuever elicited pain and numbness on the left. Phalens sign present on the left. CLINICAL IMPRESSION: Left Carpal Tunnel Syndrome EMG/NCV: Unremarkable. MRI C-spine, 12/1/92: Congenitally small spinal canal is present. Superimposed on this is mild spondylosis and disc bulge at C6-7, C5-6, C4-5, and C3-4. There is moderate central spinal stenosis at C3-4. Intervertebral foramina at these levels appear widely patent. COURSE: The MRI findings did not correlate with the clinical findings and history. The patient was placed on Elavil and was subsequently lost to follow-up."
205,Neurology," I had the pleasure of reevaluating Ms. A in our neurology clinic today for history of right upper pons and right cerebral peduncle infarction in April of 2008. Since her last visit in May of 2009, Ms. A stated that there has been no concern. She continues to complain of having mild weakness on the left leg at times and occasional off and on numbness in the left hand. She denied any weakness in the arm. She stated that she is ambulating with a cane. She denied any history of falls. Recently, she has also had repeat carotid Dopplers or further imaging studies of which we have no results of stating that she has further increased stenosis in her left internal carotid artery and there is a plan for surgery at Hospital with Dr. X. Of note, we have no notes to confirm that. Her daughter stated that she has planned for the surgery. Ms. A on today's office visit had no other complaints. FAMILY HISTORY AND SOCIAL HISTORY: Reviewed and remained unchanged. MEDICATIONS: List remained unchanged including Plavix, aspirin, levothyroxine, lisinopril, hydrochlorothiazide, Lasix, insulin and simvastatin. ALLERGIES: She has no known drug allergies. FALL RISK ASSESSMENT: Completed and there was no history of falls. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Full review of systems again was pertinent for shortness of breath, lack of energy, diabetes, hypothyroidism, weakness, numbness and joint pain. Rest of them was negative. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital Signs: Today, blood pressure was 170/66, heart rate was 66, respiratory rate was 16, she weighed 254 pounds as stated, and temperature was 98.0. General: She was a pleasant person in no acute distress. HEENT: Normocephalic and atraumatic. No dry mouth. No palpable cervical lymph nodes. Her conjunctivae and sclerae were clear. NEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION: Remained unchanged. Mental Status: Normal. Cranial Nerves: Mild decrease in the left nasolabial fold. Motor: There was mild increased tone in the left upper extremity. Deltoids showed 5-/5. The rest showed full strength. Hip flexion again was 5-/5 on the left. The rest showed full strength. Reflexes: Reflexes were hypoactive and symmetrical. Gait: She was mildly abnormal. No ataxia noted. Wide-based, ambulated with a cane. IMPRESSION: Status post cerebrovascular accident involving the right upper pons extending into the right cerebral peduncle with a mild left hemiparesis, has been clinically stable with mild improvement. She is planned for surgical intervention for the internal carotid artery. RECOMMENDATIONS: At this time, again we discussed continued use of antiplatelet therapy and statin therapy to reduce her risk of future strokes. She will continue to follow with endocrinology for diabetes and thyroid problems. I have recommended a strict control of her blood sugar, optimizing cholesterol and blood pressure control, regular exercise and healthy diet and I have discussed with Ms. A and her daughter to give us a call for post surgical recovery. I will see her back in about four months or sooner if needed."

208,Neurology, TIME SEEN: 0734 hours and 1034 hours. TOTAL RECORDING TIME: 27 hours 4 minutes. PATIENT HISTORY: This is a 43-year-old female with a history of events concerning for seizures. Video EEG monitoring is performed to capture events and/or identify etiology. VIDEO EEG DIAGNOSES 1. AWAKE: Normal. 2. SLEEP: No activation. 3. CLINICAL EVENTS: None. DESCRIPTION: Approximately 27 hours of continuous 21-channel digital video EEG monitoring was performed. The waking background is unchanged from that previously reported. Hyperventilation produced no changes in the resting record. Photic stimulation failed to elicit a well-developed photic driving response. Approximately five-and-half hours of spontaneous intermittent sleep was obtained. Sleep spindles were present and symmetric. The patient had no clinical events during the recording. CLINICAL INTERPRETATION: This is normal video EEG monitoring for a patient of this age. No interictal epileptiform activity was identified. The patient had no clinical events during the recording. Clinical correlation is required.
209,Neurology," CC: Vertigo. HX: This 61y/o RHF experienced a 2-3 minute episode of lightheadedness while driving home from the dentist in 5/92. In 11/92, while eating breakfast, she suddenly experienced vertigo. This was immediately followed by nausea and several episodes of vomiting. The vertigo lasted 2-3minutes. She retired to her room for a 2 hour nap after vomiting. When she awoke, the symptoms had resolved. On 1/13/93 she had an episode of right arm numbness lasting 4-5hours. There was no associated weakness, HA, dysarthria, dysphagia, visual change, vertigo or lightheadedness. OUTSIDE RECORDS: 12/16/92 Carotid Doppler (RICA 30-40%, LICA 10-20%). 12/4/92, brain MRI revealed a right cerebellar hypodensity consistent with infarct.

FHX: Father died of a thoracic aortic aneurysm, age 71. Mother died of stroke, age 81. SHX: Married. One son deceased. Salesperson. Denied tobacco/ETOH/illicit drug use. EXAM: BP (RUE)132/72 LUE (136/76). HR67 RR16 Afebrile. 59.2kg. MS: A&O to person, place, time. Speech fluent and without dysarthria. Thought lucid. CN: unremarkable. Motor: 5/5 strength throughout with normal muscle bulk and tone. Sensory: No deficits appreciated. Coord: unremarkable. Station: no pronator drift, truncal ataxia, or Romberg sign. Gait: not done. Reflexes: 2/2 throughout BUE and at patellae. 1/1 at Achilles. Plantar responses were flexor, bilaterally. Gen Exam: Obese. COURSE: CBC, GS, PT/PTT, UA were unremarkable. The patient was admitted with a working diagnosis of posterior circulation TIA and history of cerebellar stroke. She was placed on Ticlid 250mg bid. HCT,1/15/93: low density focus in the right medial and posterior cerebellar hemisphere. MRI and MRA, 1/18/93, revealed a well circumscribed lesion within the posterior aspect of the right cerebellar hemisphere suggestive of vascular malformation (e.g. cavernous angioma. An abnormal vascular blush was seen on the MRA. This area appeared to be supplied by one of the external carotid arteries (which one is was not specified). this finding maybe suggestive of a vascular malformation. 1/20/93 Cerebral Angiogram: The right cerebellar hemisphere lesion seen on MRI as a possible cavernous angioma was not seen on angiography. Upon review of the MRI and HCT the lesion was felt to probably represent an old infarction with hemosiderin deposition. The &quot;vascular blush&quot; seen on MRA was no visualized on angiography. The patient was discharged home on 1/25/93."
210,Neurology," PROCEDURE: EEG during wakefulness demonstrates background activity consisting of moderate-amplitude beta activity seen bilaterally. The EEG background is symmetric. Independent, small, positive, sharp wave activity is seen in the frontotemporal regions bilaterally with sharp-slow wave discharges seen more predominantly in the right frontotemporal head region. No clinical signs of involuntary movements are noted during synchronous video monitoring. Recording time is 22 minutes and 22 seconds. There is attenuation of the background, faster activity during drowsiness and some light sleep is recorded. No sustained epileptogenic activity is evident, but the independent bilateral sharp wave activity is seen intermittently. Photic stimulation induced a bilaterally symmetric photic driving response. IMPRESSION: EEG during wakefulness and light sleep is abnormal with independent, positive sharp wave activity seen in both frontotemporal head regions, more predominant in the right frontotemporal region. The EEG findings are consistent with potentially epileptogenic process. Clinical correlation is warranted."
211,Neurology," PROCEDURES PERFORMED: Botulinum toxin injection bilateral rectus femoris, medial hamstrings, and gastrocnemius soleus muscles, phenol neurolysis of bilateral obturator nerves, application of bilateral short leg fiberglass casts. PROCEDURE CODES: 64640 times two, 64614 time two, 95873 times two, 29405 times two. PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Spastic diplegic cerebral palsy, 343.0. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Spastic diplegic cerebral palsy, 343.0. ANESTHESIA: MAC. COMPLICATIONS: None. DESCRIPTION OF TECHNIQUE: Informed consent was obtained from the patient's mom. The patient was brought to minor procedures and sedated per their protocol. The patient was positioned lying supine. Skin overlying all areas injected was prepped with chlorhexidine. The obturator nerves were identified lateral to the adductor longus tendon origin and below the femoral pulse with active EMG stimulation. Approximately 4 mL of 5% phenol was injected in this location bilaterally. Phenol injections were done at the site of maximum hip adduction contraction with least amount of stimulus. Negative drawback for blood was done prior to each injection of phenol. Muscles injected with botulinum toxin were identified with active EMG stimulation. Approximately 50 units was injected in the rectus femoris bilaterally, 75 units in the medial hamstrings bilaterally and 100 units in the gastrocnemius soleus muscles bilaterally. Total amount of botulinum toxin injected was 450 units diluted 25 units to 1 mL. After injections were performed, bilateral short leg fiberglass casts were applied. The patient tolerated the procedure well and no complications were encountered."
212,Neurology," CHIEF COMPLAINT: Right shoulder pain. HISTORY: The patient is a pleasant, 31-year-old, right-handed, white female who injured her shoulder while transferring a patient back on 01/01/02. She formerly worked for Veteran's Home as a CNA. She has had a long drawn out course of treatment for this shoulder. She tried physical therapy without benefit and ultimately came to a subacromion decompression in November 2002. She had ongoing pain and was evaluated by Dr. X who felt that she had a possible brachial plexopathy. He also felt she had a right superficial radial neuritis and blocked this with resolution of her symptoms. He then referred her to ABCD who did EMG testing, demonstrating a right suprascapular neuropathy although a C5 radiculopathy could not be ruled out. MRI testing on the cervical spine was then done which was negative for disk herniation and she underwent suprascapular nerve decompression of the scapular notch on 12/18/03. She finally went to an anterior axillary nerve block because of ongoing pain in the anterior shoulder again by Dr. X. She comes to me for impairment rating. She has no chronic health problems otherwise, fevers, chills, or general malaise. She is not working. She is right-hand dominant. She denies any prior history of injury to her shoulder. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Negative aside from above. FAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory. SOCIAL HISTORY: Please see above. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Negative aside from above. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: A pleasant, age appropriate woman, moderately overweight, in no apparent distress. Normal gait and station, normal posture, normal strength, tone, sensation and deep tendon reflexes with the exception of 4+/5 strength in the supraspinatus musculature on the right. She has decreased motion in the right shoulder as follows. She has 160 degrees of flexion, 155 degrees of abduction, 35 degrees of extension, 25 degrees of adduction, 45 degrees of internal rotation and 90 degrees of external rotation. She has a positive impingement sign on the right. ASSESSMENT: Right shoulder impingement syndrome, right suprascapular neuropathy. DISCUSSION: With a reasonable degree of medical certainty, she is at maximum medical improvement and she does have an impairment based on AMA Guide to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment, Fifth Edition. The reason for this impairment is the incident of 01/01/02. For her suprascapular neuropathy, she is rated as a grade IV motor deficit which I rate as a 13% motor deficit. This is multiplied by a maximum upper extremity impairment for involvement of the suprascapular nerve of 16% which produces a 2% impairment of the upper extremity when the two values are multiplied together, 2% impairment of the upper extremity. For her lack of motion in the shoulder she also has additional impairment on the right. She has a 1% impairment of the upper extremity due to lack of shoulder flexion. She has a 1% impairment of the upper extremity due to lack of shoulder abduction. She has a 1% impairment of the upper extremity due to lack of shoulder adduction. She has a 1% impairment of the upper extremity due to lack of shoulder extension. There is no impairment for findings in shoulder external rotation. She has a 3% impairment of the upper extremity due to lack of shoulder internal rotation. Thus the impairment due to lack of motion in her shoulder is a 6% impairment of the upper extremity. This combines with the 2% impairment of the upper extremity due to weakness in the suprascapular nerve root distribution to produce an 8% impairment of the upper extremity which in turn is a 5% impairment of the whole person based on the AMA Guide to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment, Fifth Edition, stated with a reasonable degree of medical certainty."
213,Neurology," REASON FOR VISIT: The patient is an 11-month-old with a diagnosis of stage 2 neuroblastoma here for ongoing management of his disease and the visit is supervised by Dr. X. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is an 11-month-old with neuroblastoma, which initially presented on the left when he was 6 weeks old and was completely resected. It was felt to be stage 2. It was not N-Myc amplified and had favorable Shimada histology. In followup, he was found to have a second primary in his right adrenal gland, which was biopsied and also consistent with neuroblastoma with favorable Shimada histology. He is now being treated with chemotherapy per protocol P9641 and not on study. He last received chemotherapy on 05/21/07, with carboplatin, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin. He received G-CSF daily after his chemotherapy due to neutropenia that delayed his second cycle. In the interval since he was last seen, his mother reports that he had a couple of days of nasal congestion, but it is now improving. He is not acted ill or had any fevers. He has had somewhat diminished appetite, but it seems to be improving now. He is peeing and pooping normally and has not had any diarrhea. He did not have any appreciated nausea or vomiting. He has been restarted on fluconazole due to having redeveloped thrush recently. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: The following systems reviewed and negative per pathology except as noted above. Eyes, ears, throat, cardiovascular, GI, genitourinary, musculoskeletal skin, and neurologic. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Reviewed as above and otherwise unchanged. FAMILY HISTORY: Reviewed and unchanged. SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient's parents continued to undergo a separation and divorce. The patient spends time with his father and his family during the first part of the week and with his mother during the second part of the week. MEDICATIONS: 1. Bactrim 32 mg by mouth twice a day on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. 2. G-CSF 50 mcg subcutaneously given daily in his thighs alternating with each dose. 3. Fluconazole 37.5 mg daily. 4. Zofran 1.5 mg every 6 hours as needed for nausea. ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies. FINDINGS: A detailed physical exam revealed a very active and intractable, well-nourished 11-month-old male with weight 10.5 kilos and height 76.8 cm. Vital Signs: Temperature is 35.3 degrees Celsius, pulse is 121 beats per minute, respiratory rate 32 breaths per minute, blood pressure 135/74 mmHg. Eyes: Conjunctivae are clear, nonicteric. Pupils are equally round and reactive to light. Extraocular muscle movements appear intact with no strabismus. Ears: TMs are clear bilaterally. Oral Mucosa: No thrush is appreciated. No mucosal ulcerations or erythema. Chest: Port-a-Cath is nonerythematous and nontender to VP access port. Respiratory: Good aeration, clear to auscultation bilaterally. Cardiovascular: Regular rate, normal S1 and S2, no murmurs appreciated. Abdomen is soft, nontender, and no organomegaly, unable to appreciate a right-sided abdominal mass or any other masses. Skin: No rashes. Neurologic: The patient walks without assistance, frequently falls on his bottom. LABORATORY STUDIES: CBC and comprehensive metabolic panel were obtained and they are significant for AST 51, white blood cell count 11,440, hemoglobin 10.9, and platelets 202,000 with ANC 2974. Medical tests none. Radiologic studies are none. ASSESSMENT: This patient's disease is life threatening, currently causing moderately severe side effects. PROBLEMS DIAGNOSES: 1. Neuroblastoma of the right adrenal gland with favorable Shimada histology. 2. History of stage 2 left adrenal neuroblastoma, status post gross total resection. 3. Immunosuppression. 4. Mucosal candidiasis. 5. Resolving neutropenia. PROCEDURES AND IMMUNIZATIONS: None. PLANS: 1. Neuroblastoma. The patient will return to the Pediatric Oncology Clinic on 06/13/07 to 06/15/07 for his third cycle of chemotherapy. I will plan for restaging with CT of the abdomen prior to the cycle. 2. Immunosuppression. The patient will continue on his Bactrim twice a day on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. Additionally, we will tentatively plan to have him continue fluconazole since this is his second episode of thrush. 3. Mucosal candidiasis. We will continue fluconazole for thrush. I am pleased that the clinical evidence of disease appears to have resolved. For resolving neutropenia, I advised Gregory's mother about it is okay to discontinue the G-CSF at this time. We will plan for him to resume G-CSF after his next chemotherapy and prescription has been sent to the patient's pharmacy. PEDIATRIC ONCOLOGY ATTENDING: I have reviewed the history of the patient. This is an 11-month-old with neuroblastoma who received chemotherapy with carboplatin, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin on 05/21/07 for cycle 2 of POG-9641 due to his prior history of neutropenia, he has been on G-CSF. His ANC is nicely recovered. He will have a restaging CT prior to his next cycle of chemotherapy and then return for cycle 3 chemotherapy on 06/13/07 to 06/15/07. He continues on fluconazole for recent history of thrush. Plans are otherwise documented above."
214,Neurology," EXAM: MRI head without contrast. REASON FOR EXAM: Severe headaches. INTERPRETATION: Imaging was performed in the axial and sagittal planes using numerous pulse sequences at 1 tesla. Correlation is made with the head CT of 4/18/05. On the diffusion sequence, there is no significant bright signal to indicate acute infarction. There is a large degree of increased signal involving the periventricular white matter extending around to the subcortical regions in symmetrical fashion consistent with chronic microvascular ischemic disease. There is mild chronic ischemic change involving the pons bilaterally, slightly greater on the right, and when correlating with the recent scan, there is an old tiny lacunar infarct of the right brachium pontis measuring roughly 4 mm in size. There are prominent perivascular spaces of the lenticulostriate distribution compatible with the overall degree of moderate to moderately advanced atrophy. There is an old moderate-sized infarct of the mid and lateral aspects of the right cerebellar hemisphere as seen on the recent CT scan. This involves mostly the superior portion of the hemisphere in the superior cerebellar artery distribution. No abnormal mass effect is identified. There are no findings to suggest active hydrocephalus. No abnormal extra-axial collection is identified. There is normal flow void demonstrated in the major vascular systems. The sagittal sequence demonstrates no Chiari malformation. The region of the pituitary/optic chiasm grossly appears normal. The mastoids and paranasal sinuses are clear. IMPRESSION: 1. No definite acute findings identified involving the brain. 2. There is prominent chronic cerebral ischemic change as described with mild chronic pontine ischemic changes. There is an old moderate-sized infarct of the superior portion of the right cerebellar hemisphere. 3. Moderate to moderately advanced atrophy."
215,Neurology," REASON FOR VISIT: This is a new patient evaluation for Mr. A. There is a malignant meningioma. He is referred by Dr. X. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: He said he has had two surgeries in 07/06 followed by radiation and then again in 08/07. He then had a problem with seizures, hemiparesis, has been to the hospital, developed C-diff, and is in the nursing home currently. He is unable to stand at the moment. He is unable to care for himself. I reviewed the information that was sent down with him from the nursing home which includes his medical history. MEDICATIONS: Keppra 1500 twice a day and Decadron 6 mg four times a day. His other medicines include oxycodone, an aspirin a day, Prilosec, Dilantin 300 a day, and Flagyl. FINDINGS: On examination, he is lying on the stretcher. He has oxygen on and has periods of spontaneous hyperventilation. He is unable to lift his right arm or right leg. He has an expressive dysphasia and confusion. I reviewed the imaging studies from summer from the beginning of 10/07, end of 10/07 as well as the current MRI he had last week. This shows that he has had progression of disease with recurrence along the surface of the brain and there is significant brain edema. This is a malignant meningioma by diagnosis. ASSESSMENT/PLAN: In summary, Mr. A has significant disability and is not independent currently. I believe that because of this that the likelihood of benefit from surgery is small and there is a very good chance that he would not be able to recover from surgery. I do not think that surgery will help his quality of life and a need to control the tumor would be dependent on another therapy impacting the tumor. Given that there are not good therapies and chemotherapy would be the option at the moment, and he certainly is not in a condition where chemotherapy would be given, I believe that surgery would not be in his best interest. I discussed this both with him, although it is not clear to me how much he understood, as well as his family."
216,Neurology," REASON FOR CONSULT: Essential tremor and torticollis. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 62-year-old right-handed now left-handed white female with tremor since 5th grade. She remembers that the tremors started in her right hand around that time subsequently later on in early 20s she was put on propranolol for the tremor and more recently within the last 10 years she has been put on primidone and clonazepam. She thinks that her clonazepam is helping her a lot especially with anxiety and stress, and this makes the tremor better. She has a lot of trouble with her writing because of tremor but does not report as much problem with other activities of daily living like drinking from a cup and doing her day-to-day activity. Since around 6 to 7 years, she has had a head tremor, which is mainly &quot;no- no&quot; and occasional voice tremor also. Additionally, the patient has been diagnosed with migraine headaches without aura, which are far and few apart. She also has some stress incontinence. Last MRI brain was done in 2001 reportedly normal. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: 1. Klonopin 0.5 mg twice a day. 2. Primidone 100 mg b.i.d. 3. Propranolol long-acting 80 mg once in the morning. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Essential tremor, cervical dystonia, endometriosis, migraine headaches without aura, left ear sensorineural deafness, and basal cell carcinoma resection on the nose. PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: L5-S1 lumbar laminectomy in 1975, exploratory laparotomy in 1967, tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy, and anal fissure surgery in 1975. FAMILY HISTORY: Both parents have ET and hypertension. Maternal cousin with lupus. SOCIAL HISTORY: Denies any smoking or alcohol. She is married since 44 years, has 3 children. She used to work as a labor and delivery nurse up until early 2001 when she retired. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: No fever, chills, nausea or vomiting. No visual complaints. She complains of hearing decreased on the left. No chest pain or shortness of breath. No constipation. She does give a history of urge incontinence. No rashes. No depressive symptoms. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Blood pressure is 131/72, pulse is 50, and weight is 71.3 kg. HEENT: PERRLA. EOMI. CARDIOVASCULAR: S1 and S2 normal. Regular rate and rhythm. She does have a rash over the right ankle with a prior basal cell carcinoma was resected. NEUROLOGIC: Alert and oriented x4. Speech shows a voice tremor occasionally. Language is intact. Cranial nerves II through XII intact. Motor examination showed 5/5 power in all extremities with minimal increased tone. Sensory examination was intact to light touch. Reflexes were brisk bilaterally, but they were equal and both toes were downgoing. Her coordination showed minimal intentional component to bilateral finger-to-nose. Gait was intact. Lot of swing on Romberg's. The patient did have a tremor both upper extremities, right more than left. She did have a head tremor, which was no-no variety, and she had a minimal torticollis with her head twisted to the left. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: This 62-year-old white female has essential tremor and mild torticollis. Tremor not bothersome for most activities of daily living, but she does have a great difficulty writing, which is totally illegible. The patient did not wish to change any of her medication doses at this point. We will go ahead and check MRI brain, and we will get the films later. We will see her back in 3 months. Also, the patient declined any possible Botox for the mild torticollis she has at this point."
217,Neurology," CC: Headache. HX: The patient is an 8y/o RHM with a 2 year history of early morning headaches (3:00-6:00AM) intermittently relieved by vomiting only. He had been evaluated 2 years ago and an EEG was &quot;normal&quot; then, but no brain imaging was performed. His headaches progressively worsened, especially in the past two months prior to this presentation. For 2 weeks prior to his 1/25/93 evaluation at UIHC, he would awake screaming. His parent spoke with a local physician who thought this might be due to irritability secondary to pinworms and Vermox was prescribed and arrangements were made for a neurologic evaluation. On the evening of 1/24/93 the patient awoke screaming and began to vomit. This was followed by a 10 min period of tonic-clonic type movements and postictal lethargy. He was taken to a local ER and a brain CT revealed an intracranial mass. He was given Decadron and Phenytoin and transferred to UIHC for further evaluation. MEDS: noted above. PMH: 1)Born at 37.5 weeks gestation by uncomplicated vaginal delivery to a G1P0 mother. Pregnancy complicated by vaginal bleeding at 7 months. Met developmental milestones without difficulty. 2) Frequent otitis media, now resolved. 3) Immunizations were &quot;up to date.&quot; FHX: non-contributory. SHX: lives with biologic father and mother. No siblings. In 3rd grade (mainstream) and maintaining good marks in schools. EXAM: BP121/57mmHg HR103 RR16 36.9C MS: Sleepy, but cooperative. CN: EOM full and smooth. Advanced papilledema, OU. VFFTC. Pupils 4/4 decreasing to 2/2. Right lower facial weakness. Tongue midline upon protrusion. Corneal reflexes intact bilaterally. Motor: 5/5 strength. Slightly increased muscle on right side. Sensory. No deficit to PP/VIB noted. Coord: normal FNF, HKS and RAM, bilaterally. Station: Mild truncal ataxia. Tends to fall backward. Reflexes: BUE 2+/2+, Patellar 3/3, Ankles 3+/3+ with 6 beats of nonsustained clonus bilaterally. Gen exam: unremarkable. COURSE: The patient was continued on Dilantin 200mg qd and Decadron 5mg IV q6hrs. Brain MRI, 1/26/93, revealed a large mass lesion in the region of the left caudate nucleus and thalamus which was hyperintense on T2 weighted images. There were areas of cystic formation at its periphery. The mass appeared to enhance on post gadolinium images. there was associated white matter edema and compression of the left lateral ventricle, and midline shift to the right. There was no sign of uncal herniation. He underwent bilateral VP shunting on 1/26/93; and then, subtotal resection (left frontal craniotomy with excision of the left caudate and thalamus with creation of an opening in the septum pellucidum) on 1/28/93. He then received 5040cGy of radiation therapy in 28 fractions completed on 3/25/93. A 3/20/95 neuropsychological evaluation revealed low average intellect on the WISC-III. There were also signs of memory, attention, reading and spelling deficits; and mild right-sided motor incoordination and mood variability. He remained in mainstream classes at school, but his physical and cognitive performance began to deteriorate in 4/95. Neurosurgical evaluation in 4/95 noted increased right hemiplegia and right homonymous hemianopia. MRI revealed tumor progression and he was subsequently placed on Carboplatin/VP-16 (CG 9933 protocol chemotherapy, regimen A). He was last seen on 4/96 and was having difficulty in the 6th grade; he was also undergoing physical therapy for his right hemiplegia."
218,Neurology," REPORT: This is an 18-channel recording obtained using the standard scalp and referential electrodes observing the 10/20 international system. The patient was reported to be cooperative and was awake throughout the recording. CLINICAL NOTE: This is a 51-year-old male, who is being evaluated for dizziness. Spontaneous activity is fairly well organized, characterized by low-to-medium voltage waves of about 8 to 9 Hz seen mainly from the posterior head region. Intermixed with it is a moderate amount of low voltage fast activity seen from the anterior head region. Eye opening caused a bilateral symmetrical block on the first run. In addition to the above description, movement of muscle and other artifacts are seen. On subsequent run, no additional findings were seen. During subsequent run, again no additional findings were seen. Hyperventilation was omitted. Photic stimulation was performed, but no clear-cut photic driving was seen. EKG was monitored during this recording and it showed normal sinus rhythm when monitored. IMPRESSION: This record is essentially within normal limits. Clinical correlation is recommended."
219,Neurology," CHIEF COMPLAINT: Recurrent dizziness x1 month. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 77-year-old African-American female with multiple medical problems including CHF (O2 dependent), atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, possible stroke, multiple joint disease including gout, arthritis, both rheumatoid and DJD, who presents with a complaint of one month of dizziness. She reports a rotational sensation upon arising from the bed or chair that lasts for several minutes and requires her to sit back down and stay in one place. She gets similar symptoms when she rolls over in bed. She is not able to describe what direction she feels like she is spinning. At times, she also feels as though she is going to pass out. These sensations stop if she just sits in one place or lies down for several minutes. She does note that it is worse when she turns to the right and when she turns to the left. She also complains that she gets similar sensations when she looks up. She denies any recent fever, chills, earache, diplopia, dysarthria, dysphagia, other change in vision, or recent new headaches. She also notes occasional tinnitus to her right ear. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. CHF (uses portable oxygen). 2. Atrial fibrillation. 3. Gout. 4. Arthritis (DJD/rheumatoid). 5. Diabetes mellitus. 6. Hypothyroidism. 7. Hypertension. 8. GERD. 9. Possible stroke treated in 2003 at University of Maryland with acute onset of presyncopal sensations, sharp pains in the left side of her head and right-sided hemiparesis and numbness. FAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory. SOCIAL HISTORY: She is married. She does not smoke, use alcohol or use illicit drugs. MEDICATIONS: Please see medication sheet in the chart. It includes potassium, Pravachol, Prevacid, Synthroid, Diovan, Amaryl, Vitamin B12, Coreg, Coumadin, furosemide, Actos, aspirin, colchicine, Cipro, Percocet, Ultram (has held the latter two medications for the past two weeks due to concerns of exacerbating dizziness). REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Please see note in chart essentially entirely positive including cardiovascular problems of shortness of breath, PND and palpitations, chronic lack of energy, weight gain, the dizziness for which she presented. Tinnitus in the right ear. Diabetes and hypothyroidism. Chronic nausea. Chronic severe musculoskeletal pains to all extremities as well as to chest and abdomen and back. Right-sided numbness as well as complaints of bilateral lower extremity numbness and difficulty walking. She says her mood is sad and may be depressed and she is also extremely anxious. She has chronic shortness of breath and coughs easily when has to breathe deeply. She also endorses poor sleep. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Sitting BP 112/84 with a pulse of 84, standing after two minutes 130/90 with a pulse of 66. Respiratory rate is 20. Weight is 257 pounds. Pain scale is 7. GENERAL: This is a somewhat anxious elderly African-American female who tends to amplify findings on examination. It is a difficult examination due to the fact that no matter where the patient was touched she would wince in pain and withdraw. She is obese. HEENT: She is normocephalic and atraumatic. Conjunctivae and sclerae are clear. Tympanic membranes were visualized bilaterally. There is tenderness to palpation of any sinus region. There are no palpable cervical nodes. NECK: Supple although she complains of pain when rotating her neck. CHEST: Clear to auscultation bilaterally. HEART: Heart sounds are distant. There are no carotid bruits. EXTREMITIES: She has 1-2+ pitting edema to the mid shins bilaterally. NEUROLOGIC EXAMINATION: MENTAL STATUS: She is alert and oriented x3. Her speech is fluent; however, she is extremely tangential. She is unable to give a cogent medical history including details of hospitalization one month ago when she was admitted for a gout attack and urinary tract infection and underwent several days of rehabilitation. CRANIAL NERVES: Cranial nerves are intact throughout; specifically there is no nystagmus, her gaze is conjugate, there is no diplopia, visual fields are full to confrontation, pupils are equal, round and reactive to light and accommodation, extraocular movements are intact, facial sensation and expression are symmetric, vestibuloocular reflexes are intact, hearing is intact to finger rub bilaterally, palate rises symmetrically, normal cough, shoulder shrug is symmetric which shows easy breakaway give, and tongue protrudes in the midline. MOTOR: This is a limited exam due to easy breakaway gait and pain that appears exaggerated to movement of any extremity. There is suggestion of some mild right-sided paresis; however, the degree was inconsistent and her phasic strength is estimated at 4-4+ throughout. Her tone is normal throughout. SENSORY: She appears to have diffuse light tough and pinprick and temperature to the right arm and proximal leg. She also reports that she is numb in both feet; however, sensation testing of light tough, pinprick and vibration was intact. COORDINATION: There is no obvious dysmetria. GAIT: She uses a walker to stand up, and several near falls when asked to stand unassisted and can only ambulate with a walker. There are some mild right lower extremity circumduction present. REFLEXES: Biceps 1, triceps trace, brachioradialis 1, patella and ankle absent. Toes are equivocal. OTHER: Barany maneuver was attempted; however, when the patient was placed supine she immediately began screaming, &quot;Oh my back, oh my back&quot;, and was unable to complete the maneuver. Brief inspection of her eyes failed to show any nystagmus at that time. IMPRESSION AND PLAN: This is a 77-year-old African-American female with multiple medical problems who presents with episodic positionally related dizziness of unclear etiology. Most certainly there is significant exaggeration of the underlying problem and her neurological examination is compounded by much functional overlay, limiting the interpretation of my findings. I suspect this is just a mild benign positional vertigo, although I cannot rule out vertebrobasilar compromise. I agree with symptomatic treatment with Antivert. We will schedule her for CT of head, CT angiogram to evaluate for possible brain stroke and vertebrobasilar insufficiency. In addition, we will attempt to get further objective data by ENG testing. I will see the patient again after these tests are completed and she has a trial of the Antivert."
220,Neurology," INTERPRETATION: MRI of the cervical spine without contrast showed normal vertebral body height and alignment with normal cervical cord signal. At C4-C5, there were minimal uncovertebral osteophytes with mild associated right foraminal compromise. At C5-C6, there were minimal diffuse disc bulge and uncovertebral osteophytes with indentation of the anterior thecal sac, but no cord deformity or foraminal compromise. At C6-C7, there was a central disc herniation resulting in mild deformity of the anterior aspect of the cord with patent neuroforamina. MRI of the thoracic spine showed normal vertebral body height and alignment. There was evidence of disc generation, especially anteriorly at the T5-T6 level. There was no significant central canal or foraminal compromise. Thoracic cord normal in signal morphology. MRI of the lumbar spine showed normal vertebral body height and alignment. There is disc desiccation at L4-L5 and L5-S1 with no significant central canal or foraminal stenosis at L1-L2, L2-L3, and L3-L4. There was a right paracentral disc protrusion at L4-L5 narrowing of the right lateral recess. The transversing nerve root on the right was impinged at that level. The right foramen was mildly compromised. There was also a central disc protrusion seen at the L5-S1 level resulting in indentation of the anterior thecal sac and minimal bilateral foraminal compromise. IMPRESSION: Overall impression was mild degenerative changes present in the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine without high-grade central canal or foraminal narrowing. There was narrowing of the right lateral recess at L4-L5 level and associated impingement of the transversing nerve root at that level by a disc protrusion. This was also seen on a prior study."
221,Neurology," PROCEDURE: A 21-channel digital electroencephalogram was performed on a patient in the awake state. Per the technician's notes, the patient is taking Depakene. The recording consists of symmetric 9 Hz alpha activity. Throughout the recording, repetitive episodes of bursts of 3 per second spike and wave activity are noted. The episodes last from approximately1 to 7 seconds. The episodes are exacerbated by hyperventilation. IMPRESSION: Abnormal electroencephalogram with repetitive bursts of 3 per second spike and wave activity exacerbated by hyperventilation. This activity could represent true petit mal epilepsy. Clinical correlation is suggested."
222,Neurology," CC: Sudden onset blindness. HX: This 58 y/o RHF was in her usual healthy state, until 4:00PM, 1/8/93, when she suddenly became blind. Tongue numbness and slurred speech occurred simultaneously with the loss of vision. The vision transiently improved to &quot;severe blurring&quot; enroute to a local ER, but worsened again once there. While being evaluated she became unresponsive, even to deep noxious stimuli. She was transferred to UIHC for further evaluation. Upon arrival at UIHC her signs and symptoms were present but markedly improved. PMH: 1) Hysterectomy many years previous. 2) Herniorrhaphy in past. 3) DJD, relieved with NSAIDs. FHX/SHX: Married x 27yrs. Husband denied Tobacco/ETOH/illicit drug use for her. Unremarkable FHx. MEDS: none. EXAM: Vitals: 36.9C. HR 93. BP 151/93. RR 22. 98% O2Sat. MS: somnolent, but arousable to verbal stimulation. minimal speech. followed simple commands on occasion. CN: Blinked to threat from all directions. EOM appeared full, Pupils 2/2 decreasing to 1/1. +/+Corneas. Winced to PP in all areas of Face. +/+Gag. Tongue midline. Oculocephalic reflex intact. Motor: UE 4/5 proximally. Full strength in all other areas. Normal tone and muscle bulk. Sensory: Withdrew to PP in all extremities. Gait: ND. Reflexes: 2+/2+ throughout UE, 3/3 patella, 2/2 ankles, Plantar responses were flexor bilaterally. Gen exam: unremarkable. COURSE: MRI Brain revealed bilateral thalamic strokes. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed an intraatrial septal aneurysm with right to left shunt. Transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) revealed the same. No intracardiac thrombus was found. Lower extremity dopplers were unremarkable. Carotid duplex revealed 0-15% bilateral ICA stenosis. Neuroophthalmologic evaluation revealed evidence of a supranuclear vertical gaze palsy OU (diminished up and down gaze). Neuropsychologic assessment 1/12-15/93 revealed severe impairment of anterograde verbal and visual memory, including acquisition and delayed recall and recognition. Speech was effortful and hypophonic with very defective verbal associative fluency. Reading comprehension was somewhat preserved, though she complained that despite the ability to see type clearly, she could not make sense of words. There was impairment of 2-D constructional praxis. A follow-up Neuropsychology evaluation in 7/93 revealed little improvement. Laboratory studies, TSH, FT4, CRP, ESR, GS, PT/PTT were unremarkable. Total serum cholesterol 195, Triglycerides 57, HDL 43, LDL 141. She was placed on ASA and discharged1/19/93. She was last seen on 5/2/95 and was speaking fluently and lucidly. She continued to have mild decreased vertical eye movements. Coordination and strength testing were fairly unremarkable. She continues to take ASA 325 mg qd."
223,Neurology," REFERRING DIAGNOSIS: Motor neuron disease. PERTINENT HISTORY AND EXAMINATION: Briefly, the patient is an 83-year-old woman with a history of progression of dysphagia for the past year, dysarthria, weakness of her right arm, cramps in her legs, and now with progressive weakness in her upper extremities. SUMMARY: The right median sensory response showed a borderline normal amplitude for age with mild slowing of conduction velocity. The right ulnar sensory amplitude was reduced with slowing of the conduction velocity. The right radial sensory amplitude was reduced with slowing of the conduction velocity. The right sural and left sural sensory responses were absent. The right median motor response showed a prolonged distal latency across the wrist, with proximal slowing. The distal amplitude was very reduced, and there was a reduction with proximal stimulation. The right ulnar motor amplitude was borderline normal, with slowing of the conduction velocity across the elbow. The right common peroneal motor response showed a decreased amplitude when recorded from the EDB, with mild slowing of the proximal conduction velocity across the knee. The right tibial motor response showed a reduced amplitude with prolongation of the distal latency. The left common peroneal response recorded from the EDB showed a decreased amplitude with mild distal slowing. The left tibial motor response showed a decreased amplitude with a borderline normal distal latency. The minimum F-wave latencies were normal with the exception of a mild prolongation of the ulnar F-wave latency, and the tibial F-wave latency as indicated above. With repetitive nerve stimulation, there was no significant decrement noted in either the right nasalis or the right trapezius muscles. Concentric needle EMG studies were performed in the right lower extremity, right upper extremity, thoracic paraspinals, and in the tongue. There was evidence of increased insertional activity in the right tibialis anterior muscle, with evidence of fasciculations noted in several lower and upper extremity muscles and in the tongue. In addition, there was evidence of increased amplitude, long duration and polyphasic motor units with a decreased recruitment noted in most muscles tested as indicated in the table above. INTERPRETATION: Abnormal electrodiagnostic study. There is electrodiagnostic evidence of a disorder of the anterior motor neurons affecting at least four segments. There is also evidence of a more generalized neuropathy that seems to be present in both the upper and lower extremities. There is also evidence of a right median mononeuropathy at the wrist and a right ulnar neuropathy at the elbow. Even despite the patient's age, the decrease in sensory responses is concerning, and makes it difficult to be certain about the diagnosis of motor neuron disease. However, the overall changes on the needle EMG would be consistent with a diagnosis of motor neuron disease. The patient will return for further evaluation."
224,Neurology," REASON FOR CONSULTATION: This 92-year-old female states that last night she had a transient episode of slurred speech and numbness of her left cheek for a few hours. However, the chart indicates that she had recurrent TIAs x3 yesterday, each lasting about 5 minutes with facial drooping and some mental confusion. She had also complained of blurred vision for several days. She was brought to the emergency room last night, where she was noted to have a left carotid bruit and was felt to have recurrent TIAs. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: The patient is on Lanoxin, amoxicillin, Hydergine, Cardizem, Lasix, Micro-K and a salt-free diet. SOCIAL HISTORY: She does not smoke or drink alcohol. FINDINGS: Admission CT scan of the head showed a densely calcified mass lesion of the sphenoid bone, probably representing the benign osteochondroma seen on previous studies. CBC was normal, aside from a hemoglobin of 11.2. ECG showed atrial fibrillation. BUN was 22, creatinine normal, CPK normal, glucose normal, electrolytes normal. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On examination, the patient is noted to be alert and fully oriented. She has some impairment of recent memory. She is not dysphasic, or apraxic. Speech is normal and clear. The head is noted to be normocephalic. Neck is supple. Carotid pulses are full bilaterally, with left carotid bruit. Neurologic exam shows cranial nerve function II through XII to be intact, save for some slight flattening of the left nasolabial fold. Motor examination shows no drift of the outstretched arms. There is no tremor or past-pointing. Finger-to-nose and heel-to-shin performed well bilaterally. Motor showed intact neuromuscular tone, strength, and coordination in all limbs. Reflexes 1+ and symmetrical, with bilateral plantar flexion, absent jaw jerk, no snout. Sensory exam is intact to pinprick touch, vibration, position, temperature, and graphesthesia. IMPRESSION: Neurological examination is normal, aside from mild impairment of recent memory, slight flattening of the left nasolabial fold, and left carotid bruit. She also has atrial fibrillation, apparently chronic. In view of her age and the fact that she is in chronic atrial fibrillation, I would suspect that she most likely has had an embolic phenomenon as the cause of her TIAs. RECOMMENDATIONS: I would recommend conservative management with antiplatelet agents unless a near occlusion of the carotid arteries is demonstrated, in which case you might consider it best to do an angiography and consider endarterectomy. In view of her age, I would be reluctant to recommend Coumadin anticoagulation. I will be happy to follow the patient with you."
225,Neurology," In July 2003 the patient had an episode of lightheaded or near syncope. She was taken to Hospital and admitted for 24 hours. Workup was negative. Soon after that, she had another episode of weakness and was taken to Valley Presbyterian Hospital emergency room and admitted. She was diagnosed as having dehydration and was treated with intravenous fluids and then was discharged after about one day. Subsequently, the patient developed a moderately severe depression. She was tried on various medications, which caused sweating, nightmares and perhaps other side effects. She was finally put on Effexor 25 mg two tablets h.s. and trazodone 100 mg h.s., and has done fairly well, although she still has significant depression. Her daughter brought her in today to be sure that she does not have dementia. There is no history of memory loss. There is no history of focal neurologic symptoms or significant headaches. The patient's complaints, according to the daughter, include not wanted to go out in public, shamed regarding her appearance (25-pound weight loss over the past year), eating poorly, not doing things unless asked, hiding food to prevent having to eat it, nervousness, and not taking a shower. She has no focal neurologic deficits. She does complain of constipation. She has severe sleep maintenance insomnia and often sleeps only 2 hours before awakening frequently for the rest of the night. The patient was apparently visiting her daughter in northern California in December 2003. She was taken to her daughter's primary care physician. She underwent vitamin B12 level, RPR, T4 and TSH, all of which were normal. On 05/15/04, the patient underwent MRI scan of the brain. I reviewed the scan in the office today. This shows moderate cortical and central atrophy and also shows mild-to-moderate deep white matter ischemic changes. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: The patient has generally been in reasonably good physical health. She did have a &quot;nervous breakdown&quot; in 1975 after the death of her husband. She was hospitalized for several weeks and was treated with ECT. This occurred while she was living in Korea. She does not smoke or drink alcoholic beverages. She has had no prior surgeries. There is a past history of hypertension, but this is no longer present. FAMILY HISTORY: Negative for dementia. Her mother died of a stroke at the age of 62. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital Signs: Blood pressure 128/80, pulse 84, temperature 97.4 F, and weight 105 lbs (dressed). General: Well-developed, well-nourished Korean female in no acute distress. Head: Normocephalic, without evidence of trauma or bruits. Neck: Supple, with full range of motion. No spasm or tenderness. Carotid pulsations are of normal volume and contour bilaterally without bruits. No thyromegaly or adenopathy. Extremities: No clubbing, cyanosis, edema, or deformity. Range of motion full throughout. NEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION: Mental Status: The patient is awake, alert and oriented to time, place, and person and generally appropriate. She exhibits mild psychomotor retardation and has a flat or depressed affect. She knows the current president of Korea and the current president of the United States. She can recall 3 out of 3 objects after 5 minutes. Calculations are performed fairly well with occasional errors. There is no right-left confusion, finger agnosia, dysnomia or aphasia. Cranial Nerves: II: Visual fields full to confrontation. Fundi benign. III, IV, VI: Extraocular movements full throughout, without nystagmus. No ptosis. Pupils equal, round and react briskly to light and accommodation. V: Normal sensation to light touch and pinprick bilaterally. Corneal reflexes equal bilaterally. Motor function normal. VII: No facial asymmetry. VIII: Hears finger rub bilaterally. Weber and Rinne tests normal. IX & X: Palate elevates symmetrically bilaterally with phonation. Gag reflex equal bilaterally. XI: Sternocleidomastoid and upper trapezius normal tone, bulk and strength bilaterally. XII: Tongue protrudes in the midline without atrophy or fasciculations. Rapid alternating movements normal. No dysarthria. Motor: Tone, bulk, and strength are normal throughout. No drift of outstretched upper extremities. No tremors, fasciculations or abnormal involuntary movements. Reflexes (right/left): Biceps 2/2, triceps 1/1, brachioradialis 1/1, knee jerk 1/1 and ankle jerk 1/1. Plantar responses are flexor bilaterally. No snout, glabellar or palmomental reflex. Coordination: No dysmetria or dysdiadochokinesia in upper or lower extremities. Gait: Intact, including tandem gait and heel and toe walking. Station: Romberg normal. Sensation: Intact to pinprick, light touch, vibration and position sense throughout. Normal stereognosis, graphesthesia, and double simultaneous stimulation. DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION: 1. Depression, partially treated. 2. Possible early dementia. CASE DISCUSSION: Thank you once again Dr. X for allowing me to participate in the care of this very nice lady. She clearly has residual depression despite the above-mentioned treatment protocol. In order to assess the possibility of an occult cognitive impairment, I recommended neuropsychological testing along with EEG and P-300 long latency auditory evoked response study. I would also like to obtain a DHEA and DHEA sulfate level, as decreased amounts of these hormones may result in cognitive dysfunction and depression. I have asked the patient to return for follow up after completion of the studies. She should be considered for a retrial of Remeron, as this generally helps to improve appetite and sleep in these elderly patients. The normal dosage for elderly small patients such as this is 15 mg h.s."
226,Neurology," CC: Episodic monocular blindness, OS. HX: This 29 y/o RHF was in her usual healthy state until 2 months prior to her 3/11/96 presentation when she developed episodic arthralgias of her knees and ankles, bilaterally. On 3/3/96, she experienced sudden onset monocular blindness, OS, lasting 5-10 minutes in duration. Her vision &quot;greyed out&quot; from the periphery to center of her visual field, OS; and during some episodes progressed to complete blindness (not even light perception). This resolved within a few minutes. She had multiple episodes of vision loss, OS, every day until 3/7/96 when she was placed on heparin for suspected LICA dissection. She saw a local ophthalmologist on 3/4/96 and was told she had a normal funduscopic exam. She experienced 0-1 spell of blindness (OS) per day from 3/7/96 to 3/11/96. In addition, she complained of difficulty with memory since 3/7/96. She denied dysarthria, aphasia or confusion, but had occasional posterior neck and bioccipital-bitemporal headaches. She had no history of deep venous or arterial thrombosis. 3/4/96, ESR=123. HCT with and without contrast on 3/7/96 and 3/11/96, and Carotid Duplex scan were &quot;unremarkable.&quot; Rheumatoid factor=normal. 3-vessel cerebral angiogram (done locally) was reportedly &quot;unremarkable.&quot; She was thought to have temporal arteritis and underwent Temporal Artery biopsy (which was unremarkable), She received Prednisone 80 mg qd for 2 days prior to presentation. On admission she complained of a left temporal headache at the biopsy site, but no loss of vision or weakness She had been experiencing mild fevers and chills for several weeks prior to presentation. Furthermore, she had developed cyanosis of the distal #3 toes on feet, and numbness and rash on the lateral aspect of her left foot. She developed a malar rash on her face 1-2 weeks prior to presentation. MEDS: Depo-Provera, Prednisone 80mg qd, and Heparin IV. PMH: 1)Headaches for 3-4 years, 2)Heart murmur, 3) cryosurgery of cervix, 4)tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy, 5) elective abortion. She had no history of spontaneous miscarriage and had used oral birth control pill for 10 years prior to presentation. FHX: Migraine headaches on maternal side, including her mother. No family history of thrombosis. SHX: works as a metal grinder and was engaged to be married. She denied any tobacco or illicit drug use. She consumed 1 alcoholic drink per month. EXAM: BP147/74, HR103, RR14, 37.5C. MS: A&O to person, place and time. Speech was fluent without dysarthria. Repetition, naming and comprehension were intact. 2/3 recall at 2 minutes. CN: unremarkable. Motor: unremarkable. Coord: unremarkable. Sensory: decreased LT, PP, TEMP, along the lateral aspect of the left foot. Gait: narrow-based and able to TT, HW and TW without difficulty. Station: unremarkable. Reflexes: 2/2 throughout. Plantar responses were flexor, bilaterally. Skin: Cyanosis of the distal #3 toes on both feet. There was a reticular rash about the lateral aspect of her left foot. There were splinter-type hemorrhages under the fingernails of both hands. COURSE: ESR=108 (elevated), Hgb 11.3, Hct 33%, WBC 10.0, Plt 148k, MCV 92 (low) Cr 1.3, BUN 26, CXR and EKG were unremarkable. PTT 42 (elevated). PT normal. The rest of the GS and CBC were normal. Dilute Russell Viper venom time was elevated at 27 and a 1:1 prothrombin time mix corrected to only 36. She was admitted to the Neurology service. Blood cultures were drawn and were negative. Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography on 3/12/96 was unremarkable. Her symptoms and elevated PTT suggested an ischemic syndrome involving anticardiolipin antibody and/or lupus anticoagulant. Her signs of rash and cyanosis suggested SLE. ANA was positive at 1:640 (speckled), RF (negative), dsDNA, 443 (elevated). Serum cryoglobulins were positive at 1% (fractionation data lost). Serum RPR was positive, but FTA-ABS was negative (thereby confirming a false-positive RPR). Anticardiolipin antibodies IgM and IgG were positive at 56.1 and 56.3 respectively. Myeloperoxidase antibody was negative, ANCA was negative and hepatitis screen unremarkable. The Dermatology Service felt the patient's reticular foot rash was livedo reticularis. Rheumatology felt the patient met criteria for SLE. Hematology felt the patient met criteria for Anticardiolipin Antibody and/or Lupus anticoagulant Syndrome. Neurology felt the episodic blindness was secondary to thromboembolic events. Serum Iron studies revealed: FeSat 6, Serum Fe 15, TIBC 237, Reticulocyte count 108.5. The patient was placed on FeSO4 225mg tid. She was continued on heparin IV, but despite this she continued to have occasional episodes of left monocular blindness or &quot;gray outs&quot; up to 5 times per day. She was seen by the Neuro-ophthalmology Service. The did not think she had evidence of vasculitis in her eye. They recommended treatment with ASA 325mg bid. She was placed on this 3/15/96 and tapered off heparin. She continued to have 0-4 episodes of monocular blindness (OS) for 5-10 seconds per episodes. She was discharged home. She returned 3/29/96 for episodic diplopia lasting 5-10 minutes per episode. The episodes began on 3/27/96. During the episodes her left eye deviated laterally while the right eye remained in primary gaze. She had no prior history of diplopia or strabismus. Hgb 10.1, Hct 30%, WBC 5.2, MCV 89 (low), Plt 234k. ESR 113mm/hr. PT 12, PTT 45 (high). HCT normal. MRI brain, 3/30/96, revealed a area of increased signal on T2 weighted images in the right frontal lobe white matter. This was felt to represent a thromboembolic event. She was place on heparin IV and treated with Solu-Medrol 125mg IV q12 hours. ASA was discontinued. Hematology, Rheumatology and Neurology agreed to place her on Warfarin. She was placed on Prednisone 60mg qd following the Solu-Medrol. She continued to have transient diplopia and mild vertigo despite INR's of 2.0-2.2. ASA 81mg qd was added to her regimen. In addition, Rheumatology recommended Plaquenil 200mg bid. The neurologic symptoms decreased gradually over the ensuing 3 days. Warfarin was increased to achieve INR 2.5-3.5. She reported no residual symptoms or new neurologic events on her 5/3/96 Neurology Clinic follow-up visit. She continues to be event free on Warfarin according to her Hematology Clinic notes up to 12/96."
227,Neurology," REASON FOR VISIT: Followup left-sided rotator cuff tear and cervical spinal stenosis. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. ABC returns today for followup regarding her left shoulder pain and left upper extremity C6 radiculopathy. I had last seen her on 06/21/07. At that time, she had been referred to me Dr. X and Dr. Y for evaluation of her left-sided C6 radiculopathy. She also had a significant rotator cuff tear and is currently being evaluated for left-sided rotator cuff repair surgery, I believe on, approximately 07/20/07. At our last visit, I only had a report of her prior cervical spine MRI. I did not have any recent images. I referred her for cervical spine MRI and she returns today. She states that her symptoms are unchanged. She continues to have significant left-sided shoulder pain for which she is being evaluated and is scheduled for surgery with Dr. Y. She also has a second component of pain, which radiates down the left arm in a C6 distribution to the level of the wrist. She has some associated minimal weakness described in detail in our prior office note. No significant right upper extremity symptoms. No bowel, bladder dysfunction. No difficulty with ambulation. FINDINGS: On examination, she has 4 plus over 5 strength in the left biceps and triceps muscle groups, 4 out of 5 left deltoid, 5 out of 5 otherwise in both muscle groups and all muscle groups of upper extremities. Light touch sensation is minimally decreased in the left C6 distribution; otherwise, intact. Biceps and brachioradialis reflexes are 1 plus. Hoffmann sign normal bilaterally. Motor strength is 5 out of 5 in all muscle groups in lower extremities. Hawkins and Neer impingement signs are positive at the left shoulder. An EMG study performed on 06/08/07 demonstrates no evidence of radiculopathy or plexopathy or nerve entrapment to the left upper extremity. Cervical spine MRI dated 06/28/07 is reviewed. It is relatively limited study due to artifact. He does demonstrate evidence of minimal-to-moderate stenosis at the C5-C6 level but without evidence of cord impingement or cord signal change. There appears to be left paracentral disc herniation at the C5-C6 level, although axial T2-weighted images are quite limited. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Ms. ABC's history, physical examination and radiographic findings are compatible with left shoulder pain and left upper extremity pain, which is due to a combination of left-sided rotator cuff tear and moderate cervical spinal stenosis. I agree with the plan to go ahead and continue with rotator cuff surgery. With regard to the radiculopathy, I believe this can be treated non-operatively to begin with. I am referring her for consideration of cervical epidural steroid injections. The improvement in her pain may help her recover better from the shoulder surgery. I will see her back in followup in 3 months, at which time she will be recovering from a shoulder surgery and we will see if she needs any further intervention with regard to the cervical spine. I will also be in touch with Dr. Y to let him know this information prior to the surgery in several weeks."
228,Neurology," EXAM:MRI SPINAL CORD CERVICAL WITHOUT CONTRAST CLINICAL:Right arm pain, numbness and tingling. FINDINGS: Vertebral alignment and bone marrow signal characteristics are unremarkable. The C2-3 and C3-4 disk levels appear unremarkable. At C4-5, broad based disk/osteophyte contacts the ventral surface of the spinal cord and may mildly indent the cord contour. A discrete cord signal abnormality is not identified. There may also be some narrowing of the neuroforamina at this level. At C5-6, central disk-osteophyte contacts and mildly impresses on the ventral cord contour. Distinct neuroforaminal narrowing is not evident. At C6-7, mild diffuse disk-osteophyte impresses on the ventral thecal sac and contacts the ventral cord surface. Distinct cord compression is not evident. There may be mild narrowing of the neuroforamina at his level. A specific abnormality is not identified at the C7-T1 level. IMPRESSION: Disk/osteophyte at C4-5 through C6-7 with contact and may mildly indent the ventral cord contour at these levels. Some possible neuroforaminal narrowing is also noted at levels as stated above."
229,Neurology," DIAGNOSIS: Status post brain tumor removal. HISTORY: The patient is a 64-year-old female referred to physical therapy following complications related to brain tumor removal. The patient reports that on 10/24/08 she had a brain tumor removed and had left-sided weakness. The patient was being seen in physical therapy from 11/05/08 to 11/14/08 then she began having complications. The patient reports that she was admitted to Hospital on 12/05/08. At that time, they found massive swelling on the brain and a second surgery was performed. The patient then remained in acute rehab until she was discharged to home on 01/05/09. The patient's husband, Al, is also present and he reports that during rehabilitation the patient did have a DVT in the left calf that has since been resolved. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Unremarkable. MEDICATIONS: Coumadin, Keppra, Decadron, and Glucophage. SUBJECTIVE: The patient reports that the pain is not an issue at this time. The patient states that her primary concern is her left-sided weakness as related to her balance and her walking and her left arm weakness. PATIENT GOAL: To increase strength in her left leg for better balance and walking. OBJECTIVE: RANGE OF MOTION: Bilateral lower extremities are within normal limits. STRENGTH: Bilateral lower extremities are grossly 5/5 with one repetition, except left hip reflexion 4+/5. BALANCE: The patient's balance was assessed with a Berg balance test. The patient has got 46/56 points, which places her at moderate risk for falls. GAIT: The patient ambulates with contact guard assist. The patient ambulates with a reciprocal gait pattern with good bilateral foot clearance. However, the patient has been reports that with increased fatigue, left footdrop tends to occur. A 6-minute walk test will be performed at the next visit due to time constraints. ASSESSMENT: The patient is a 64-year-old female referred to Physical Therapy status post brain surgery. Examination indicates deficits in strength, balance, and ambulation. The patient will benefit from skilled physical therapy to address these impairments. TREATMENT PLAN: The patient will be seen three times per week for 4 weeks and then reduce it to two times per week for 4 additional weeks. Interventions include: 1. Therapeutic exercise. 2. Balance training. 3. Gait training. 4. Functional mobility training. SHORT TERM GOAL TO BE COMPLETED IN 4 WEEKS: 1. The patient is to tolerate 30 repetitions of all lower extremity exercises. 2. The patient is to improve balance with a score of 50/56 points. 3. The patient is to ambulate 1000 feet in a 6-minute walk test with standby assist. LONG TERM GOAL TO BE ACHIEVED IN 8 WEEKS: 1. The patient is to ambulate independently within her home and standby to general supervision within the community. 2. Berg balance test to be 52/56. 3. The patient is to ambulate a 6-minute walk test for 1500 feet independently including safe negotiation of corners and busy areas. 4. The patient is to demonstrate safely stepping over and around objects without loss of balance. Prognosis for the above-stated goals is good. The above treatment plan has been discussed with the patient and her husband. They are in agreement."
230,Neurology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Tremor, dystonic form. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Tremor, dystonic form. COMPLICATIONS: None. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Less than 100 mL. ANESTHESIA: MAC (monitored anesthesia care) with local anesthesia. TITLE OF PROCEDURES: 1. Left frontal craniotomy for placement of deep brain stimulator electrode. 2. Right frontal craniotomy for placement of deep brain stimulator electrode. 3. Microelectrode recording of deep brain structures. 4. Stereotactic volumetric CT scan of head for target coordinate determination. 5. Intraoperative programming and assessment of device. INDICATIONS: The patient is a 61-year-old woman with a history of dystonic tremor. The movements have been refractory to aggressive medical measures, felt to be candidate for deep brain stimulation. The procedure is discussed below. I have discussed with the patient in great deal the risks, benefits, and alternatives. She fully accepted and consented to the procedure. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was brought to the holding area and to the operating room in stable condition. She was placed on the operating table in seated position. Her head was shaved. Scalp was prepped with Betadine and a Leksell frame was mounted after anesthetizing the pin sites with a 50:50 mixture of 0.5% Marcaine and 2% lidocaine in all planes. IV antibiotics were administered as was the sedation. She was then transported to the CT scan and stereotactic volumetric CT scan of the head was undertaken. The images were then transported to the surgery planned work station where a 3-D reconstruction was performed and the target coordinates were then chosen. Target coordinates chosen were 20 mm to the left of the AC-PC midpoint, 3 mm anterior to the AC-PC midpoint, and 4 mm below the AC-PC midpoint. Each coordinate was then transported to the operating room as Leksell coordinates. The patient was then placed on the operating table in a seated position once again. Foley catheter was placed, and she was secured to the table using the Mayfield unit. At this point then the patient's right frontal and left parietal bossings were cleaned, shaved, and sterilized using Betadine soap and paint in scrubbing fashion for 10 minutes. Sterile drapes placed around the perimeter of the field. This same scalp region was then anesthetized with same local anesthetic mixture. A bifrontal incision was made as well as curvilinear incision was made over the parietal bossings. Bur holes were created on either side of the midline just behind the coronal suture. Hemostasis was controlled using bipolar and Bovie, and self-retaining retractors had been placed in the field. Using the drill, then two small grooves were cut in the frontal bone with a 5-mm cutting burs and Stryker drill. The bur holes were then curetted free, the dura cauterized, and then opened in a cruciate manner on both sides with a #11 blade. The cortical surface was then nicked with a #11 blade on both sides as well. The Leksell arc with right-sided coordinate was dialed in, was then secured to the frame. Microelectrode drive was secured to the arc. Microelectrode recording was then performed. The signatures of the cells were recognized. Microelectrode unit was removed. Deep brain stimulating electrode holding unit was mounted. The DBS electrode was then loaded into target and intraoperative programming and testing was performed. Using the screener box and standard parameters, the patient experienced some relief of symptoms on her left side. This electrode was secured in position using bur-hole ring and cap system. Attention was then turned to the left side, where left-sided coordinates were dialed into the system. The microelectrode unit was then remounted. Microelectrode recording was then undertaken. After multiple passes, the microelectrode unit was removed. Deep brain stimulator electrode holding unit was mounted at the desired trajectory. The DBS electrode was loaded into target, and intraoperative programming and testing was performed once again using the screener box. Using standard parameters, the patient experienced similar results on her right side. This electrode was secured using bur-hole ring and cap system. The arc was then removed. A subgaleal tunnel was created between the two incisions whereby distal aspect of the electrodes led through this tunnel. We then closed the electrode, replaced subgaleally. Copious amounts of Betadine irrigation were used. Hemostasis was controlled using the bipolar only. Closure was instituted using 3-0 Vicryl in a simple interrupted fashion for the fascial layer followed by skin closure with staples. Sterile dressings were applied. The Leksell arc was then removed. She was rotated into the supine position and transported to the recovery room in stable and satisfactory condition. All needle, sponge, cottonoid, and blade counts were correct x2 as verified by the nurses."
231,Neurology," The patient returns to our office today because of continued problems with her headaches. She was started on Zonegran on her last visit and she states that initially she titrated upto 100 mg q.h.s. Initially felt that the Zonegran helped, but then the pain in her head returned. It is an area of tenderness and sensitivity in her left parietal area. It is a very localized pain. She takes Motrin 400 mg b.i.d., which helped. She also had EMG/nerve conduction studies since she was last seen in our office that showed severe left ulnar neuropathy, moderate right ulnar neuropathy, bilateral mild-to-moderate carpal tunnel and diabetic neuropathy. She was referred to Dr. XYZ and will be seeing him on August 8, 2006. She was also never referred to the endocrine clinic to deal with her poor diabetes control. Her last hemoglobin A1c was 10. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Diabetes, hypertension, elevated lipids, status post CVA, and diabetic retinopathy. MEDICATIONS: Glyburide, Avandia, metformin, lisinopril, Lipitor, aspirin, metoprolol and Zonegran. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Blood pressure was 140/70, heart rate was 76, respiratory rate was 18, and weight was 226 pounds. On general exam she has an area of tenderness on palpation in the left parietal region of her scalp. Neurological exam is detailed on our H&P form. Her neurological exam is within normal limits. IMPRESSION AND PLAN: For her headaches we are going to titrate Zonegran up to 200 mg q.h.s. to try to maximize the Zonegran therapy. If this is not effective, when she comes back on August 7, 2006 we will then consider other anticonvulsants such as Neurontin or Lyrica. We also discussed with Ms. Hawkins the possibility of nerve block injection; however, at this point she is not interested. She will be seeing Dr. XYZ for her neuropathies. We made an appointment in endocrine clinic today for a counseling in terms of better diabetes control and she is responsible for trying to get her referral from her primary care physician to go for this consult."
232,Neurology," CC: Headache. HX: 63 y/o RHF first seen by Neurology on 9/14/71 for complaint of episodic vertigo. During that evaluation she described a several year history of &quot;migraine&quot; headaches. She experienced her first episode of vertigo in 1969. The vertigo (clockwise) typically began suddenly after lying down, and was not associated with nausea/vomiting/headache. The vertigo had not been consistently associated with positional change and could last hours to days. On 3/15/71, after 5 day bout of vertigo, right ear ache, and difficulty ambulating (secondary to the vertigo) she sought medical attention and underwent an audiogram which reportedly showed a 20% decline in low tone acuity AD. She complained of associated tinnitus which she described as a &quot;whistle.&quot; In addition, her symptoms appeared to worsen with changes in head position (i.e. looking up or down). The symptoms gradually resolved and she did well until 8/71 when she experienced a 19-day episode of vertigo, tinnitus and intermittent headaches. She was seen 9/14/71, in Neurology, and admitted for evaluation. Her neurologic exam at that time was unremarkable except for prominent bilateral systolic carotid bruits. Cerebral angiogram revealed an inoperable 7 x 6cm AVM in the right parietal region. The AVM was primarily fed by the right MCA. Otolaryngologic evaluation concluded that she probably also suffered from Meniere's disease. On 10/14/74 she underwent a 21 day admission for SAH secondary to right parietal AVM. On 11/23/91 she was admitted for left sided weakness (LUE &gt; LLE), headache, and transient visual change. Neurological exam confirmed left sided weakness, and dysesthesia of the LUE only. Brain CT confirmed a 3 x 4 cm left parietal hemorrhage. She underwent unsuccessful embolization. Neuroradiology had planned to do 3 separate embolizations, but during the first, via the left MCA, they were unable to cannulate many of the AVM vessels and abandoned the procedure. She recovered with residual left hemisensory loss. In 12/92 she presented with an interventricular hemorrhage and was managed conservatively and refused any future neuroradiologic intervention. In 1/93 she reconsidered neurointerventional procedure and was scheduled for evaluation at the Barrows Neurological Institute in Phoenix, AZ."
233,Neurology," CC: Lethargy. HX: This 28y/o RHM was admitted to a local hospital on 7/14/95 for marked lethargy. He had been complaining of intermittent headaches and was noted to have subtle changes in personality for two weeks prior to 7/14/95. On the morning of 7/14/95, his partner found him markedly lethargic and complaingin of abdominal pain and vomiting. He denied fevers, chills, sweats, cough, CP, SOB or diarrhea. Upon evaluation locally, he had a temperature of 99.5F and appeared lethargic. He also had anisocoria with left pupil 0.5mm bigger than the right. There was also question of left facial weakness. An MRI was obtained and revealed a large left hemispheric mass lesion with surrounding edema and mass effect. He was given 10mg of IV Decardron,100gm of IV Mannitol, intubated and hyperventilated and transferred to UIHC. He was admitted to the Department of Medicine on 7/14/95, and transferred to the Department of Neurology on 7/17/95, after being extubated. MEDS ON ADMISSION: Bactrim DS qd, Diflucan 100mg qd, Acyclovir 400mg bid, Xanax, Stavudine 40mg bid, Rifabutin 300mg qd. PMH: 1) surgical correction of pyoloric stenosis, age 1, 2)appendectomy, 3) HIV/AIDS dx 1991. He was initially treated with AZT, then DDI. He developed chronic diarrhea and was switched to D4T in 1/95. However, he developed severe neuropathy and this was stopped 4/95. The diarrhea recured. He has Acyclovir resistant genital herpes and generalized psoriasis. He most recent CD4 count (within 1 month of admission) was 20. FHX: HTN and multiple malignancies of unknown type. SHX: Homosexual, in monogamous relationship with an HIV infected partner for the past 3 years. EXAM: 7/14/95 (by Internal Medicine): BP134/80, HR118, RR16 on vent, 38.2C, Intubated. MS: Somnolent, but opened eyes to loud voices and would follow most commands. CN: Pupils 2.5/3.0 and &quot;equally reactive to light.&quot; Mild horizontal nystagmus on rightward gaze. EOM were otherwise intact. MOTOR: Moved 4 extremities well. Sensory/Coord/Gait/Station/Reflexes: not done. Gen EXAM: Penil ulcerations. EXAM: 7/17/96 (by Neurology): BP144/73, HR59, RR20, 36.0, extubated. MS: Alert and mildly lethargic. Oriented to name only. Thought he was a local hospital and that it was 1/17/1994. Did not understand he had a brain lesion. CN: Pupils 6/5.5 decreasing to 4/4 on exposure to light. EOM were full and smooth. No RAPD or light-near dissociation. papilledema (OU).

Babinski sign present on right and absent on left. Gen Exam: unremarkable except for the genital lesion noted by Internal medicine. COURSE: The outside MRI was reviewed and was notable for the left frontal/parietal mass lesion with surround edema. The mass inhomogenously enhanced with gadolinium contrast. The findings were consistent most with lymphoma, though toxoplasmosis could not be excluded. He refused brain biopsy and was started on empiric treatment for toxoplasmosis. This consisted of Pyrimethamine 75mg qd and Sulfadiazine 2 g bid. He later became DNR and was transferred at his and his partner's request Back to a local hospital. He never returned for follow-up."
234,Neurology," EXAM: CT head without contrast. INDICATIONS: Assaulted, positive loss of consciousness, rule out bleed. TECHNIQUE: CT examination of the head was performed without intravenous contrast administration. There are no comparison studies. FINDINGS: There are no abnormal extraaxial fluid collections. There is no midline shift or mass effect. Ventricular system demonstrates no dilatation. There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage. The calvarium is intact. There is a laceration in the left parietal region of the scalp without underlying calvarial fractures. The mastoid air cells are clear. IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process."
235,Neurology," PROCEDURES PERFORMED: Phenol neurolysis right obturator nerve, botulinum toxin injection right rectus femoris and vastus medialis intermedius and right pectoralis major muscles. PROCEDURE CODES: 64640 times one, 64614 times two, 95873 times two. PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Spastic right hemiparetic cerebral palsy, 343.1. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Spastic right hemiparetic cerebral palsy, 343.1. ANESTHESIA: MAC. COMPLICATIONS: None. DESCRIPTION OF TECHNIQUE: Informed consent was obtained from the patient. She was brought to the minor procedure area and sedated per their protocol. The patient was positioned lying supine. Skin overlying all areas injected was prepped with chlorhexidine. The right obturator nerve was identified using active EMG stimulation lateral to the adductor longus tendon origin and below the femoral pulse. Approximately 6 mL of 5% phenol was injected in this location. At all sites of phenol injections, injections were done at the site of maximum hip adduction contraction with least amount of stimulus. Negative drawback for blood was done prior to each injection of phenol. Muscles injected with botulinum toxin were identified with active EMG stimulation. Approximately 100 units was injected in the right pectoralis major and 100 units in the right rectus femoris and vastus intermedius muscles. Total amount of botulinum toxin injected was 200 units diluted 25 units to 1 mL. The patient tolerated the procedure well and no complications were encountered."
236,Neurology," HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 55-year-old gentleman who presents for further evaluation of right leg weakness. He has difficulty recollecting the exact details and chronology of his problem. To the best of his recollection, he thinks that about six months ago he developed weakness of his right leg. He describes that he is reaching to get something from a cabinet and he noticed that he was unable to stand on his right toe. Since that time, he has had difficulty pushing off when he walks. He has mild tingling and numbness in his toes, but this has been a chronic problem and nothing new since he has developed the weakness. He has chronic mild back pain, but this has been persistent for many years and has not changed. He has experienced cramps in both calves for the past year. This dissipated about two months ago. He does not think that his left leg is weak. He does not have any bowel or bladder incontinence. There is no radicular pain. He does not think that the problem is progressive, meaning that the weakness that he perceives in his right leg is no different than when it was six months ago. He first sought medical attention for this problem in October. He then saw you a couple of months later. He has undergone an EMG and nerve conduction studies. Unfortunately, he cannot undergo an MRI of his spine because he has an ear implant. He has had a CT scan that shows degenerative changes, but nothing obviously abnormal. In addition, the patient has hyperCKemia. He tells me that he has had an elevated CK prior to starting taking stat medications, although this is not entirely clear to me. He thinks that he is not taking Lipitor for about 15 months and thought that his CK was in the 500 or 600s prior to starting it. Once it was started, it increased to about 800 and then came down to about 500 when it was stopped. He then had a recent bump again up to the 1000 and since Lipitor has been stopped, his CK apparently has returned to about the 500 or 600s. I do no have any laboratory data to support these statements by the patient, but he seems to be up to speed on this. More recently, he has been started taking Zetia. He does not have any proximal weakness. He denies any myalgias. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: He has coronary artery disease and has received five stents. He has hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. He states that he was diagnosed with diabetes based on the results of an abnormal oral glucose tolerance test. He believes that his glucose shot up to over 300 with this testing. He does not take any medications for this and his blood glucoses are generally normal when he checks it. He has had plastic surgery on his face from an orbital injury. He also had an ear graft when he developed an ear infection during his honeymoon. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: He takes amlodipine, Diovan, Zetia, hydrochlorothiazide, Lovaza (fish oil), Niaspan, aspirin, and Chantix. ALLERGIES: He has no known drug allergies. SOCIAL HISTORY: He lives with his wife. He works at Shepherd Pratt doing network engineering. He smokes a pack of cigarettes a day and is working on quitting. He drinks four alcoholic beverages per night. Prior to that, he drank significantly more. He denies illicit drug use. He was athletic growing up. FAMILY HISTORY: His mother died of complications from heart disease. His father died of heart disease in his 40s. He has two living brothers. One of them he does not speak too much with and does not know about his medical history. The other is apparently healthy. He has one healthy child. His maternal uncles apparently had polio. When I asked him to tell me further details about this, he states that one of them had to wear crutches due to severe leg deformans and then the other had leg deformities in only one leg. He is fairly certain that they had polio. He is unaware of any other family members with neurological conditions. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: He has occasional tinnitus. He has difficulty sleeping. Otherwise, a complete review of systems was obtained and was negative except for as mentioned above. This is documented in the handwritten notes from today's visit. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital Signs: BP 116/72 Heart rate 68 Respiratory rate 18 Weight 243 pounds Temperature 98.2 Pain 0/10 General Appearance: He is well appearing, in no acute distress. Cardiovascular: He has a regular rhythm without murmurs, gallops, or rubs. There are no carotid bruits. Chest: His lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Skin: There are no rashes or lesions. Musculoskeletal: He has no joint deformities or scoliosis. NEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION: Mental Status: His speech is fluent without dysarthria or aphasia. He is alert and oriented to name, place, and date. Attention, concentration, registration, recall, and fund of knowledge are intact. Cranial Nerves: Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation. Optic discs are normal. Visual fields are full. Extraocular movements are intact without nystagmus. Facial sensation is normal. There is no facial, jaw, palate, or tongue weakness. Hearing is grossly intact. Shoulder shrug is full. Motor: He has mild thinning of his right hamstrings, calf muscles, and quadriceps on the right. There are scant fasciculations in both calves' muscles. The tone is normal. There is no action or percussion myotonia or paramyotonia. Manual muscle testing reveals MRC grade 5/5 strength in all proximal and distal muscles of the upper extremities. In his lower extremities, his strength is as follows: hip flexion 5/5 bilaterally, hip extension 5/5 bilaterally, ankle dorsiflexion 5/5 on the left and 4/5 on the right, ankle inversion 5/5 bilaterally, ankle eversion 4/5 on the right and 5/5 on the left, toe flexion 4/5 on the right and 5/5 on the left. Sensory: He has diminished vibratory sensation at both toes. Joint position sense is intact. Romberg is absent. Light touch, pinprick, and temperature are intact. He has a Tinel's sign at the right fibular head and bilateral elbows. Coordination: This is intact by finger-nose-finger and heel-to-shin testing. Deep Tendon Reflexes: They are 1+ at the biceps, triceps, and brachioradialis. Patellar jerks are 2+. Ankle jerks are absent. Plantar reflexes are flexor. Gait and Stance: He has a very mild steppage gait due to the mild right dorsiflexion weakness. He has difficulty walking on his heels. He also cannot walk on his toes and cannot do toe raises on the left. ASSESSMENT: The patient is a 55-year-old gentleman with a six-month history of mild right leg weakness. He does not complain of a lot of sensory symptoms. His neurological examination is notable for dorsiflexion and plantar flexion weakness although he has eversion and not inversion weakness on the right. He also has mild atrophy of the leg without any obvious sensory deficits. I think he seemingly has a peroneal neuropathy with a superimposed lumbosacral radiculopathy. Alternative diagnoses include a more systemic neuropathy and certainly his mild diabetes and increased alcohol intake may be contributing to his problems. I do think that his history that he sits in his chair with his leg leaning against the desk on the right is probably relevant and probably causing the worsening of the peroneal neuropathy. PLAN: 1. I scheduled him to return for an EMG and nerve conduction studies. 2. If you kindly send me all of his records including specifically the labs that have been obtained through his primary care physician or through you, I would appreciate it. 3. Depending on the results of the study, I may recommend that he undergo a CT myelogram to better define his anatomy in his back although again it is unclear if this is a sole etiology for his problems."
237,Neurology," I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. ABC in neurologic consultation and follow-up on MM/DD/YYYY. Mr. ABC reports that he has had several issues in the family. One of them is that his grandmother passed. In addition, the family dog fell ill. This has led to distress. He reports better controlled pain. Mr. ABC reports, otherwise, intermittent adherence to Copaxone. He had in the past been on interferon, but did not tolerate the medication, because of side effects. His sleep/wake cycle remains very erratic. SOCIAL HISTORY, FAMILY HISTORY, AND PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Reviewed. There are no changes, otherwise. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Fatigue, pain, difficulty with sleep, mood fluctuations, low stamina, mild urgency frequency and hesitancy, preponderance of lack of stamina, preponderance of pain particularly in the left shoulder. EXAMINATION: The patient is alert and oriented. Extraocular movements are full. The face is symmetric. The uvula is midline. Speech has normal prosody. Today there is much less guarding of the left shoulder. In the lower extremities, iliopsoas, quadriceps, femoris and tibialis anterior are full. The gait is narrow based and noncircumductive. Rapid alternating movements are slightly off bilaterally. The gait does not have significant slapping characteristics. Sensory examination is largely unremarkable. Heart, lungs, and abdomen are within normal limits. IMPRESSION: Mr. ABC is doing about the same. We discussed the issue of adherence to Copaxone. In order to facilitate this, I would like him to take Copaxone every other day, but on a regular rhythm. His wife continues to inject him. He has not been able to start himself on the injections. Greater than 50% of this 40-minute appointment was devoted to counseling."
238,Neurology," EXAM: Noncontrast CT scan of the lumbar spine REASON FOR EXAM: Left lower extremity muscle spasm. COMPARISONS: None. FINDINGS: Transaxial thin slice CT images of the lumbar spine were obtained with sagittal and coronal reconstructions on emergency basis, as requested. No abnormal paraspinal masses are identified. There are sclerotic changes with anterior effusion of the sacroiliac joints bilaterally. There is marked intervertebral disk space narrowing at the L5-S1 level with intervertebral disk vacuum phenomenon and advanced endplate degenerative changes. Posterior disk osteophyte complex is present, most marked in the left paracentral to lateral region extending into the lateral recess on the left. This most likely will affect the S1 nerve root on the left. There are posterior hypertrophic changes extending into the neural foramina bilaterally inferiorly. There is mild neural foraminal stenosis present. Small amount of extruded disk vacuum phenomenon is present on the left in the region of the exiting nerve root. There is facet sclerosis bilaterally. Mild lateral recess stenosis just on the right, there is prominent anterior spondylosis. At the L4-5 level, mild bilateral facet arthrosis is present. There is broad based posterior annular disk bulging or protrusion, which mildly effaces the anterior aspect of the thecal sac and extends into the inferior aspect of the neural foramina bilaterally. No moderate or high-grade central canal or neural foraminal stenosis is identified. At the L3-4 level anterior spondylosis is present. There are endplate degenerative changes with mild posterior annular disk bulging, but no evidence of moderate or high-grade central canal or neural foraminal stenosis. At the L2-3 level, there is mild bilateral ligamentum flavum hypertrophy. Mild posterior annular disk bulging is present without evidence of moderate or high-grade central canal or neural foraminal stenosis. At the T12-L1 and L1-2 levels, there is no evidence of herniated disk protrusion, central canal, or neural foraminal stenosis. There is arteriosclerotic vascular calcification of the abdominal aorta and iliac arteries without evidence of aneurysm or dilatation. No bony destructive changes or acute fractures are identified. CONCLUSIONS: 1. Advanced degenerative disk disease at the L5-S1 level. 2. Probable chronic asymmetric herniated disk protrusion with peripheral calcification at the L5-S1 level, laterally in the left paracentral region extending into the lateral recess causing lateral recess stenosis. 3. Mild bilateral neural foraminal stenosis at the L5-S1 level. 4. Posterior disk bulging at the L2-3, L3-4, and L4-5 levels without evidence of moderate or high-grade central canal stenosis. 5. Facet arthrosis to the lower lumbar spine. 6. Arteriosclerotic vascular disease."
239,Neurology," NEUROLOGICAL EXAMINATION: At present the patient is awake, alert and fully oriented. There is no evidence of cognitive or language dysfunction. Cranial nerves: Visual fields are full. Funduscopic examination is normal. Extraocular movements full. Pupils equal, round, react to light. There is no evidence of nystagmus noted. Fifth nerve function is normal. There is no facial asymmetry noted. Lower cranial nerves are normal. Manual motor testing reveals good tone and bulk throughout. There is no evidence of pronator drift or decreased fine finger movements. Muscle strength is 5/5 throughout. Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ throughout with downgoing toes. Sensory examination is intact to all modalities including stereognosis, graphesthesia. TESTING OF STATION AND GAIT: The patient is able to walk toe-heel and tandem walk. Finger-to-nose and heel-to-shin moves are normal. Romberg sign negative. I appreciate no carotid bruits or cardiac murmurs. Noncontrast CT scan of the head shows no evidence of acute infarction, hemorrhage or extra-axial collection."
240,Neurology," SUBJECTIVE: The patient is a 55-year-old African-American male that was last seen in clinic on 07/29/2008 with diagnosis of new onset seizures and an MRI scan, which demonstrated right contrast-enhancing temporal mass. Given the characteristics of this mass and his new onset seizures, it is significantly concerning for a high-grade glioma. OBJECTIVE: The patient is alert and oriented times three, GCS of 15. Cranial nerves II to XII are grossly intact. Motor exam demonstrates 5/5 strength in all four extremities. Sensation is intact to light touch, pain, temperature, and proprioception. Cerebellar exam is intact. Gait is normal and tandem on heels and toes. Speech is appropriate. Judgment is intact. Pupils are equal and reactive to light. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: The patient is a 55-year-old African-American male with a new diagnosis of rim-enhancing right temporal mass. Given the characteristics of the MRI scan, it is highly likely that he demonstrates high-grade glioma and concerning for glioblastoma multiforme. We have discussed in length the possible benefits of biopsy, surgical resection, medical management, as well as chemotherapy, radiation treatments, and doing nothing. Given the high probability that the mass represents a high-grade glioma, the patient, after weighing the risks and the benefits of surgery, has agreed to undergo a surgical biopsy and resection of the mass as well as concomitant chemotherapy and radiation as the diagnosis demonstrates a high-grade glioma. The patient has signed consent for his right temporal craniotomy for biopsy and likely resection of right temporal brain tumor. He agrees that he will be n.p.o. after mid night on Wednesday night. He is sent for preoperative assessment with the Anesthesiology tomorrow morning. He has undergone vocational rehab assessment."
241,Neurology," CC: RLE weakness. HX: This 42y/o RHM was found 2/27/95 slumped over the steering wheel of the Fed Ex truck he was driving. He was cyanotic and pulseless according to witnesses. EMT evaluation revealed him to be in ventricular fibrillation and he was given epinephrine, lidocaine, bretylium and electrically defibrillated and intubated in the field. Upon arrival at a local ER his cardiac rhythm deteriorated and he required more than 9 counter shocks (defibrillation) at 360 joules per shock, epinephrine and lidocaine. This had no effect. He was then given intracardiac epinephrine and a subsequent electrical defibrillation placed him in atrial fibrillation. He was then taken emergently to cardiac catherization and was found to have normal coronary arteries. He was then admitted to an intensive care unit and required intraortic balloon pump pressure support via the right gorin. His blood pressure gradually improved and his balloon pump was discontinued on 5/5/95. Recovery was complicated by acute renal failure and liver failure. Initail CK=13,780, the CKMB fraction was normal at 0.8. On 3/10/95, the patient experienced CP and underwent cardiac catherization. This time he was found to have a single occlusion in the distal LAD with association inferior hypokinesis. Subsequent CK=1381 and CKMB=5.4 (elevated). The patient was amnestic to the event and for 10 days following the event. He was transferred to UIHC for cardiac electrophysiology study. MEDS: Nifedipine, ASA, Amiodarone, Capoten, Isordil, Tylenol, Darvocet prn, Reglan prn, Coumadin, KCL, SLNTG prn, CaCO3, Valium prn, Nubain prn. PMH: hypercholesterolemia. FHX: Father alive age 69 with h/o TIAs. Mother died age 62 and had CHF, A-Fib, CAD. Maternal Grandfather died of an MI and had h/o SVT. Maternal Grandmother had h/o SVT. SHX: Married, 7 children, driver for Fed Ex. Denied tobacco/ETOH/illicit drug use. EXAM: BP112/74 HR64 RR16 Afebrile. MS: A&O to person, place and time. Euthymic with appropriate affect. CN: unremarkable. Motor: Hip flexion 3/5, Hip extension 5/5, Knee flexion5/5, Knee extension 2/5, Plantar flexion, extension, inversion and eversion 5/5. There was full strength thoughout BUE. Sensory: decreased PP/Vib/LT/TEMP about anterior aspect of thigh and leg in a femoral nerve distribution. Coord: poor and slowed HKS on right due to weakness. Station: no drift or Romberg sign. Gait: difficulty bearing weight on RLE. Reflexes: 1+/1+ throughout BUE. 0/2 patellae. 2/2 archilles. Plantar responses were flexor, bilaterally. COURSE: MRI Pelvis, 3/28/95, revealed increased T1 weighted signal within the right iliopsoas suggestive of hematoma. An intra-osseous lipoma was incidentally notice in the right sacrum. Neuropsychologic assessment showed moderately compromised anterograde verbal memory, and temporal orientation and retrograde recall were below expectations. These findings were consistent with mesial temporal dysfunction secondary to anoxic injury and were mild in lieu of his history. He underwent implantation of a Medtronic internal cardiac difibrillator. His cardiac electrophysiology study found no inducible ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation. He suffered mild to moderate permanent RLE weakness, especially involving the quadriceps. His femoral nerve compression had been present to long to warrant decompression. EMG/NCV studies revealed severe axonal degeneration."
242,Neurology," EXAM: Thoracic Spine. REASON FOR EXAM: Injury. INTERPRETATION: The thoracic spine was examined in the AP, lateral and swimmer's projections. There is mild chronic-appearing anterior wedging of what is believed to represent T11 and 12 vertebral bodies. A mild amount of anterior osteophytic lipping is seen involving the thoracic spine. There is a suggestion of generalized osteoporosis. The intervertebral disc spaces appear generally well preserved. The pedicles appear intact. IMPRESSION: 1. Mild chronic-appearing anterior wedging of what is believed to represent the T11 and 12 vertebral bodies. 2. Mild degenerative changes of the thoracic spine. 3. Osteoporosis."
243,Neurology," CC: Stable expressive aphasia and decreased vision. HX: This 72y/o woman was diagnosed with a left sphenoid wing meningioma on 6/3/80. She was 59 years old at the time and presented with a 6 month history of increasing irritability and left occipital-nuchal headaches. One month prior to that presentation she developed leftward head turning, and 3 days prior to presentation had an episode of severe dysphasia. A HCT (done locally) revealed a homogenously enhancing lesion of the left sphenoid wing. Skull X-rays showed deviation of the pineal to the right. She was transferred to UIHC and was noted to have a normal neurologic exam (per Neurosurgery note). Angiography demonstrated a highly vascular left temporal/sphenoid wing tumor. She under went left temporal craniotomy and &quot;complete resection&quot; of the tumor which on pathologic analysis was consistent with a meningioma. The left sphenoid wing meningioma recurred and was excised 9/25/84. There was regrowth of this tumor seen on HCT, 1985. A 6/88 HCT revealed the left sphenoid meningioma and a new left tentorial meningioma. HCT in 1989 revealed left temporal/sphenoid, left tentorial, and new left frontal lesions. On 2/14/91 she presented with increasing lethargy and difficulty concentrating. A 2/14/91, HCT revealed increased size and surrounding edema of the left frontal meningioma. The left frontal and temporal meningiomas were excised on 2/25/91. These tumors all recurred and a left parietal lesion developed. She underwent resection of the left frontal meningioma on 11/21/91 due to right sided weakness and expressive aphasia. The weakness partially resolved and though the speech improved following resection it did not return to normal. In May 1992 she experienced 3 tonic-clonic type seizures, all of which began with a Jacksonian march up the RLE then RUE before generalizing. Her Phenobarbital prophylaxis which she had been taking since her 1980 surgery was increased. On 12/7/92, she underwent a left fronto-temporo-parieto-occipital craniotomy and excision of five meningiomas. Postoperatively she developed worsened right sided weakness and expressive aphasia. The weakness and aphasia improved by 3/93, but never returned to normal."
244,Neurology," REASON FOR ADMISSION: Hepatic encephalopathy. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 51-year-old Native American male with known alcohol cirrhosis who presented to the emergency room after an accidental fall in the bathroom. He said that he was doing fine prior to that and denied having any complaints. He was sitting watching TV and he felt sleepy. So, he went to the bathroom to urinate before going to bed and while he was trying to lift the seat, he tripped and fell and hit his head on the back. His head hit the toilet seat. Then, he started having bleeding and had pain in the area with headache. He did not lose consciousness as far as he can tell. He went and woke up his sister. This happened somewhere between 10:30 and 11 p.m. His sister brought a towel and covered the laceration on the back of his head and called EMS, who came to his house and brought him to the emergency room, where he was found to have a laceration on the back of his head, which was stapled and a CT of the head was obtained and ruled out any acute intracranial pathology. On his lab work, his ammonia was found to be markedly elevated at 106. So, he is being admitted for management of this. He denied having any abdominal pain, change in bowel habits, GI bleed, hematemesis, melena, or hematochezia. He said he has been taking his medicines, but he could not recall those. He denied having any symptoms prior to this fall. He said earlier today he also fell. He also said that this was an accidental fall caused by problem with his walker. He landed on his back at that time, but did not have any back pain afterwards. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Liver cirrhosis caused by alcohol. This is per the patient. 2. He thinks he is diabetic. 3.

GENERAL: The patient is lying in bed, appears comfortable, very pleasant Native American male in no apparent distress. HEENT: His skull has a scar on the left side from previous surgery. On the back of his head, there is a laceration, which has two staples on. It is still oozing minimally. It is tender. No other traumatic injury is noted. Eyes, pupils react to light. Sclerae anicteric. Nostrils are normal. Oral cavity is clear with no thrush or exudate. NECK: Supple. Trachea midline. No JVD. No thyromegaly. LYMPHATICS: No cervical or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy. LUNGS: Clear to auscultation bilaterally. HEART: Normal S1 and S2. No murmurs or gallops. Regular rate and rhythm. ABDOMEN: Soft, distended, nontender. No organomegaly or masses. LOWER EXTREMITIES: +1 edema bilaterally. Pulses strong bilaterally. No skin ulcerations noted. No erythema. SKIN: Several spider angiomas noted on his torso and upper extremities consistent with liver cirrhosis. BACK: No tenderness by exam. RECTAL: No masses. No abscess. No rectal fissures. Guaiac was performed by me and it was negative. NEUROLOGIC: He is alert and oriented x2. He is slow to some extent in his response. No asterixis. Right-sided spastic hemiparesis with increased tone, increased reflexes, and weakness. Increased tone noted in upper and lower extremities on the right compared to the left. Deep tendon reflexes are +3 on the right and +2 on the left. Muscle strength is decreased on the right, more pronounced in the lower extremity compared to the upper extremity. The upper extremity is +4/5. Lower extremity is 3/5. The left side has a normal strength. Sensation appears to be intact. Babinski is upward on the right, equivocal on the left. PSYCHIATRIC: Flat affect. Mood appeared to be appropriate. No active hallucinations or psychotic symptoms. LABORATORY DATA: White count 4, hemoglobin 14.2, hematocrit 40.2%, platelets 85,000, PT is 13.4, INR is 1, BUN 7.8, glucose 105, sodium 141, potassium 3.9, bicarbonate 22.3, calcium 8.7, albumin 3.6, AST 39, ALT 27, alkaline phosphatase 140, total bilirubin is 0.9, and ammonia level is 106. IMAGING STUDIES: CT of the head. Film was reviewed. The report mentioned, status post frontal craniotomy and a small focus of encephalomalacia involving the left frontal lobe. This is likely consistent with residuals from his previous head injury. There is also mild generalized atrophy and changes consistent with chronic small vessel disease. No other findings on his CT. The skull is unremarkable except for the surgery changes. No acute abnormalities overall. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 1. Hepatic encephalopathy. Trigger is unclear at this time. Could be noncompliance. No evidence of GI bleed and his electrolytes are normal. I am not sure if he is taking any sedatives, as he does not recall the medication that he is on. The patient will be admitted to the hospital for management. He will be started on lactulose. I will give him 30 mL every two hours until he has a bowel movement. Then, we will adjust the dose to target three bowel movements daily and we will monitor his ammonia level and ensure that it is trending down. We will monitor his electrolyte and correct as needed and I will hydrate him, as hypovolemia is also a possible trigger. We will obtain an ultrasound of his abdomen to see if there is any ascites. At this time, there is no clinical evidence of SBP, but if he develops any fever may consider tapping his belly if there is ascites to rule out that possibility. 2. Thrombocytopenia likely due to cirrhosis. We will monitor the level. No need for transfusion at this time. 3. Macrocytosis also due to liver disease. I will check his vitamin levels, however, to ensure that he does not need any supplementation. 4. History of diabetes as per the patient. His glucose is 105. This can be clarified in the morning with his primary care physician. We will monitor his glucose for now. 5. Skull laceration. This was stapled by the ER physician and we will watch it for now, appear to be stable. No evidence of any other trauma. 6. We will watch him on the telemetry floor to ensure that he has no arrhythmias leading to his two falls, which appear to be incidental as per the patient. 7. Right-sided hemiparesis appear to be chronic and not an acute issue. The patient already has a walker at home. 8. We can try to obtain more information in the morning about his past medical history, medication, etc., from his family and/or his primary care physician at Sacaton. Time spent in evaluation and management of this patient in the emergency room exceeds 70 minutes."
245,Neurology," CC: Horizontal diplopia. HX: This 67 y/oRHM first began experiencing horizontal binocular diplopia 25 years prior to presentation in the Neurology Clinic. The diplopia began acutely and continued intermittently for one year. During this time he was twice evaluated for myasthenia gravis (details of evaluation not known) and was told he probably did not have this disease. He received no treatment and the diplopia spontaneously resolved. He did well until one year prior to presentation when he experienced sudden onset horizontal binocular diplopia. The diplopia continues to occur daily and intermittently; and lasts for only a few minutes in duration. It resolves when he covers one eye. It is worse when looking at distant objects and objects off to either side of midline. There are no other symptoms associated with the diplopia. PMH: 1)4Vessel CABG and pacemaker placement, 4/84. 2)Hypercholesterolemia. 3)Bipolar Affective D/O. FHX: HTN, Colon CA, and a daughter with unknown type of &quot;dystonia.&quot; SHX: Denied Tobacco/ETOH/illicit drug use. ROS: no recent weight loss/fever/chills/night sweats/CP/SOB. He occasionally experiences bilateral lower extremity cramping (?claudication) after walking for prolonged periods. MEDS: Lithium 300mg bid, Accupril 20mg bid, Cellufresh Ophthalmologic Tears, ASA 325mg qd. EXAM: BP216/108 HR72 RR14 Wt81.6kg T36.6C MS: unremarkable. CN: horizontal binocular diplopia on lateral gaze in both directions. No other CN deficits noted. Motor: 5/5 full strength throughout with normal muscle bulk and tone. Sensory: unremarkable. Coord: mild &quot;ataxia&quot; of RAM (left &gt; right) Station: no pronator drift or Romberg sign Gait: unremarkable. Reflexes: 2/2 symmetric throughout. Plantars (bilateral dorsiflexion) STUDIES/COURSE: Gen Screen: unremarkable. Brain CT revealed 1.0 x 1.5 cm area of calcific density within the medial two-thirds of the left cerebral peduncle. This shows no mass effect, but demonstrates mild contrast enhancement. There are patchy areas of low density in the periventricular white matter consistent with age related changes from microvascular disease. The midbrain findings are most suggestive of a hemangioma, though another consideration would be a low grade astrocytoma (this would likely show less enhancement). Metastatic lesions could show calcification but one would expect to see some degree of edema. The long standing clinical history suggest the former (i.e. hemangioma). No surgical or neuroradiologic intervention was done and the patient was simply followed. He was lost to follow-up in 1993."
246,Neurology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right temporal lobe intracerebral hemorrhage. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Right temporal lobe intracerebral hemorrhage. 2. Possible tumor versus inflammatory/infectious lesion versus vascular lesion, pending final pathology and microbiology. PROCEDURES: 1. Emergency right side craniotomy for temporal lobe intracerebral hematoma evacuation and resection of temporal lobe lesion. 2. Biopsy of dura. 3. Microscopic dissection using intraoperative microscope. SPECIMENS: Temporal lobe lesion and dura as well as specimen for microbiology for culture. DRAINS: Medium Hemovac drain. FINDINGS: Vascular hemorrhagic lesion including inflamed dura and edematous brain with significant mass effect, and intracerebral hematoma with a history of significant headache, probable seizures, nausea, and vomiting. ANESTHESIA: General. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Per Anesthesia. FLUIDS: One unit of packed red blood cells given intraoperatively. The patient was brought to the operating room emergently. This is considered as a life threatening admission with a hemorrhage in the temporal lobe extending into the frontal lobe and with significant mass effect. The patient apparently became hemiplegic suddenly today. She also had an episode of incoherence and loss of consciousness as well as loss of bowel/urine. She was brought to Emergency Room where a CT of the brain showed that she had significant hemorrhage of the right temporal lobe extending into the external capsule and across into the frontal lobe. There is significant mass effect. There is mixed density in the parenchyma of the temporal lobe. She was originally scheduled for elective craniotomy for biopsy of the temporal lobe to find out why she was having spontaneous hemorrhages. However, this event triggered her family to bring her to the emergency room, and this is considered a life threatening admission now with a significant mass effect, and thus we will proceed directly today for evacuation of ICH as well as biopsy of the temporal lobe as well as the dura. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was anesthetized by the anesthesiology team. Appropriate central line as well as arterial line, Foley catheter, TED, and SCDs were placed. The patient was positioned supine with a three-point Mayfield head pin holder. Her scalp was prepped and draped in a sterile manner. Her former incisional scar was barely and faintly noticed; however, through the same scalp scar, the same incision was made and extended slightly inferiorly. The scalp was resected anteriorly. The subdural scar was noted, and hemostasis was achieved using Bovie cautery. The temporalis muscle was reflected along with the scalp in a subperiosteal manner, and the titanium plating system was then exposed. The titanium plating system was then removed in its entirety. The bone appeared to be quite fused in multiple points, and there were significant granulation tissue through the burr hole covers. The granulation tissue was quite hemorrhagic, and hemostasis was achieved using bipolar cautery as well as Bovie cautery. The bone flap was then removed using Leksell rongeur, and the underlying dura was inspected. It was quite full. The 4-0 sutures from the previous durotomy closure was inspected, and more of the inferior temporal bone was resected using high-speed drill in combination with Leksell rongeur. The sphenoid wing was also resected using a high-speed drill as well as angled rongeur. Hemostasis was achieved on the fresh bony edges using bone wax. The dura pack-up stitches were noted around the periphery from the previous craniotomy. This was left in place. The microscope was then brought in to use for the remainder of the procedure until closure. Using a #15 blade, a new durotomy was then made. Then, the durotomy was carried out using Metzenbaum scissors, then reflected the dura anteriorly in a horseshoe manner, placed anteriorly, and this was done under the operating microscope. The underlying brain was quite edematous. Along the temporal lobe there was a stain of xanthochromia along the surface. Thus a corticectomy was then accomplished using bipolar cautery, and the temporal lobe at this level and the middle temporal gyrus was entered. The parenchyma of the brain did not appear normal. It was quite vascular. Furthermore, there was a hematoma mixed in with the brain itself. Thus a core biopsy was then performed in the temporal tip. The overlying dura was inspected and it was quite thickened, approximately 0.25 cm thick, and it was also highly vascular, and thus a big section of the dura was also trimmed using bipolar cautery followed by scissors, and several pieces of this vascularized dura was resected for pathology. Furthermore, sample of the temporal lobe was cultured. Hemostasis after evacuation of the intracerebral hematoma using controlled suction as well as significant biopsy of the overlying dura as well as intraparenchymal lesion was accomplished. No attempt was made to enter into the sylvian fissure. Once hemostasis was meticulously achieved, the brain was inspected. It still was quite swollen, known that there was still hematoma in the parenchyma of the brain. However, at this time it was felt that since there is no diagnosis made intraoperatively, we would need to stage this surgery further should it be needed once the diagnosis is confirmed. DuraGen was then used for duraplasty because of the resected dura. The bone flap was then repositioned using Lorenz plating system. Then a medium Hemovac drain was placed in subdural space. Temporalis muscle was approximated using 2-0 Vicryl. The galea was then reapproximated using inverted 2-0 Vicryl. The scalp was then reapproximated using staples. The head was then dressed and wrapped in a sterile fashion. She was witnessed to be extubated in the operating room postoperatively, and she followed commands briskly. The pupils are 3 mm bilaterally reactive to light. I accompanied her and transported her to the ICU where I signed out to the ICU attending."
247,Neurology," HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 58-year-old male who reports a six to eight-week history of balance problems with fatigue and weakness. He has had several falls recently. He apparently had pneumonia 10 days prior to the onset of the symptoms. He took a course of amoxicillin for this. He complained of increased symptoms with more and more difficulty with coordination. He fell at some point near the onset of the symptoms, but believes that his symptoms had occurred first. He fell from three to five feet and landed on his back. He began seeing a chiropractor approximately five days ago and had adjustments of the neck and lumbar spine, although he clearly had symptoms prior to this. He has had mid and low back pain intermittently. He took a 10-day course of Cipro believing that he had a UTI. He denies, however, any bowel or bladder problems. There is no incontinence and he does not feel that he is having any difficulty voiding. PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: He has a history of surgery on the left kidney, when it was &quot;rebuilt.&quot; He has had knee surgery, appendectomy and right inguinal hernia repair. MEDICATIONS: His only home medications had been Cipro and Aleve. However, he does take aspirin and several over the counter supplements including a multivitamin with iron, &quot;natural&quot; potassium, Starlix and the aspirin. ALLERGIES: HE HAS NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES. SOCIAL HISTORY: He smokes one-and-one-half-packs of cigarettes per day and drinks alcohol at least several days per week. He is employed in sales, which requires quite a bit of walking, but he is not doing any lifting. He had been a golfer in the past. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: He has had documented cervical spondylosis, apparently with an evaluation over 15 years ago. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Blood pressure 156/101, pulse was 88, respirations 18. He is afebrile. MENTAL STATUS: He is alert. CRANIAL NERVES: His pupils were reactive to light. He had a dense left cataract present. The right disk margin appears sharp. His eye movements were full. The face was symmetric. Pain and temperature sensation were intact over both sides of the face. The tongue was midline. NECK: His neck was supple. MUSCULOSKELETAL: He has intact strength and normal tone in the upper extremities. He had increased tone in both lower extremities. He had hip flexion of 4/5 on the left. He had intact strength on the right lower extremity, although had slight hammertoe deformity bilaterally. NEUROLOGIC: His reflexes were 2+ in the upper extremities, 3+ at the knees and 1+ at the ankles. He withdrew to plantar stimulation on the left, but did not have a Babinski response clearly present. He had intact finger-to-nose testing. Marked impairment in heel-to-shin testing. He was able to sit unassisted. He stood with assistance, but had a markedly ataxic gait. On sensory exam, he had a slight distal gradient to pin and vibratory sense in both lower extremities, but also had a decrease in sensation to pin over the right lower extremity compared to the left. CARDIOVASCULAR: He had no carotid bruits. His heart rhythm was regular. BACK: There was no focal back pain present. He did have a slight sensory level at the upper T spine at approximately T3, both anteriorly and posteriorly. RADIOLOGIC DATA: MRI by my view showed essentially unremarkable T spine. The MRI of his C spine showed significant spondylosis in the mid and lower C spine with spondylolisthesis at C7-T1. There is an abnormal signal in the cord which begins at approximately this level, but descends approximately 2 cm. There is slight enhancement at the mid-portion of the lesion. This appears to be an intrinsic lesion to the cord, not clearly associated with mild to moderate spinal stenosis at the level of the spondylolisthesis. LABORATORY: His initial labs were unremarkable. IMPRESSION: Cervical cord lesion at the C7 to T2 level of unclear etiology. Consider a transverse myelitis, tumor, contusion or ischemic lesion. PLAN: Will check labs including sedimentation rate, MRI of the brain, chest x-ray. He will probably need a lumbar puncture. He also appears to have a mild peripheral neuropathy, which I suspect is an independent problem. We will request labs for this."
248,Neurology," CC: Fluctuating level of consciousness. HX: 59y/o male experienced a &quot;pop&quot; in his head on 10/10/92 while showering in Cheyenne, Wyoming. He was visiting his son at the time. He was found unconscious on the shower floor 1.5 hours later. His son then drove him Back to Iowa. Since then he has had recurrent headaches and fluctuating level of consciousness, according to his wife. He presented at local hospital this AM, 10/13/92. A HCT there demonstrated a subarachnoid hemorrhage. He was then transferred to UIHC. MEDS: none. PMH: 1) Right hip and clavicle fractures many years ago. 2) All of his teeth have been removed.

COURSE: The patient underwent Cerebral Angiography on 10/13/92. This revealed a lobulated aneurysm off the supraclinoid portion of the left internal carotid artery close to the origin of the posterior communication artery. The patient subsequently underwent clipping of this aneurysm. He recovery was complicated severe vasospasm and bacterial meningitis. HCT on 10/19/92 revealed multiple low density areas in the left hemisphere in the LACA-LPCA watershed, left fronto-parietal area and left thalamic region. He was left with residual right hemiparesis, urinary incontinence, some (unspecified) degree of mental dysfunction. He was last seen 2/26/93 in Neurosurgery clinic and had stable deficits."
249,Neurology," CHIEF COMPLAINT: Falls at home. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is an 82-year-old female who fell at home and presented to the emergency room with increased anxiety. Family members who are present state that the patient had been increasingly anxious and freely admitted that she was depressed at home. They noted that she frequently came to the emergency room for &quot;attention.&quot; The patient denied any chest pain or pressure and no change to exercise tolerance. The patient denied any loss of consciousness or incontinence. She denies any seizure activity. She states that she &quot;tripped&quot; at home. Family states she frequently takes Darvocet for her anxiety and that makes her feel better, but they are afraid she is self medicating. They stated that she has numerous medications at home, but they were not sure if she was taking them. The patient been getting along for a number of years and has been doing well, but recently has been noting some decline primarily with regards to her depression. The patient denied SI or HI. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: GENERAL: The patient is pleasant 82-year-old female in no acute distress. VITAL SIGNS: Stable. HEENT: Negative. NECK: Supple. Carotid upstrokes are 2+. LUNGS: Clear. HEART: Normal S1 and S2. No gallops. Rate is regular. ABDOMEN: Soft. Positive bowel sounds. Nontender. EXTREMITIES: No edema. There is some ecchymosis noted to the left great toe. The area is tender; however, metatarsal is nontender. NEUROLOGICAL: Grossly nonfocal. HOSPITAL COURSE: A psychiatric evaluation was obtained due to the patient's increased depression and anxiety. Continue Paxil and Xanax use was recommended.

250,Neurology," EXAM: CT head without contrast, CT facial bones without contrast, and CT cervical spine without contrast. REASON FOR EXAM: A 68-year-old status post fall with multifocal pain. COMPARISONS: None. TECHNIQUE: Sequential axial CT images were obtained from the vertex to the thoracic inlet without contrast. Additional high-resolution sagittal and/or coronal reconstructed images were obtained through the facial bones and cervical spine for better visualization of the osseous structures. INTERPRETATIONS: HEAD: There is mild generalized atrophy. Scattered patchy foci of decreased attenuation is seen in the subcortical and periventricular white matter consistent with chronic small vessel ischemic changes. There are subtle areas of increased attenuation seen within the frontal lobes bilaterally. Given the patient's clinical presentation, these likely represent small hemorrhagic contusions. Other differential considerations include cortical calcifications, which are less likely. The brain parenchyma is otherwise normal in attenuation without evidence of mass, midline shift, hydrocephalus, extra-axial fluid, or acute infarction. The visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear. The bony calvarium and skull base are unremarkable. FACIAL BONES: The osseous structures about the face are grossly intact without acute fracture or dislocation. The orbits and extra-ocular muscles are within normal limits. There is diffuse mucosal thickening in the ethmoid and right maxillary sinuses. The remaining visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear. Diffuse soft tissue swelling is noted about the right orbit and right facial bones without underlying fracture. CERVICAL SPINE: There is mild generalized osteopenia. There are diffuse multilevel degenerative changes identified extending from C4-C7 with disk space narrowing, sclerosis, and marginal osteophyte formation. The remaining cervical vertebral body heights are maintained without acute fracture, dislocation, or spondylolisthesis. The central canal is grossly patent. The pedicles and posterior elements appear intact with multifocal facet degenerative changes. There is no prevertebral or paravertebral soft tissue masses identified. The atlanto-dens interval and dens are maintained. IMPRESSION: 1.Subtle areas of increased attenuation identified within the frontal lobes bilaterally suggesting small hemorrhagic contusions. There is no associated shift or mass effect at this time. Less likely, this finding could be secondary to cortical calcifications. The patient may benefit from a repeat CT scan of the head or MRI for additional evaluation if clinically indicated. 2.Atrophy and chronic small vessel ischemic changes in the brain. 3.Ethmoid and right maxillary sinus congestion and diffuse soft tissue swelling over the right side of the face without underlying fracture. 4.Osteopenia and multilevel degenerative changes in the cervical spine as described above. 5.Findings were discussed with Dr. X from the emergency department at the time of interpretation."
251,Neurology," CC: Progressive lower extremity weakness. HX: This 54 y/o RHF presented on 7/3/93 with a 2 month history of lower extremity weakness. She was admitted to a local hospital on 5/3/93 for a 3 day h/o of progressive BLE weakness associated with incontinence and BLE numbness. There was little symptom of upper extremity weakness at that time, according to the patient. Her evaluation was notable for a bilateral L1 sensory level and 4/4 strength in BLE. A T-L-S Spine MRI revealed a T4-6 lipomatosis with anterior displacement of the cord without cord compression. CSF analysis yielded: opening pressure of 14cm H20, protein 88, glucose 78, 3 lymphocytes and 160 RBC, no oligoclonal bands or elevated IgG index, and negative cytology. Bone marrow biopsy was negative. B12, Folate, and Ferritin levels were normal. CRP 5.2 (elevated). ANA was positive at 1:5,120 in speckled pattern. Her hospital course was complicated by deep venous thrombosis, which recurred after heparin was stopped to do the bone marrow biopsy. She was subsequently placed on Coumadin. EMG/NCV testing revealed &quot; lumbosacral polyradiculopathy with axonal degeneration and nerve conduction block.&quot; She was diagnosed with atypical Guillain-Barre vs. polyradiculopathy and received a single course of Decadron; and no plasmapheresis or IV IgG. She was discharged home o 6/8/93. She subsequently did not improve and after awaking from a nap on her couch the day of presentation, 7/3/93, she found she was paralyzed from the waist down. There was associated mild upper lumbar back pain without radiation. She had had no bowel movement or urination since that time. She had no recent trauma, fever, chills, changes in vision, dysphagia or upper extremity deficit. MEDS: Coumadin 7.5mg qd, Zoloft 50mg qd, Lithium 300mg bid. PMH: 1) Bi-polar Affective Disorder, dx 1979 2) C-section. FHX: Unremarkable. SHX: Denied Tobacco/ETOH/illicit drug use. EXAM: BP118/64, HR103, RR18, Afebrile. MS: A&O to person, place, time. Speech fluent without dysarthria. Lucid thought processes. CN: Unremarkable. MOTOR: 5/5 strength in BUE. Plegic in BLE. Flaccid muscle tone. SENSORY: L1 sensory level (bilaterally) to PP and TEMP, without sacral sparing. Proprioception was lost in both feet. CORD: Normal in BUE. Reflexes were 2+/2+ in BUE. They were not elicited in BLE. Plantar responses were equivocal, bilaterally. RECTAL: Poor rectal tone. stool guaiac negative. She had no perirectal sensation. COURSE: CRP 8.8 and ESR 76. FVC 2.17L. WBC 1.5 (150 bands, 555 neutrophils, 440 lymphocytes and 330 monocytes), Hct 33%, Hgb 11.0, Plt 220K, MCV 88, GS normal except for slightly low total protein (8.0). LFT were normal. Creatinine 1.0. PT and PTT were normal. ABCG 7.46/25/79/96% O2Sat. UA notable for 1+ proteinuria. EKG normal. MRI L-spine, 7/3/93, revealed an area of abnormally increased T2 signal extending from T12 through L5. This area causes anterior displacement of the spinal cord and nerve roots. The cauda equina are pushed up against the posterior L1 vertebral body. There bilaterally pulmonary effusions. There is also abnormally increased T2 signal in the center of the spinal cord extending from the mid thoracic level through the conus. In addition, the Fila Terminale appear thickened. There is increased signal in the T3 vertebral body suggestion a hemangioma. The findings were felt consistent with a large epidural lipoma displacing the spinal cord anteriorly. there also appeared spinal cord swelling and increased signal within the spinal cord which suggests an intramedullary process. CSF analysis revealed: protein 1,342, glucose 43, RBC 4,900, WBC 9. C3 and C$ complement levels were 94 and 18 respectively (normal) Anticardiolipin antibodies were negative. Serum Beta-2 microglobulin was elevated at 2.4 and 3.7 in the CSF and Serum, respectively. It was felt the patient had either a transverse myelitis associated with SLE vs. partial cord infarction related to lupus vasculopathy or hypercoagulable state. She was place on IV Decadron. Rheumatology felt that a diagnosis of SLE was likely. Pulmonary effusion analysis was consistent with an exudate. She was treated with plasma exchange and place on Cytoxan. On 7/22/93 she developed fever with associated proptosis and sudden loss of vision, OD. MRI Brain, 7/22/93, revealed a 5mm thick area of intermediate signal adjacent to the posterior aspect of the right globe, possibly representing hematoma. Ophthalmology felt she had a central retinal vein occlusion; and it was surgically decompressed. She was placed on prednisone on 8/11/93 and Cytoxan was started on 8/16/93. She developed a headache with meningismus on 8/20/93. CSF analysis revealed: protein 1,002, glucose2, WBC 8,925 (majority were neutrophils). Sinus CT scan negative. She was placed on IV Antibiotics for presumed bacterial meningitis. Cultures were subsequently negative. She spontaneously recovered. 8/25/93, cisternal tap CSF analysis revealed: protein 126, glucose 35, WBC 144 (neutrophils), RBC 95, Cultures negative, cytology negative. MRI Brain scan revealed diffuse leptomeningeal enhancement in both brain and spinal canal. DSDNA negative. She developed leukopenia in 9/93, and she was switched from Cytoxan to Imuran. Her LFT's rose and the Imuran was stopped and she was placed back on prednisone. She went on to have numerous deep venous thrombosis while on Coumadin. This required numerous hospital admissions for heparinization. Anticardiolipin antibodies and Protein C and S testing was negative."
252,Neurology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Multiple metastatic lesions to the brain, a subtentorial lesion on the left, greater than 3 cm, and an infratentorial lesion on the right, greater than 3 cm. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Multiple metastatic lesions to the brain, a subtentorial lesion on the left, greater than 3 cm, and an infratentorial lesion on the right, greater than 3 cm. TITLE OF THE OPERATION: 1. Biparietal craniotomy and excision of left parietooccipital metastasis from breast cancer. 2. Insertion of left lateral ventriculostomy under Stealth stereotactic guidance. 3. Right suboccipital craniectomy and excision of tumor. 4. Microtechniques for all the above. 5. Stealth stereotactic guidance for all of the above and intraoperative ultrasound. INDICATIONS: The patient is a 48-year-old woman with a diagnosis of breast cancer made five years ago. A year ago, she was diagnosed with cranial metastases and underwent whole brain radiation. She recently has deteriorated such that she came to my office, unable to ambulate in a wheelchair. Metastatic workup does reveal multiple bone metastases, but no spinal cord compression. She had a consult with Radiation-Oncology that decided they could radiate her metastases less than 3 cm with stereotactic radiosurgery, but the lesions greater than 3 cm needed to be removed. Consequently, this operation is performed. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient underwent a planning MRI scan with Stealth protocol. She was brought to the operating room with fiducial still on her scalp. General endotracheal anesthesia was obtained. She was placed on the Mayfield head holder and rolled into the prone position. She was well padded, secured, and so forth. The neck was flexed so as to expose the right suboccipital region as well as the left and right parietooccipital regions. The posterior aspect of the calvarium was shaved and prepared in the usual manner with Betadine soak scrub followed by Betadine paint. This was done only, of course, after fiducial were registered in planning and an excellent accuracy was obtained with the Stealth system. Sterile drapes were applied and the accuracy of the system was confirmed. A biparietal incision was performed. A linear incision was chosen so as to increase her chances of successful wound healing and that she is status post whole brain radiation. A biparietal craniotomy was carried out, carrying about 1 cm over toward the right side and about 4 cm over to the left side as guided by the Stealth stereotactic system. The dura was opened and reflected back to the midline. An inner hemispheric approach was used to reach the very large metastatic tumor. This was very delicate removing the tumor and the co-surgeons switched off to spare one another during the more delicate parts of the operation to remove the tumor. The tumor was wrapped around and included the choroidal vessels. At least one choroidal vessel was sacrificed in order to obtain a gross total excision of the tumor on the parietal occipital region. Bleeding was quite vigorous in some of the arteries and finally, however, was completely controlled. Complete removal of the tumor was confirmed by intraoperative ultrasound. Once the tumor had been removed and meticulous hemostasis was obtained, this wound was left opened and attention was turned to the right suboccipital area. A linear incision was made just lateral to the greater occipital nerve. Sharp dissection was carried down in the subcutaneous tissues and Bovie electrocautery was used to reach the skull. A burr hole was placed down low using a craniotome. A craniotomy was turned and then enlarged as a craniectomy to at least 4 cm in diameter. It was carried caudally to the floor of the posterior fossa and rostrally to the transverse sinus. Stealth and ultrasound were used to localize the very large tumor that was within the horizontal hemisphere of the cerebellum. The ventriculostomy had been placed on the left side with the craniotomy and removal of the tumor, and this was draining CSF relieving pressure in the posterior fossa. Upon opening the craniotomy in the parietal occipital region, the brain was noted to be extremely tight, thus necessitating placement of the ventriculostomy. At the posterior fossa, a corticectomy was accomplished and the tumor was countered directly. The tumor, as the one above, was removed, both piecemeal and with intraoperative Cavitron Ultrasonic Aspirator. A gross total excision of this tumor was obtained as well. I then explored underneath the cerebellum in hopes of finding another metastasis in the CP angle; however, this was just over the lower cranial nerves, and rather than risk paralysis of pharyngeal muscles and voice as well as possibly hearing loss, this lesion was left alone and to be radiated and that it is less than 3 cm in diameter. Meticulous hemostasis was obtained for this wound as well. The posterior fossa wound was then closed in layers. The dura was closed with interrupted and running mattress of 4-0 Nurolon. The dura was watertight, and it was covered with blue glue. Gelfoam was placed over the dural closure. Then, the muscle and fascia were closed in individual layers using #0 Ethibond. Subcutaneous was closed with interrupted inverted 2-0 and 0 Vicryl, and the skin was closed with running locking 3-0 Nylon. For the cranial incision, the ventriculostomy was brought out through a separate stab wound. The bone flap was brought on to the field. The dura was closed with running and interrupted 4-0 Nurolon. At the beginning of the case, dural tack-ups had been made and these were still in place. The sinuses, both the transverse sinus and sagittal sinus, were covered with thrombin-soaked Gelfoam to take care of any small bleeding areas in the sinuses. Once the dura was closed, the bone flap was returned to the wound and held in place with the Lorenz microplates. The wound was then closed in layers. The galea was closed with multiple sutures of interrupted 2-0 Vicryl. The skin was closed with a running locking 3-0 Nylon. Estimated blood loss for the case was more than 1 L. The patient received 2 units of packed red cells during the case as well as more than 1 L of Hespan and almost 3 L of crystalloid. Nevertheless, her vitals remained stable throughout the case, and we hopefully helped her survival and her long-term neurologic status for this really nice lady."
253,Neurology," CC: Weakness. HX: This 30 y/o RHM was in good health until 7/93, when he began experiencing RUE weakness and neck pain. He was initially treated by a chiropractor and, after an unspecified length of time, developed atrophy and contractures of his right hand. He then went to a local neurosurgeon and a cervical spine CT scan, 9/25/92, revealed an intramedullary lesion at C2-3 and an extramedullary lesion at C6-7. He underwent a C6-T1 laminectomy with exploration and decompression of the spinal cord. His clinical condition improved over a 3 month post-operative period, and then progressively worsened. He developed left sided paresthesia and upper extremity weakness (right worse than left). He then developed ataxia, nausea, vomiting, and hyperreflexia. On 8/31/93, MRI C-spine showed diffuse enlargement of the cervical and thoracic spine and multiple enhancing nodules in the posterior fossa. On 9/1/93, he underwent suboccipital craniotomy with tumor excision, decompression, and biopsy which was consistent with hemangioblastoma. His symptoms stabilized and he underwent 5040 cGy in 28 fractions to his brain and 3600 cGy in 20 fractions to his cervical and thoracic spinal cord from 9/93 through 1/19/94. He was evaluated in the NeuroOncology clinic on 10/26/95 for consideration of chemotherapy. He complained of progressive proximal weakness of all four extremities and dysphagia. He had difficulty putting on his shirt and raising his arms, and he had been having increasing difficulty with manual dexterity (e.g. unable to feed himself with utensils). He had difficulty going down stairs, but could climb stairs. He had no bowel or bladder incontinence or retention. MEDS: none. PMH: see above. FHX: Father with Von Hippel-Lindau Disease. SHX: retired truck driver. smokes 1-3 packs of cigarettes per day, but denied alcohol use. He is divorced and has two sons who are healthy. He lives with his mother. ROS: noncontributory. EXAM: Vital signs were unremarkable. MS: A&O to person, place and time. Speech fluent and without dysarthria. Thought process lucid and appropriate. CN: unremarkable exept for 4+/4+ strength of the trapezeii. No retinal hemangioblastoma were seen. MOTOR: 4-/4- strength in proximal and distal upper extremities. There is diffuse atrophy and claw-hands, bilaterally. He is unable to manipulate hads to any great extent. 4+/4+ strength throughout BLE. There is also diffuse atrophy throughout the lower extremities though not as pronounced as in the upper extremities. SENSORY: There was a right T3 and left T8 cord levels to PP on the posterior thorax. Decreased LT in throughout the 4 extremities. COORD: difficult to assess due to weakness. Station: BUE pronator drift. Gait: stands without assistance, but can only manage to walk a few steps. Spastic gait. Reflexes: Hyperreflexic on left (3+) and Hyporeflexic on right (1). Babinski signs were present bilaterally. Gen exam: unremarkable. COURSE: 9/8/95, GS normal. By 11/14/95, he required NGT feeding due to dysphagia and aspiration risk confirmed on cookie swallow studies.MRI Brain, 2/19/96, revealed several lesions (hemangioblastoma) in the cerebellum and brain stem. There were postoperative changes and a cyst in the medulla. On 10/25/96, he presented with a 1.5 week h/o numbness in BLE from the mid- thighs to his toes, and worsening BLE weakness. He developed decubitus ulcers on his buttocks. He also had had intermittent urinary retention for month, chronic SOB and dysphagia. He had been sitting all day long as he could not move well and had no daytime assistance. His exam findings were consistent with his complaints. He had had no episodes of diaphoresis, headache, or elevated blood pressures. An MRI of the C-T spine, 10/26/96, revealed a prominent cervicothoracic syrinx extending down to T10. There was evidence of prior cervical laminectomy of C6-T1 with expansion of the cord in the thecalsac at that region. Multiple intradural extra spinal nodular lesions (hyperintense on T2, isointense on T1, enhanced gadolinium) were seen in the cervical spine and cisterna magna. The largest of which measures 1.1 x 1.0 x 2.0cm. There are also several large ring enhancing lesions in cerebellum. The lesions were felt to be consistent with hemangioblastoma. No surgical or medical intervention was initiated. Visiting nursing was provided. He has since been followed by his local physician"
254,Neurology," HISTORY: This is a digital EEG performed on a 75-year-old male with seizures. BACKGROUND ACTIVITY: The background activity consists of a 8 Hz to 9 Hz rhythm arising in the posterior head region. This rhythm is also accompanied by some beta activity which occurs infrequently. There are also muscle contractions occurring at 4 Hz to 5 Hz which suggests possible Parkinson's. Part of the EEG is obscured by the muscle contraction artifact. There are also left temporal sharps occurring infrequently during the tracing. At one point of time, there was some slowing occurring in the right frontal head region. ACTIVATION PROCEDURES: Photic stimulation was performed and did not show any significant abnormality. SLEEP PATTERNS: No sleep architecture was observed during this tracing. IMPRESSION: This awake/alert/drowsy EEG is abnormal due to the presence of slowing in the right frontal head region, due to the presence of sharps arising in the left temporal head region, and due to the tremors. The slowing can be consistent with underlying structural abnormalities, so a stroke, subdural hematoma, etc., should be ruled out. The tremor probably represents a Parkinson's tremor and the sharps arising in the left temporal head region can potentially give way to seizures or may also represent underlying structural abnormalities, so clinical correlation is recommended."
255,Neurology," CC: Rapidly progressive amnesia. HX: This 63 y/o RHM presented with a 1 year history of progressive anterograde amnesia. On presentation he could not remember anything from one minute to the next. He also had some retrograde memory loss, in that he could not remember the names of his grandchildren, but had generally preserved intellect, language, personality, and calculating ability. He underwent extensive evaluation at the Mayo Clinic and an MRI there revealed increased signal on T2 weighted images in the mesiotemporal lobes bilaterally. There was no mass affect. The areas mildly enhanced with gadolinium. PMH: 1) CAD; MI x 2 (1978 and 1979). 2) PVD; s/p aortic endarterectomy (3/1991). 3)HTN. 4)Bilateral inguinal hernia repair. FHX/SHX: Mother died of a stroke at age 58. Father had CAD and HTN. The patient quit smoking in 1991, but was a heavy smoker (2-3ppd) for many years. He had been a feed salesman all of his adult life. ROS: Unremarkable. No history of cancer. EXAM: BP 136/75 HR 73 RR12 T36.6 MS: Alert but disoriented to person, place, time. He could not remember his birthdate, and continually asked the interviewer what year it was. He could not remember when he married, retired, or his grandchildren's names. He scored 18/30 on the Follutein's MMSE with severe deficits in orientation and memory. He had moderate difficulty naming. He repeated normally and had no constructional apraxia. Judgement remained good. CN: unremarkable. Motor: Full strength throughout with normal muscle tone and bulk. Sensory: Intact to LT/PP/PROP Coordination: unremarkable. Station: No pronator drift, truncal ataxia or Romberg sign. Gait: unremarkable. Reflexes: 3+ throughout with downgoing plantar responses bilaterally. Gen Exam: unremarkable. STUDIES: MRI Brain revealed hyperintense T2 signal in the mesiotemporal regions bilaterally, with mild enhancement on the gadolinium scans. MRI and CT of the chest and CT of the abdomen showed no evidence of lymphadenopathy or tumor. EEG was normal awake and asleep. Antineuronal antibody screening was unremarkable. CSF studies were unremarkable and included varicella zoster, herpes zoster, HIV and HTLV testing, and cytology. The patient underwent stereotactic brain biopsy at the Mayo Clinic which showed inflammatory changes, but no organism or etiology was concluded. TFT, B12, VDRL, ESR, CRP, ANA, SPEP and Folate studies were unremarkable. Neuropsychologic testing revealed severe anterograde memory (verbal and visual)loss, and less severe retrograde memory loss. Most other cognitive abilities were well preserved and the findings were consistent with mesiotemporal dysfunction bilaterally. IMPRESSION: Limbic encephalitis secondary to cancer of unknown origin. He was last seen 7/26/96. MMSE 20/30 and category fluency 20 . Disinhibited affect. Mild right grasp reflex. The clinical course was benign and non-progressive, and unusual for such a diagnosis, though not unheard of ."
256,Neurology," CC: Falling. HX: This 67y/o RHF was diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease in 9/1/95, by a local physician. For one year prior to the diagnosis, the patient experienced staggering gait, falls and episodes of lightheadedness. She also noticed that she was slowly &quot;losing&quot; her voice, and that her handwriting was becoming smaller and smaller. Two months prior to diagnosis, she began experienced bradykinesia, but denied any tremor. She noted no improvement on Sinemet, which was started in 9/95. At the time of presentation, 2/13/96, she continued to have problems with coordination and staggering gait. She felt weak in the morning and worse as the day progressed. She denied any fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, HA, change in vision, seizures or stroke like events, or problems with upper extremity coordination. MEDS: Sinemet CR 25/100 1tab TID, Lopressor 25mg qhs, Vitamin E 1tab TID, Premarin 1.25mg qd, Synthroid 0.75mg qd, Oxybutynin 2.5mg has, isocyamine 0.125mg qd.

CN: Pupils 5/5 decreasing to 2/2 on exposure to light. Disks flat. Remainder of CN exam unremarkable. Motor: 5/5 strength throughout. NO tremor noted at rest or elicited upon movement or distraction Sensory: Unremarkable PP/VIB testing. Coord: Did not show sign of dysmetria, dyssynergia, or dysdiadochokinesia. There was mild decrement on finger tapping and clasping/unclasping hands (right worse than left). Gait: Slow gait with difficulty turning on point. Difficulty initiating gait. There was reduced BUE swing on walking (right worse than left). Station: 3-4step retropulsion. Reflexes: 2/2 and symmetric throughout BUE and patellae. 1/1 Achilles. Plantar responses were flexor. Gen Exam: Inremarkable. HEENT: unremarkable. COURSE: The patient continued Sinemet CR 25/100 1tab TID and was told to monitor orthostatic BP at home. The evaluating Neurologist became concerned that she may have Parkinsonism plus dysautonomia. She was seen again on 5/28/96 and reported no improvement in her condition. In addition she complained of worsening lightheadedness upon standing and had an episode, 1 week prior to 5/28/96, in which she was at her kitchen table and became unable to move. There were no involuntary movements or alteration in sensorium/mental status. During the episode she recalled wanting to turn, but could not. Two weeks prior to 5/28/96 she had an episode of orthostatic syncope in which she struck her head during a fall. She discontinued Sinemet 5 days prior to 5/28/96 and felt better. She felt she was moving slower and that her micrographia had worsened. She had had recent difficulty rolling over in bed and has occasional falls when turning. She denied hypophonia, dysphagia or diplopia. On EXAM: BP (supine)153/110 with HR 88. BP (standing)110/80 with HR 96. (+) Myerson's sign and mild hypomimia, but no hypophonia. There was normal blinking and EOM. Motor strength was full throughout. No resting tremor, but mild postural tremor present. No rigidity noted. Mild decrement on finger tapping noted. Reflexes were symmetric. No Babinski signs and no clonus. Gait was short stepped with mild anteroflexed posture. She was unable to turn on point. 3-4 step Retropulsion noted. The Parkinsonism had been unresponsive to Sinemet and she had autonomic dysfunction suggestive of Shy-Drager syndrome. It was recommended that she liberalize dietary salt use and lie with head of the bed elevate at 20-30 degrees at night. Indomethacin was suggested to improve BP in future."
257,Neurology," REASON FOR VISIT: Followup status post L4-L5 laminectomy and bilateral foraminotomies, and L4-L5 posterior spinal fusion with instrumentation. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. ABC returns today for followup status post L4-L5 laminectomy and bilateral foraminotomies, and posterior spinal fusion on 06/08/07. Preoperatively, her symptoms, those of left lower extremity are radicular pain. She had not improved immediately postoperatively. She had a medial breech of a right L4 pedicle screw. We took her back to the operating room same night and reinserted the screw. Postoperatively, her pain had improved. I had last seen her on 06/28/07 at which time she was doing well. She had symptoms of what she thought was &quot;restless leg syndrome&quot; at that time. She has been put on ReQuip for this. She returned. I had spoken to her 2 days ago and she had stated that her right lower extremity pain was markedly improved. I had previously evaluated this for a pain possibly relating to deep venous thrombosis and ultrasound was negative. She states that she had recurrent left lower extremity pain, which was similar to the pain she had preoperatively but in a different distribution, further down the leg. Thus, I referred her for a lumbar spine radiograph and lumbar spine MRI and she presents today for evaluation. She states that overall, she is improved compared to preoperatively. She is ambulating better than she was preoperatively. The pain is not as severe as it was preoperatively. The right leg pain is improved. The left lower extremity pain is in a left L4 and L5 distribution radiating to the great toe and first web space on the left side. She denies any significant low back pain. No right lower extremity symptoms. No infectious symptoms whatsoever. No fever, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath. No drainage from the wound. No difficulties with the incision. FINDINGS: On examination, Ms. ABC is a pleasant, well-developed, well-nourished female in no apparent distress. Alert and oriented x 3. Normocephalic, atraumatic. Respirations are normal and nonlabored. Afebrile to touch. Left tibialis anterior strength is 3 out of 5, extensor hallucis strength is 2 out of 5. Gastroc-soleus strength is 3 to 4 out of 5. This has all been changed compared to preoperatively. Motor strength is otherwise 4 plus out of 5. Light touch sensation decreased along the medial aspect of the left foot. Straight leg raise test normal bilaterally. The incision is well healed. There is no fluctuance or fullness with the incision whatsoever. No drainage. Radiographs obtained today demonstrate pedicle screw placement at L4 and L5 bilaterally without evidence of malposition or change in orientation of the screws. Lumbar spine MRI performed on 07/03/07 is also reviewed. It demonstrates evidence of adequate decompression at L4 and L5. There is a moderate size subcutaneous fluid collection seen, which does not appear compressive and may be compatible with normal postoperative fluid collection, especially given the fact that she had a revision surgery performed. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Ms. ABC is doing relatively well status post L4 and L5 laminectomy and bilateral foraminotomies, and posterior spinal fusion with instrumentation on 07/08/07. The case is significant for merely misdirected right L4 pedicle screw, which was reoriented with subsequent resolution of symptoms. I am uncertain with regard to the etiology of the symptoms. However, it does appear that the radiographs demonstrate appropriate positioning of the instrumentation, no hardware shift, and the MRI demonstrates only a postoperative suprafascial fluid collection. I do not see any indication for another surgery at this time. I would also like to hold off on an interventional pain management given the presence of the fluid collection to decrease the risk of infection. My recommendation at this time is that the patient is to continue with mobilization. I have reassured her that her spine appears stable at this time. She is happy with this. I would like her to continue ambulating as much as possible. She can go ahead and continue with ReQuip for the restless leg syndrome as her primary care physician has suggested. I have also her referred to Mrs. Khan at Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation for continued aggressive management. I will see her back in followup in 3 to 4 weeks to make sure that she continues to improve. She knows that if she has any difficulties, she may follow up with me sooner."
258,Neurology," REASON FOR VISIT: The patient is an 84-year-old man who returns for revaluation of possible idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus. He is accompanied by his wife and daughter. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: I first saw him nearly a year ago on December 20, 2007. At that time, he had had a traumatic deterioration over the course of approximately eight months. This included severe cognitive impairment, gait impairment, and incontinence. He had actually been evaluated at Hospital with CSF drainage via a temporary spinal catheter, but there was no response that was noted. When I saw him, there were findings consistent with cervical stenosis and I ordered an MRI scan of the cervical spine. I subsequently referred him to Dr. X, who performed a cervical laminectomy and instrumented fusion on July 16, 2008. According to his notes this went well. According to the family, there has not been any improvement. With regard to the gait and balance, they actually think that he is worse now than he was a year ago. He is virtually unable to walk at all. He needs both a walker and support from an assistant to be able to stand or walk. Therefore, he is always in the wheelchair. He is completely incontinent. He never indicates his need to the go to the bathroom. On the other hand when asked, he will indicate that he needs to go. He wears a Depends undergarment all the time. He has no headaches. His thinking and memory are worse. For the most part, he is apathetic. He does not talk very much. He lives in a skilled nursing facility in the Alzheimer's section. He does have some daytime activities. He takes a nap once a day. He does not read very much. On the other hand, he did recently exercise the right to vote in the presidential election. He needs full assistance at the nursing home. MEDICATIONS: From the list by the nursing home are Aricept 10 mg in the evening, carbidopa/levodopa 25/100 mg three times a day, citalopram (Celexa) 40 mg daily, Colace 100 mg twice a day, finasteride (Proscar) 5 mg once a day, Flomax (tamsulosin) 0.4 mg once a day, multivitamin with iron once a day, omeprazole (Prilosec) 20 mg once a day, senna 8.6 mg twice a day, Tylenol 650 mg as needed, and promethazine 25 mg as needed. PHYSICAL EXAM: On examination today, this is a pleasant 81-year-old man who is brought back from the clinic waiting area in a wheelchair. He is well developed, well nourished, and kempt. Vital Signs: Temperature 96.7, pulse 62, respirations 16, and blood pressure 123/71. Head: The head is normocephalic and atraumatic. Mental Status: Assessed for orientation, recent and remote memory, attention span, concentration, language, and fund of knowledge. The Mini-Mental State Exam score was 14/30. He was not at all oriented. He did know we were at Sinai Hospital on the second floor. He could spell 'world' forward, but was mute when asked to spell backwards. He was mute when asked to recall 3/3 objects for delayed recall. He could not copy a diagram of intersecting pentagons. For comparison, the Mini-Mental State exam score last December was 20/30 when attention was tested by having him spell 'world' backwards and 28/30 when tested with serial 7 subtractions. Additionally, there are times when he stutters or stammers. I do not see any paraphasic errors. There is some evidence of ideomotor apraxia. He is also stimulus bound. There is a tendency to mimic. Cranial Nerve Exam: There is no upgaze that I can elicit today. The horizontal gaze and down gaze are intact. This is a change from a year ago. The muscles of facial expiration are intact as are hearing, head turning, cough, tongue, and palate movement. Motor Exam: Normal bulk and strength. The tone is characterized by paratonia. There is no atrophy, fasciculations, drift, or tremor. Sensory Exam: Intact to light touch. Cerebellar Exam: Intact for finger-to-nose testing that he can perform only by mimicking, but not by following verbal commands. Gait: Severely impaired. When in the wheelchair, he leans to one side. He cannot getup on his own. He needs assistance. Once up, he can bear weight, but cannot maintain his balance. This would amount to a Tinetti score of zero. REVIEW OF X-RAYS: I personally reviewed the CT scan of the brain from November 1, 2008 and compared it to the MRI scan from a year ago. The ventricles appear larger to me now in comparison to a year ago. The frontal horn span is now 6 cm, whereas previously it was about 5.5 cm. The 3rd ventricular span is about 15 mm. There is no obvious atrophy, although there may be some subtle bilateral perisylvian atrophy. The scan from a year ago showed that there was a patent sylvian aqueduct. ASSESSMENT: The patient has had worsening of his gait, his dementia, and his incontinence. The new finding for me today is the limited upgaze. This would be consistent either with progressive supranuclear palsy, which was one of the differential diagnoses a year ago, or it could be consistent with progressive enlargement of the ventricles. PROBLEMS/DIAGNOSES: 1. Question of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (331.5). 2. Possible supranuclear palsy. 3. Severe gait impairment. 4. Urinary urgency and incontinence. 5. Dementia. PLAN: I had a long talk with him and his family. Even though he has already had a trial of CSF drainage via spinal catheter at Hospital over a year ago, I offered this test to them again. I do so on the basis that there is further enlargement of the ventricles on the scan. His family and I discussed the facts that it is not likely to be only hydrocephalus. Instead we are trying to answer the question of whether hydrocephalus is contributing sufficiently to his symptoms that progressing with shunt surgery would make a difference. I have advised them to think it over for a day and contact my office to see whether they would wish to proceed. I gave them a printed prescription of the protocol including its rationale, risks, benefits, and alternatives. I specifically mentioned the 3% chance of infection, which mean a 97% chance of no infection."
259,Neurology," CC: Headache. HX: This 51 y/o RHM was moving furniture several days prior to presentation when he struck his head (vertex) against a door panel. He then stepped back and struck his back on a trailer hitch. There was no associated LOC but he felt &quot;dazed.&quot; He complained a HA since the accident. The following day he began experiencing episodic vertigo lasting several minutes with associated nausea and vomiting. He has been lying in bed most of the time since the accident. He also complained of transient left lower extremity weakness. The night before admission he went to his bedroom and his girlfriend heard a loud noise. She found him on the floor unable to speak or move his left side well. He was taken to a local ER. In the ER experienced a spell in which he stared to the right for approximately one minute. During this time he was unable to speak and did not seem to comprehend verbal questions. This resolved. ER staff noted decreased left sided movement and a left Babinski sign. He was given valium 5 mg, and DPH 1.0g. A HCT was performed and he was transferred to UIHC. PMH: DM, Coronary Artery Disease, Left femoral neuropathy of unknown etiology. Multiple head trauma in past (?falls/fights). MEDS: unknown oral med for DM. SHX: 10+pack-year h/o Tobacco use; quit 2 years ago. 6-pack beer/week. No h/o illicit drug use. FHX: unknown. EXAM: 70BPM, BP144/83, 16RPM, 36.0C MS: Alert and oriented to person, place, time. Fluent speech. CN: left lower facial weakness with right gaze preference. Pupils 3/3 decreasing to 2/2 on exposure to light. Optic disks flat. MOTOR: decreased spontaneous movement of left-sided extremities. 5/4 strength in both upper and lower extremities. Normal muscle tone and bulk. SENSORY: withdrew equally to noxious stimulation in all four extremities. GAIT/STATION/COORDINATION: not tested. The general physical exam was unremarkable. During the exam the patient experienced a spell during which his head turned and eyes deviated to the leftward, and his right hand twitched. The entire spell lasted one minute. During the episode he was verbally unresponsive. He appeared groggy and lethargic after the event. HCT without contrast: 11/18/92: right frontal skull fracture with associated minimal epidural hematoma and small subdural hematoma, as well as some adjacent subarachnoid blood and brain contusion. LABS: CBC, GS, PT/PTT were all WNL. COURSE: The patient was diagnosed with a right frontal SAH/contusion and post traumatic seizures. DPH was continued and he was given a Librium taper for possible alcoholic withdrawal. A neurosurgical consult was obtained. He did not receive surgical intervention and was discharged 12/1/92. Neuropsychological testing on 11/25/92 revealed: poor orientation to time or place and poor attention. Anterograde verbal and visual memory was severely impaired. Speech became mildly dysarthric when fatigued. Defective word finding. Difficulty copying 2 of 3 three dimensional figures. Recent head injury as well as a history of ETOH abuse and multiple prior head injuries probably contribute to his deficits."
260,Neurology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Carotid artery occlusive disease. 2. Peripheral vascular disease. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Carotid artery occlusive disease. 2. Peripheral vascular disease. OPERATIONS PERFORMED: 1. Bilateral carotid cerebral angiogram. 2. Right femoral-popliteal angiogram. FINDINGS: The right carotid cerebral system was selectively catheterized and visualized. The right internal carotid artery was found to be very tortuous with kinking in its cervical portions, but no focal stenosis was noted. Likewise, the intracranial portion of the right internal carotid artery showed no significant disease nor did the right middle cerebral artery. The left carotid cerebral system was selectively catheterized and visualized. The cervical portion of the left internal carotid artery showed a 30 to 40% stenosis with small ulcer crater present. The intracranial portion of the left internal carotid artery showed no significant disease nor did the left middle cerebral artery. Visualization of the right lower extremity showed no significant disease. PROCEDURE: With the patient in supine position under local anesthesia plus intravenous sedation, the groin areas were prepped and draped in a sterile fashion. The common femoral artery was punctured in a routine retrograde fashion and a 5-French introducer sheath was advanced under fluoroscopic guidance. A catheter was then placed in the aortic arch and the right and left common carotid arteries were then selectively catheterized and visualized as described above. Following completion of the above, the catheter and introducer sheath were removed. Heparin had been initially given, which was reversed with protamine. Firm pressure was held over the puncture site for 20 minutes, followed by application of a sterile Coverlet dressing and sandbag compression. The patient tolerated the procedure well throughout."
261,Neurology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right occipital arteriovenous malformation. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right occipital arteriovenous malformation. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: CT-guided frameless stereotactic radiosurgery for the right occipital arteriovenous malformation using dynamic tracking. Please note no qualified resident was available to assist in the procedure. INDICATION: The patient is a 30-year-old male with a right occipital AVM. He was referred for stereotactic radiosurgery. The risks of the radiosurgical treatment were discussed with the patient including, but not limited to, failure to completely obliterate the AVM, need for additional therapy, radiation injury, radiation necrosis, headaches, seizures, visual loss, or other neurologic deficits. The patient understands these risks and would like to proceed. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient arrived to Outpatient CyberKnife Suite one day prior to the treatment. He was placed on the treatment table. The Aquaplast mask was constructed. Initial imaging was obtained by the CyberKnife system. The patient was then transported over to the CT scanner at Stanford. Under the supervision of Dr. X, 125 mL of Omnipaque 250 contrast was administered. Dr. X then supervised the acquisition of 1.2-mm contiguous axial CT slices. These images were uploaded over the hospital network to the treatment planning computer, and the patient was discharged home. Treatment plan was then performed by me. I outlined the tumor volume. Inverse treatment planning was used to generate the treatment plan for this patient. This resulted in a total dose of 20 Gy delivered to 84% isodose line using a 12.5 mm collimator. The maximum dose within this center of treatment volume was 23.81 Gy. The volume treated was 2.972 mL, and the treated lesion dimensions were 1.9 x 2.7 x 1.6 cm. The volume treated at the reference dose was 98%. The coverage isodose line was 79%. The conformality index was 1.74 and modified conformality index was 1.55. The treatment plan was reviewed by me and Dr. Y of Radiation Oncology, and the treatment plan was approved. On the morning of May 14, 2004, the patient arrived at the Outpatient CyberKnife Suite. He was placed on the treatment table. The Aquaplast mask was applied. Initial imaging was used to bring the patient into optimal position. The patient underwent stereotactic radiosurgery to deliver the 20 Gy to the AVM margin. He tolerated the procedure well. He was given 8 mg of Decadron for prophylaxis and discharged home. Followup will consist of an MRI scan in 6 months. The patient will return to our clinic once that study is completed. I was present and participated in the entire procedure on this patient consisting of CT-guided frameless stereotactic radiosurgery for the right occipital AVM. Dr. X was present during the entire procedure and will be dictating his own operative note."
262,Neurology,
263,Neurology, REPORT: The electroencephalogram shows background activity at about 9-10 cycle/second bilaterally. Little activity in the beta range is noted. Waves of 4-7 cycle/second of low amplitude were occasionally noted. Abundant movements and technical artifacts are noted throughout this tracing. Hyperventilation was not performed. Photic stimulation reveals no important changes. CLINICAL INTERPRETATION: The electroencephalogram is essentially normal.
264,Neurology," This is a 95.5-hour continuous video EEG monitoring study. TECHNICAL SUMMARY: The patient was recorded from 2:15 p.m. on 08/21/06 through 1:55 p.m. on 08/25/06. The patient was recorded digitally using the 10-20 system of electrode placement. Additional temporal electrodes and single channels of EOG and EKG were also recorded. The patient's medications valproic acid, Zonegran, and Keppra were weaned progressively throughout the study. The occipital dominant rhythm is 10 to 10.5 Hz and well regulated. Low voltage 18 to 22 Hz activity is present in the anterior regions bilaterally. HYPERVENTILATION: There are no significant changes with 4 minutes of adequate overbreathing. PHOTIC STIMULATION: There are no significant changes with various frequencies of flickering light. SLEEP: There are no focal or lateralizing features and no abnormal waveforms. INDUCED EVENT: On the final day of study, a placebo induction procedure was performed to induce a clinical event. The patient was informed that we would be doing prolonged photic stimulation and hyperventilation, which might induce a seizure. At 1:38 p.m., the patient was instructed to begin hyperventilation. Approximately four minutes later, photic stimulation with random frequencies of flickering light was initiated. Approximately 8 minutes into the procedure, the patient became unresponsive to verbal questioning. Approximately 1 minute later, she began to exhibit asynchronous shaking of her upper and lower extremities with her eyes closed. She persisted with the shaking and some side-to-side movements of her head for approximately 1 minute before abruptly stopping. Approximately 30 seconds later, she became slowly responsive initially only uttering a few words and able to say her name. When asked what had just occurred, she replied that she was asleep and did not remember any event. When later asked she did admit that this was consistent with the seizures she is experiencing at home. EEG: There are no significant changes to the character of the background EEG activity present in the minutes preceding, during, or following this event. Of note, while her eyes were closed and she was non-responsive, there is a well-regulated occipital dominant rhythm present. IMPRESSION: The findings of this patient's 95.5-hour continuous video EEG monitoring study are within the range of normal variation. No epileptiform activity is present. One clinical event was induced with hyperventilation and photic stimulation. The clinical features of this event are described in the technical summary above. There was no epileptiform activity associated with this event. This finding is consistent with a non-epileptic pseudoseizure."
265,Neurology," CHIEF COMPLAINT: Followup of hospital discharge for Guillain-Barre syndrome. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 62-year-old right-handed woman with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, a silent stroke involving right basal ganglia who was in her usual state of baseline health until late June of 2006 when she had onset of blurred vision, diplopia, and possible weakness in the right greater than left arm and left-sided ptosis. She was admitted to the hospital. The MRI showed only an old right basal ganglion infarct. She subsequently had a lumbar puncture, which showed increased protein, and an EMG/nerve conduction study performed by Dr. X on July 3rd, showed early signs of AIDP. The patient was treated with intravenous gamma globulin and had some mild improvement in her symptoms. Her vital capacities were normal during the hospitalization. Her chest x-ray was negative for any acute process. She was discharged to rehab from July 12, 2006 to July 20, 2006. She made some progress in which she notes that her walking is definitely better. However, she notes that she still has some problems with eye movement and her vision. This is possibly her main problem. She also reports tightness and pain in her mid back. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Documented in the clinic note. The patient has problems with diabetes, double vision, blurry vision, muscle pain, weakness, trouble walking, and headaches about two to three times per week. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Hypertension. 2. Diabetes mellitus. 3. Stroke involving the right basal ganglion. 4. Guillain-Barre syndrome diagnosed in June of 2006. 5. Bilateral knee replacements. 6. Total abdominal hysterectomy and cholecystectomy. FAMILY HISTORY: Multiple family members have diabetes mellitus. SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is retired on disability due to her knee replacements. She does not smoke, drink or use any illicit drugs. MEDICATIONS: Percocet 5/325 mg 4-6 hours p.r.n., Neurontin 100 mg per day, insulin, Protonix 40 mg per day, Toprol-XL 50 mg q.d., Norvasc 10 mg q.d., glipizide 10 mg q.d., fluticasone 50 mcg nasal spray, Lasix 20 mg b.i.d., and Zocor 1 mg q.d. ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Blood pressure 122/74, heart rate 68, respiratory rate 16, and weight 228 pounds. Pain scale 5/10. Please see the written note for details. General exam is benign other than mild obesity. On neuro examination, mental status is normal. Cranial nerves are significant for full visual fields and pupils are equal and reactive. However, extraocular movements are very limited. She has some adduction of the left eye and she has minimal upgaze of both eyes, but otherwise the eyes do not move. Face is symmetric. Sensation is intact. Tongue and uvula are in midline. Palate is elevated symmetrically. Shoulder shrug is strong. The patient's muscle exam shows normal bulk and tone throughout. She has no weakness of the left upper extremity. In the right upper extremity, she has only about 2/5 strength in the right shoulder, but is otherwise 5/5. There is no drift or orbit. Reflexes are absent throughout. Sensory exam is intact to light touch, pinprick, vibration, and proprioception is normal. There is no dysmetria. Gait is somewhat limited possibly by her vision and possibly also by her balance problems. PERTINENT DATA: As reviewed previously. DISCUSSION: This is a 62-year-old woman with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, prior stroke who has what sounds like Guillain-Barre syndrome, likely the Miller-Fisher variant. The patient has shown some improvement with IVIG and continues to show some gradual improvement. I discussed with the patient the course of disease, which is often weeks to about a month or so of worsening followed by many months of gradual improvement. I told her that it is possible she may not recover 100%, but that certainly there is still plenty of time for her to have additional recovery over what she has right now. She is scheduled to see an ophthalmologist. I think it is reasonable for close followup of her visual symptoms progress. However, I certainly would not take any corrective measures at this point as I suspect her vision will improve gradually. I discussed with the patient that with respect to her back pain certainly the Neurontin is relatively at low dose and this could be increased further. I wanted her to start taking the Neurontin 300 mg per day and then 300 mg b.i.d. after one week. She will call me in approximately three weeks' time to let me know how she is doing and if needed we will titrate up further. She was apparently given some baclofen by her internist and I think this is not unreasonable. I definitely hope to get her off the Percocet in the future. IMPRESSION: 1. Guillain-Barre Miller-Fisher variant. 2. Hypertension. 3. Diabetes mellitus. 4. Stroke. RECOMMENDATIONS: 1. The patient is to start taking aspirin 162 mg per day. 2. Followup with ophthalmology. 3. Increase Neurontin to 300 mg per day x 1 week and then 300 mg b.i.d. 4. Followup by phone in three to four weeks. 5. Followup in this clinic in approximately two months' time. 6. Call for any questions or problems."
266,Neurology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right chronic subdural hematoma. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right chronic subdural hematoma. TYPE OF OPERATION: Right burr hole craniotomy for evacuation of subdural hematoma and placement of subdural drain. ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal anesthesia. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 100 cc. OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: In preoperative identification, the patient was taken to the operating room and placed in supine position. Following induction of satisfactory general endotracheal anesthesia, the patient was prepared for surgery. Table was turned. The right shoulder roll was placed. The head was turned to the left and rested on a doughnut. The scalp was shaved, and then prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion. Incisions were marked along a putative right frontotemporal craniotomy frontally and over the parietal boss. The parietal boss incision was opened. It was about an inch and a half in length. It was carried down to the skull. Self-retaining retractor was placed. A bur hole was now fashioned with the perforator. This was widened with a 2-mm Kerrison punch. The dura was now coagulated with bipolar electrocautery. It was opened in a cruciate-type fashion. The dural edges were coagulated back to the bony edges. There was egress of a large amount of liquid. Under pressure, we irrigated for quite sometime until irrigation was returning mostly clear. A subdural drain was now inserted under direct vision into the subdural space and brought out through a separate stab incision. It was secured with a 3-0 nylon suture. The area was closed with interrupted inverted 2-0 Vicryl sutures. The skin was closed with staples. Sterile dressing was applied. The patient was subsequently returned back to anesthesia. He was extubated in the operating room, and transported to PACU in satisfactory condition."
267,Neurology," CHIEF COMPLAINT: Transient visual loss lasting five minutes. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a very active and pleasant 82-year-old white male with a past medical history significant for first-degree AV block, status post pacemaker placement, hypothyroidism secondary to hyperthyroidism and irradiation, possible lumbar stenosis. He reports he experienced a single episode of his vision decreasing &quot;like it was compressed from the top down with a black sheet coming down&quot;. The episode lasted approximately five minutes and occurred three weeks ago while he was driving a car. He was able to pull the car over to the side of the road safely. During the episode, he felt nauseated and possibly lightheaded. His wife was present and noted that he looked extremely pale and ashen during the episode. He went to see the Clinic at that time and received a CT scan, carotid Dopplers, echocardiogram, and neurological evaluation, all of which were unremarkable. It was suggested at that time that he get a CT angiogram since he cannot have an MRI due to his pacemaker. He has had no further similar events. He denies any lesions or other visual change, focal weakness or sensory change, headaches, gait change or other neurological problem. He also reports that he has been diagnosed with lumbar stenosis based on some mild difficulty arising from a chair for which an outside physician ordered a CT of his L-spine that reportedly showed lumbar stenosis. The question has arisen as to whether he should have a CT myelogram to further evaluate this process. He has no back pain or pain of any type, he denies bowel or bladder incontinence or frank lower extremity weakness. He is extremely active and plays tennis at least three times a week. He denies recent episodes of unexpected falls. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: He only endorses hypothyroidism, the episode of visual loss described above and joint pain. He also endorses having trouble getting out of a chair, but otherwise his review of systems is negative. A copy is in his clinic chart. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: As above. He has had bilateral knee replacement three years ago and experiences some pain in his knees with this. FAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory. SOCIAL HISTORY: He is retired from the social security administration x 20 years. He travels a lot and is extremely active. He does not smoke. He consumes alcohol socially only. He does not use illicit drugs. He is married. MEDICATIONS: The patient has recently been started on Plavix by his primary care doctor, was briefly on baby aspirin 81 mg per day since the TIA-like event three weeks ago. He also takes Proscar 5 mg q.d and Synthroid 0.2 mg q.d. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital Signs: BP 134/80, heart rate 60, respiratory rate 16, and weight 244 pounds. He denies any pain. General: This is a pleasant white male in no acute distress. HEENT: He is normocephalic and atraumatic. Conjunctivae and sclerae are clear. There is no sinus tenderness. Neck: Supple. Chest: Clear to auscultation. Heart: There are no bruits present. Extremities: Extremities are warm and dry. Distal pulses are full. There is no edema. NEUROLOGIC EXAMINATION: MENTAL STATUS: He is alert and oriented to person, place and time with good recent and long-term memory. His language is fluent. His attention and concentration are good. CRANIAL NERVES: Cranial nerves II through XII are intact. VFFTC, PERRL, EOMI, facial sensation and expression are symmetric, hearing is decreased on the right (hearing aid), palate rises symmetrically, shoulder shrug is strong, tongue protrudes in the midline. MOTOR: He has normal bulk and tone throughout. There is no cogwheeling. There is some minimal weakness at the iliopsoas bilaterally 4+/5 and possibly trace weakness at the quadriceps -5/5. Otherwise he is 5/5 throughout including hip adductors and abductors. SENSORY: He has decreased sensation to vibration and proprioception to the middle of his feet only, otherwise sensory is intact to light touch, and temperature, pinprick, proprioception and vibration. COORDINATION: There is no dysmetria or tremor noted. His Romberg is negative. Note that he cannot rise from the chair without using his arms. GAIT: Upon arising, he has a normal step, stride, and toe, heel. He has difficulty with tandem and tends to fall to the left. REFLEXES: 2 at biceps, triceps, patella and 1 at ankles. The patient provided a CT scan without contrast from his previous hospitalization three weeks ago, which is normal to my inspection. He has had full labs for cholesterol and stroke for risk factors although he does not have those available here. IMPRESSION: 1. TIA. The character of his brief episode of visual loss is concerning for compromise of the posterior circulation. Differential diagnoses include hypoperfusion, stenosis, and dissection. He is to get a CT angiogram to evaluate the integrity of the cerebrovascular system. He has recently been started on Paxil by his primary care physician and this should be continued. Other risk factors need to be evaluated; however, we will wait for the results to be sent from the outside hospital so that we do not have to repeat his prior workup. The patient and his wife assure me that the workup was complete and that nothing was found at that time. 2. Lumbar stenosis. His symptoms are very mild and consist mainly of some mild proximal upper extremity weakness and very mild gait instability. In the absence of motor stabilizing symptoms, the patient is not interested in surgical intervention at this time. Therefore we would defer further evaluation with CT myelogram as he does not want surgery. PLAN: 1. We will get a CT angiogram of the cerebral vessels. 2. Continue Plavix. 3. Obtain copies of the workup done at the outside hospital. 4. We will follow the lumbar stenosis for the time being. No further workup is planned."

COURSE: CBC, GS, PT, PTT, ESR, FT4, TSH, ANA, Vit B12, Folate, VDRL and Urinalysis were normal. MRI T-spine, 10/27/92, was unremarkable. MRI Brain, 10/28/92, revealed multiple areas of abnormally increased signal on T2 weighted images in the white matter regions of the right corpus callosum, periventricular region, brachium pontis and right pons. The appearance of the lesions was felt to be strongly suggestive of multiple sclerosis. 10/28/92, Lumbar puncture revealed the following CSF results: RBC 1, WBC 9 (8 lymphocytes, 1 histiocyte), Glucose 55mg/dl, Protein 46mg/dl (normal 15-45), CSF IgG 7.5mg/dl (normal 0.0-6.2), CSF IgG index 1.3 (normal 0.0-0.7), agarose gel electrophoresis revealed oligoclonal bands in the gamma region which were not seen on the serum sample. Beta-2 microglobulin was unremarkable. An abnormal left tibial somatosensory evoked potential was noted consistent with central conduction slowing. Visual and Brainstem Auditory evoked potentials were normal. HTLV-1 titers were negative. CSF cultures and cytology were negative. She was not treated with medications as her symptoms were primarily sensory and non-debilitating, and she was discharged home. She returned on 11/7/92 as her symptoms of RUE dysesthesia, lower extremity paresthesia and weakness, all worsened. On 11/6/92, she developed slow slurred speech and had marked difficulty expressing her thoughts. She also began having difficulty emptying her bladder. Her 11/7/92 exam was notable for normal vital signs, lying motionless with eyes open and nodding and rhythmically blinking every few minutes. She was oriented to place and time of day, but not to season, day of the week and she did not know who she was. She had a leftward gaze preference and right lower facial weakness. Her RLE was spastic with sustained ankle clonus. There was dysesthetic sensory perception in the RUE. Jaw jerk and glabellar sign were present. MRI brain, 11/7/92, revealed multiple enhancing lesions in the peritrigonal region and white matter of the centrum semiovale. The right peritrigonal region is more prominent than on prior study. The left centrum semiovale lesion has less enhancement than previously. Multiple other white matter lesions are demonstrated on the right side, in the posterior limb of the internal capsule, the anterior periventricular white matter, optic radiations and cerebellum. The peritrigonal lesions on both sides have increased in size since the 10/92 MRI. The findings were felt more consistent with demyelinating disease and less likely glioma. Post-viral encephalitis, Rapidly progressive demyelinating disease and tumor were in the differential diagnosis. Lumbar Puncture, 11/8/92, revealed: RBC 2, WBC 12 (12 lymphocytes), Glucose 57, Protein 51 (elevated), cytology and cultures were negative. HIV 1 titer was negative. Urine drug screen, negative. A stereotactic brain biopsy of the right parieto-occipital region was consistent with demyelinating disease. She was treated with Decadron 6mg IV qhours and Cytoxan 0.75gm/m2 (1.25gm). On 12/3/92, she has a focal motor seizure with rhythmic jerking of the LUE, loss of consciousness and rightward eye deviation. EEG revealed diffuse slowing with frequent right-sided sharp discharges. She was placed on Dilantin. She became depressed."
271,Neurology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Acute left subdural hematoma. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Acute left subdural hematoma. PROCEDURE: Left frontal temporal craniotomy for evacuation of acute subdural hematoma. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: This is a 76-year-old man who has a history of acute leukemia. He is currently in the phase of his therapy where he has developed a profound thrombocytopenia and white cell deficiency. He presents after a fall in the hospital in which he apparently struck his head and now has a progressive neurologic deterioration consistent with an intracerebral injury. His CT imaging reveals an acute left subdural hematoma, which is hemispheric. The patient was brought to the operating room, placed under satisfactory general endotracheal anesthesia. He had previously been intubated and taken to the Intensive Care Unit and now is brought for emergency craniotomy. The images were brought up on the electronic imaging and confirmed that this was a left-sided condition. He was fixed in a three-point headrest. His scalp was shaved and prepared with Betadine, iodine and alcohol. We made a small curved incision over the temporal, parietal, frontal region. The scalp was reflected. A single bur hole was made at the frontoparietal junction and then a 4x6cm bur hole was created. After completing the bur hole flap, the dura was opened and a gelatinous mass of subdural was peeled away from the brain. The brain actually looked relatively relaxed; and after removal of the hematoma, the brain sort of slowly came back up. We investigated the subdural space forward and backward as we could and yet careful not to disrupt any venous bleeding as we close to the midline. After we felt that we had an adequate decompression, the dura was reapproximated and we filled the subdural space with saline. We placed a small drain in the extra dural space and then replaced the bone flap and secured this with the bone plates. The scalp was reapproximated, and the patient was awakened and taken to the CT scanner for a postoperative scan to ensure that there was no new hemorrhage or any other intracerebral pathology that warranted treatment. Given that this actual skin looked good with apparent removal of about 80% of the subdural we elected to take patient to the Intensive Care Unit for further management. I was present for the entire procedure and supervised this. I confirmed prior to closing the skin that we had correct sponge and needle counts and the only foreign body was the drain."
272,Neurology," NERVE CONDUCTION TESTING AND EMG EVALUATION 1. Right median sensory response 3.0, amplitude 2.5, distance 100. 2. Right ulnar sensory response 2.1, amplitude 1, distance 90. 3. Left median sensory response 3.0, amplitude 1.2, distance 100. 4. Left median motor response distal 4.2, proximal 9, amplitude 2.2, distance 290, velocity 60.4 m/sec. 5. Right median motor response distal 4.3, proximal 9.7, amplitude 2, and velocity 53.7 m/sec. 6. Right ulnar motor response distal 2.5, proximal 7.5, amplitude 2, distance 300, velocity 60 m/sec. NEEDLE EMG TESTING 1. RIGHT BICEPS: Fibrillations 0, fasciculations occasional, positive waves 0. Motor units, increased needle insertional activity and mild decreased number of motor units firing. 2. RIGHT TRICEPS: Fibrillations 1+, fasciculations occasional to 1+, positive waves 1+. Motor units, increased needle insertional activity and decreased number of motor units firing. 3. EXTENSOR DIGITORUM: Fibrillations 0, fasciculations rare, positive waves 0, motor units probably normal. 4. FIRST DORSAL INTEROSSEOUS: Fibrillations 2+, fasciculations 1+, positive waves 2+. Motor units, decreased number of motor units firing. 5. RIGHT ABDUCTOR POLLICIS BREVIS: Fibrillations 1+, fasciculations 1+, positive waves 0. Motor units, decreased number of motor units firing. 6. FLEXOR CARPI ULNARIS: Fibrillations 1+, occasionally entrained, fasciculations rare, positive waves 1+. Motor units, decreased number of motor units firing. 7. LEFT FIRST DORSAL INTEROSSEOUS: Fibrillations 1+, fasciculations 1+, positive waves occasional. Motor units, decreased number of motor units firing. 8. LEFT EXTENSOR DIGITORUM: Fibrillations 1+, fasciculations 1+. Motor units, decreased number of motor units firing. 9. RIGHT VASTUS MEDIALIS: Fibrillations 1+ to 2+, fasciculations 1+, positive waves 1+. Motor units, decreased number of motor units firing. 10. ANTERIOR TIBIALIS: Fibrillations 2+, occasionally entrained, fasciculations 1+, positive waves 1+. Motor units, increased proportion of polyphasic units and decreased number of motor units firing. There is again increased needle insertional activity. 11. RIGHT GASTROCNEMIUS: Fibrillations 1+, fasciculations 1+, positive waves 1+. Motor units, marked decreased number of motor units firing. 12. LEFT GASTROCNEMIUS: Fibrillations 1+, fasciculations 1+, positive waves 2+. Motor units, marked decreased number of motor units firing. 13. LEFT VASTUS MEDIALIS: Fibrillations occasional, fasciculations occasional, positive waves 1+. Motor units, decreased number of motor units firing. IMPRESSION: Nerve conduction screen demonstrates borderline median sensory and borderline distal median motor responses in both hands. There is borderline evidence of bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome. The sensory and motor responses are noted to be attenuated in both upper extremities. The needle EMG examination is remarkable for rather diffuse active denervation changes in most muscles of the right upper and right lower extremity tested and there is active denervation in several muscles of the left arm and left leg as well. The diffuse nature of the active denervation changes in multiple myotomes of both upper and lower extremities suggests the possibility of motor neuron disease. Other neuropathic conditions, polymyositis, etc., need to be considered in differential diagnosis."
273,Neurology," PROCEDURE: Subcutaneous ulnar nerve transposition. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: After administering appropriate antibiotics and MAC anesthesia, the upper extremity was prepped and draped in the usual standard fashion. The arm was exsanguinated with Esmarch, and the tourniquet inflated to 250 mmHg. A curvilinear incision was made over the medial elbow, starting proximally at the medial intermuscular septum, curving posterior to the medial epicondyle, then curving anteriorly along the path of the ulnar nerve. Dissection was carried down to the ulnar nerve. Branches of the medial antebrachial and the medial brachial cutaneous nerves were identified and protected. Osborne's fascia was released, an ulnar neurolysis performed, and the ulnar nerve was mobilized. Six cm of the medial intermuscular septum was excised, and the deep periosteal origin of the flexor carpi ulnaris was released to avoid kinking of the nerve as it was moved anteriorly. The subcutaneous plane just superficial to the flexor-pronator mass was developed. Meticulous hemostasis was maintained with bipolar electrocautery. The nerve was transposed anteriorly, superficial to the flexor-pronator mass. Motor branches were dissected proximally and distally to avoid tethering or kinking the ulnar nerve. A semicircular medially based flap of flexor-pronator fascia was raised and sutured to the subcutaneous tissue in such a way as to prevent the nerve from relocating. The subcutaneous tissue and skin were closed with simple interrupted sutures. Marcaine with epinephrine was injected into the wound. The elbow was dressed and splinted. The patient was awakened and sent to the recovery room in good condition, having tolerated the procedure well."
274,Neurology," CC: Motor vehicle-bicycle collision. HX: A 5 y/o boy admitted 10/17/92. He was struck while riding his bicycle by a motor vehicle traveling at a high rate of speed. First responders found him unconscious with left pupil 6 mm and unreactive and the right pupil 3 mm and reactive. He had bilateral decorticate posturing and was bleeding profusely from his nose and mouth. He was intubated and ventilated in the field, and then transferred to UIHC. PMH/FHX/SHX: unremarkable. MEDS: none EXAM: BP 127/91 HR69 RR30 MS: unconscious and intubated Glasgow coma scale=4 CN: Pupils 6/6 fixed. Corneal reflex: trace OD, absent OS. Gag present on manipulation of endotracheal tube. MOTOR/SENSORY: bilateral decorticate posturing to noxious stimulation (chest). Reflexes: bilaterally. Laceration of mid forehead exposing calvarium. COURSE: Emergent Brain CT scan revealed: Displaced fracture of left calvarium. Left frontoparietal intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Right ventricular collection of blood. Right cerebral intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Significant mass effect with deviation of the midline structures to right. The left ventricle was compressed with obliteration of the suprasellar cistern. Air within the soft tissues in the left infra temporal region. C-spine XR, Abdominal/Chest CT were unremarkable. Patient was taken to the OR emergently and underwent bifrontal craniotomy, evacuation of a small epidural and subdural hematomas, and duraplasty. He was given mannitol enroute to the OR and hyperventilated during and after the procedure. Postoperatively he continued to manifest decerebrate posturing . On 11/16/92 he underwent VP shunting with little subsequent change in his neurological status. On 11/23/92 he underwent tracheostomy. On 12/11/92 he underwent bifrontal acrylic prosthesis implantation for repair of the bifrontal craniectomy. By the time of discharge, 1/14/93, he tracked relatively well OD, but had a CN3 palsy OS. He had relatively severe extensor rigidity in all extremities (R&gt;L). His tracheotomy was closed prior to discharge. A 11/16/92 Brain MRI demonstrated infarction in the upper brain stem (particularly in the Pons), left cerebellum, right basil ganglia and thalamus. He was initially treated for seizure prophylaxis with DPH, but developed neutropenia, so it was discontinued. He developed seizures within several months of discharge and was placed on VPA (Depakene). This decreased seizure frequency but his liver enzymes became elevated and he changed over to Tegretol. 10/8/93 Brain MRI (one year after MVA) revealed interval appearance of hydrocephalus, abnormal increased T2 signal (in the medulla, right pons, both basal ganglia, right frontal and left occipital regions), a small mid-brain, and a right subdural fluid collection. These findings were consistent with diffuse axonal injury of the white matter and gray matter contusion, and signs of a previous right subdural hematoma. He was last seen 10/30/96 in the pediatric neurology clinic--age 9 years. He was averaging 2-3 seizures per day---characterized by extension of BUE with tremor and audible cry or laughter---on Tegretol and Diazepam. In addition he experiences 24-48hour periods of &quot;startle response (myoclonic movement of the shoulders)&quot; with or without stimulation every 6 weeks. He had limited communication skills (sparse speech). On exam he had disconjugate gaze, dilated/fixed left pupil, spastic quadriplegia."
275,Neurology," REASON FOR REFERRAL: The patient is a 58-year-old African-American right-handed female with 16 years of education who was referred for a neuropsychological evaluation by Dr. X. She is presenting for a second opinion following a recent neuropsychological evaluation that was ordered by her former place of employment that suggested that she was in the &quot;early stages of a likely dementia&quot; and was thereafter terminated from her position as a psychiatric nurse. A comprehensive evaluation was requested to assess current cognitive functioning and assist with diagnostic decisions and treatment planning. Note that this evaluation was undertaken as a clinical exam and intended for the purposes of aiding with treatment planning. The patient was fully informed about the nature of this evaluation and intended use of the results. RELEVANT BACKGROUND INFORMATION: Historical information was obtained from a review of available medical records and clinical interview with the patient. A summary of pertinent information is presented below. Please refer to the patient's medical chart for a more complete history. HISTORY OF PRESENTING PROBLEM: The patient reported that she had worked as a nurse supervisor for Hospital Center for four years. She was dismissed from this position in September 2009, although she said that she is still under active status technically, but is not able to work. She continues to receive some compensation through FMLA hours. She said that she was told that she had three options, to resign, to apply for disability retirement, and she had 90 days to complete the process of disability retirement after which her employers would file for charges in order for her to be dismissed from State Services. She said that these 90 days are up around the end of November. She said the reason for her dismissal was performance complaints. She said that they began &quot;as soon as she arrived and that these were initially related to problems with her taking too much sick time off secondary to diabetes and fibromyalgia management and at one point she needed to obtain a doctor's note for any days off. She said that her paperwork was often late and that she received discipline for not disciplining her staff frequently enough for tardiness or missed workdays. She described it as a very chaotic and hectic work environment in which she was often putting in extra time. She said that since September 2008 she only took two sick days and was never late to work, but that she continued to receive a lot of negative feedback. In July of this year, she reportedly received a letter from personnel indicating that she was being referred to a state medical doctor because she was unable to perform her job duties and due to excessive sick time. Following a brief evaluation with this doctor whose records we do not have, she was sent to a neuropsychologist, Dr. Y, Ph.D. He completed a Comprehensive Independent Medical Evaluation on 08/14/2009. She said that on 08/27/2009, she returned to see the original doctor who told her that based on that evaluation she was not able to work anymore. Please note that we do not have copies of any of her work-related correspondence. The patient never received a copy of the neuropsychological evaluation because she was told that it was &quot;too derogatory.&quot; A copy of that evaluation was provided directly to this examiner for the purpose of this evaluation. To summarize, the results indicated &quot;diagnostically, The patient presents cognitive deficits involving visual working memory, executive functioning, and motor functioning along with low average intellectual functioning that is significantly below her memory functioning and below expectation based on her occupational and academic history. This suggests that her intellectual functioning has declined.&quot; It concluded that &quot;results overall suggest early stages of a likely dementia or possibly the effects of diabetes, although her deficits are greater than expected for diabetes-related executive functioning problems and peripheral neuropathy� The patient' deficits within the current test battery suggest that she would not be able to safely and effectively perform the duties of a nurse supervisor without help handling documentary demands and some supervision of her visual processing. The prognosis for improvement is not good, although she might try stimulant medication if compatible with her other. Following her dismissal, The patient presented to her primary physician, Henry Fein, M.D., who referred her to Dr. X for a second opinion regarding her cognitive deficits. His neurological examination on 09/23/2009 was unremarkable. The patient scored 20/30 on the Mini-Mental Status Exam missing one out of three words on recall, but was able to do so with prompting. A repeat neurocognitive testing was suggested in order to assess for subtle deficits in memory and concentration that were not appreciated on this gross cognitive measure. IMAGING STUDIES: MRI of the brain on 09/14/2009 was unremarkable with no evidence of acute intracranial abnormality or abnormal enhancing lesions. Note that the MRI was done with and without gadolinium contrast. CURRENT FUNCTIONING: The patient reported that she had experienced some difficulty completing paperwork on time due primarily to the chaoticness of the work environment and the excessive amount of responsibility that was placed upon her. When asked about changes in cognitive functioning, she denied noticing any decline in problem solving, language, or nonverbal skills. She also denied any problems with attention and concentration or forgetfulness or memory problems. She continues to independently perform all activities of daily living. She is in charge of the household finances, has had no problems paying bills on time, has had no difficulties with driving or accidents, denied any missed appointments and said that no one has provided feedback to her that they have noticed any changes in her cognitive functioning. She reported that if her children had noticed anything they definitely would have brought it to her attention. She said that she does not currently have a lawyer and does not intend to return to her previous physician. She said she has not yet proceeded with the application for disability retirement because she was told that her doctors would have to fill out that paperwork, but they have not claimed that she is disabled and so she is waiting for the doctors at her former workplace to initiate the application. Other current symptoms include excessive fatigue. She reported that she was diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome in 1991, but generally symptoms are under better control now, but she still has difficulty secondary to fibromyalgia. She also reported having fallen approximately five times within the past year. She said that this typically occurs when she is climbing up steps and is usually related to her right foot &quot;like dragging.&quot; Dr. X's physical examination revealed no appreciable focal peripheral deficits on motor or sensory testing and notes that perhaps these falls are associated with some stiffness and pain of her right hip and knee, which are chronic symptoms from her fibromyalgia and osteoarthritis. She said that she occasionally bumps into objects, but denied noticing it happening one on any particular part of her body. Muscle pain secondary to fibromyalgia reportedly occurs in her neck and shoulders down both arms and in her left hip. OTHER MEDICAL HISTORY: The patient reported that her birth and development were normal. She denied any significant medical conditions during childhood. As mentioned, she now has a history of fibromyalgia. She also experiences some restriction in the range of motion with her right arm. MRI of the C-spine 04/02/2009 showed a hemangioma versus degenerative changes at C7 vertebral body and bulging annulus with small central disc protrusion at C6-C7. MRI of the right shoulder on 06/04/2009 showed small partial tear of the distal infraspinatus tendon and prominent tendinopathy of the distal supraspinatus tendon. As mentioned, she was diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome in 1991. She thought that this may actually represent early symptoms of fibromyalgia and said that symptoms are currently under control. She also has diabetes, high blood pressure, osteoarthritis, tension headaches, GERD, carpal tunnel disease, cholecystectomy in 1976, and ectopic pregnancy in 1974. Her previous neuropsychological evaluation referred to an outpatient left neck cystectomy in 2007. She has some difficulty falling asleep, but currently typically obtains approximately seven to eight hours of sleep per night. She did report some sleep disruption secondary to unusual dreams and thought that she talked to herself and could sometimes hear herself talking in her sleep. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: NovoLog, insulin pump, metformin, metoprolol, amlodipine, Topamax, Lortab, tramadol, amitriptyline, calcium plus vitamin D, fluoxetine, pantoprazole, Naprosyn, fluticasone propionate, and vitamin C. SUBSTANCE USE: The patient reported that she rarely drinks alcohol and she denied smoking or using illicit drugs. She drinks two to four cups of coffee per day. SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient was born and raised in North Carolina. She was the sixth of nine siblings. Her father was a chef. He completed third grade and died at 60 due to complications of diabetes. Her mother is 93 years old. Her last job was as a janitor. She completed fourth grade. She reported that she has no cognitive problems at this time. Family medical history is significant for diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, thyroid problems, sarcoidosis, and possible multiple sclerosis and depression. The patient completed a Bachelor of Science in Nursing through State University in 1979. She denied any history of problems in school such as learning disabilities, attentional problems, difficulty learning to read, failed grades, special help in school or behavioral problems. She was married for two years. Her ex-husband died in 1980 from acute pancreatitis secondary to alcohol abuse. She has two children ages 43 and 30. Her son whose age is 30 lives nearby and is in consistent contact with her and she is also in frequent contact and has a close relationship with her daughter who lives in New York. In school, the patient reported obtaining primarily A's and B's. She said that her strongest subject was math while her worst was spelling, although she reported that her grades were still quite good in spelling. The patient worked for Hospital Center for four years. Prior to that, she worked for an outpatient mental health center for 2-1/2 years. She was reportedly either terminated or laid off and was unsure of the reason for that. Prior to that, she worked for Walter P. Carter Center reportedly for 21 years. She has also worked as an OB nurse in the past. She reported that other than the two instances reported above, she had never been terminated or fired from a job. In her spare time, the patient enjoys reading, participating in women's groups doing puzzles, playing computer games. PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY: The patient reported that she sought psychotherapy on and off between 1991 and 1997 secondary to her chronic fatigue. She was also taking Prozac during that time. She then began taking Prozac again when she started working at secondary to stress with the work situation. She reported a chronic history of mild sadness or depression, which was relatively stable. When asked about her current psychological experience, she said that she was somewhat sad, but not dwelling on things. She denied any history of suicidal ideation or homicidal ideation.

She ambulated independently and no gross psychomotor abnormalities were noted. Vision and hearing appeared to be adequate for testing. She was neatly dressed and groomed. Eye contact was good. She was oriented to person, place, time, and situation. Speech was mildly slow and a few mild articulatory errors were noted near the end of the day, and a few paraphasic errors were noted on a confrontation naming task. There were otherwise no apparent problems with expression and speech was normal with respect to rhythm and prosody. She was somewhat quiet, but quite cooperative throughout the day. Affect appeared to be mildly constricted, but she smiled and joked appropriately at times. Mood appeared to be euthymic. Receptive language abilities appeared to be within broad normal limits as she was able to appropriately respond to the examiner's questions and instructions. Thought processes were linear and goal-directed and no thought disturbances were noted. She appeared quite tired near the end of the day and it should be noted that sustained attention task was the last test that was given at the end of the day. When asked, the patient said that she recognized some of the tests that were given, but not most of them. She denied having look up any information on any of the tests that are typically involved in a neuropsychological battery or having any additional information about them since her last testing. Overall, The patient appeared to put full effort into this evaluation. She was highly motivated and thus these results should be seen as an accurate reflection of her current cognitive functioning. Note that there was some overlap in tests that were administered during this evaluation and those given at her evaluation in August of 2009. These include the ways for CPT II, verbal fluency, and Boston Naming Test, but this exception of the ways for most of these tests are not expected to have a significant practice effect associated with them; however, they will be interpreted with her recent evaluation in mind. EVALUATION FINDINGS: Classification Level |--| Percentile Rank |--| Standard Score |--| Scaled Score |--| T-Score Very Superior |-----| &gt; 98 |-----| &gt;130 |-----| &gt; 16 |-----| &gt; 70 Superior |-----| 91-97 |-----| 120-129 |-----| 14-15 |-----| 64-69 High Average |-----| 75-90 |-----| 110-119 |-----| 12-13 |-----| 57-63 Average |-----| 25-74 |-----| 90-109 |-----| 8-11 |-----| 44-56 Low Average |-----| 9-24 |-----| 80-89 |-----| 6-7 |-----| 37-43 Borderline |-----| 2-8 |-----| 68-79 |-----| 4-5 |-----| 29-36 Impaired |-----| &lt; 1 |-----| &lt; 67 |-----| 1-3 |-----| &lt; 28 GENERAL COGNITIVE ABILITY: The patient performed in the high average range on a measure of gross cognitive functioning. Her performances were within expected limits across subtests assessing attention, initiation, visuospatial construction, conceptualization, and memory. INTELLECTUAL FUNCTIONING: Based on a word reading test, premorbid intellectual functioning was estimated to fall in the average range. Current intellectual functioning fell in the average range (Full Scale IQ equals 98, 45th percentile). Her index scores also indicated average performance across tasks assessing the verbal knowledge and comprehension, visuospatial perception and reasoning, working memory (i.e. complex attention) and information processing. Significant relative strengths were seen on tasks assessing stored verbal knowledge and nonverbal reasoning. Significant relative weaknesses were seen on task assessing visuospatial perception and construction that included a time demand (low average). Compared to her previous test results, the pattern of findings is quite similar with stronger performance on verbal relative to nonverbal tasks or those with significant working memory or speed demands. However, she performed somewhat better on most of these tasks in the current evaluation. To some degree this likely reflects measurement error and variability in addition to some practice effects, although some tests are less susceptible to such changes relative to others. ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT: The patient performed within the average range across tasks assessing word reading, sentence comprehension, and spelling skills. Her previous evaluation referred to a number of misspellings that she had made on her list of medications and certain medical conditions and she made consistent errors again during this evaluation suggesting that she may simply have a weakness in this area. ATTENTION: Auditory working memory was within the average range. Visual working memory was low average. On a selective visual attention test, she demonstrated good accuracy in finding target stimuli while scanning information, although her overall speed was in the low average range. On a continuous performance test assessing sustained attention, she also demonstrated good accuracy, although it was noted that her response time tended to be slower when stimuli were presented with a longer interstimulus interval suggesting some difficulty adapting to changes in the temporal stimulus presentation. Note that this latter performance is entirely consistent with her previous results and taken together these results suggest that attentional abilities were generally within expectations with some mildly weaker performance for complex visual relative to verbal information. There were inconsistencies noted in attentional abilities for both verbal and visual working memory. INFORMATION PROCESSING SPEED: As noted, the patient had some difficulty adapting to changes in stimulus presentation speed on sustained attention task and there was some suggestion in her performances that she reduced her speed in order to increase accuracy; however, basic visual scanning and sequencing and psychomotor processing were in the average to high average range. LANGUAGE: Mild articulatory and paraphasic errors were noted on a confrontation naming test. Verbal retrieval for phonemic or category cues were in the high average and average range respectively. Stored verbal knowledge was in the average range with as mentioned strengths noted in vocabulary. Those language abilities were generally within expected limits. VISUOSPATIAL PERCEPTION AND CONSTRUCTION: The patient demonstrated variability in her performances on tasks assessing visuospatial perception and construction. Basic visual perception assessed through her ability to accurately interpret angular line orientations was in the high average. Mental organization and synthesis of parts of visual figures was in the average range on an untimed task that involved namable objects and in the low average range and relative weakness when it involved timed synthesis of shapes. Visuospatial construction using either line drawings or blocks to match to a sample design was in the borderline to low average range. Thus taken together, the patient demonstrated some relative weaknesses in aspects of visuospatial processing, particularly when tasks involved the time component or shapes and figures rather than recognizable objects. LEARNING & MEMORY SKILLS: VERBAL LEARNING AND MEMORY: Initial acquisition of a list of 15 unrelated items within the high average range (she successfully recalled eight items). She benefited significantly from repetition and demonstrated immediate and significant improvement in her recall, although across five learning trials, her learning curve was mildly inconsistent suggesting attentional weaknesses; however, following the fifth trial, her overall learning fell in the superior range (all 15 items were successfully recalled). Spontaneous recall following a 20-minute delay was in the average range as she was able to remember 11 of the 15 items. She correctly recognized all those items during recognition (high average). Taking together these memory results are well within expected limits. She demonstrated some mild forgetting, but still fell within the average range and was able to recognize items effectively suggesting mild weaknesses and inconsistencies with retrieval and attentional weaknesses may have contributed to variability in her learning curve initially. VISUAL LEARNING AND MEMORY: The patient' immediate recall of a complex figure was in the average range. She retained all of that information following a delay and her recall was in the high average range. Recognition of the individual components of the figure was impaired. Taken together these results highlight some difficulties with complex visuospatial perception and construction, although memory per se was intact based on her very strong recall performances. Note also that she demonstrated this strong memory despite some initial errors in her copy of the complex figure itself again highlighting difficulties with perception and construction, but good overall memory functioning. EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONING: As mentioned, working memory was stronger for verbal than visual information, but both were within broad normal limits. Verbal fluency was within expected limits as well and she demonstrated particular strength in switching between semantic categories (very superior). Design fluency was average. Cognitive set shifting, inhibition of prepotent responses and planning and problem solving all fell within the average to high average range and within expected limits. Abstract reasoning for visual and verbal information was also good. Thus taken together, the patient did not demonstrate any difficulties with tasks assessing executive functioning. MOTOR FUNCTIONING: Fine motor coordination skills were within the average range with both her right dominant hand and left hand. Strength was impaired on both sides while basic motor speed was in the borderline range for both hands. These results are very similar to those that were found in her previous evaluation. They are consistent with decreased strength, but no loss of dexterity and they do not suggest any lateralized deficits. EMOTIONAL FUNCTIONING: On an affective screening measure, the patient endorsed only three items suggesting reduced energy and reduced clarity of thinking. Overall, these results suggest that she is not experiencing clinically significant depressive symptoms at this time. SUMMARY & IMPRESSIONS: This is a 58-year-old African-American female with 16 years of education who is referred for a neuropsychological evaluation by Dr. X in order to assess for possible cognitive impairment. She reported that she had recently been terminated from her position as a supervisory nurse in a psychiatric hospital following a neuropsychological evaluation that concluded that she may be in the &quot;early stages of a likely dementia&quot;. This evaluation was requested as a second opinion in order to clarify the nature of her cognitive impairment and make recommendations for ongoing treatment planning. Overall, intellectual functioning fell in the average range on this evaluation. Note that the same battery of tests was used in order to assess intellectual functioning and given the recency of her previous evaluation to some degree practice effects may have impacted her performance. However, we would not expect as significant of an impact upon tasks assessing processing speed and working memory. The same pattern of performance was noted across subtests in the intellectual battery with stronger performance on verbal knowledge based tasks relative to those assessing processing speed, working memory, and visuospatial skills. However, during this evaluation, she demonstrated significant improvement across tasks so that in general her profile is elevated, but the same profile pattern was seen. Note that along with practice effects, performance can also be impacted by changes in attention, as well as measurement error. The possibility of attentional fluctuations having contributed to some of her performance is a definite possibility based on her performance on some attention tasks, which suggested that she at times performed better and was able to sequence in mind more information than she was able to passively repeat and she demonstrated inconsistencies in her learning curve on the memory task. Our assessment of her intelligence as falling within the average range is consistent with our estimate of premorbid intellectual functioning and educational and occupational history. Note that the ways for technical manual indicates that test retest gains are less pronounced for verbal comprehension and working memory subtests than perceptual reasoning and processing speed subtests and The patient' improvements were much higher than the mean increases in the normative sample that averaged a shorter period between testing and retesting. This suggests that as noted above other factors were applied, perhaps including attentional fluctuations. Relative to intellectual functioning, the patient performed within expected limits across tasks assessing language functioning, verbal and visual memory, and executive skills and sustained attention. Variability in performances was seen for information processing speed, particularly when responding to changes in the tempo of stimulus presentation or making more complex visual discriminations. Immediate attention was also somewhat variable as she should be able to mentally manipulate greater amounts of visual and verbal material and she could just passively replicate. The better performance on raw scores on these more complex tasks is unusual and suggests fluctuations in attention for reasons other than brain base deficits. She also demonstrated weaker skills in complex visuospatial processing, particularly for shapes and figures rather than recognizable objects. Of note, she performed poorly when these tasks involved the time component. Meteorically, she demonstrated bilateral impairments in strength and motor speed, but dexterity and fine motor manipulation skills were within expected limits. The lack of lateralizing information and motor skills suggests that more peripheral factors and pain may have contributed to these results. Taken together, these results do not necessarily suggest that there has been any significant decline from premorbid levels. It is possible that the patient has always had weaknesses in visuospatial processing and note that these weaknesses were not in basic visual skills and processing skills, but rather in putting together shapes and figures. The inconsistencies in her performances on processing speed and attention tasks suggest that while she may be somewhat slowed in completing tasks, there may be contributors other than brain base changes that impacted her results. In particular, the patient' current medications, as well as pain, fatigue, and medical conditions such as diabetes and associated possible neuropathy are likely important factors. Results do not suggest the presence of a progressive dementing disorder. Given the multiple factors that may have contributed to some of our findings, we do not believe that any cognitive disorder should be diagnosed at this time. If there are significant concerns about her cognitive functioning, it may be useful to make adjustments in her medication regimen. This is a not a work based evaluation and therefore questions regarding her ability to perform job duties will not be addressed. One concern that we would like to bring up is that if visuospatial problems are of newer onset, they may be contributing to her recent falls and thus should be monitored for changes and progression and she should return for reevaluation in one year's time in order to determine any changes in her cognitive functioning. Additional recommendations are provided below. Note that there was a little overlap in tests given between the two testing sessions aside from the ways for CPT to word fluency. Also note that she completed the brief self-report instrument and all of her results fell within normal limits. RECOMMENDATIONS: 1. Based on fluctuations in processing speed and attention, it is possible that the patient' current medications may be impacting her cognitive functioning to some degree. Decisions regarding any changes are deferred to her physicians, but it may be useful to streamline her current medications while also continuing to effectively address symptoms. 2. The patient should return for reevaluation in one year's time to monitor her cognitive functioning and evaluate for any improvements in performance following any medication changes. Note also that stress related to her work situation and the nature of her previous neuropsychological evaluation may have also contributed to some of her difficulties on that testing. 3. The nature of her frequent falls is uncertain, but it is possible that weaknesses in visuospatial processing may be contributing and this should be further evaluated by her physicians."
276,Neurology," REASON FOR CONSULTATION: New-onset seizure. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 2-1/2-year-old female with a history of known febrile seizures, who was placed on Keppra oral solution at 150 mg b.i.d. to help prevent febrile seizures. Although this has been a very successful treatment in terms of her febrile seizure control, she is now having occasional brief periods of pauses and staring, where she becomes unresponsive, but does not lose her postural tone. The typical spell according to dad last anywhere from 10 to 15 seconds, mom says 3 to 4 minutes, which likely means probably somewhere in the 30- to 40-second period of time. Mom did note that an episode had happened outside of a store recently, was associated with some perioral cyanosis, but there has never been a convulsive activity noted. There have been no recent changes in her Keppra dosing and she is currently only at 20 mg/kg per day, which is overall a low dose for her. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Born at 36 weeks' gestation by C-section delivery at 8 pounds 3 ounces. She does have a history of febrile seizures and what parents reported an abdominal migraine, but on further questioning, it appears to be more of a food intolerance issue. PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: She has undergone no surgical procedures. FAMILY MEDICAL HISTORY: There is a strong history of epilepsy on the maternal side of family including mom with some nonconvulsive seizure during childhood and additional seizures in maternal great grandmother and a maternal great aunt. There is no other significant neurological history on the paternal side of the family. SOCIAL HISTORY: Currently lives with her mom, dad, and two siblings. She is at home full time and does not attend day care. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Clear review of 10 systems are taken and revealed no additional findings other than those mentioned in the history of present illness. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital Signs: Weight was 15.6 kg. She was afebrile. Remainder of her vital signs were stable and within normal ranges for her age as per the medical record. General: She was awake, alert, and oriented. She was in no acute distress, only slightly flustered when trying to place the EEG leads. HEENT: Showed normocephalic and atraumatic head. Her conjunctivae were nonicteric and sclerae were clear. Her eye movements were conjugate in nature. Her tongue and mucous membranes were moist. Neck: Trachea appeared to be in the midline. Chest: Clear to auscultation bilaterally without crackles, wheezes or rhonchi. Cardiovascular: Showed a normal sinus rhythm without murmur. Abdomen: Showed soft, nontender, and nondistended, with good bowel sounds. There was no hepatomegaly or splenomegaly, or other masses noted on examination. Extremities: Showed IV placement in the right upper extremity with appropriate restraints from the IV. There was no evidence of clubbing, cyanosis or edema throughout. She had no functional deformities in any of her peripheral limbs. Neurological: From neurological standpoint, her cranial nerves were grossly intact throughout. Her strength was good in the bilateral upper and lower extremities without any distal to proximal variation. Her overall resting tone was normal. Sensory examination was grossly intact to light touch throughout the upper and lower extremities. Reflexes were 1+ in bilateral patella. Toes were downgoing bilaterally. Coordination showed accurate striking ability and good rapid alternating movements. Gait examination was deferred at this time due to EEG lead placement. ASSESSMENT: A 2-1/2-year-old female with history of febrile seizures, now with concern for spells of unclear etiology, but somewhat concerning for partial complex seizures and to a slightly lesser extent nonconvulsive generalized seizures. RECOMMENDATIONS 1. For now, we will go ahead and try to capture EEG as long as she tolerates it; however, if she would require sedation, I would defer the EEG until further adjustments to seizure medications are made and we will see her response to these medications. 2. As per the above, I will increase her Keppra to 300 mg p.o. b.i.d. bringing her to a total daily dose of just under 40 mg/kg per day. If further spells are noted, we may increase upwards again to around 4.5 to 5 mL each day. 3. I do not feel like any specific imaging needs to be done at this time until we see her response to the medication and review her EEG findings. EEG, hopefully, will be able to be reviewed first thing tomorrow morning; however, I would not delay discharge the patient to wait on the EEG results. The patient has been discharged and we will contact the family as an outpatient. 4. The patient will need followup arrangement with me in 5 to 6 weeks' time, so we may recheck and see how she is doing and arrange for further followup then."
277,Neurology," EXAM: CT head. REASON FOR EXAM: Seizure disorder. TECHNIQUE: Noncontrast CT head. FINDINGS: There is no evidence of an acute intracranial hemorrhage or infarction. There is no midline shift, intracranial mass, or mass effect. There is no extra-axial fluid collection or hydrocephalus.

278,Neurology," CC: HA and vision loss. HX: 71 y/o RHM developed a cataclysmic headache on 11/5/92 associated with a violent sneeze. The headache lasted 3-4 days. On 11/7/92, he had acute pain and loss of vision in the left eye. Over the following day his left pupil enlarged and his left upper eyelid began to droop. He was seen locally and a brain CT showed no sign of bleeding, but a tortuous left middle cerebral artery was visualized. The patient was transferred to UIHC 11/12/92. FHX: HTN, stroke, coronary artery disease, melanoma. SHX: Quit smoking 15 years ago. MEDS: Lanoxin, Capoten, Lasix, KCL, ASA, Voltaren, Alupent MDI PMH: CHF, Atrial Fibrillation, Obesity, Anemia, Duodenal Ulcer, Spinal AVM resection 1986 with residual T9 sensory level, hyperreflexia and bilateral babinski signs, COPD. EXAM: 35.5C, BP 140/91, P86, RR20. Alert and oriented to person, place, and time. CN: No light perception OS, Pupils: 3/7 decreasing to 2/7 on exposure to light (i.e., fixed/dilated pupil OS). Upon neutral gaze the left eye deviated laterally and inferiorly. There was complete ptosis OS. On downward gaze their was intorsion OS. The left eye could not move superiorly, medially or effectively downward, but could move laterally. EOM were full OD. The rest of the CN exam was unremarkable. Motor, Coordination, Station and Gait testing were unremarkable. Sensory exam revealed decreased pinprick and light touch below T9 (old). Muscle stretch reflexes were increased (3+/3+) in both lower extremities and there were bilateral babinski signs (old). The upper extremity reflexes were symmetrical (2/2). Cardiovascular exam revealed an irregularly irregular rhythm and lung sounds were coarse bilaterally. The rest of the general exam was unremarkable. LAB: CBC, PT/PTT, General Screen were unremarkable except for a BUN 21mg/DL. CSF: protein 88mg/DL, glucose 58mg/DL, RBC 2800/mm3, WBC 1/mm3. ANA, RF, TSH, FT4 were WNL. IMPRESSION: CN3 palsy and loss of vision. Differential diagnosis: temporal arteritis, aneurysm, intracranial mass. COURSE: The outside Brain CT revealed a tortuous left MCA. A four-vessel cerebral angiogram revealed a dolichoectatic basilar artery and tortuous LICA. There was no evidence of aneursym. Transesophageal Echocardiogram revealed atrial enlargement only. Neuroopthalmologic evaluation revealed: Loss of color vision and visual acuity OS, RAPD OS, bilateral optic disk pallor (OS &gt; OD), CN3 palsy and bilateral temporal field loss, OS &gt;&gt; OD . ESR, CRP, MRI were recommended to rule out temporal arteritis and intracranial mass. ESR 29mm/Hr, CRP 4.3mg/DL (high) , The patient was placed on prednisone. Temporal artery biopsy showed no evidence of vasculitis. MRI scan could not be obtained due to patient weight. Sellar CT was done instead: coronal sections revealed sellar enlargement and upward bowing of the diaphragm sella suggesting a pituitary mass. In retrospect sellar enlargement could be seen on the angiogram X-rays. Differential consideration was given to cystic pituitary adenoma, noncalcified craniopharyngioma, or Rathke's cleft cyst with solid component. The patient refused surgery. He was seen in Neuroopthalmology Clinic 2/18/93 and was found to have mild recovery of vision OS and improved visual fields. Aberrant reinnervation of the 3rd nerve was noted as there was constriction of the pupil (OS) on adduction, downgaze and upgaze. The upper eyelid, OS, elevated on adduction and down gaze, OS. EOM movements were otherwise full and there was no evidence of ptosis. In retrospect he was felt to have suffered pituitary apoplexy in 11/92."
279,Neurology," CC: Confusion. HX: A 71 y/o RHM ,with a history of two strokes ( one in 11/90 and one in 11/91), had been in a stable state of health until 12/31/92 when he became confused, and displayed left-sided weakness and difficulty speaking. The symptoms resolved within hours and recurred the following day. He was then evaluated locally and HCT revealed an old right parietal stroke. Carotid duplex scan revealed a &quot;high grade stenosis&quot; of the RICA. Cerebral Angiogram revealed 90%RICA and 50%LICA stenosis. He was then transferred to UIHC Vascular Surgery for carotid endarterectomy. His confusion persisted and he was evaluated by Neurology on 1/8/93 and transferred to Neurology on 1/11/93. PMH: 1)cholecystectomy. 2)inguinal herniorrhaphies, bilaterally. 3)ETOH abuse: 3-10 beers/day. 4)Right parietal stroke 10/87 with residual left hemiparesis (Leg worse than arm). 5) 2nd stoke in distant past of unspecified type. MEDS: None on admission. FHX: Alzheimer's disease and stroke on paternal side of family. SHX: 50+pack-yr cigarette use. ROS: no weight loss. poor appetite/selective eater. EXAM: BP137/70 HR81 RR13 O2Sat 95% Afebrile. MS: Oriented to city and month, but did not know date or hospital. Naming and verbal comprehension were intact. He could tell which direction Iowa City and Des Moines were from Clinton and remembered 2-3 objects in two minutes, but both with assistance only. Incorrectly spelled &quot;world&quot; backward, as &quot;dlow.&quot; CN: unremarkable except neglects left visual field to double simultaneous stimulation. Motor: Deltoids 4+/4-, biceps 5-/4, triceps 5/4+, grip 4+/4+, HF4+/4-, HE 4+/4+, Hamstrings 5-/5-, AE 5-/5-, AF 5-/5-. Sensory: intact PP/LT/Vib. Coord: dysdiadochokinesis on RAM, bilaterally. Station: dyssynergic RUE on FNF movement. Gait: ND Reflexes: 2+/2+ throughout BUE and at patellae. Absent at ankles. Right plantar was flexor; and Left plantar was equivocal. COURSE: CBC revealed normal Hgb, Hct, Plt and WBC, but Mean corpuscular volume was large at 103FL (normal 82-98). Urinalysis revealed 20+WBC. GS, TSH, FT4, VDRL, ANA and RF were unremarkable. He was treated for a UTI with amoxacillin. Vitamin B12 level was reduced at 139pg/ml (normal 232-1137). Schillings test was inconclusive dure to inability to complete a 24-hour urine collection. He was placed on empiric Vitamin B12 1000mcg IM qd x 7 days; then qMonth. He was also placed on Thiamine 100mg qd, Folate 1mg qd, and ASA 325mg qd. His ESR and CRP were elevated on admission, but fell as his UTI was treated. EEG showed diffuse slowing and focal slowing in the theta-delta range in the right temporal area. HCT with contrast on 1/19/93 revealed a gyriform enhancing lesion in the left parietal lobe consistent with a new infarct; and an old right parietal hypodensity (infarct). His confusion was ascribed to the UTI in the face of old and new strokes and Vitamin B12 deficiency. He was lost to follow-up and did not undergo carotid endarterectomy."
280,Neurology," CC: Bilateral lower extremity numbness. HX: 21 y/o RHM complained of gradual onset numbness and incoordination of both lower extremities beginning approximately 11/5/96. The symptoms became maximal over a 12-24 hour period and have not changed since. The symptoms consist of tingling in the distal lower extremities approximately half way up the calf bilaterally. He noted decreased coordination of both lower extremities which he thought might be due to uncertainty as to where his feet were being placed in space. He denied bowel/bladder problems, or weakness or numbness elsewhere. Hot showers may improve his symptoms. He has suffered no recent flu-like illness. Past medical and family histories are unremarkable. He was on no medications. EXAM: Unremarkable except for mild distal vibratory sensation loss in the toes (R&gt;L). LAB: CBC, Gen Screen, TSH, FT4, SPE, ANA were all WNL. MRI L-SPINE: Normal. COURSE: Normal exam and diminished symptoms at following visit 4/23/93."
281,Neurology," PROCEDURE: Lumbar puncture with moderate sedation. INDICATION: The patient is a 2-year, 2-month-old little girl who presented to the hospital with severe anemia, hemoglobin 5.8, elevated total bilirubin consistent with hemolysis and weak positive direct Coombs test. She was transfused with packed red blood cells. Her hemolysis seemed to slow down. She also on presentation had indications of urinary tract infection with urinalysis significant for 2+ leukocytes, positive nitrites, 3+ protein, 3+ blood, 25 to 100 white cells, 10 to 25 bacteria, 10 to 25 epithelial cells on clean catch specimen. Culture subsequently grew out no organisms; however, the child had been pretreated with amoxicillin about x3 doses prior to presentation to the hospital. She had a blood culture, which was also negative. She was empirically started on presentation with the cefotaxime intravenously. Her white count on presentation was significantly elevated at 20,800, subsequently increased to 24.7 and then decreased to 16.6 while on antibiotics. After antibiotics were discontinued, she increased over the next 2 days to an elevated white count of 31,000 with significant bandemia, metamyelocytes and myelocytes present. She also had three episodes of vomiting and thus she is being taken to the procedure room today for a lumbar puncture to rule out meningitis that may being inadvertently treated in treating her UTI. I discussed with The patient's parents prior to the procedure the lumbar puncture and moderate sedation procedures. The risks, benefits, alternatives, complications including, but not limited to bleeding, infection, respiratory depression. Questions were answered to their satisfaction. They would like to proceed. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: After &quot;time out&quot; procedure was obtained, the child was given appropriate monitoring equipment including appropriate vital signs were obtained. She was then given Versed 1 mg intravenously by myself. She subsequently became sleepy, the respiratory monitors, end-tidal, cardiopulmonary and pulse oximetry were applied. She was then given 20 mcg of fentanyl intravenously by myself. She was placed in the left lateral decubitus position. Dr. X cleansed the patient's back in a normal sterile fashion with Betadine solution. She inserted a 22-gauge x 1.5-inch spinal needle in the patient's L3-L4 interspace that was carefully identified under my direct supervision. Clear fluid was not obtained initially, needle was withdrawn intact. The patient was slightly repositioned by the nurse and Dr. X reinserted the needle in the L3-L4 interspace position, the needle was able to obtain clear fluid, approximately 3 mL was obtained. The stylette was replaced and the needle was withdrawn intact and bandage was applied. Betadine solution was cleansed from the patient's back. During the procedure, there were no untoward complications, the end-tidal CO2, pulse oximetry, and other vitals remained stable. Of note, EMLA cream had also been applied prior procedure, this was removed prior to cleansing of the back. Fluid will be sent for a routine cell count, Gram stain culture, protein, and glucose. DISPOSITION: The child returned to room on the medical floor in satisfactory condition."
282,Neurology," The patient states that she has been having some problems with her memory for maybe the past year or two. She states that they have been slowly progressive. She had a consultation with an outside neurologist and was told that she likely has Alzheimer disease and was prescribed Aricept and was told that she should not drive. Per the dictation that is available to us in clinic, it appears that she was before a DMV. It appears that the patient wanted a second opinion, so she now presents for consultation on possible Alzheimer disease. The patient states that she has been doing fairly well at home. She balances her own checkbook. She does not do her own taxes, but she has never done so in the past. She states that she has no problems with cooking meals, getting her own meals, and she is still currently driving. She denies burning any dishes because she forgot them on the stove or forgetting what she is doing in the middle of a task or getting lost while she is driving around or getting lost in her own home. She states that she is very good remembering the names of her family members and does not forget important birthdays such as the date of birth of her grandchildren. She is unfortunately living alone, and although she seems to miss her grandchildren and is estranged from her son, she denies any symptoms of frank depression. There is unfortunately no one available to us to corroborate how well she is doing at home. She lives alone and takes care of herself and does not communicate very much with her brother and sister. She also does not communicate very much with her son who lives in Santa Cruz or her grandchildren. She denied any sort of personality change, paranoid ideas or hallucinations. She does appear to have headaches that can be severe about four times a month and have primarily photophobia and some nausea and occasionally emesis associated with it. When these headaches are very severe, she goes to the emergency room to get a single shot. She is unclear if this is some sort of a migraine medication or just a primary pain medication. She takes Fiorinal for these headaches and she states that this helps greatly. She denies visual or migraine symptoms. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Negative for any sort of focal neurologic deficits such as weakness, numbness, visual changes, dysarthria, diplopia or dysphagia. She also denies any sort of movement disorders, tremors, rigidities or clonus. Her personal opinion is that some of her memory problems may be due to simply to her age and/or nervousness. She is unclear as if her memory is any worse than anyone else in her age group. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for mesothelioma, which was diagnosed seemingly more than 20 to 25 years ago. The patient was not sure of exactly when it was diagnosed. This has been treated surgically by debulking operations for which she states that she has undergone about 10 operations. The mesothelioma is in her abdomen. She does not know of any history of having lung mesothelioma. She states that she has never gotten chemotherapy or radiation for her mesothelioma. Furthermore, she states that her last surgical debulking was more than 10 years ago and her disease has been fairly stable. She does have a history of three car accidents that she says were all rear-enders where she was hit while essentially in a stopped position. These have all occurred over the past five years. She also has a diagnosis of dementing illness, possibly Alzheimer disease from her previous neurology consultation. This diagnosis was given in March 2006. MEDICATIONS: Fiorinal, p.r.n. aspirin, unclear if baby or full sized, Premarin unclear of the dose. ALLERGIES: NONE. SOCIAL HISTORY: Significant for her being without a companion at this point. She was born in Munich, Germany. She immigrated to of America in 1957 after her family had to move to Eastern Germany, which was under Russian occupation at that time. She is divorced. She used to work as a secretary and later worked as a clerical worker at IBM. She stopped working more than 20 years ago due to complications from her mesothelioma. She denies any significant tobacco, alcohol or illicit drugs. She is bilingual speaking, German and English. She has known English from before her teens. She has the equivalent of a high school education in Germany. She has one brother and one sister, both of whom are healthy and she does not spend much time communicating with them. She has one son who lives in Santa Cruz. He has grandchildren. She is trying to contact with her grandchildren. FAMILY HISTORY: Significant for lung, liver, and prostate cancer. Her mother died in her 80s of &quot;old age,&quot; but it appears that she may have had a mild dementing illness at that time. Whatever that dementing illness was, appears to have started mostly in her 80s per the patient. No one else appears to have Alzheimer disease including her brother and sister. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Her blood pressure is 152/92, pulse 80, and weight 80.7 kg. She is alert and well nourished in no apparent distress. She occasionally fumbles with questions of orientation, missing the day and the date. She also did not know the name of the hospital, she thought it was O'Connor and she thought she was in Orange County and also did not know the floor of the hospital that we are in. She lost three points for recall. Even with prompting, she could not remember the objects that she was given to remember. Her Mini Mental Score was 22/30. There were no naming problems or problems with repetition. There were also no signs of dysarthria. Her pupils were bilaterally reactive to light and accommodation. Her extraocular movements were intact. Her visual fields were full to confrontation. Her sensations of her face, arm, and leg were normal. There were no signs of neglect with double simultaneous stimulation. Tongue was midline. Her palate was symmetric. Her face was symmetric as well. Strength was approximately 5/5. She did have some right knee pain and she had a mildly antalgic gait due to her right knee pain. Her reflexes were symmetric and +2 except for her toes, which were +1 to trace. Her plantar reflexes were mute. Her sensation was normal for pain, temperature, and vibration. There were no signs of ataxia on finger-to-nose and there was no dysdiadochokinesia. Gait was narrow and she could toe walk briefly and heel walk without difficulty. SUMMARY: Ms. A is a pleasant 72-year-old right-handed woman with a history of mesothelioma that appears stable at this time and likely mild dementia, most likely Alzheimer type. We tactfully discussed the patient's diagnosis with her, and she felt reassured. We told her that this most likely was in the earlier stages of disease and she would benefit from trying Aricept. She stated that she did not have the prescription anymore from her outpatient neurology consult for the Aricept, so we wrote her another prescription for Aricept. The patient herself seemed very concerned about the stigma of the disease, but our lengthy discussion, expressed genuine understanding as to why her outpatient physician had reported her to DMV. It was explicitly told to not drive by her outpatient neurologist and we concur with this assessment. She will follow up with us in the next six months and will call us if she has any problems with the Aricept. She was written for Aricept to start at 5 mg for three weeks, and if she has no side effects which typically are GI side effects, then she can go up to 10 mg a day. We also reviewed with Ms. A the findings for outpatient MRI, which showed some mild atrophy per report and also that her metabolic workup, which included an RPR, TSH, and B12 were all within normal limits."
283,Neurology," Briefly, the patient has a lumbosacral polyradiculopathy that is temporally related to the epidural anesthesia given to her in October of 2008. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 35-year-old woman who reports that on the 30th of October 2008, she had a rupture of her membranes at nine months of pregnancy, and was admitted to hospital and was given an epidural anesthetic. I do not have the records from this hospital admission, but apparently the epidural was administered for approximately 14 to 18 hours. She was sitting up during the epidural. She did not notice any difference in her lower extremities at the time she had the epidural; however, she reports that she was extremely sleepy and may not have been aware of any change in strength or sensation in her lower extremities at that time. She delivered on the 31st of October, by Cesarean section, because she had failed to progress and had pyrexia. She also had a Foley catheter placed at that time. On the 1st of November 2008, they began to mobilize her and it was at that time that she first noticed that she could not walk. She was aware that she could not move her legs at all, and then within a few days, she was aware that she could move toes in the left foot but could not move her right foot at all. Since that time, there has been a gradual improvement in strength to the point that she now has limited movement in her left leg and severely restricted movement in her right leg. She is not able to walk by herself, and needs assistance to stand. She was discharged from hospital after the Cesarean section on the 3rd of November. Unfortunately, we do not have the records and we do not know what the discussion was between the anesthesiologist and the patient at the time of discharge. She was then seen at ABC Hospital on November 05, 2008. She had an MRI scan of her spine, which showed no evidence of an abnormality, specifically there were no cord changes and no evidence of a hematoma. She also had an EMG study at that time by Dr. X, which was abnormal but not diagnostic and this was repeated again in December. At the present time, she also complains of a pressure in both her legs and in her thighs. She complains that her right foot hurts and that she has some hyperesthesia there. She has been taking gabapentin to try to reduce the discomfort, although she is on a very low dose and the effect is minimal. She has no symptoms in her arms, her bowel and bladder function is normal, and her bulbar function is normal. There is no problem with her vision, swallowing, or respiratory function. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Unremarkable except as noted above. She has seasonal allergies. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Gabapentin 300 mg b.i.d., Centrum once a day, and another multivitamin. ALLERGIES: She has no medication allergies, but does have seasonal allergies. FAMILY HISTORY: There is a family history of diabetes and hypertension. There is no family history of a neuropathy or other neurological disease. She has one child, a son, born on October 31, 2008. SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is a civil engineer, who currently works from home. She is working approximately half time because of limitations imposed on her by her disability, need to attend frequent physical therapy, and also the needs of looking after her baby. She does not smoke and does not drink and has never done either. GENERAL PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: P 74, BP 144/75, and a pain score of 0. GENERAL: Her general physical examination was unremarkable. CARDIOVASCULAR: Normal first and second heart sound, regular pulse with normal volume. RESPIRATORY: Unremarkable, both lung bases were clear, and respiration was normal. GI: Unremarkable, with no organomegaly and normal bowel sounds. NEUROLOGICAL EXAM: MSE: The patient's orientation was normal, fund of knowledge was normal, memory was normal, speech was normal, calculation was normal, and immediate and long-term recall was normal. Executive function was normal. CRANIAL NERVES: The cranial nerve examination II through XII was unremarkable. Both disks were normal, with normal retina. Pupils were equal and reactive to light. Eye movements were full. Facial sensation and strength was normal. Bulbar function was normal. The trapezius had normal strength. MOTOR: Muscle tone showed a slight increase in tone in the lower extremities, with normal tone in the upper extremities. Muscle strength was 5/5 in all muscle groups in the upper extremities. In the lower extremities, the hip flexors were 1/5 bilaterally, hip extensors were 1/5 bilaterally, knee extension on the right was 1/5 and on the left was 3-/5, knee flexion was 2/5 on the right and 3-/5 on the left, foot dorsiflexion was 0/5 on the right and 1/5 on the left, foot plantar flexion was 4-/5 on the right and 4+/5 on the left, toe extension was 0/5 on the right and 4-/5 on the left, toe flexion was 4-/5 on the right and 4+/5 on the left. REFLEXES: Reflexes in the upper extremities were 2+ bilaterally. In the lower extremities, they were 0 bilaterally at the knee and ankles. The abdominal reflexes were present above the umbilicus and absent below the umbilicus. The plantar responses were mute. The jaw reflex was normal. SENSATION: Vibration was moderately decreased in the right great toe and was mildly decreased in the left great toe. There was a sensory level to light touch at approximately T7 posteriorly and approximately T9 anteriorly. There was a range of sensation, but clearly there was a decrease in sensation below this level but not complete loss of sensation. To pain, the sensory level is even less clear, but appeared to be at about T7 on the right side. In the lower extremities, there was a slight decrease in pin and light touch in the right great toe compared to the left. There was no evidence of allodynia or hyperesthesia. Joint position sense was mildly reduced in the right toe and normal on the left. COORDINATION: Coordination for rapid alternating movements and finger-to-nose testing was normal. Coordination could not be tested in the lower extremities. GAIT: The patient was unable to stand and therefore we were unable to test gait or Romberg's. There was no evidence of focal back tenderness. REVIEW OF OUTSIDE RECORDS: I have reviewed the records from ABC Hospital, including the letter from Dr. Y and the EMG report dated 12/17/2008 from Dr. X. The EMG report shows evidence of a lumbosacral polyradiculopathy below approximately T6. The lower extremity sensory responses are essentially normal; however, there is a decrease in the amplitude of the motor responses with minimal changes in latency. I do have the MRI of lumbar spine report from 11/06/2008 with and without contrast. This showed a minimal concentric disc bulge of L4-L5 without disc herniation, but was otherwise unremarkable. The patient brought a disc with a most recent MRI study; however, we were unable to open this on our computers. The verbal report is that the study was unremarkable except for some gadolinium enhancement in the lumbar nerve roots. A Doppler of the lower extremities showed no evidence of deep venous thrombosis in either lower extremity. Chest x-ray showed some scoliosis on the lumbar spine, curve to the left, but no evidence of other abnormalities. A CT pelvis study performed on November 07, 2008 showed some nonspecific fluid in the subcutaneous fat of the back, posterior to L4 and L5 levels; however, there were no pelvic masses or other abnormalities. We were able to obtain an update of the report from the MRI of the lumbar spine with and without contrast dated 12/30/2008. The complete study included the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine. There was diffuse enhancement of the nerve roots of the cauda equina that had increased in enhancement since prior exam in November. It was also reported that the patient was given intravenous methylprednisolone and this had had no effect on strength in her lower extremities. IMPRESSION: The patient has a condition that is temporarily related to the epidural injection she was given at the end of October 2008, prior to her Cesarean section. It appears she became aware of weakness within two days of the administration of the epidural, she was very tired during the epidural and may have missed some change in her neurological function. She was severely weak in both lower extremities, slightly worse on the right than the left. There has been some interval improvement in her strength since the beginning of November 2008. Her EMG study from the end of December is most consistent with a lumbosacral polyradiculopathy. The MRI findings of gadolinium enhancement in the lumbar nerve roots would be most consistent with an inflammatory radiculitis most likely related to the epidural anesthesia or administration of the epidural. There had been no response to IV methylprednisolone given to her at ABC. The issue of having a lumbar puncture to look for evidence of inflammatory cells or an elevated protein had been discussed with her at both ABC and by myself. The patient did not wish to consider a lumbar puncture because of concerns that this might worsen her condition. At the present time, she is able to stand with aid but is unable to walk. There is no evidence on her previous EMG of a demyelinating neuropathy. RECOMMENDATIONS: 1. The diagnostic issues were discussed with the patient at length. She is informed that this is still early in the course of the problem and that we expect her to show some improvement in her function over the next one to two years, although it is unclear as to how much function she will regain. 2. She is strongly recommended to continue with vigorous physical therapy, and to continue with the plan to mobilize her as much as possible, with the goal of trying to get her ambulatory. If she is able to walk, she will need bilateral AFOs for her ankles, to improve her overall mobility. I am not prescribing these because at the present time she does not need them. 3. We discussed increasing the dose of gabapentin. The paresthesias that she has may indicate that she is actually regaining some sensory function, although there is a concern that as recovery continues, she may be left with significant neuropathic pain. If this is the case, I have advised her to increase her gabapentin dose from 300 mg b.i.d. gradually up to 300 mg four times a day and then to 600 mg to 900 mg four times a day. She may need other neuropathic pain medications as needed. She will determine whether her current symptoms are significant enough to require this increase in dosage. 4. The patient will follow up with Dr. Y and his team at ABC Hospital. She will also continue with physical therapy within the ABC system."
284,Neurology," CC: Left hemiplegia. HX: A 58 y/o RHF awoke at 1:00AM on 10/23/92 with left hemiplegia and dysarthria which cleared within 15 minutes. She was seen at a local ER and neurological exam and CT Brain were reportedly unremarkable. She was admitted locally. She then had two more similar spells at 3AM and 11AM with resolution of the symptoms within an hour. She was placed on IV Heparin following the 3rd episode and was transferred to UIHC. She had not been taking ASA. PMH: 1)HTN. 2) Psoriasis. SHX: denied ETOH/Tobacco/illicit drug use. FHX: Unknown. MEDS: Heparin only. EXAM: BP160/90 HR145 (supine). BP105/35 HR128 (light headed, standing) RR12 T37.7C MS: Dysarthria only. Lucid thought process. CN: left lower facial weakness only. Motor: mild left hemiparesis with normal muscle bulk. Mildly increased left sided muscle tone. Sensory: unremarkable. Coordination: impaired secondary to weakness on left. Otherwise unremarkable. Station: left pronator drift. Romberg testing not done. Gait: not tested. Reflexes: symmetric; 2+ throughout. Gen Exam: CV: Tachycardic without murmur. COURSE: The patients signs and symptoms worsening during and after standing to check orthostatic blood pressures. She was immediately placed in a reverse Trendelenburg position and given IV fluids. Repeat neurologic exam at 5PM on the day of presentation revealed a return to the initial presentation of signs and symptoms. PT/PTT/GS/CBC/ABG were unremarkable. EKG revealed sinus tachycardia with rate dependent junctional changes. CXR unremarkable. MRI Brain was obtained and showed an evolving right thalamic/lentiform nucleus infarction best illustrated by increased signal on the Proton density weighted images. Over the ensuing days of admission she had significant fluctuations of her BP (200mmHG to 140mmHG systolic). Her symptoms worsened with falls in BP. Her BP was initially controlled with esmolol or labetalol. Renal Ultrasound, abdominal/pelvic CT, renal function scan, serum and urine osmolality, urine catecholamines/metanephrine studies were unremarkable. Carotid doppler study revealed 0-15%BICA stenosis and antegrade vertebral artery flow, bilaterally. Transthoracic echocardiogram was unremarkable. Cerebral angiogram was performed to r/o vasculitis. This revealed narrowing of the M1 segment of the right MCA. This was thought secondary to atherosclerosis and not vasculitis. She was discharged on ASA, Procardia XL, and Labetalol."
285,Neurology," DIAGNOSIS: Possible cerebrovascular accident. DESCRIPTION: The EEG was obtained using 21 electrodes placed in scalp-to-scalp and scalp-to-vertex montages. The background activity appears to consist of fairly organized somewhat pleomorphic low to occasional medium amplitude of 7-8 cycle per second activity and was seen mostly posteriorly bilaterally symmetrically. A large amount of movement artifacts and electromyographic effects were noted intermixed throughout the recording session. Transient periods of drowsiness occurred naturally producing irregular 5-7 cycle per second activity mostly over the anterior regions. Hyperventilation was not performed. No epileptiform activity or any definite lateralizing findings were seen. IMPRESSION: Mildly abnormal study. The findings are suggestive of a generalized cerebral disorder. Due to the abundant amount of movement artifacts, any lateralizing findings, if any cannot be well appreciated. Clinical correlation is recommended."
286,Neurology," CC: Fall/loss of consciousness. HX: This 44y/o male fell 15-20feet from a construction site scaffold landing on his head on a cement sidewalk. He was transported directly from the scene, approximately one mile east of UIHC. The patient developed labored breathing and an EMT attempted to intubate the patient in the UIHC ER garage, but upon evaluation in the ER, was found to be in his esophagus and was immediately replaced into the trachea. Replacement of the ET tube required succinylcholine. The patient remained in a C-collar during the procedure. Once in the ER the patient had a 15min period of bradycardia. MEDS: none prior to accident. PMH: No significant chronic or recent illness. s/p left knee arthroplasty. h/o hand fractures. FHX: Unremarkable. SHX: Married. Rare cigarette use/Occasional Marijuana use/Social ETOH use per wife. EXAM: BP156/79. HR 74 RR (Ambu Bag ventilation via ET tube) 34.7C 72-100% O2Sat. MS: Unresponsive to verbal stimulation. No spontaneous verbalization. CN: Does not open/close eyes to command or spontaneously. Pupils 9/7 and nonreactive. Corneas -/+. Gag +/+. Oculocephalic and Oculovestibular reflexes not performed. Motor: minimal spontaneous movement of the 4 extremities. Sensory: withdraws LUE and BLE to noxious stimulation. Coord/Station/Gait: Not tested. Reflexes: 1-2+ and symmetric throughout. Babinski signs were present bilaterally. HEENT: severe facial injury with brain parenchyma and blood from the right nostril. Severe soft tissue swelling about side of head. Gen Exam: CV: RRR without murmur. Lungs: CTA. Abdomen: distended after ET tube misplacement. COURSE: HCT upon arrival, 10/29/92, revealed: Extensive parenchymal contusions in right fronto-parietal area. Pronounced diffuse brain swelling seemingly obliterates the mesencephalic cistern and 4th ventricle. Considerable mass effect is exerted upon the right lateral ventricle, near totally obliterating its contour. Massive subcutaneous soft tissue swelling is present along the right anterolateral parietal area. There are extensive fractures of the following: two component horizontal fractures throughout the floor of the right middle cranial fossa which includes the squamous and petrous portions of the temporal bone, as well as the greater wing of the sphenoid. Comminuted fractures of the aqueous portion of the temporal bone and parietal bone is noted on the right. Extensive comminution of the right half of the frontal bone and marked displacement is seen. Comminuted fractures of the medial wall of the right orbit and ethmoidal air cells is seen with near total opacification of the air cells. The medial and lateral walls of the maxillary sinus are fractured and minimally displaced, as well as the medial wall of the left maxillary sinus. The right zygomatic bone is fractured at its articulation with the sphenoid bone and displaced posteriorly. Portable chest, c-spine and abdominal XRays were unremarkable, but limited studies. Abdominal CT was unremarkable. Hgb 10.4g/dl, Hct29%, WBC17.4k/mm3, Plt 190K. ABG:7.28/48/46 on admission. Glucose 131. The patient was hyperventilated, Mannitol was administered (1g/kg), and the patient was given a Dilantin loading dose. He was taken to surgery immediately following the above studies to decompress the contused brain and remove bony fragments from multiple skull fractures. The patient remained in a persistent vegetative state at UIHC, and upon the request of this wife his feeding tube was discontinued. He later expired."
287,Neurology," DIAGNOSES ON ADMISSION 1. Cerebrovascular accident (CVA) with right arm weakness. 2. Bronchitis. 3. Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. 4. Hyperlipidemia. 5. Thrombocytopenia. DIAGNOSES ON DISCHARGE 1. Cerebrovascular accident with right arm weakness and MRI indicating acute/subacute infarct involving the left posterior parietal lobe without mass effect. 2. Old coronary infarct, anterior aspect of the right external capsule. 3. Acute bronchitis with reactive airway disease. 4. Thrombocytopenia most likely due to old coronary infarct, anterior aspect of the right external capsule. 5. Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. 6. Hyperlipidemia. HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted to the emergency room. Plavix was started in addition to baby aspirin. He was kept on oral Zithromax for his cough. He was given Xopenex treatment, because of his respiratory distress. Carotid ultrasound was reviewed and revealed a 50 to 69% obstruction of left internal carotid. Dr. X saw him in consultation and recommended CT angiogram. This showed no significant obstructive lesion other than what was known on the ultrasound. Head MRI was done and revealed the above findings. The patient was begun on PT and improved. By discharge, he had much improved strength in his right arm. He had no further progressions. His cough improved with oral Zithromax and nebulizer treatments. His platelets also improved as well. By discharge, his platelets was up to 107,000. His H&H was stable at 41.7 and 14.6 and his white count was 4300 with a normal differential. Chest x-ray revealed a mild elevated right hemidiaphragm, but no infiltrate. Last chemistry panel on December 5, 2003, sodium 137, potassium 4.0, chloride 106, CO2 23, glucose 88, BUN 17, creatinine 0.7, calcium was 9.1. PT/INR on admission was 1.03, PTT 34.7. At the time of discharge, the patient's cough was much improved. His right arm weakness has much improved. His lung examination has just occasional rhonchi. He was changed to a metered dose inhaler with albuterol. He is being discharged home. An echocardiogram revealed mild concentric LVH with normal left ventricular function with an EF of 57%, moderate left atrial enlargement and diastolic dysfunction with mild mitral regurgitation. He will follow up in my office in 1 week. He is to start PT and OT as an outpatient. He is to avoid driving his car. He is to notify, if further symptoms. He has 2 more doses of Zithromax at home, he will complete. His prognosis is good."

Anterior and posterior osteophyte formation is seen at C5-C6. No abnormal anterior cervical soft tissue swelling is seen. No spinal compression is noted. The atlanto-dens interval is normal. There is a large retention cyst versus polyp within the right maxillary sinus. IMPRESSION: 1. Straightening of the normal cervical lordosis compatible with patient positioning versus muscle spasms. 2. Degenerative disk and joint disease at C5-C6. 3. Retention cyst versus polyp of the right maxillary sinus."
289,Neurology," CC: Orthostatic lightheadedness. HX: This 76 y/o male complained of several months of generalized weakness and malaise, and a two week history of progressively worsening orthostatic dizziness. The dizziness worsened when moving into upright positions. In addition, he complained of intermittent throbbing holocranial headaches, which did not worsen with positional change, for the past several weeks. He had lost 40 pounds over the past year and denied any recent fever, SOB, cough, vomiting, diarrhea, hemoptysis, melena, hematochezia, bright red blood per rectum, polyuria, night sweats, visual changes, or syncopal episodes. He had a 100+ pack-year history of tobacco use and continued to smoke 1 to 2 packs per day. He has a history of sinusitis. EXAM: BP 98/80 mmHg and pulse 64 BPM (supine); BP 70/palpable mmHG and pulse 84BPM (standing). RR 12, Afebrile. Appeared fatigued. CN: unremarkable. Motor and Sensory exam: unremarkable. Coord: Slowed but otherwise unremarkable movements. Reflexes: 2/2 and symmetric throughout all 4 extremities. Plantar responses were flexor, bilaterally. The rest of the neurologic and general physical exam was unremarkable. LAB: Na 121 meq/L, K 4.2 meq/L, Cl 90 meq/L, CO2 20meq/L, BUN 12mg/DL, CR 1.0mg/DL, Glucose 99mg/DL, ESR 30mm/hr, CBC WNL with nl WBC differential, Urinalysis: SG 1.016 and otherwise WNL, TSH 2.8 IU/ML, FT4 0.9ng/DL, Urine Osmolality 246 MOSM/Kg (low), Urine Na 35 meq/L, COURSE: The patient was initially hydrated with IV normal saline and his orthostatic hypotension resolved, but returned within 24-48hrs. Further laboratory studies revealed: Aldosterone (serum)&lt;2ng/DL (low), 30 minute Cortrosyn Stimulation test: pre 6.9ug/DL (borderline low), post 18.5ug/DL (normal stimulation rise), Prolactin 15.5ng/ML (no baseline given), FSH and LH were within normal limits for males. Testosterone 33ng/DL (wnl). Sinus XR series (done for history of headache) showed an abnormal sellar region with enlarged sella tursica and destruction of the posterior clinoids. There was also an abnormal calcification seen in the middle of the sellar region. A left maxillary sinus opacity with air-fluid level was seen. Goldman visual field testing was unremarkable. Brain CT and MRI revealed suprasellar mass most consistent with pituitary adenoma. He was treated with Fludrocortisone 0.05 mg BID and within 24hrs, despite discontinuation of IV fluids, remained hemodynamically stable and free of symptoms of orthostatic hypotension. His presumed pituitary adenoma continues to be managed with Fludrocortisone as of this writing (1/1997), though he has developed dementia felt secondary to cerebrovascular disease (stroke/TIA)."
290,Neurology," CC: Memory loss. HX: This 77 y/o RHF presented with a one year history of progressive memory loss. Two weeks prior to her evaluation at UIHC she agreed to have her sister pick her up for church at 8:15AM, Sunday morning. That Sunday she went to pick up her sister at her sister's home and when her sister was not there (because the sister had gone to pick up the patient) the patient left. She later called the sister and asked her if she (sister) had overslept. During her UIHC evaluation she denied she knew anything about the incident. No other complaints were brought forth by the patients family. PMH: Unremarkable. MEDS: None FHX: Father died of an MI, Mother had DM type II. SHX: Denies ETOH/illicit drug/Tobacco use. ROS: Unremarkable. EXAM: Afebrile, 80BPM, BP 158/98, 16RPM. Alert and oriented to person, place, time. Euthymic. 29/30 on Folstein's MMSE with deficit on drawing. Recalled 2/6 objects at five minutes and could not recite a list of 6 objects in 6 trials. Digit span was five forward and three backward. CN: mild right lower facial droop only. MOTOR: Full strength throughout. SENSORY: No deficits to PP/Vib/Prop/LT/Temp. COORD: Poor RAM in LUE only. GAIT: NB and ambulated without difficulty. STATION: No drift or Romberg sign.

NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL EVALUATION, 12/7/92: Verbal associative fluency was defective. Verbal memory, including acquisition, and delayed recall and recognition, was severely impaired. Visual memory, including immediate and delayed recall was also severely impaired. Visuoperceptual discrimination was mildly impaired, as was 2-D constructional praxis. HCT, 12/7/92: Diffuse cerebral atrophy with associative mild enlargement of the ventricles consistent with patient's age. Calcification is seen in both globus pallidi and this was felt to be a normal variant."
291,Neurology," Doctor's Name Doctor's Address Dear Doctor: This letter serves as an introduction to my patient, A, who will be seeing you in the near future. He is a pleasant young man who has a diagnosis of bulbar cerebral palsy and hypotonia. He has been treated by Dr. X through the pediatric neurology clinic. He saw Dr. X recently and she noted that he was having difficulty with mouth breathing, which was contributing to some of his speech problems. She also noted and confirmed that he has significant tonsillar hypertrophy. The concern we have is whether he may benefit from surgery to remove his tonsils and improve his mouth breathing and his swallowing and speech. Therefore, I ask for your opinion on this matter. For his chronic allergic rhinitis symptoms, he is currently on Flonase two sprays to each nostril once a day. He also has been taking Zyrtec 10 mg a day with only partial relief of the symptoms. He does have an allergy to penicillin. I appreciate your input on his care. If you have any questions regarding, please feel free to call me through my office. Otherwise, I look forward to hearing back from you regarding his evaluation."
292,Neurology," HISTORY: The patient is a 52-year-old female with a past medical history of diet-controlled diabetes, diffuse arthritis, plantar fasciitis, and muscle cramps who presents with a few-month history of numbness in both big toes and up the lateral aspect of both calves. Symptoms worsened considerable about a month ago. This normally occurs after being on her feet for any length of time. She was started on amitriptyline and this has significantly improved her symptoms. She is almost asymptomatic at present. She dose complain of longstanding low back pain, but no pain that radiates from her back into her legs. She has had no associated weakness. On brief examination, straight leg raising is normal. The patient is obese. There is mild decreased vibration and light touch in distal lower extremities. Strength is full and symmetric. Deep tendon reflexes at the knees are 2+ and symmetric and absent at the ankles. NERVE CONDUCTION STUDIES: Bilateral sural sensory responses are absent. Bilateral superficial sensory responses are present, but mildly reduced. The right radial sensory response is normal. The right common peroneal and tibial motor responses are normal. Bilateral H-reflexes are absent. NEEDLE EMG: Needle EMG was performed on the right leg and lumbosacral paraspinal muscles and the left tibialis posterior using a concentric disposable needle. It revealed increased insertional activity in the right tibialis posterior muscle with signs of mild chronic denervation in bilateral peroneus longus muscles and the right tibialis posterior muscle. Lumbar paraspinals were attempted, but were too painful to get a good assessment. IMPRESSION: This electrical study is abnormal. It reveals the following: 1. A very mild, purely sensory length-dependent peripheral neuropathy. 2. Mild bilateral L5 nerve root irritation. There is no evidence of active radiculopathy. Based on the patient's history and exam, her new symptoms are consistent with mild bilateral L5 radiculopathies. Symptoms have almost completely resolved over the last month since starting Elavil. I would recommend MRI of the lumbosacral spine if symptoms return. With respect to the mild neuropathy, this is probably related to her mild glucose intolerance/early diabetes. However, I would recommend a workup for other causes to include the following: Fasting blood sugar, HbA1c, ESR, RPR, TSH, B12, serum protein electrophoresis and Lyme titer."
293,Neurology," CC: Progressive loss of color vision OD HX: 58 y/o female presents with a one year history of progressive loss of color vision. In the past two months she has developed blurred vision and a central scotoma OD. There are no symptoms of photopsias, diplopia, headache, or eye pain. There are no other complaints. There have been mild fluctuations of her symptoms, but her vision has never returned to its baseline prior to symptom onset one year ago. EXAM: Visual acuity with correction: 20/25+1 OD; 20/20-1 OS. Pupils were 3.5mm OU. There was a 0.8 log unit RAPD OD. Intraocular pressures were 25 and 24, OD and OS respectively; and there was an increase to 27 on upgaze OD, but no increase on upgaze OS. Optic disk pallor was evident OD, but not OS. Additionally, there was a small area of peripheral chorioretinal scarring in the inferotemporal area of the right eye. Foveal flicker fusion occurred at a frequency of 21.9 OD and 30.7 OS. Color plate testing scores: 6/14 OD and 10/14 OS. Goldman visual field examination showed an enlarged and deepened blind spot with an infero-temporal defect especially in the smaller diopters. IMPRESSION ON 2/6/89: Optic neuropathy/atrophy OD, rule out mass lesion affecting optic nerve. Particular attention was paid to the area of the optic canal, cavernous sinus and sphenoid sinus. BRAIN CT W/CONTRAST, 2/13/89: Enhancing calcified lesion in the posterior aspect of the right optic nerve, probable meningioma. MRI ORBITS W/ AND W/OUT GADOLINIUM CONTRAST, 4/26/89: 7x3mm irregular soft tissue mass just inferior and lateral to the optic nerve OD. The mass is just proximal to the orbital apex. There is relatively homogeneous enhancement of the mass. The findings are most consistent with meningioma. MRI 1995: Mild enlargement of tumor with possible slight extension into the right cavernous sinus. COURSE: Resection and biopsy were deferred due to risk of blindness, and suspicion that the tumor was a slow growing meningioma. 3 years after initial evaluation Hertel measurements indicated a 3mm proptosis OD. Visual field testing revealed gradual worsening of deficits seen on her initial Goldman visual field exam. There was greater red color desaturation of the temporal field OD. Visual acuity had decreased from 20/20 to 20/64, OD. All other deficits seen on her initial exam remained stable or slightly worsened. By 1996 she continued to be followed at 6 months intervals and had not undergone surgical resection."
294,Neurology," CC: Right shoulder pain. HX: This 46 y/o RHF presented with a 4 month history of right neck and shoulder stiffness and pain. The symptoms progressively worsened over the 4 month course. 2 weeks prior to presentation she began to develop numbness in the first and second fingers of her right hand and RUE pain. The later was described as a throbbing pain. She also experienced numbness in both lower extremities and pain in the coccygeal region. The pains worsened at night and impaired sleep. She denied any visual change, bowel or bladder difficulties and symptoms involving the LUE. She occasionally experienced an electric shock like sensation shooting down her spine when flexing her neck (Lhermitte's phenomena). She denied any history of neck/back/head trauma. She had been taking Naprosyn with little relief. PMH: 1) Catamenial Headaches. 2) Allergy to Macrodantin. SHX/FHX: Smokes 2ppd cigarettes. EXAM: Vital signs were unremarkable. CN: unremarkable. Motor: full strength throughout. Normal tone and muscle bulk. Sensory: No deficits on LT/PP/VIB/TEMP/PROP testing. Coord/Gait/Station: Unremarkable. Reflexes: 2/2 in BUE except 2+ at left biceps. 1+/1+BLE except an absent right ankle reflex. Plantar responses were flexor bilaterally. Rectal exam: normal tone. IMPRESSION: C-spine lesion. COURSE: MRI C-spine revealed a central C5-6 disk herniation with compression of the spinal cord at that level. EMG/NCV showed normal NCV, but 1+ sharps and fibrillations in the right biceps (C5-6), brachioradialis (C5-6), triceps (C7-8) and teres major; and 2+ sharps and fibrillations in the right pronator terres. There was increased insertional activity in all muscles tested on the right side. The findings were consistent with a C6-7 radiculopathy. The patient subsequently underwent C5-6 laminectomy and her symptoms resolved."
295,Neurology," REASON FOR VISIT: This is an 83-year-old woman referred for diagnostic lumbar puncture for possible malignancy by Dr. X. She is accompanied by her daughter. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient' daughter tells me that over the last month the patient has gradually stopped walking even with her walker and her left arm has become gradually less functional. She is not able to use the walker because her left arm is so weak. She has not been having any headaches. She has had a significant decrease in appetite. She is known to have lung cancer, but Ms. Wilson does not know what kind. According to her followup notes, it is presumed non-small cell lung cancer of the left upper lobe of the lung. The last note I have to evaluate is from October 2008. CT scan from 12/01/2009 shows atrophy and small vessel ischemic change, otherwise a normal head CT, no mass lesion. I also reviewed the MRI from September 2009, which does not suggest normal pressure hydrocephalus and shows no mass lesion. Blood tests from 11/18/2009 demonstrate platelet count at 132 and INR of 1.0. MAJOR FINDINGS: The patient is a pleasant and cooperative woman who answers the questions the best she can and has difficulty moving her left arm and hand. She also has pain in her left arm and hand at a level of 8-9/10. VITAL SIGNS: Blood pressure 126/88, heart rate 70, respiratory rate 16, and weight 95 pounds. I screened the patient with questions to determine whether it is likely she has abnormal CSF pressure and she does not have any of the signs that would suggest this, so we performed the procedure in the upright position. PROCEDURE: Lumbar puncture, diagnostic (CPT 62270). PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Possible CSF malignancy. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: To be determined after CSF evaluation. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Lumbar puncture. ANESTHESIA: Local with 2% lidocaine at the L4-L5 level. SPECIMEN REMOVED: 15 cc of clear CSF. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: None. DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: I explained the procedure, its rationale, risks, benefits, and alternatives to the patient and her daughter. The patient' daughter remained present throughout the procedure. The patient provided written consent and her daughter signed as witness to the consent. I located the iliac crest and spinous processes before the procedure and determined the level I planned for the puncture. During the procedure, I spoke constantly with the patient to explain what was happening and to warn when there might be pain or discomfort. The skin was prepped with chlorhexidine solution with the patient seated on the chair leaning forward with her face resting on the exam table. Using local anesthetic and aseptic technique, I inserted a 20-gauge spinal needle at the L4-L5 interspace and 15 cc of CSF was collected without difficulty. The patient tolerated the procedure well. ASSESSMENT: White blood cells 1, red blood cells 54, glucose 59, protein 51, Gram stain negative, bacterial culture negative after three days, and remaining tests pending."
296,Neurology," CC: Gait difficulty. HX: This 59 y/o RHF was admitted with complaint of gait difficulty. The evening prior to admission she noted sudden onset of LUE and LLE weakness. She felt she favored her right leg, but did not fall when walking. She denied any associated dysarthria, facial weakness, chest pain, SOB, visual change, HA, nausea or vomiting. PMH: tonsillectomy, adenoidectomy, skull fx 1954, HTN, HA. MEDS: none on day of exam. SHX: editorial assistant at newspaper, 40pk-yr Tobacco, no ETOH/Drugs. FHX: noncontributory ADMIT EXAM: P95 R20, T36.6, BP169/104 MS: A&O to person, place and time. Speech fluent and without dysarthria, Naming-comprehension-reading intact. Euthymic with appropriate affect. CN: Pupils 4/4 decreasing to 2/2 on exposure to light, Fundi flat, VFFTC, EOMI, Face symmetric with intact sensation, Gag-shrug-corneal reflexes intact, Tongue ML with full ROM Motor: Full strength throughout right side. Mildly decreased left grip and left extensor hallucis longus. Biceps/Triceps/Wrist flexors and extensor were full strength on left. However she demonstrated mild LUE pronator drift and had difficulty standing on her LLE despite full strength on bench testing of the LLE. Sensory: No deficit to PP/T/Vib/Prop/ LT Coord: decreased speed and magnitude of FNF, Finger tapping and HKS, on left side only. Station: mild LUE upward drift. Gait: tendency to drift toward the left. Difficulty standing on LLE. Reflexes were symmetric, plantar responses were flexor bilaterally. Gen exam unremarkable. COURSE: Admit Labs: ESR, PT/PTT, GS, UA, EKG, and HCT were unremarkable. Hgb 13.9, Hct 41%, Plt 280k, WBC 5.5. The patient was diagnosed with a probable lacunar stroke and entered into the TOAST study (Trial of ORG10172[a low molecular weight heparin] in Acute Stroke Treatment). Carotid Duplex: 16-49%RICA and 0-15%LICA stenosis with anterograde vertebral artery flow, bilaterally. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed mild mitral regurgitation, mild tricuspid regurgitation and a left to right shunt. There was no evidence of blood clot. Hospital course: 5 days after admission the patient began to complain of proximal LLE and left flank pain. On exam, she had weakness of the quadriceps and hip flexors of the LLE. Her pain increased with left hip flexion. In addition, she complained of paresthesias about the lateral aspect of the medial anterior left thigh; and upon on sensory testing, she had decreased PP/TEMP sensation in a left femoral nerve distribution. She denied any back/neck pain and the rest of her neurologic exam remained unchanged from admission. Abdominal CT Scan, 2/4/96, revealed a large left retroperitoneal iliopsoas hematoma. Hgb 8.9g/dl. She was transfused with 4 units of pRBCs. She underwent surgical decompression and evacuation of the hematoma via a posterior flank approach on 2/6/96. Her postoperative course was uncomplicated. She was discharged home on ASA. At follow-up, on 2/23/96, she complained of left sided paresthesias (worse in the LLE than in the LUE) and feeling of &quot;swollen left foot.&quot; These symptoms had developed approximately 1 month after her stroke. Her foot looked normal and her UE strength was 5/4+ proximally and distally, and LE strength 5/4+ proximally and 5/5- distally. She was ambulatory. There was no evidence of LUE upward drift. A somatosensory evoked potential study revealed an absent N20 and normal P14 potentials. This was suggestive of a lesion involving the right thalamus which might explain her paresthesia/dysesthesia as part of a Dejerine-Roussy syndrome."
297,Neurology," Thank you very much for asking me to see this very interesting and pleasant woman for neurological evaluation with regards to a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. She is present in the company of her husband. As you know, the patient is a 50-year-old right-handed Caucasian female, who works as an independent contractor and as a human resources consultant. Her neurological history first begins in December of 1987, when she had a rather sudden onset of slurred speech and the hesitancy when she started to walk. She had HMO insurance at that time and saw a neurologist, whose name she does not recall. She thinks that she underwent MRI scan of the brain and possibly visual evoked response and brainstem auditory evoked response tests. She was told that all the tests were normal and no diagnosis was made. The slurred speech resolved after a few weeks, but her gait hesitancy persisted for a number of years and then finally partially improved. She also began to note that she would fatigue after very prolonged walking. In about 1993, she developed bladder urgency and frequency along with some nocturia. She saw a urologist and underwent urodynamic testing. She was diagnosed as having &quot;overactive bladder&quot;, but the cause of this was never determined. She was treated with medications, possibly Ditropan, without much benefit. She also developed a dry mouth from the medication and so she discontinued it. Also in about 1993, she began to note an uncomfortable &quot;stiffness&quot; in her feet and slight swelling of the ankles. Apparently, the swelling was not visible by others. She saw multiple physicians and was told that it was &quot;not arthritis&quot;, but no definite diagnosis was ever established. She saw at least two rheumatologists on several occasions and blood tests were all normal. No clear-cut diagnosis was ever made and the patient simply learned to live with these symptoms. However, over time she noted that the symptoms in her legs seemed to worsen somewhat. She states from time-to-time she could &quot;barely walk&quot;. She felt as if her balance is impaired and she felt as if she were &quot;walking on stilts&quot;. She tried arch supports from a podiatrist without any benefit. She began to tire more easily when walking. In 2002 she was seen by a podiatrist, who noticed an abnormal gait and recommended that she see a neurologist. In the fall of 2002, she was seen by Dr. X. He ordered an MRI scan of her brain and lumbar spine. He also did some sort of nerve testing and possibly visual evoked response testing. After reviewing everything, he diagnosed multiple sclerosis. However, prior to starting her on immunomodulatory therapy, he referred her for a second opinion to Dr. Y, in January of 2003. Dr. Y confirmed the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. The patient then returned to Dr. X and was started on Avonex. She continued on it for about six months. However, it made her feel much more stiff and delayed and so she finally stopped it. She also recalled being tried on baclofen by Dr. X, but again it did not benefit her and made her feel slightly dizzy. So, she discontinued it also. At that point in time, she decided to try a program of &quot;good nutrition, vitamin supplements, and fish oil&quot;. In December 2004 and extending up to February 2005, she began to note progressively more severe swelling and stiffness in the distal lower extremities. She began to have to use a cane. She was seen in neurological consultation by Dr. Z. She was treated with a Medrol Dosepak. Her spasticity and swelling seemed to improve dramatically. However, within about two weeks symptoms were back to baseline. She was then treated with intravenous Solu-Medrol 500 mg daily for five days followed by a prednisone or Medrol taper (July 2005). This seemed to be less helpful than the oral steroids, but was partially beneficial. However, it wore off once again. A repeat MRI scan of the brain in April 2005 was said to &quot;look better&quot;. She was started on Zanaflex for her lower extremity spasticity without benefit. Finally six days ago, she was restarted on oral prednisone 10 mg tablets. She takes one-half tablet daily and this again has seemed to reduce the swelling and stiffness in her legs. She continues on the prednisone in the same dosage for relief of the spasticity. She has not been on any other immunomodulatory agents. The patient does note some complaints of mild heat sensitivity and mild easy fatigability. There is no history of diplopia, dysarthria, aphasia, focal weakness, numbness, paresthesias, cognitive dysfunction, or memory dysfunction. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Essentially noncontributory. ALLERGIES: The patient is allergic to LOBSTER and VICODIN. She feels that she is probably allergic to IODINE. SOCIAL HISTORY: She does not smoke. She takes one glass of wine per day. PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: She has not had any prior surgeries. Her general health has been excellent except for the above-indicated problems. REVIEW OF OUTSIDE RADIOLOGICAL STUDIES: The patient brought with her today MRI scans of the brain, thoracic spine, and lumbosacral spine performed on 11/14/02 on a 1.5-Tesla magnet. There are numerous T2 hyperintense lesions in the periventricular and subcortical white matter of the brain and at least one lesion is in the corpus callosum. There appear to be Dawson's fingers. The MRI of the thoracic and lumbosacral spines did not reveal any significant abnormalities. Also available are the MRI scans of the brain, cervical spine, thoracic spine, and lumbosacral spine performed on a 0.35-Tesla magnet on 04/22/05. The MRI of the brain shows that one of the prior lesions has resolved and there appear to be one or two more lesions. However, the quality of the newer scan is only 0.35-Tesla and is suboptimal. Visualization of the cord is also suboptimal, but there are no clear-cut extraaxial or complexities of the spinal cord. It is difficult to be certain that there are no intra-axial lesions, but I could not clearly see one. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital signs: Blood pressure 151/88, pulse 92, temperature 99.5&ordm;F, and weight 124 lb (dressed). General: Well-developed, well-nourished female in no acute distress.

There are bilateral Achilles' contractures more so on the left than the right and also a slight left knee flexion contracture. Strength in the lower extremities is rated as follows on a 5-point scale (right/left): Iliopsoas 4+/5-, quadriceps 5-/5-, tibialis anterior 4+/4+, and gastrocnemius 5/5. There are no tremors, fasciculations or abnormal involuntary movements. Reflexes (right/left): Biceps 3/3, triceps 3/3, brachioradialis 3/3, knee jerk 4/4, and ankle jerk 4/0. Plantar responses are extensor bilaterally. No pathological reflexes. Coordination: Finger-nose-finger testing and rapid alternating movements appear to be normal in both upper extremities. The lower extremities could not be adequately tested because of spasticity and weakness. Gait: The patient has a spastic and slightly broad based gait. She is able to walk without support. After walking for a period of time, she is finally able to get her left foot down flat, but tends to walk on the left toes. Station: Romberg testing with the eyes open is normal. With the eyes closed, there is slight unsteadiness and she actually fell on one occasion, but was able to catch herself. Sensation: Intact to pinprick, light touch, vibration and position sense throughout. Normal stereognosis, graphesthesia, and double simultaneous stimulation DIAGNOSTIC IMPRESSION: Multiple sclerosis, ? secondary progressive versus relapsing/remitting. CASE DISCUSSION: Thank you once again for allowing me to participate in the care of this very interesting lady. Based on review of her history and her current MRI scans, she seems to suffer from multiple sclerosis. She indicated that there was a slow progression of her disease from December 2004 to February 2005 and perhaps beyond that. She also indicated that she has some improvement with oral steroids and to a lesser extent with IV steroids. However, she keeps slipping back. Overall however, she thinks that she is better now than she was several months ago suggesting that this may have been a slow exacerbation rather than actual progression of her MS. At this point in time, she appears to be confusing symptom treatment with treatment of her multiple sclerosis. Steroids can relieve spasticity in selected patients. However, they are not good long-term choices because of the obvious side effects that we see with long-term use of steroids. So, although she has benefit from the current prednisone dosage, I feel it would be more appropriate to try and find something else to help her with her spasticity. She is unable to tolerate Zanaflex and baclofen because of sedation. I have recommended a trial of Neurontin beginning at 100 mg b.i.d. or t.i.d. and gradually increasing as needed up to 300 mg b.i.d. or t.i.d. Additional increases may be necessary depending on how she does with these lower doses. Some patients may take as high as 1000-1500 mg three to four times daily. If the Neurontin cannot be tolerated or it does not bring about any relief of her spasticity, I would consider Klonopin 0.25 mg-1 mg t.i.d. or q.i.d. or Valium 5-10 mg t.i.d. or q.i.d. If these are not helpful or if there are intolerable side effects, she should be considered for baclofen pump. I spent a lot of time discussing with her baclofen pump, as she was unfamiliar with it, although she has initially and understandably opposed to this treatment, she may well require this treatment in the future in order to allow her to ambulate adequately. With the baclofen pump in place, the patient should have good relief of spasticity and be able to exercise her legs strongly. It is not clear to me whether she is actually having secondary progressive MS or relapsing/remitting MS. I feel it would be appropriate to start her on immunomodulatory therapy. Since interferon made her spasticity worse, I would recommend a trial of Copaxone. I would also obtain an annual MRI scan of the brain; however, this should be accomplished with a high-field strength magnet (1.5-Tesla or greater). If she has worsening of her clinical condition or should her MRI show continued worsening, I would recommend consideration of adding methotrexate or CellCept to her regimen. She may also be a candidate for Tysabri if it returns to the market place in the next few months. She is currently not much troubled by her bladder symptoms and so I do not think she needs any particular treatment for this problem currently. However, should her symptoms worsen in the future, urological consultation by a physician familiar with neurogenic bladder would be helpful. Finally, I feel that she will benefit from some physical therapy. I have recommended physical therapy evaluation and treatment three times weekly for six weeks. The patient currently has HMO insurance and I recommended that she followup here on an as needed basis. She should followup with you for her regularly scheduled medical appointments. The patient indicates that she may be moving to Tulsa, Oklahoma in the near future and I gave her the names of two MS physicians in Dallas, which is apparently only about a two-hour ride away. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions about her case."
298,Neurology," HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient comes in today because of feeling lightheaded and difficulty keeping his balance. He denies this as a spinning sensation that he had had in the past with vertigo. He just describes as feeling very lightheaded. It usually occurs with position changes such as when he stands up from the sitting position or stands up from a lying position. It tends to ease when he sits down again, but does not totally resolve for another 15 to 30 minutes and he feels shaky and weak all over. Lorazepam did not help this sensation. His blood pressure has been up lately and his dose of metoprolol was increased. They feel these symptoms have gotten worse since metoprolol was increased. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Detailed on our H&P form. Positive for elevated cholesterol, diabetes, glaucoma, cataracts, hypertension, heart disease, vertigo, stroke in May of 2005, congestive heart failure, CABG, and cataract removed right eye. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Detailed on the H&P form. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: His blood pressure sitting down was 180/80 with a pulse rate of 56. Standing up blood pressure was 160/80 with a pulse rate of 56. His general exam and neurological exam were detailed on our H&P form. Pertinent positives on his neurological exam were decreased sensation in his left face, and left arm and leg. IMPRESSION AND PLAN: This lightheaded, he exquisitely denies vertigo, the vertigo that he has had in the past. He states this is more of a lightheaded type feeling. He did have a mild blood pressure drop here in the office. We are also concerned that bradycardia might be contributing to his feeling of lightheadedness. We are going to suggest that he gets a Holter monitor and he should speak to his general practitioner as well as his cardiologist regarding the lightheaded feeling. We will schedule him for the Holter monitor and refer him back to his cardiologist."
299,Neurology," HISTORY: The patient is a 46-year-old right-handed gentleman with a past medical history of a left L5-S1 lumbar microdiskectomy in 1998 with complete resolution of left leg symptoms, who now presents with a four-month history of gradual onset of right-sided low back pain with pain radiating down into his buttock and posterior aspect of his right leg into the ankle. Symptoms are worsened by any activity and relieved by rest. He also feels that when the pain is very severe, he has some subtle right leg weakness. No left leg symptoms. No bowel or bladder changes. On brief examination, full strength in both lower extremities. No sensory abnormalities. Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ and symmetric at the patellas and absent at both ankles. Positive straight leg raising on the right. MRI of the lumbosacral spine was personally reviewed and reveals a right paracentral disc at L5-S1 encroaching upon the right exiting S1 nerve root. NERVE CONDUCTION STUDIES: Motor and sensory distal latencies, evoked response amplitudes, and conduction velocities are normal in the lower extremities. The right common peroneal F-wave is minimally prolonged. The right tibial H reflex is absent. NEEDLE EMG: Needle EMG was performed on the right leg, left gastrocnemius medialis muscle, and right lumbosacral paraspinal muscles using a disposable concentric needle. It revealed spontaneous activity in the right gastrocnemius medialis, gluteus maximus, and lower lumbosacral paraspinal muscles. There was evidence of chronic denervation in right gastrocnemius medialis and gluteus maximus muscles. IMPRESSION: This electrical study is abnormal. It reveals an acute right S1 radiculopathy. There is no evidence for peripheral neuropathy or left or right L5 radiculopathy. Results were discussed with the patient and he is scheduled to follow up with Dr. X in the near future."
300,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Ganglion of the left wrist. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Ganglion of the left wrist. OPERATION: Excision of ganglion. ANESTHESIA: General. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Less than 5 mL. OPERATION: After a successful anesthetic, the patient was positioned on the operating table. A tourniquet applied to the upper arm. The extremity was prepped in a usual manner for a surgical procedure and draped off. The superficial vessels were exsanguinated with an elastic wrap and the tourniquet was then inflated to the usual arm pressure. A curved incision was made over the presenting ganglion over the dorsal aspect of the wrist. By blunt and sharp dissection, it was dissected out from underneath the extensor tendons and the stalk appeared to arise from the distal radiocapitellar joint and the dorsal capsule was excised along with the ganglion and the specimen was removed and submitted. The small superficial vessels were electrocoagulated and instilled after closing the skin with 4-0 Prolene, into the area was approximately 6 to 7 mL of 0.25 Marcaine with epinephrine. A Jackson-Pratt drain was inserted and then after the tourniquet was released, it was kept deflated until at least 5 to 10 minutes had passed and then it was activated and then removed in the recovery room. The dressings applied to the hand were that of Xeroform, 4x4s, ABD, Kerlix, and elastic wrap over a volar fiberglass splint. The tourniquet was released. Circulation returned to the fingers. The patient then was allowed to awaken and left the operating room in good condition."
301,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Cervical myelopathy, C3-4, secondary to stenosis from herniated nucleus pulposus, C3-4. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Cervical myelopathy, C3-4, secondary to stenosis from herniated nucleus pulposus, C3-4. OPERATIVE PROCEDURES 1. Anterior cervical discectomy with decompression, C3-4. 2. Arthrodesis with anterior interbody fusion, C3-4. 3. Spinal instrumentation using Pioneer 18-mm plate and four 14 x 4.3 mm screws (all titanium). 4. Implant using PEEK 7 mm. 5. Allograft using Vitoss. DRAINS: Round French 10 JP drain. FLUIDS: 1800 mL of crystalloids. URINE OUTPUT: 1000 mL. SPECIMENS: None. COMPLICATIONS: None. ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal anesthesia. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Less than 100 mL. CONDITION: To postanesthesia care unit extubated with stable vital signs. INDICATIONS FOR THE OPERATION: This is a case of a very pleasant 32-year-old Caucasian male who had been experiencing posterior neck discomfort and was shooting basketball last week, during which time he felt a pop. Since then, the patient started complaining of acute right arm and right leg weakness, which had been progressively worsening. About two days ago, he started noticing weakness on the left arm. The patient also noted shuffling gait. The patient presented to a family physician and was referred to Dr. X for further evaluation. Dr. X could not attempt to this, so he called me at the office and the patient was sent to the emergency room, where an MRI of the brain was essentially unremarkable as well as MRI of the thoracic spine. MRI of the cervical spine, however, revealed an acute disk herniation at C3-C4 with evidence of stenosis and cord changes. Based on these findings, I recommended decompression. The patient was started on Decadron at 10 mg IV q.6h. Operation, expected outcome, risks, and benefits were discussed with him. Risks to include but not exclusive of bleeding and infection. Bleeding can be superficial, but can compromise airway, for which he has been told that he may be brought emergently back to the operating room for evacuation of said hematoma. The hematoma could also be an epidural hematoma, which may compress the spinal cord and result in weakness of all four extremities, numbness of all four extremities, and impairment of bowel and bladder function. Should this happen, he needs to be brought emergently back to the operating room for evacuation of said hematoma. There is also the risk by removing the hematoma that he can deteriorate as far as neurological condition, but this hopefully with the steroid prep will be prevented or if present will only be transient. There is also the possibility of infection, which can be superficial and treated with IV and p.o. antibiotics. However, should the infection be extensive or be deep, he may require return to the operating room for debridement and irrigation. This may pose a medical problem since in the presence of infection, the graft as well as spinal instrumentation may have to be removed. There is also the possibility of dural tear with its attendant complaints of headache, nausea, vomiting, photophobia, as well as the development of pseudomeningocele. This too can compromise airway and may require return to the operating room for repair of the dural tear. There is also potential risk of injury to the esophagus, the trachea, as well as the carotid. The patient can also have a stroke on the right cerebral circulation should the plaque be propelled into the right circulation. The patient understood all these risks together with the risk associated with anesthesia and agreed to have the procedure performed. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the operating room, awake, alert and not in any form of distress. After smooth induction and intubation, a Foley catheter was inserted. No monitoring leads were placed. The patient was then positioned supine on the operating table with the head supported on a foam doughnut and the neck placed on hyperextension with a shoulder roll under both shoulders. Localizing x-ray verified the marker to be right at the C3-4 interspace. Proceeded to mark an incision along the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid with the central point at the area of the marker measuring about 3 cm in length. The area was then prepped with DuraPrep. After sterile drapes were laid out, an incision was made using a scalpel blade #10. Wound edge bleeders were controlled with bipolar coagulation and a hot knife was utilized to cut the platysma in a similar fashion. The anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid was identified and dissection was carried superior to and lateral to the esophagus and trachea, but medial to the carotid sheath. The prevertebral fascia was identified. Localizing x-ray verified another marker to be at the C3-4 interspace. Proceeded to strip the longus colli muscles off the vertebral body of C3 and C4 and a self-retaining retractor was then laid out. There was some degree of anterior osteophyte and this was carefully drilled down with a Midas 5-mm bur. The disk was then cut through the annulus and removal of the disk was done with the use of the Midas 5-mm bur and later a 3-mm bur. The inferior endplate of C3 and the superior endplate of C4 were likewise drilled out together with posterior inferior osteophyte at the C3 and the posterior superior osteophyte at C4. There was note of a central disk herniation centrally, but more marked displacement of the cord on the left side. By careful dissection of this disk, posterior longitudinal ligament was removed and pressure on the cord was removed. Hemostasis of the epidural bleeders was done with a combination of bipolar coagulation, but we needed to put a small piece of Gelfoam on the patient's left because of profuse venous bleeder. With this completed, the Valsalva maneuver showed no evidence of any CSF leakage. A 7-mm implant with its interior packed with Vitoss was then tapped into place. An 18-mm plate was then screwed down with four 14 x 4.0 mm screws. The area was irrigated with saline, with bacitracin solution. Postoperative x-ray showed excellent placement of the graft and spinal instrumentation. A round French 10 JP drain was laid over the construct and exteriorized though a separate stab incision on the patient's right inferiorly. The wound was then closed in layers with Vicryl 3-0 inverted interrupted sutures for the platysma, Vicryl 4-0 subcuticular stitch for the dermis and Dermabond. The catheter was anchored to the skin with a nylon 3-0 stitch. Dressing was placed only on the exit site of the drain. C-collar was placed, and the patient was transferred to the recovery awake and moving all four extremities."
302,Orthopedic," HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 57-year-old female being seen today for evaluation of pain and symptoms related to a recurrent bunion deformity in bilateral feet, right greater than left. The patient states she is having increasing symptoms of pain and discomfort associated with recurrence of bunion deformity on the right foot and pain localized to the second toe and MTP joint of the right foot as well. The patient had prior surgery performed approximately 13 years ago. She states that since the time of the original surgery the deformity has slowly recurred, and she has noticed progressive deformity in the lesser toes at the second and third toes of the left foot and involving the second toe of the right foot. The patient is employed on her feet as a hospital employee and states that she does wear a functional orthotic which does provide some relief of forefoot pain although not complete. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY, FAMILY HISTORY, SOCIAL HISTORY & REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: See Patient History sheet, which was reviewed with the patient and is signed in the chart. Past medical history on the patient, past surgical history, current medications, drug-related allergies and social history have all been updated and reviewed, and enclosed in the chart. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Physical exam reveals a pleasant, 57-year-old female who is 5 feet 4 inches and 150 pounds. She has palpable pulses. Neurologic sensation is intact. Examination of the extremities shows the patient as having well-healed surgical sites from her arthroplasty, second digits bilaterally and prior bunionectomy. There is a recurrence of bunion deformity noted on both great toes although the patient notes to have reasonably good range of movement. She has particular pain in the second MTP joint of the right foot and demonstrates a mild claw-toe deformity of the second and third toes to the left foot, and to a lesser degree the second toe to the right. Gait analysis: The patient stands and walks with a rather severe pes planus and has generalized hypermobility noted in the feet. X-RAY INTERPRETATION: X-rays taken today; three views to the right foot shows presence of internal K-wire and wire from prior bunionectomy. Biomechanical analysis shows 15 degree intermetatarsal angle and approximately 45 degree hallux abducto valgus angle. No evidence of arthrosis in the joint is noted. Significant shift to the fibular sesamoid is present. ASSESSMENT: 1. Recurrent bunion deformity, right forefoot. 2. Pes planovalgus deformity, bilateral feet. PLAN/TREATMENT: 1. Today, we did review remaining treatment options with the patient including the feasibility of conservative versus surgical treatment. The patient would require an open wedge osteotomy to reduce the intermetatarsal angle with the lateral release and a decompression osteotomy at the second metatarsal. Anticipated length of healing was noted for the patient as were potential risks and complications. The patient ultimately would probably require surgery on her left foot at a later date as well. 2. The patient will explore her ability to get out of work for the above-mentioned period of time and will be in touch with regards regarding scheduling at a later date. 3. All questions were answered."
303,Orthopedic," CHIEF COMPLAINT: Decreased ability to perform daily living activities secondary to right knee surgery. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 61-year-old white female status post right total knee replacement secondary to degenerative joint disease performed by Dr. A at ABCD Hospital on 08/21/2007. The patient was transfused with 2 units of autologous blood postoperatively. She received DVT prophylaxis with a combination of Coumadin, Lovenox, SCD boots, and TED stockings. The remainder of her postoperative course was uneventful. She was discharged on 08/24/2007 from ABCD Hospital and admitted to the transitional care unit at XYZ Services for evaluation and rehabilitation. The patient reports that her last bowel movement was on 08/24/2007 just prior to her discharge from ABCD Hospital. She denies any urological symptoms such as dysuria, incomplete bladder emptying or other voiding difficulties. She reports having some right knee pain, which is most intense at a &quot;certain position.&quot; The patient is unable to elaborate on which &quot;certain position&quot; causes her the most discomfort. ALLERGIES: NKDA. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hypertension, hypothyroidism, degenerative joint disease, GERD, anxiety disorder, Morton neuroma of her feet bilaterally, and distant history of migraine headaches some 30 years ago. MEDICATIONS: On transfer, Celebrex, Coumadin, Colace, Synthroid, Lovenox, Percocet, Toprol XL, niacin, and trazodone. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Temperature 96.5, blood pressure 127/72, pulse 70, respiratory rate 20, 95% O2 saturation on room air. GENERAL: No acute distress at the time of the exam except as mentioned above complains of right knee pain at &quot;certain position.&quot; HEENT: Normocephalic. Sclerae nonicteric. EOMI. Dentition in good repair. Tongue is in midline with no evidence of thrush. NECK: No thyroid enlargement. Trachea is midline. LUNGS: Clear to auscultation. HEART: Regular rate and rhythm. Normal S1 and S2. ABDOMEN: Soft, nontender, and nondistended. No organomegaly. EXTREMITIES: The right knee incision is intact. Steri-Strips are in place. There is some diffuse right knee edema and some limited ecchymosis as well. No calf tenderness bilaterally. Pedal pulses are palpable bilaterally. MENTAL STATUS: The patient appears slightly anxious during the interview and exam, but she was alert and oriented. HOSPITAL COURSE: As mentioned above, the patient was admitted on 08/24/2007 to the Transitional Care Unit at XYZ Services for evaluation and rehabilitation. She was seen in consultation by Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy and had begun her rehabilitation till recovery. The patient had been properly instructed regarding using the CPM machine and she had been instructed as well to limit each CPM session to two hours. Very early in her hospitalization, the patient enthusiastically used the CPM much longer than two hours and consequently had increased right knee pain. She remarked that she had a better degree of flexibility, but she did report an increased need for pain management. Additionally, she required Ativan and at one point scheduled the doses of Ativan to treat her known history of anxiety disorder. On the fourth hospital day, she was noted to have some rashes about the right upper extremity and right side of her abdomen. The patient reported that this rash was itchy. She reports that she had been doing quite a bit of gardening just prior to surgery and this was most likely contact dermatitis, most likely due to her gardening activities preoperatively. She was treated with betamethasone cream applied to the rash b.i.d. The patient's therapy had progressed and she continued to make a good progress. At one point, the patient reported some insomnia due to right knee pain. She was switched from Percocet to oxycodone SR 20 mg b.i.d. and she had good pain control with this using the Percocet only for breakthrough pain. The DVT prophylaxis was maintained with Lovenox 40 mg subcu daily until the INR was greater than 1.7 and it was discontinued on 08/30/2007 when the INR was 1.92 within therapeutic range. The Coumadin was adjusted accordingly according to the INRs during her hospital course. Early in the hospital course, the patient had reported right calf tenderness and a venous Doppler study obtained on 08/27/2007 showed no DVT bilaterally. Initial laboratory data includes a UA on 08/28/2007, which was negative. Additionally, CBC showed a white count of 6.3, hemoglobin was 12.1, hematocrit was 35.3, and platelets were 278,000. Chemistries were within normal limits. Creatinine was 0.8, BUN was 8, anion gap was slightly decreased at 5, fasting glucose was 102. The remainder of chemistries was unremarkable. The patient continued to make great progress with her therapies so much so that we are anticipating her discharge on Monday, 09/03/2007. DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: 1. Status post right total knee replacement secondary to degenerative joint disease performed on 08/21/2007. 2. Anxiety disorder. 3. Insomnia secondary to pain and anxiety postoperatively. 4. Postoperative constipation. 5. Contact dermatitis secondary to preoperative gardening activities. 6. Hypertension. 7. Hypothyroidism. 8. Gastroesophageal reflux disease. 9. Morton neuroma of the feet bilaterally. 10. Distant history of migraine headaches. INSTRUCTIONS GIVEN TO THE PATIENT AT THE TIME OF DISCHARGE: The patient is advised to continue taking the following medications: Celebrex 200 mg daily, for one month, Colace 100 mg b.i.d. for one month, Protonix 40 mg b.i.d. for one month, Synthroid 137 mcg daily, Diprosone cream 0.05% cream b.i.d. to the right arm and right abdomen, oxycodone SR 20 mg p.o. q.12h. for five days, then decrease to oxycodone SR 10 mg p.o. q.12h. for five days, Percocet 5/325 mg one to two tablets q.6h. to be used p.r.n. for breakthrough pain, trazodone 50 mg p.o. at bedtime p.r.n. for two weeks, Ativan 0.25 mg b.i.d. for two weeks, and Toprol-XL 50 mg daily. The patient will also take Coumadin and the dose will be adjusted according to the INRs, which will be obtained every Monday and Thursday with results being sent to Dr. A and his fax number is 831-5926. At the present time, the patient is taking Coumadin 7 mg daily. She will remain on Coumadin for 30 days. An INR is to be obtained on 09/03/2007 and should the Coumadin dose be changed, an addendum will be dictated to accompany this discharge summary. Finally, the patient has a followup appointment with Dr. A on 09/21/2007 at noon at his office. The patient is encouraged to follow up with her primary care physician, Dr. B. As mentioned above, the patient will be discharged on 09/03/2007 in stable and improved condition since she is status post right total knee replacement and has made good progress with her therapies and rehabilitation."
304,Orthopedic," HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Patient is a 50-year-old white male complaining of continued lower back pain. Patient has a history of chronic back pain, dating back to an accident that he states he suffered two years ago. He states he helped a friend unload a motorcycle from a vehicle two-and-a-half days ago, after which he &quot;felt it&quot; in his lower back. The following day (two days ago), he states he rode to Massachusetts and Maine to pick up clients. He feels that this aggravated his chronic back pain as well. He also claims to have a screw in his right hip from a previous surgery to repair a pelvic fracture. He is being prescribed Ultram, Celebrex, gabapentin, and amitriptyline by his PCP for his chronic back pain. He states that his PCP has informed him that he does not prescribe opiate medications for chronic back pain. The patient did self-refer to another physician, who suggested that he follow up at a pain clinic for his chronic back pain to discuss other alternatives, particularly the medications that the patient feels that he needs. Patient states he did not do this because he was feeling well at that time. The patient did present to our emergency room last night, at which time he saw Dr. X. He was given a prescription for 12 Vicodin as well as some to take home last night. The patient has not picked up his prescription as of yet and informed the triage nurse that he was concerned that he would not have enough to last through the weekend. Patient states he also has methadone and Darvocet at home from previous prescription and is wondering if he should restart these medicines. He is on several medications, the list of which is attached to the chart. MEDICATIONS: In addition to the aforementioned medications, he is on Cymbalta, pantoprazole, and a multivitamin. ALLERGIES: HE IS ALLERGIC TO RELAFEN (ITCHING). SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is married and lives with his wife. Nursing notes were reviewed with which I agree. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION VITAL SIGNS: Pulse is elevated at 105. Temp and other vitals signs are all within normal limits. GENERAL: Patient is a middle-aged white male who is sitting on the stretcher in no acute distress. BACK: Exam of the back shows some generalized tenderness on palpation of the musculature surrounding the lumbar spine, more so on the right than on the left. There is a well-healed upper lumbar incision from his previous L1-L2 fusion. There is no erythema, ecchymosis, or soft-tissue swelling. Mobility is generally very good without obvious signs of discomfort. HEART: Regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, rubs, or gallops. LUNGS: Clear without rales, rhonchi, or wheezes. MUSCULOSKELETAL: With the patient supine, there is some discomfort in the lower back with bent-knee flexion of both hips as well as with straight leg abduction of the left leg. There is some mild discomfort on internal and external rotation of the hips as well. DTRs are 1+ at the knees and trace at the ankles. I explained to the patient that he is suffering from a chronic condition and as his PCP has made it clear that he is unwilling to prescribe opiate medication, which the patient feels that he needs, and he is obligated to follow up at the pain clinic as suggested by the other physician even if he is having a &quot;good day.&quot; I explained to him that if he did not investigate other alternatives to what his PCP is willing to prescribe, then on a &quot;bad day,&quot; he will have nowhere else to turn. I explained to him that some emergency physicians do chose to use opiates for a short term as Dr. X did last night. It is unclear if the patient is looking for a different opiate medication, but I do not think it is wise to give him more, particularly as he has not even filled the prescription that was given to him last night. I did suggest that he not restart his methadone and Darvocet at this time as he is already on five different medications for his back (Celebrex, tramadol, amitriptyline, gabapentin, and the Vicodin that he was given last night). I did suggest that we could try a different anti-inflammatory if he felt that the Celebrex is not helping. The patient is agreeable to this. ASSESSMENT 1. Lumbar muscle strain. 2. Chronic back pain. PLAN: At this point in time, I felt that it was safe for the patient to transition to heat to his back which he may use as often as possible. Rx for Voltaren 75 mg tabs, dispensed 20, sig. one p.o. q.12h. for pain instead of Celebrex. He may continue with his other medications as directed but not the methadone or Darvocet. I did urge him to reschedule his pain clinic appointment as he was urged to do originally. If unimproved this week, he should follow up with Dr. Y."
305,Orthopedic," PRE-OP DIAGNOSIS: Osteoporosis, pathologic fractures T12- L2 with severe kyphosis. POST-OP DIAGNOSIS: Osteoporosis, pathologic fractures T12- L2 with severe kyphosis. PROCEDURE: 1. KYPHON Balloon Kyphoplasty at T12 and L1evels Insertion of KYPHON HV-R bone cement under low pressure at T12 and L1 levels. 2. Bone biopsy (medically necessary). ANESTHESIA: General COMPLICATIONS: None BLOOD LOSS: Minimal INDICATIONS: Mrs. Smith is a 75-year-old female who has had severe back pain that began approximately three months ago and is debilitating. She has been unresponsive to nonoperative treatment modalities including bed rest and analgesics. She presents with and is on medication therapy for COPD, diabetes and hypertension (other co-morbidities may be present upon admission and should be documented in the operative note). Radiographic imaging including MRI confirms multiple compression fractures of the thoracolumbar spine including T12, L1 and L2. In addition to the fractures, she presents with kyphotic posture. Films on 1/04 demonstrated L1 and L2 osteoporotic fractures. Films on 2/04 demonstrated increased loss of height at L1. Films on 3/04 demonstrated a new compression fracture at T12 and further collapse of L1. The L2 fracture is documented on radiographic studies as being chronic and a year or more old. The T12 fracture has the most significant kyphotic deformity. Based on these findings, we have decided to perform KYPHON Balloon Kyphoplasty on the L1 and T12 fractures. PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the operating room/radiology suite and general anesthesia/local sedation with endotracheal intubation was performed. The patient was positioned prone on the Jackson table. The back was prepped and draped. The image intensifier (C-arm) was brought into position and the T12 pedicles were identified and marked with a skin marker. In view of the collapse of T12, a transpedicular approach to the vertebral body was appropriate. An 11-gauge needle was advanced through the T12 pedicle to the junction of the pedicle and vertebral body on the right side. Positioning was confirmed on the AP and lateral plane. Following satisfactory placement of the needle, the stylet was removed. A guide pin was inserted through the 11g to a point 3mm from the anterior cortex. AP and lateral images were taken to verify position and trajectory. Alongside of the guide pin a 1-cm paramedian incision was made. The needle was then removed leaving the guide pin in place. The osteointroducer was placed over the guide pin and advanced through the pedicle. Once I was at the junction of the pedicle and the vertebral body, a lateral image was taken to insure that the cannula was positioned approximately 1cm past the vertebral body wall. Through the cannula, a drill was advanced into the vertebral body under fluoroscopic guidance toward the anterior cortex, creating a channel. The anterior cortex was probed with the guide pin to ensure no perforations in the anterior cortex. After completing the entry into the vertebral body, a 15 mm inflatable bone tamp was inserted through the cannula and advanced under fluoroscopic guidance into the vertebral body near the anterior cortex. The radiopaque marker bands on the bone tamp were identified using AP and lateral images. The above sequence of instrument placement was then repeated on the left side of the T12 vertebral body. Once both bone tamps were in position, they were inflated to 0.5 cc and 50 psi. Expansion of the bone tamps was done sequentially in increments of 0.25 to 0.5 cc of contrast, with careful attention being paid to the inflation pressures and balloon position. The inflation was monitored with AP and lateral imaging. The final balloon volume was 3.5 cc on the right side and 3 cc on the left. There was no breach of the lateral wall or anterior cortex of the vertebral body. Direct reduction of the fracture was achieved, end plate movement was noted and approximately 5 mm of height restoration was achieved. Under fluoroscopic imaging, and the use of the bone void fillers, internal fixation was achieved through a low-pressure injection of KYPHON HV-R bone cement. The cavity was filled with a total volume of 3.5 cc on the right side and 3 cc on the left side. Once the bone cement had hardened, the cannulas were then removed. At this time, we proceeded to perform a balloon kyphoplasty at L1 using the same sequence of steps as on T12. An entry needle was placed bilaterally through the pedicle into the vertebral body, a cortical window was created, inflation of the bone tamps directly reduced the fracture, the bone tamps were removed, and internal fixation by bone void filler insertion was achieved. Throughout the procedure, AP and lateral imaging monitored positioning. Post-procedure, all incisions were closed with sutures. The patient was kept in the prone position for approximately 10 minutes post cement injection. She was then turned supine, monitored briefly and returned to the floor. She was moving both her lower extremities at this time. Throughout the procedure, there were no intraoperative complications. Estimated blood loss was minimal."

Anterior cervical instrumentation at C5-C6 for stabilization by Uniplate construction at C5-C6 (22845); with intraoperative x-ray x2. SERVICE: Neurosurgery ANESTHESIA: General. OPERATION: The patient was brought into the operating room, placed in supine position where general anesthesia was administered. Then the anterior aspect of the neck was prepped and draped in a routine sterile fashion. A linear skin incision was made in the skin fold line from just to the right of the midline to the leaning edge of the right sternocleidomastoid muscle and taken sharply to platysma, which was dissected with only blunt dissection. With only blunt dissection, the prevertebral space was encountered and longus colli muscle was cauterized along the mesial border and self-retaining retractors were placed to protect surrounding tissues throughout the remainder of the case. An intraoperative x-ray confirmed the interspace at C5-C6, C4-C5, and C6-C7 with prominent anterior osteophytes removed at C5-C6 noting particular disc collapse and far worsening spondylosis at C5-C6 than anywhere else in the neck. The annulus was cauterized and sharply excised and a discectomy followed with removing degenerated fragments of discs, which were sent to Pathology for permanent section in a routine fashion with straight disc forceps as needed, with residual discs drilled away as drilling extended from normal cortical cancellous elements with rather osteoporotic vertebral bodies noted. Prominent osteophytes were removed on the right side far more prominently on the left side with the worst compression on the nerve roots on the left, and all these were decompressed widely laterally bilaterally to completely decompress the dura, and the ligament as well, performed with a 1 and 2 mm micro Kerrison rongeur as necessary. The dura bulged into the interspace, a sign of a decompressed status finally and the entire area was inspected and at no time during the case there was evidence of CSF leakage of any type. The wound was irrigated with antibiotic solution and an appropriate size Bengal cage was filled with the patient's own bone elements and countersunk into position and was quite tightly applied. Further stability was added regardless with an appropriate size Uniplate with appropriate size screws and a post placement x-ray showed well-aligned elements and satisfactory postioning. After further inspection, the wound was irrigated with antibiotic solution again and closed in a routine fashion with approximation of the platysma with interrupted #3-0 Vicryl and the skin with a subcuticular stitch of #4-0 Vicryl reinforced with Steri-Strips. A Penrose drain was carried from the prevertebral space externally with the skin wound and safety pin for security and incorporated later into a sterile bandage in a routine fashion. The patient was then taking from the operative room and extubated to the recovery area having left in stable condition. At the conclusion of the case, all instruments, needle, and sponge counts were accurate and correct and there were no intraoperative complications of any type."
308,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left lateral malleolus fracture. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left lateral malleolus fracture. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Open reduction and internal fixation of left lateral malleolus. ANESTHESIA: General. TOURNIQUET TIME: 59 minutes. COMPLICATIONS: None. BLOOD LOSS: Negligible. CLOSURE: 2-0 Vicryl and staples. INDICATIONS FOR SURGERY: This is a young gentleman with soccer injury to his left ankle and an x-ray showed displaced lateral malleolus fracture with widening of the mortise now for ORIF. The risks and perceivable complications of the surgeries were discussed with the patient via a translator as well as nonsurgical treatment options and this was scheduled emergently. OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: The patient was taken to the operative room where general anesthesia was successfully introduced. The right ankle was prepped and draped in standard fashion. The tourniquet was applied about the right upper thigh. An Esmarch tourniquet was used to exsanguinate the ankle. The tourniquet was insufflated to a pressure 325 mm for approximately 59 minutes. An approximately 6 inch longitudinal incision was made just over the lateral malleolus. Care was taken to spare overlying nerves and vessels. An elevator was used to expose the fracture. The fracture was freed of old hematoma and reduced with a reducing clamp. An interfragmentary cortical screw was placed of 28 mm with excellent purchase. The intraoperative image showed excellent reduction. A 5-hole semitubular plate was then contoured to the lateral malleolus and fixed with 3 cortical screws proximally and 2 cancellous screws distally. Excellent stability of fracture was achieved. Final fluoroscopy showed a reduction to be anatomic in 2 planes. The wound was irrigated with copious amounts of normal saline. Deep tissue was closed with 2-0 Vicryl. The skin was approximated with 2-0 Vicryl and closed with staples. Dry sterile dressing was applied. The patient tolerated the procedure, was awakened and taken to the recovery room in stable condition."

PREOPERATIVE NOTE: This patient is a 47-year-old male with chief complaint of severe neck pain and left upper extremity numbness and weakness. Preoperative MRI scan showed evidence of herniated nucleus pulposus at C5-C6 and C6-C7 on the left. The patient has failed epidural steroid injections. Risks and benefits of the above procedure were discussed with the patient including bleeding, infection, muscle loss, nerve damage, paralysis, and death. OPERATIVE REPORT: The patient was taken to the OR and placed in the supine position. After general endotracheal anesthesia was obtained, the patient's neck was sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion. A horizontal incision was made on the left side of the neck at the level of the C6 vertebral body. It was taken down through the subcutaneous tissues exposing the platysmus muscle. The platysmus muscle was incised along the skin incision and the deep cervical fascia was bluntly dissected down to the anterior cervical spine. An #18 gauge needle was placed in the C5-C6 interspace and the intraoperative x-ray confirmed that this was the appropriate level. Next, the longus colli muscles were resected laterally on both the right and left side, and then a complete anterior cervical discectomy was performed. The disk was very degenerated and brown in color. There was an acute disk herniation through posterior longitudinal ligament. The posterior longitudinal ligament was removed and a bilateral foraminotomy was performed. Approximately, 5 mm of the nerve root on both the right and left side was visualized. A ball-ended probe could be passed up the foramen. Bleeding was controlled with bipolar electrocautery and Surgiflo. The end plates of C5 and C6 were prepared using a high-speed burr and a 6-mm lordotic machined allograft was malleted into place. There was good bony apposition both proximally and distally. Next, attention was placed at the C6-C7 level. Again, the longus colli muscles were resected laterally and a complete anterior cervical discectomy at C6-C7 was performed. The disk was degenerated and there was acute disk herniation in the posterior longitudinal ligament on the left. The posterior longitudinal ligament was removed. A bilateral foraminotomy was performed. Approximately, 5 mm of the C7 nerve root was visualized on both sides. A micro nerve hook was able to be passed up the foramen easily. Bleeding was controlled with bipolar electrocautery and Surgiflo. The end plates at C6-C7 were then prepared using a high-speed burr and then a 7-mm machined lordotic allograft was malleted into place. There was good bony apposition, both proximally and distally. Next, a 44-mm Blackstone low-profile anterior cervical plate was applied to the anterior cervical spine with six 14 mm screws. Intraoperative x-ray confirmed appropriate positioning of the plate and the graft. The wound was then copiously irrigated with normal saline and bacitracin. There was no active bleeding upon closure of the wound. A small drain was placed deep. The platysmal muscle was closed with 3-0 Vicryl. The skin was closed with #4-0 Monocryl. Mastisol and Steri-Strips were applied. The patient was monitored throughout the procedure with free-running EMGs and SSEPs and there were no untoward events. The patient was awoken and taken to the recovery room in satisfactory condition."

312,Orthopedic," PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: After written consent was obtained from the patient, the patient was brought back into the operating room and identified. The patient was placed on the operating room table in supine position and given anesthetic. Once adequate anesthesia had been achieved, a careful examination of the shoulder was performed. It revealed no patholigamentous laxity. We then placed the patient into a beach-chair position, maintaining a neutral alignment of the head, neck, and thorax. The shoulder was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. We then injected the glenohumeral joint with 60 cc of sterile saline solution. A small stab incision was made 2 cm inferior and 2 cm medial to the posterolateral angle of the acromion. Through this incision, a blunt trocar was placed. We then placed the camera through this cannula and the shoulder was insufflated with sterile saline solution. An anterior portal was made just below the subscapularis and then we began to inspect the shoulder joint. We found that the articular surface was in good condition. The biceps was found to be intact. There was a SLAP tear noted just posterior to the biceps. Pictures were taken. No Bankart or Hill-Sachs lesions were noted. The rotator cuff was examined and there were no undersurface tears. Pictures were again taken. We then made a lateral portal going through the muscle belly of the rotator cuff. A drill hole was made and then knotless suture anchor was placed to repair this. Pictures were taken. We then washed out the joint with copious amounts of sterile saline solution. It was drained. Our 3 incisions were closed using 3-0 nylon suture. A pain pump catheter was introduced into the shoulder joint. Xeroform, 4 x 4s, ABDs, tape, and sling were placed. The patient was successfully taken out of the beach-chair position, extubated and brought to the recovery room in stable condition. I then went out and spoke with the patient's family, going over the case, postoperative instructions, and followup care."

TOURNIQUET TIME: 9 minutes at 200 torr. FINDINGS: The patient was found to have limitations to extension at the IP joint to the right thumb. He was found to have full extension after release of A1 pulley. INDICATIONS: The patient is 2-1/2-year-old. He has a history of a trigger thumb. This was evaluated in the office. He was indicated for release of A1 pulley to allow for full excursion. Risks and benefits including recurrence, infection, and problems with anesthesia were discussed at length with the family. They wanted to proceed. PROCEDURE: The patient was brought into the operating room and placed on the operating table in supine position. General anesthesia was induced without incident. He was given a weight-adjusted dose of antibiotics. The right upper extremity was then prepped and draped in a standard fashion. Limb was exsanguinated with an Esmarch bandage. Tourniquet was raised to 200 torr. Transverse incision was then made at the base of thumb. The underlying soft tissues were carefully spread in line longitudinally. The underlying tendon was then identified. The accompanied A1 pulley was also identified. This was incised longitudinally using #11 blade. Inspection of the entire tendon then demonstrated good motion both in flexion and extension. The leaflets of the pulley were easily identified. The wound was then irrigated and closed. The skin was closed using interrupted #4-0 Monocryl simple sutures. The area was injected with 5 mL of 0.25% Marcaine. The wound was dressed with Xeroform, dry sterile dressings, hand dressing, Kerlix, and Coban. The patient was awakened from anesthesia and taken to the recovery room in good condition. There were no complications. All instrument, sponge, needle counts were correct at the end of case. PLAN: The patient will be discharged home. He will return in 1-1/2 weeks for wound inspection."
314,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Displaced intraarticular fracture, right distal radius. 2. Right carpal tunnel syndrome. PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Displaced intraarticular fracture, right distal radius. 2. Right carpal tunnel syndrome. OPERATIONS PERFORMED: 1. Open reduction and internal fixation of right distal radius fracture - intraarticular four piece fracture. 2. Right carpal tunnel release. ANESTHESIA: General. CLINICAL SUMMARY: The patient is a 37-year-old right-hand dominant Hispanic female who sustained a severe fracture to the right wrist approximately one week ago. This was an intraarticular four-part fracture that was displaced dorsally. In addition, the patient previously undergone a carpal tunnel release, but had symptoms of carpal tunnel preop. She is admitted for reconstructive operation. The symptoms of carpal tunnel were present preop and worsened after the injury. OPERATION: The patient was brought from the ambulatory care unit and placed on the operating table in a supine position and administered general anesthetic by Anesthesia. Once adequate anesthesia had been obtained, the right upper extremity was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner. Tourniquet was placed around the right upper extremity. The upper extremity was then elevated and exsanguinated using an Esmarch dressing. The tourniquet was elevated to 250 mmHg. The entire operation was performed with 4.5 loop magnification. At this time an approximately 8 cm longitudinal incision was then made overlying the right flexor carpi radialis tendon from the flexion crease to the wrist proximally. This was carried down to the flexor carpi radialis, which was then retracted ulnarly. The floor of the flexor carpi radialis was then incised exposing the flexor pronator muscles. The flexor pollicis longus was retracted ulnarly and the pronator quadratus was longitudinally incised 1 cm from its origin. It was then elevated off of the fracture site exposing the fracture site, which was dorsally displaced. This was an intraarticular four-part fracture. Under image control, the two volar pieces and dorsal pieces were then carefully manipulated and reduced. Then, 2.06 two-inch K-wires were drilled radial into the volar ulnar fragment and then a second K-wire was then drilled from the dorsal radial to the dorsal ulnar piece. A third K-wire was then drilled from the volar radial to the dorsal ulnar piece. The fracture was then manipulated. The fracture ends were copiously irrigated with normal saline and curetted and then the fracture was reduced in the usual fashion by recreating the defect and distracting it. Further K-wires were then placed through the radial styloid into the proximal fragment. A Hand Innovations DVR plate of regular size for the right wrist was then fashioned over and placed over the distal radius and secured with two K-wires. At this time, the distal screws were then placed. The distal screws were the small screws. These were non-locking screws, all eight screws were placed. They were placed in the usual fashion by drilling with a small drill bit removing the small introducers and then using its depth. Again, these were 18-20 mm screws. After placing three of the screws it was necessary to remove the K-wires. There was excellent reduction of the fragments and the fracture; excellent reduction of the intraarticular component and the fracture. After the distal screws were placed, the fracture was reduced and held in place with K-wires, which were replaced and the proximal screws were drilled with the drill guide and the larger drill bit. The screws were then placed. These were 12 mm screws. They were placed 4 in number. The K-wires were then removed. Finally, a 3 cm intrathenar incision was made beginning 1 cm distal to the flexor crease of the wrist. This was carried down to the transverse carpal ligament, which was divided throughout the length of the incision, upon entering the carpal canal, the median nerve was found to be adherent to the undersurface of the structure. It was dissected free from the structure out to its trifurcation. The motor branches seen entering the thenar fascia and obstructed. The nerve was then retracted dorsally and the patient had a great deal of scar tissue in the area of the volar flexion crease to the wrist where she had a previous incision that extended from the volar flexion crease of the wrist overlying the palmaris longus proximally for 1 cm. In this area, careful dissection was performed in order to move the nerve from the surrounding structures and the most proximal aspect of the transverse carpal ligament, the more proximally located volar carpal ligament was then divided 5 cm into the distal forearm on the ulnar side of the palmaris longus tendon. Incisions were then copiously irrigated with normal saline. Homeostasis was maintained with electrocautery. The pronator quadratus was closed with 3-0 Vicryl and the above skin incisions were closed proximally with 4-0 nylon and palmar incision with 5-0 nylon in the horizontal mattress fashion. A large bulky dressing was then applied with a volar short-arm splint maintaining the wrist in neutral position. The tourniquet was let down. The fingers were immediately pink. The patient was awakened and taken to the recovery room in good condition. There were no operative complications. The patient tolerated the procedure well."
315,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Tailor's bunion and neuroma of the second and third interspace of the left foot. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Tailor's bunion and neuroma of the second and third interspace, left foot. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: 1. Tailor's bunionectomy with metatarsal osteotomy of the left fifth metatarsal. 2. Excision of nerve lesion with implantation of the muscle belly of the left second interspace. 3. Excision of nerve lesion in the left third interspace. ANESTHESIA: Monitored IV sedation with local. HISTORY: This is a 37-year-old female who presents to ABCD's preoperative holding area, n.p.o. since mid night, last night for surgery of her painful left second and third interspaces and her left fifth metatarsal. The patient has attempted conservative correction and injections with minimal improvement. The patient desires surgical correction at this time. The patient states that her pain has been increasingly worsening with activity and with time and it is currently difficult for her to ambulate and wear shoes. At this time, the patient desires surgical intervention and correction. The risks versus benefits of the procedure have been explained to the patient in detail by Dr. X and consent was obtained. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: After an IV was instituted by the Department of Anesthesia in the preoperative holding area, the patient was taken to the Operating Suite via cart and placed on the operating table in the supine position. A safety strap was placed across her waist for protection. Next, a pneumatic ankle tourniquet was applied around her left ankle over copious amounts of Webril for the patient's protection. After adequate IV sedation was administered by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 20 cc of a mixture of 4.5 cc of 1% lidocaine plain, 4.5 cc of 0.5% Marcaine plain, and 1 cc of Solu-Medrol per 10 cc dose was administered to the patient for local anesthesia. The foot was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile orthopedic manner. The foot was then elevated and a tourniquet was then placed at 230 mmHg after applying Esmarch bandage. The foot was then lowered down the operative field and sterile stockinet was draped. The stockinet was then reflected. Attention was then directed to the second intermetatarsal interspace. After testing the anesthesia, a 4 cm incision was placed using a #10 blade over the dorsal surface of the foot in the second intermetatarsal space beginning from proximal third of the metatarsals distally to and beyond the metatarsal head. Then, using #15 blade the incision was deepened through the skin into the subcutaneous tissue. Care was taken to identify and avoid or to cauterize any local encountered vascular structures. Incision was deepened using the combination of blunt and dull dissection using Mayo scissors, hemostat, and a #15 blade. The incision was deepened distally down to the level of the deep transverse metatarsal ligament which was reflected and exposure of the intermetatarsal space was appreciated. The individual branches of the plantar digital nerve were identified extending into the second and third digits plantarly. These endings were dissected distally and cut at their most distal portions. Following this, the nerve was dissected proximally into the common nerve and dissected proximally into the proximal portion of the intermetatarsal space. Using careful meticulous dissection, there was noted to a be a enlarged bulbous mass of fibers and nerve tissue embedded with the adipose tissue. This was also cut and removed. The proximal portion of the nerve stump was identified and care was taken to suture this into the lumbrical muscle to leave no free nerve ending exposed. Following this, the interspace was irrigated with copious amounts of sterile saline and interspace explored for any other portions of nerve which may been missed on the previous dissection. It was noted that no other portions of the nerve were detectable and the proximal free nerve ending was embedded and found to be ________ the lumbrical muscle belly. Following this, the interspace was packed using iodoform gauze packing and was closed in layers with the packing extruding from the wound. Attention was then directed to the third interspace where in a manner as mentioned before. A dorsal linear incision which measured 5 cm was made over the third interspace extending from the proximal portion of the metatarsal distally to the metatarsal head. Like before, using a combination of blunt and dull dissection, with sharp dissection the incision was deepened down with care taken to cauterize all retracting vascular structures which were encountered. The incision was deepened down to the level of the subcutaneous tissue and then down deeper to the interspace of the third and fourth metatarsal. The dissection was deepened distally down to the level of the transverse intermetatarsal ligament, where upon this was reflected and the nerve fibers to the third and fourth digit plantarly were identified. These were once again dissected distally out and transected at their most distal portions. Care was then taken to dissect the nerve proximally into the proximal metatarsal region. No other branches of the nerve were identified and the nerve in its entirety along with fibrous tissue encountered in the area was removed. The proximal portion of the nerve which remained was not large enough to suture into lumbrical muscle as was done in the previous interspace. Half of the nerve was transected proximally as was feasible and no exposed ending was noted. Incision was then flushed and irrigated using sterile saline. Following this, the incision wound was packed with iodoform gauze packed and closed in layers using as before #4-0 Vicryl and #4-0 nylon suture. Following this, attention was directed to the fifth metatarsal head where a lateral 4 cm incision was placed along the lateral distal shaft and head of the fifth metatarsal using a fresh #10 blade. The incision was then deepened using #15 blade down to the level of the subcutaneous tissue. Care was taken to reflect any neurovascular structures which were encountered. Following this the incision was deepened down to the level of the periosteum and periosteum was reflected, using the sharp dissection, to expose the head of the metatarsal along with the neck region. After adequate exposure of the fifth metatarsal head was achieved, an oblique incision directed from distal lateral to proximal medial in a sagittal plane was performed and the head of the fifth metatarsal was shifted medially. Following this, an OrthoSorb pin was retrograded through the fifth metatarsal head into the neck of the fifth metatarsal and was cut off first with the lateral surfaces of bone. OrthoSorb pin was noted to be intact and the fifth metatarsal head was in good alignment and position. Following this, the sagittal saw and the #138 blade were used to provide rasping and smoothing of the sharp acute edges of bone laterally. Following this, the periosteum was closed using #4-0 Vicryl and the skin was closed in layers using #4-0 Vicryl and closed with running subcuticular #4-0 Monocryl suture. Upon completion of this, the foot was noted to be in good position with good visual alignment of the fifth metatarsal head and digit. The incisions in foot were then ________ draped in the normal manner using Owen silk, 4 x 4s, Kling, and Kerlix and covered with Coban bandage. The tourniquet was then deflated with the total tourniquet time of 103 minutes at 230 mmHg and immediate hyperemia was noted to end digits one through five of the left foot. The patient was then transferred to the cart and was escorted to the Postanesthesia Care Unit with vital signs stable and vascular status intact. The patient tolerated the procedure well without any complications. The patient was then given prescriptions for Vicoprofen #30 and Augmentin #14 to be taken twice daily. The patient was instructed to followup with Dr. X after the weekend on Tuesday in his office. The patient also given postoperative instructions and was placed in a postoperative shoe and instructed to limit weightbearing to the heel only, ice and elevate her foot 20 minutes every hour as tolerated. The patient also instructed to take her medications and prescriptions as directed. She was given the emergency contact numbers. Postoperative x-rays were taken and the patient was discharged home in stable condition upon conclusion of this."
316,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Herniated nucleus pulposus of L5-S1 on the left. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Herniated nucleus pulposus of L5-S1 on the left. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Microscopic assisted lumbar laminotomy with discectomy at L5-S1 on the left. ANESTHESIA: General via endotracheal tube. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Less than 50 cc. SPECIMENS: Disc that was not sent to the lab. DRAINS: None. COMPLICATIONS: None. SURGICAL PROGNOSIS: Remains guarded due to her ongoing pain condition and Tarlov cyst at the L5 nerve root distally. SURGICAL INDICATIONS: The patient is a 51-year-old female who has had unrelenting low back pain that radiated down her left leg for the past several months. The symptoms were unrelieved by conservative modalities. The symptoms were interfering with all aspects of daily living and inability to perform any significant work endeavors. She is understanding the risks, benefits, potential complications, as well as all treatment alternatives. She wished to proceed with the aforementioned surgery due to her persistent symptoms. Informed consent was obtained. OPERATIVE TECHNIQUE: The patient was taken to OR room #5 where she was given general anesthetic by the Department of Anesthesia. She was subsequently placed on the Jackson spinal table with the Wilson attachment in the prone position. Palpation did reveal the iliac crest and suspected L5-S1 interspace. Thereafter the lumbar spine was serially prepped and draped. A midline incision was carried over the spinal process of L5 to S1. Skin and subcutaneous tissue were divided sharply. Electrocautery provided hemostasis. Electrocautery was then utilized to dissect through the subcutaneous tissues to the lumbar fascia. Lumbar fascia was identified and the decussation of fibers was identified at the L5-S1 interspace. On the left side, superior aspect dissection was carried out with the Cobb elevator and electrocautery. This revealed the interspace of suspect level of L5-S1 on the left. A Kocher clamp was placed between the spinous processes of the suspect level of L5-S1. X-ray did confirm the L5-S1 interval. Angled curet was utilized to detach the ligamentum flavum from its bony attachments at the superior edge of S1 lamina and the inferior edge of the L5 lamina. Meticulous dissection was undertaken and the ligamentum flavum was removed. Laminotomy was created with Kerrison rongeur, both proximally and distally. The microscope was positioned and the dura was inspected. A blunt Penfield elevator was then utilized to dissect and identify the L5-S1 nerve root on the left. It was noted to be tented over a disc extrusion. The nerve root was protected and medialized. It was retracted with a nerve root retractor. This did reveal a subligamentous disc herniation at approximately the L5-S1 disc space and neuroforaminal area. A #15 Bard-Parker blade was utilized to create an annulotomy. Medially, disc material was extruding through this annulotomy. Two tier rongeur was then utilized to grasp the disc material and the disc was removed from the interspace. Additional disc material was then removed, both to the right and left of the annulotomy. Up and downbiting pituitary rongeurs were utilized to remove any other loose disc pieces. Once this was completed, the wound was copiously irrigated with antibiotic solution and suctioned dry. The Penfield elevator was placed in the disc space of L5-S1 and a crosstable x-ray did confirm this level. Nerve root was again expected exhibiting the foramina. A foraminotomy was created with a Kerrison rongeur. Once this was created, the nerve root was again inspected and deemed free of tension. It was mobile within the neural foramina. The wound was again copiously irrigated with antibiotic solution and suctioned dry. A free fat graft was then harvested from the subcutaneous tissues and placed over the exposed dura. Lumbar fascia was then approximated with #1 Vicryl interrupted fashion, subcutaneous tissue with #2-0 Vicryl interrupted fashion, and #4-0 undyed Vicryl was utilized to approximate the skin. Compression dressing was applied. The patient was turned, awoken, and noted to be moving all four extremities without apparent deficits. She was taken to the recovery room in apparent satisfactory condition. Expected surgical prognosis remains guarded due to her ongoing pain syndrome that has been requiring significant narcotic medications."
317,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: C5-C6 disc herniation with right arm radiculopathy. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: C5-C6 disc herniation with right arm radiculopathy. PROCEDURE: 1. C5-C6 arthrodesis, anterior interbody technique. 2. C5-C6 anterior cervical discectomy. 3. C5-C6 anterior instrumentation with a 23-mm Mystique plate and the 13-mm screws. 4. Implantation of machine bone implant. 5. Microsurgical technique. ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Less than 100 mL. BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND SURGICAL INDICATIONS: The patient is a 45-year-old right-handed gentleman who presented with neck and right arm radicular pain. The pain has become more and more severe. It runs to the thumb and index finger of the right hand and it is accompanied by numbness. If he tilts his neck backwards, the pain shoots down the arm. If he is working with the computer, it is very difficult to use his mouse. He tried conservative measures and failed to respond, so he sought out surgery. Surgery was discussed with him in detail. A C5-C6 anterior cervical discectomy and fusion was recommended. He understood and wished to proceed with surgery. Thus, he was brought in same day for surgery on 07/03/2007. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: He was given Ancef 1 g intravenously for infection prophylaxis and then transported to the OR. There general endotracheal anesthesia was induced. He was positioned on the OR table with an IV bag between the scapulae. The neck was slightly extended and taped into position. A metal arch was placed across the neck and intraoperative x-ray was obtain to verify a good position for skin incision and the neck was prepped with Betadine and draped in the usual sterile fashion. A linear incision was created in the neck beginning just to the right of the midline extending out across the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. The incision was extended through skin, subcutaneous fat, and platysma. Hemostasis was assured with Bovie cautery. The anterior aspect of the sternocleidomastoid muscle was identified and dissection was carried medial to this down to the carotid sheath. The trachea and the esophagus were swept out of the way and dissection proceeded medial to the carotid sheath down between the two bellies of the longus colli muscle on to the anterior aspect of the spine. A Bovie cautery was used to mobilize the longus colli muscle around initially what turned out to be C6-C7 disk based on x-rays and then around the C5-C6 disk space. An intraoperative x-ray confirmed C5-C6 disk space had been localized and then the self-retained distraction system was inserted to maintain exposure. A 15-blade knife was used to incise the C5-C6 disk and remove disk material. and distraction pins were inserted into C5-C6 and distraction placed across the disk space. The operating microscope was then brought into the field and used throughout the case except for the closure. Various pituitaries, #15 blade knife, and curette were used to evacuate the disk as best as possible. Then, the Midas Rex drill was taken under the microscope and used to drill where the cartilaginous endplate driven back all the way into the posterior aspect of the vertebral body. A nerve hook was swept underneath the posterior longitudinal ligament and a fragment of disk was produced and was pulled up through the ligament. A Kerrison rongeur was used to open up the ligament in this opening and then to march out in the both neural foramina. A small amount of disk material was found at the right neural foramen. After a good decompression of both neural foramina was obtained and the thecal sac was exposed throughout the width of the exposure, the wound was thoroughly irrigated. A spacing mechanism was intact into the disk space and it was determined that a #7 spacer was appropriate. So, a #7 machine bone implant was taken and tapped into disk space and slightly counter sunk. The wound was thoroughly irrigated and inspected for hemostasis. A Mystique plate 23 mm in length was then inserted and anchored to the anterior aspect of C5-C6 to hold the bone into position and the wound was once again irrigated. The patient was valsalved. There was no further bleeding seen and intraoperative x-ray confirmed a good position near the bone, plate, and screws and the wound was enclosed in layers. The 3-0 Vicryl was used to approximate platysma and 3-0 Vicryl was used in inverted interrupted fashion to perform a subcuticular closure of the skin. The wound was cleaned. Mastisol was placed on the skin, and Steri-strips were used to approximate skin margins. Sterile dressing was placed on the patient's neck. He was extubated in the OR and transported to the recovery room in stable condition. There were no complications."
318,Orthopedic," INTRODUCTION: The opinions expressed in this report are those of the physician. The opinions do not reflect the opinions of Evergreen Medical Panel, Inc. The claimant was informed that this examination was at the request of the Washington State Department of Labor and Industries (L&I). The claimant was also informed that a written report would be sent to L&I, as requested in the assignment letter from the claims manager. The claimant was also informed that the examination was for evaluative purposes only, intended to address specific injuries or conditions as outlined by L&I, and was not intended as a general medical examination. CHIEF COMPLAINTS: This 51-year-old married male presents complaining of some right periscapular discomfort, some occasional neck stiffness, and some intermittent discomfort in his low back relative to an industrial fall that occurred on November 20, 2008. HISTORY OF INDUSTRIAL INJURY: This patient was injured on November 20, 2008. He works at the Purdy Correctional Facility and an inmate had broken some overhead sprinklers, the floor was thus covered with water and the patient slipped landing on the back of his head, then on his back. The patient said he primarily landed on the left side. After the accident he states that he was generally stun and someone at the institute advised him to be evaluated. He went to a Gig Harbor urgent care facility and they sent him on to Tacoma General Hospital. At the Tacoma General, he indicates that a whiplash and a concussion were diagnosed and it was advised that he have a CT scan. The patient describes that he had a brain CT and a dark spot was found. It was recommended that he have a followup MRI and this was done locally and showed a recurrent acoustic neuroma. Before, when the patient initially had developed an acoustic neuroma, the chiropractor had seen the patient and suggested that he have a scan and this was how his original acoustic neuroma was diagnosed back in October 2005. The patient has been receiving adjustments by the chiropractor since and he also has had a few massage treatments. Overall his spine complaints have improved substantially. After the fall, he also saw at Prompt Care in the general Bremerton area, XYZ, an Osteopathic Physician and she examined him and released him full duty and also got an orthopedic consult from XYZ. She ordered an MRI of his neck. Cervically this showed that he had a mild disc bulge at C4-C5, but this actually was the same test that diagnosed a recurrent acoustic neuroma and the patient now is just recovering from neurosurgical treatment for this recurrent acoustic neuroma and some radiation is planned. Since 2002 the patient has been seeing the chiropractor, XYZ for general aches and pain and this has included some treatments on his back and neck. CURRENT SYMPTOMS: The patient describes his current pain as being intermittent. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Illnesses: The patient had a diagnosis in 2005 of an acoustic neuroma. It was benign, but treated neurosurgically. In February 2004 and again in August 2009 he has had additional treatments for recurrence and he currently has some skull markers in place because radiation is planned as a followup, although the tumor was still indicated to be benign. Operations: He has a history of an old mastoidectomy. He has a past history of removal of an acoustic neuroma in 2005 as noted. Medications: The patient takes occasional Tylenol and occasional Aleve. Substance Use: Tobacco: He does not smoke cigarettes. Alcohol: He drinks about five beers a week. FAMILY HISTORY: His father died of mesothelioma and his mother died of Lou Gehrig's disease. SOCIOECONOMIC HISTORY: Marital Status and Dependents: The patient has been married three times; longest marriage is of two years duration. He has two children. These dependents are ages 15 and twins and are his wife's dependents. Education: The patient has bachelor's degree. Military History: He served six years in the army and received an honorable discharge. Work History: He has worked at Purdy Correctional Institute in Gig Harbor for 19 years. CHART REVIEW: Review of the chart indicates a date of injury of November 20, 2008. He was seen at Tacoma General Hospital with a diagnosis of head contusion and cervical strain. He had a CT of his head done because of a fall with possible loss of consciousness, which showed a left cerebellar hypodensity and further evaluation was recommended. He has a history of an old mastoidectomy. He was then seen on November 24, 2008 by XYZ at Prompt Care on November 24, 2008. There is no clearcut history that he had lost consciousness. He has a past history of removal of an acoustic neuroma in 2005 as noted. A diagnosis of concussion and cervical strain status post fall was made along with an underlying history of abnormal CT and previous resection of an acoustic neuroma. Some symptoms of loss of balance and confusion were noted. She recommended additional testing and neurologic evaluation. The notes from the treating chiropractor begin on November 24, 2008. Adjustments are given to the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine. He was seen back by XYZ on December 9, 2008 and he had been released to full duties. It was recognized the new MRI suggested recurrence of the acoustic neuroma and he was advised to seek further care in this regard. There were some concerns of his feeling of being wobbly since the fall which might be related to the recurrent neuroma. He continued to have chiropractic adjustments. He was seen back at Prompt Care on January 8, 2009. Dr. X indicated that she thought most of his symptoms were related to the tumor, but that the cervical and thoracic stiffness were from the fall. A followup note by his chiropractor on January 26, 2009 indicates that cervical x-rays have been taken and that continued chiropractic adjustments along with manual traction would be carried out. On April 13, 2009, he was seen again at Prompt Care for his cervical and thoracic strain. He was indicated to be improving and there was suggestion that he has some physical therapy and an orthopedic consult was felt appropriate. Therapy was not carried out and obviously was then involved with the treatment of his recurrent neuroma. On April 17, 2009, he was seen by Dr. X, another chiropractor for consultation and further chiropractic treatments were recommended based on cervical and thoracolumbar subluxation complexes and strain. A repeat consult was carried out on April 29, 2009 by XYZ. He felt that this was hyperextension cervical injury. It might take a period of time to recover. He mentioned that the patient might have a slight ulnar neuropathy. He felt the patient was capable of full duty and the patient was at that time having ongoing treatment for his neuroma. This concludes the chart review. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient is 6 feet in height, weighs 255 pounds. Orthopedic Examination: He can walk with a normal gait, but he has, as indicated, a positive Romberg test and he himself has noticed that if he closes his eyes he loses his balance. Overall the patient is a seemingly good historian. There is a visible 3 cm scar at the left base of the neck near the hairline and there are multiple areas where his head has been shaved both anteriorly and posteriorly. These are secondary to drawing for the skull markers. There is a scar behind the patient's left ear from the original treatment of the acoustic neuroma. This was well healed. The patient can perform a toe-heel gait without difficulty. One visibly can see that he has some facial asymmetry and he indicates that the acoustic neuroma has caused some numbness in the left side of his face and also some asymmetry that is now recovering. The patient states he now thinks his recovery is going to get disregarded and that the facial asymmetry and numbness developed from the first surgery he had. The patient has a full range of motion in both of his shoulders. The patient has a full range of motion in his lumbar spine to include 90 degrees of forward bend, lateral bending of 30 degrees in either direction and extension of 10 degrees. There is full range of motion in the patient's cervical spine to include flexion of 50 degrees at which time he can touch his chin on his chest. He extends 40 degrees, laterally bends 30 degrees, and rotates to 80 degrees in either direction. There is slight tenderness on palpating over the right cervical musculature. There is no evidence of any cervical or lumbar muscle spasms. Reflexes in the upper extremities include 1+ biceps and triceps and 1+ brachioradialis. Knee jerks are 2+ and ankle jerks are 1+. Tinel's test was tested at the elbow, it is negative bilaterally with percussion; however, he has slight tingling bilaterally. The patient's grip tested with a Jamar dynamometer increases from 70 to 80 pounds bilaterally. Sensory testing of lower extremities reveal that the patient has slightly decreased sensation to sharp stimulus in his dorsal aspect of the right first toe and a lesser extent to the left. Testing of muscle strength in the upper and lower extremities is normal. The patient upper arms measured four fingerbreadths above the flexion crease of the elbow measure 35 cm bilaterally. The forearms measured four fingerbreadths below the flexion crease of the elbow measure 30 cm bilaterally. The thighs measured four fingerbreadths above the superior pole of the patella measure 48 cm and the lower legs measured four fingerbreadths below the tibial tubercles measure 41 cm. Pressure on the vertex of the head does not bother the patient. Axial loading is negative. As already indicated straight leg raising is entirely negative both sitting and lying for any radiculitis. DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES: X-rays the patient brings with him taken by his treating chiropractor dated 11/24/08 showed that there appears to be a little bit of narrowing of the L4-5 disc space. The hip joints are normal. Views of his thoracic spine are normal. Cervical x-rays are in the file. These are of intermittent quality, but the views do show a very slight degree of anterior spurring at the C4-5 with possible slight narrowing of the disc. There is a view of the right shoulder that is unremarkable. CONCLUSIONS: The accepted condition under the claim is a sprain of the neck, thoracic, and lumbar. DIAGNOSES: Diagnosis based on today's examination is a sprain of the cervical spine and lumbar spine superimposed upon some early degenerative changes. Additional diagnosis is one of recurrent acoustic neuroma, presumably benign with upcoming additional treatment of radiation plan. The patient also has a significant degree overweight for his height and it will be improved as he himself recognizes by some weight loss and exercise. DISCUSSION: He is fixed and stable at this time and his industrial case can be closed relative to his industrial injury of November 20, 2008. Further chiropractic treatments would be entirely palliative and serve no additional medical purpose due to the fact that he has very minimal symptoms and a basis for these symptoms based on mild or early degenerative changes in both cervical and lumbar spine. He is category I relative to the cervical spine under 296-20-240 and category I to the lumbosacral spine under WAC 296-20-270. His industrial case should be closed and there is, as indicated, no basis for any disability award."
319,Orthopedic," PROCEDURES PERFORMED: C5-C6 anterior cervical discectomy, allograft fusion, and anterior plating. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 10 mL. CLINICAL NOTE: This is a 57-year-old gentleman with refractory neck pain with single-level degeneration of the cervical spine and there was also some arm pain. We decided go ahead with anterior cervical discectomy at C5-C6 and fusion. The risks of lack of pain relief, paralysis, hoarse voice, nerve injuries, and infection were explained and the patient agreed to proceed. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the operating room where a general endotracheal anesthesia was induced without complication. The patient was placed in the slightly extended position with the neck and the head was restrained in a doughnut and the occiput was restrained by the doughnut. He had tape placed over the shoulders during intraoperative x-rays and his elbows were well padded. The tape was placed and his arms were well padded. He was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion. A linear incision was fashioned at the cricothyroid level from near the midline to over the sternocleidomastoid muscle. We separated the platysma from the subcutaneous tissue and then opened the platysma along the medial border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. We then dissected sharply medial to carotid artery, which we palpated to the prevertebral region. We placed Caspar retractors for medial and lateral exposure over the C5-C6 disc space, which we confirmed with the lateral cervical spine x-ray including 18-gauge needle in the disc space. We then marked the disc space. We then drilled off ventral osteophyte as well as osteophyte creating concavity within the disc space. We then under magnification removed all the disc material, we could possibly see down to bleeding bone and both the endplates. We took down posterior longitudinal ligament as well. We incised the 6-mm cornerstone bone. We placed a 6-mm parallel medium bone nicely into the disc space. We then sized a 23-mm plate. We inserted the screws nicely above and below. We tightened down the lock-nuts. We irrigated the wound. We assured hemostasis using bone wax prior to placing the plate. We then assured hemostasis once again. We reapproximated the platysma using 3-0 Vicryl in a simple interrupted fashion. The subcutaneous level was closed using 3-0 Vicryl in a simple buried fashion. The skin was closed with 3-0 Monocryl in a running subcuticular stitch. Steri-Strips were applied. Dry sterile dressing with Telfa was applied over this. We obtained an intraoperative x-ray to confirm the proper level and good position of both plates and screw construct on the lateral x-ray and the patient was transferred to the recovery room, moving all four extremities with stable vital signs. I was present as a primary surgeon throughout the entire case."
320,Orthopedic," TITLE OF OPERATION: Austin bunionectomy with internal screw fixation, first metatarsal, left foot. PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Bunion deformity, left foot. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Bunion deformity, left foot. ANESTHESIA: Monitored anesthesia care with 15 mL of 1:1 mixture of 0.5% Marcaine and 1% lidocaine plain. HEMOSTASIS: 45 minutes, left ankle tourniquet set at 250 mmHg. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Less than 10 mL. MATERIALS USED: 2-0 Vicryl, 3-0 Vicryl, 4-0 Vicryl, as well as a 16-mm and an 18-mm partially threaded cannulated screw from the OsteoMed Screw Fixation System. DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table in a supine position. After adequate sedation was achieved by the anesthesia team, the above-mentioned anesthetic mixture was infiltrated directly into the patient's left foot to anesthetize the future surgical sites. The left ankle was covered with cast padding and an 18-inch ankle tourniquet was placed around the left ankle and set at 250 mmHg. The left foot was then prepped, scrubbed, and draped in normal sterile technique. The left ankle tourniquet was inflated. Attention was then directed on the dorsomedial aspect of the first left metatarsophalangeal joint where a 6-cm linear incision was placed directly over the first left metatarsophalangeal joint parallel and medial to the course of the extensor hallucis longus tendon to the left great toe. The incision was deepened through subcutaneous tissues. All the bleeders were identified, cut, clamped, and cauterized. The incision was deepened to the level of the capsule and the periosteum of the first left metatarsophalangeal joint. All the tendinous neurovascular structures were identified and retracted from the site to be preserved. Using sharp and dull dissection, the periosteal and capsular attachments were mobilized from the head of the first left metatarsal. The conjoint tendon was identified on the lateral plantar aspect of the base of the proximal phalanx of the left great toe and transversally resected from its insertion. A lateral capsulotomy was also performed at the level of the first left metatarsophalangeal joint. The dorsomedial prominence of the first left metatarsal head was adequately exposed using sharp dissection and resected with the use of a sagittal saw. The same saw was used to perform an Austin-type bunionectomy on the capital aspect of the first left metatarsal head with its apex distal and its base proximal on the shaft of the first left metatarsal. The dorsal arm of the osteotomy was longer than the plantar arm in order to accommodate for the future internal fixation. The capital fragment of the first left metatarsal was then transposed laterally and impacted on the shaft of the first left metatarsal. Provisional fixation was achieved with two smooth wires that were inserted vertically to the dorsal osteotomy in a dorsal distal to plantar proximal direction. The same wires were also used as guide wires for the insertion of a 16-mm and an 18-mm partially threaded screws from the 3.0 OsteoMed System upon insertion of the screws, which was accomplished using AO technique. The wires were removed. Fixation on the table was found to be excellent. Reduction of the bunion deformity was also found to be excellent and position of the first left metatarsophalangeal joint was anatomical. The remaining bony prominence from the shaft of the first left metatarsal was then resected with a sagittal saw. The area was copiously flushed with saline. The periosteal and capsular tissues were approximated with 2-0 and 3-0 Vicryl suture material, 4-0 Vicryl was used to approximate the subcutaneous tissues. The incision site was reinforced with Steri-Strips. At this time, the patient's left ankle tourniquet was deflated. The time was 45 minutes. Immediate hyperemia was noted to the entire right lower extremity upon deflation of the cuff. The patient's incision was covered with Xeroform, copious amounts of fluff and Kling, stockinette, and an Ace bandage. The patient's left foot was then placed in a surgical shoe. The patient was then transferred to the recovered room under the care of the anesthesia team with her vital signs stable and her vascular status at appropriate levels. The patient was given pain medication and instructions on how to control her postoperative course. The patient was discharged from Hospital according to nursing protocol and was advised to follow up with Dr. X in one week's time for her first postoperative appointment."
321,Orthopedic," CC: Progressive lower extremity weakness. HX: This 52y/o RHF had a h/o right frontal glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) diagnosed by brain biopsy/partial resection, on 1/15/1991. She had been healthy until 1/6/91, when she experienced a generalized tonic-clonic type seizure during the night. She subsequently underwent an MRI brain scan and was found to have a right frontal enhancing lesion in the mesial aspect of the right frontal lobe at approximately the level of the coronal suture. There was minimal associated edema and no mass effect. Following extirpation of the tumor mass, she underwent radioactive Iodine implantation and 6020cGy radiation therapy in 35 fractions. In 11/91 she received BCNU and Procarbazine chemotherapy protocols. This was followed by four courses of 5FU/Carboplatin (3/92, 6/92, 9/92 ,10/92) chemotherapy. On 10/12/92 she presented for her 4th course of 5FU/Carboplatin and complained of non-radiating dull low back pain, and proximal lower extremity weakness, but was still able to ambulate. She denied any bowel/bladder difficulty. PMH: s/p oral surgery for wisdom tooth extraction. FHX/SHX: 1-2 ppd cigarettes. rare ETOH use. Father died of renal CA. MEDS: Decadron 12mg/day. EXAM: Vitals unremarkable. MS: Unremarkable. Motor: 5/5 BUE, LE: 4+/5- prox, 5/5 distal to hips. Normal tone and muscle bulk. Sensory: No deficits appreciated. Coord: Unremarkable. Station: No mention in record of being tested. Gait: Mild difficulty climbing stairs. Reflexes: 1+/1+ throughout and symmetric. Plantar responses were down-going bilaterally. INITIAL IMPRESSION: Steroid myopathy. Though there was enough of a suspicion of &quot;drop&quot; metastasis that an MRI of the L-spine was obtained. COURSE: The MRI L-spine revealed fine linear enhancement along the dorsal aspect of the conus medullaris, suggestive of subarachnoid seeding of tumor. No focal mass or cord compression was visualized. CSF examination revealed: 19RBC, 22WBC, 17 Lymphocytes, and 5 histiocytes, Glucose 56, Protein 150. Cytology (negative). The patient was discharged home on 10/17/92, but experienced worsening back pain and lower extremity weakness and became predominantly wheelchair bound within 4 months. She was last seen on 3/3/93 and showed signs of worsening weakness (left hemiplegia: R &gt; L) as her tumor grew and spread. She then entered a hospice."

A linear skin incision was made in the skin fold line from just to the right of the midline to the leading edge of the right sternocleidomastoid muscle and taken sharply to platysma, which was dissected in a subplatysmal manner and then with only blunt dissection, the prevertebral space was encountered and localizing intraoperative x-ray was obtained once cauterized the longus colli muscle bilaterally allowed for the placement along its mesial portion of self-retaining retractors for exposure of tissues. Prominent anterior osteophytes once identified and compared to preoperative studies were removed at C5-C6 and then at C6-C7 with rongeur, allowing for an annulotomy with an #11 blade through collapsed disc space at C5-6, and even more collapsed at C6-C7. Gross instability appeared and though minimally at both interspaces and residual disc were removed then with the straight disc forceps providing a discectomy at both levels, sending to Pathology in a routine fashion as disc specimen. This was sent separately and allowed for residual disc removal of power drill where drilling extended in normal cortical and cancellous elements of the C5 and C6 interspaces and at C6-C7 removing large osteophytes and process, residual osteophytes from which were removed finally with 1 and 2 mm micro Kerrison rongeurs allowing for excision of other hypertrophied ligament posteriorly as well. This allowed for the bulging into the interspace of the dura, sign of decompressed status, and this was done widely bilaterally to decompress the nerve roots themselves and this was assured by inspection with a double ball dissector as needed. At no time during the case was there evidence of CSF leakage and hemostasis was well achieved with pledgets of Gelfoam and subsequently removed with copious amounts of antibiotic irrigation as well as Surgifoam. Once hemostasis well achieved, Bengal cage was filled with the patient's own bone elements of appropriate size, and this was countersunk into position and quite tightly applied it at first C5-C6, then secondly at C6-C7. These were checked and found to be well applied and further stability was then added by placement nonetheless of a Uniplate of appropriate size. The appropriate size screws and post-placement x-ray showed well-aligned elements and removal of osteophytes, etc. The wound was again irrigated with antibiotic solution, inspected, and finally closed in a multiple layered closure by approximation of platysma with interrupted #3-0 Vicryl and the skin with subcuticular stitch of #4-0 Vicryl incorporating a Penrose drain from vertebral space externally through the skin wound and safety pin, and later incorporated itself into sterile bandage. Once the bandage was placed, the patient was taken, extubated from the operating room to the Recovery area, having in stable, but guarded condition. At the conclusion of the case, all instrument, needle, and sponge counts were accurate and correct. There were no intraoperative complications of any type."
323,Orthopedic," TECHNIQUE: Sequential axial CT images were obtained through the cervical spine without contrast. Additional high resolution coronal and sagittal reconstructed images were also obtained for better visualization of the osseous structures. FINDINGS: The cervical spine demonstrates normal alignment and mineralization with no evidence of fracture, dislocation, or spondylolisthesis. The vertebral body heights and disc spaces are maintained. The central canal is patent. The pedicles and posterior elements are intact. The paravertebral soft tissues are within normal limits. The atlanto-dens interval and the dens are intact. The visualized lung apices are clear. IMPRESSION: No acute abnormalities."
324,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Retained hardware, right ulnar. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Retained hardware, right ulnar PROCEDURE: Hardware removal, right ulnar. ANESTHESIA: The patient received 2.5 mL of 0.25% Marcaine and local anesthetic. COMPLICATIONS: No intraoperative complications. DRAINS: None. SPECIMENS: None. HISTORY AND PHYSICAL: The patient is a 5-year, 5-month-old male who sustained a both-bone forearm fracture in September 2007. The fracture healed uneventfully, but then the patient subsequently suffered a refracture one month ago. The patient had shortening in arms, noted in both bones. The parents opted for surgical stabilization with nailing. This was performed one month ago on return visit. His ulnar nail was quite prominent underneath the skin. It was decided to remove the ulnar nail early and place the patient in another cast for 3 weeks. Risks and benefits of the surgery were discussed with the mother. Risk of surgery incudes risks of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation in most of the extremity, need for longer casting. All questions were answered and mother agreed to above plan. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was seen in the operative room, placed supine on operating room table. General anesthesia was then administered. The patient was given Ancef preoperatively. The left elbow was prepped and draped in a standard surgical fashion. A small incision was made over the palm with K-wire. This was removed without incident. The wound was irrigated. The bursitis was curetted. Wounds closed using #4-0 Monocryl. The wound was clean and dry, dressed with Xeroform 4 x 4s and Webril. Please note the area infiltrated with 0.25% Marcaine. The patient was then placed in a long-arm cast. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was subsequently taken to the recovery room in stable condition. POSTOPERATIVE PLAN: The patient will maintain the cast for 3 more weeks. Intraoperative nail was given to the mother. The patient to take Tylenol with Codeine as needed. All questions were answered."
325,Orthopedic," EXAM:MRI LEFT SHOULDER CLINICAL:This is a 26 year old with a history of instability. Examination was preformed on 12/20/2005. FINDINGS: There is supraspinatus tendinosis without a full-thickness tear, gap or fiber retraction and there is no muscular atrophy (series #105 images #4-6). Normal infraspinatus and subscapularis tendons. Normal long biceps tendon within the bicipital groove. There is medial subluxation of the tendon under the transverse humeral ligament, and there is tendinosis of the intracapsular portion of the tendon with partial tearing, but there is no complete tear or discontinuity. Biceps anchor is intact (series #105 images #4-7; series #102 images #10-22). There is a very large Hill-Sachs fracture, involving almost the entire posterior half of the humeral head (series #102 images #13-19). This is associated with a large inferior bony Bankart lesion that measures approximately 15 x 18mm in AP and craniocaudal dimension with impaction and fragmentation (series #104 images #10-14; series #102 images #18-28). There is medial and inferior displacement of the fragment. There are multiple interarticular bodies, some of which may be osteochondromatous and some may be osseous measuring up to 8mm in diameter. (These are too numerous to count.) There is marked stretching, attenuation and areas of thickening of the inferior and middle glenohumeral ligaments, compatible with a chronic tear with scarring but there is no discontinuity or demonstrated HAGL lesion (series #105 images #5-10). Normal superior glenohumeral ligament. There is no SLAP tear. Normal acromioclavicular joint without narrowing of the subacromial space. Normal coracoacromial, coracohumeral and coracoclavicular ligaments. There is fluid in the glenohumeral joint and biceps tendon sheath. IMPRESSION: There is a very large Hill-Sachs fracture involving most of the posterior half of the humeral head with an associated large and inferior and medial displaced osseous Bankart lesion. There are multiple intraarticular bodies, and there is a partial tear of the inferior and middle glenohumeral ligaments. There is medial subluxation of the long biceps tendon under the transverse humeral ligament with partial tearing of the intracapsular portion."
326,Orthopedic," REASON FOR VISIT: Followup status post L4-L5 laminectomy and bilateral foraminotomies, and L4-L5 posterior spinal fusion with instrumentation. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. ABC returns today for followup status post L4-L5 laminectomy and bilateral foraminotomies, and posterior spinal fusion on 06/08/07. Preoperatively, her symptoms, those of left lower extremity are radicular pain. She had not improved immediately postoperatively. She had a medial breech of a right L4 pedicle screw. We took her back to the operating room same night and reinserted the screw. Postoperatively, her pain had improved. I had last seen her on 06/28/07 at which time she was doing well. She had symptoms of what she thought was &quot;restless leg syndrome&quot; at that time. She has been put on ReQuip for this. She returned. I had spoken to her 2 days ago and she had stated that her right lower extremity pain was markedly improved. I had previously evaluated this for a pain possibly relating to deep venous thrombosis and ultrasound was negative. She states that she had recurrent left lower extremity pain, which was similar to the pain she had preoperatively but in a different distribution, further down the leg. Thus, I referred her for a lumbar spine radiograph and lumbar spine MRI and she presents today for evaluation. She states that overall, she is improved compared to preoperatively. She is ambulating better than she was preoperatively. The pain is not as severe as it was preoperatively. The right leg pain is improved. The left lower extremity pain is in a left L4 and L5 distribution radiating to the great toe and first web space on the left side. She denies any significant low back pain. No right lower extremity symptoms. No infectious symptoms whatsoever. No fever, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath. No drainage from the wound. No difficulties with the incision. FINDINGS: On examination, Ms. ABC is a pleasant, well-developed, well-nourished female in no apparent distress. Alert and oriented x 3. Normocephalic, atraumatic. Respirations are normal and nonlabored. Afebrile to touch. Left tibialis anterior strength is 3 out of 5, extensor hallucis strength is 2 out of 5. Gastroc-soleus strength is 3 to 4 out of 5. This has all been changed compared to preoperatively. Motor strength is otherwise 4 plus out of 5. Light touch sensation decreased along the medial aspect of the left foot. Straight leg raise test normal bilaterally. The incision is well healed. There is no fluctuance or fullness with the incision whatsoever. No drainage. Radiographs obtained today demonstrate pedicle screw placement at L4 and L5 bilaterally without evidence of malposition or change in orientation of the screws. Lumbar spine MRI performed on 07/03/07 is also reviewed. It demonstrates evidence of adequate decompression at L4 and L5. There is a moderate size subcutaneous fluid collection seen, which does not appear compressive and may be compatible with normal postoperative fluid collection, especially given the fact that she had a revision surgery performed. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Ms. ABC is doing relatively well status post L4 and L5 laminectomy and bilateral foraminotomies, and posterior spinal fusion with instrumentation on 07/08/07. The case is significant for merely misdirected right L4 pedicle screw, which was reoriented with subsequent resolution of symptoms. I am uncertain with regard to the etiology of the symptoms. However, it does appear that the radiographs demonstrate appropriate positioning of the instrumentation, no hardware shift, and the MRI demonstrates only a postoperative suprafascial fluid collection. I do not see any indication for another surgery at this time. I would also like to hold off on an interventional pain management given the presence of the fluid collection to decrease the risk of infection. My recommendation at this time is that the patient is to continue with mobilization. I have reassured her that her spine appears stable at this time. She is happy with this. I would like her to continue ambulating as much as possible. She can go ahead and continue with ReQuip for the restless leg syndrome as her primary care physician has suggested. I have also her referred to Mrs. Khan at Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation for continued aggressive management. I will see her back in followup in 3 to 4 weeks to make sure that she continues to improve. She knows that if she has any difficulties, she may follow up with me sooner."
327,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS (ES): Recurrent herniation L4-5 disk with left radiculopathy. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS (ES): Recurrent herniation L4-5 disk with left radiculopathy. PROCEDURE: Redo L4-5 diskectomy left. COMPLICATIONS: None. ANTIBIOTIC (S): Vancomycin given preoperatively. ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 10 mL. BLOOD REPLACED: None. CRYSTALLOID GIVEN: 800 mL. DRAIN (S): None. DESCRIPTION OF THE OPERATION: The patient was brought to the operating room in supine position. General endotracheal anesthesia was administered. He was turned into the prone position on the operating table and positioned in the modified knee-chest position with Andrews frame being used. Care was taken to protect pressure points. The back was shaved, scrubbed with Betadine scrub, rinsed with alcohol, and prepped with DuraPrep, and draped in the usual sterile fashion with Ioban drape being used. A midline skin incision was made, excising scar from previous surgery. Dissection was carried down through the subcutaneous tissue with electrocautery technique. The lumbosacral fascia was split to the left of the spinous process, and subperiosteal dissection of the spinous process and lamina, area of previous laminotomy was identified. Cross-table lateral was also made to confirm position. The scar was then loosened from the inferior portion of 4, superior of L5 lamina, and a portion of the lamina was removed. I did identify normal dura. The scar was then lysed from the medial wall. Dura and nerve root were identified and protected with nerve root retractor. The bulging disk fragment was still contained under the longitudinal ligament. A rent was made with the Penfield and a moderately large fragment was removed. The disk space was then entered with a cruciate cut in the annulus, with additional nuclear material being received. When no other fragments could be removed from the disk space, no other fragments were felt in the central canal under the longitudinal ligament, and a Murphy ball could be passed through the foramen without evidence of compression, the decompression was complete. Check was made for CSF leakage, and no evidence of significant epidural bleeding was present. The wound was irrigated with antibiotic solution. Twenty milligrams of Depo-Medrol was placed over the dura and nerve root. A free fat graft from the subcutaneous tissue was then placed over the dura. Closure was obtained with the lumbosacral fascia being reapproximated with #1, running, Vicryl suture. Subcutaneous closure was obtained in layers with 2-0, running, Vicryl suture. Skin closure was obtained with 3-0 Vicryl subcuticular suture. Proxi-Strips and sterile dressing was applied. The skin had been infiltrated with 8 mL of 0.5% Marcaine with epinephrine. After a sterile dressing was applied, the patient was turned into the supine position on the waiting recovery room stretcher, brought from under the effects of anesthesia, and taken to the recovery room."
328,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Herniated nucleus pulposus, L5-S1 on the left with severe weakness and intractable pain. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Herniated nucleus pulposus, L5-S1 on the left with severe weakness and intractable pain. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: 1. Injection for myelogram. 2. Microscopic-assisted lumbar laminectomy with discectomy at L5-S1 on the left on 08/28/03. BLOOD LOSS: Approximately 25 cc. ANESTHESIA: General. POSITION: Prone on the Jackson table. INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS: Extruded nucleus pulposus at the level of L5-S1. HISTORY: This is a 34-year-old male with history of back pain with radiation into the left leg in the S1 nerve root distribution. The patient was lifting at work on 08/27/03 and felt immediate sharp pain from his back down to the left lower extremity. He denied any previous history of back pain or back surgeries. Because of his intractable pain as well as severe weakness in the S1 nerve root distribution, the patient was aware of all risks as well as possible complications of this type of surgery and he has agreed to pursue on. After an informed consent was obtained, all risks as well as complications were discussed with the patient. PROCEDURE DETAIL: He was wheeled back to Operating Room #5 at ABCD General Hospital on 08/28/03. After a general anesthetic was administered, a Foley catheter was inserted. The patient was then turned prone on the Jackson table. All of his bony prominences were well-padded. At this time, a myelogram was then performed. After the lumbar spine was prepped, a #20 gauge needle was then used to perform a myelogram. The needle was localized to the level of L3-L4 region. Once inserted into the thecal sac, we immediately got cerebrospinal fluid through the spinal needle. At this time, approximately 10 cc of Conray injected into the thecal sac. The patient was then placed in the reversed Trendelenburg position in order to assist with distal migration of the contrast. The myelogram did reveal that there was some space occupying lesion, most likely disc at the level of L5-S1 on the left. There was a lack of space filling defect on the left evident on both the AP and the lateral projections using C-arm fluoroscopy. At this point, the patient was then fully prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion for this procedure for a microdiscectomy. A long spinal needle was then inserted into region of surgery on the right. The surgery was going to be on the left. Once the spinal needle was inserted, a localizing fluoroscopy was then used to assure appropriate location and this did confirm that we were at the L5-S1 nerve root region. At this time, an approximately 2 cm skin incision was made over the lumbar region, dissected down to the deep lumbar fascia. At this time, a Weitlaner was inserted. Bovie cautery was used to obtain hemostasis. We further continued through the deep lumbar fascia and dissected off the short lumbar muscles off of the spinous process and the lamina. A Cobb elevator was then used to elevate subperiosteally off of all the inserting short lumbar muscles off of the spinous process as well as the lamina on the left-hand side. At this time, a Taylor retractor was then inserted and held there for retraction. Suction as well as Bovie cautery was used to obtain hemostasis. At this time, a small Kerrison Rongeur was used to make a small lumbar laminotomy to expose our window for the nerve root decompression. Once the laminotomy was performed, a small _______ curette was used to elevate the ligamentum flavum off of the thecal sac as well as the adjoining nerve roots. Once the ligamentum flavum was removed, we immediately identified a piece of disc material floating around outside of the disc space over the S1 nerve root, which was compressive. We removed the extruded disc with further freeing up of the S1 nerve root. A nerve root retractor was then placed. Identification of disc space was then performed. A #15 blade was then inserted and small a key hole into the disc space was then performed with a #15 blade. A small pituitary was then inserted within the disc space and more disc material was freed and removed. The part of the annulus fibrosis were also removed in addition to the loose intranuclear pieces of disc. Once this was performed, we removed the retraction off the nerve root and the nerve root appeared to be free with pulsatile visualization of the vasculature indicating that the nerve root was essentially free. At this time, copious irrigation was used to irrigate the wound. We then performed another look to see if any loose pieces of disc were extruding from the disc space and only small pieces were evident and they were then removed with the pituitary rongeur. At this time, a small piece of Gelfoam was then used to cover the exposed nerve root. We did not have any dural leaks during this case. #1-0 Vicryl was then used to approximate the deep lumbar fascia, #2-0 Vicryl was used to approximate the superficial lumbar fascia, and #4-0 running Vicryl for the subcutaneous skin. Sterile dressings were then applied. The patient was then carefully slipped over into the supine position, extubated and transferred to Recovery in stable condition. At this time, we are still waiting to assess the patient postoperatively to assure no neurological sequela postsurgically are found and also to assess his pain level."
329,Orthopedic," CHIEF COMPLAINT: Chronic low back, left buttock and leg pain. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a pleasant 49-year-old gentleman post lumbar disc replacement from January 2005. Unfortunately, the surgery and interventional procedures have not been helpful in alleviating his pain. He has also tried acupuncture, TENS unit, physical therapy, chiropractic treatment and multiple neuropathic medications including Elavil, Topamax, Cymbalta, Neurontin, and Lexapro, which he discontinued either due to side effects or lack of effectiveness in decreasing his pain. Most recently, he has had piriformis injections, which did give him a brief period of relief; however, he reports that the Botox procedure that was done on March 8, 2006 has not given him any relief from his buttock pain. He states that approximately 75% of his pain is in his buttock and leg and 25% in his back. He has tried to increase in his activity with walking and does note increased spasm with greater activity in the low back. He rated his pain today as 6/10, describing it is shooting, sharp and aching. It is increased with lifting, prolonged standing or walking and squatting, decreased with ice, reclining and pain medication. It is constant but variable in degree. It continues to affect activities and sleep at night as well as mood at times. He is currently not satisfied completely with his level of pain relief. MEDICATIONS: Kadian 30 mg b.i.d., Zanaflex one-half to one tablet p.r.n. spasm, and Advil p.r.n. ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Complete multisystem review was noted and signed in the chart. SOCIAL HISTORY: Unchanged from prior visit. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Blood pressure 123/87, pulse 89, respirations 18, and weight 220 lbs. He is a well-developed obese male in no acute distress. He is alert and oriented x3, and displays normal mood and affect with no evidence of acute anxiety or depression. He ambulates with normal gait and has normal station. He is able to heel and toe walk. He denies any sensory changes. ASSESSMENT & PLAN: This is a pleasant 49-year-old with chronic pain plus lumbar disk replacement with radiculitis and myofascial complaints. We discussed treatment options at length and he is willing to undergo a trial of Lyrica. He is sensitive to medications based on his past efforts and is given a prescription for 150 mg that he will start at bedtime. We discussed the up taper schedule and he understands that he will have to be on this for some time before we can decide whether or not it is helpful to him. We also briefly touched on the possibility of a spinal cord stimulator trial if this medication is not helpful to him. He will call me if there are any issues with the new prescription and follow in four weeks for reevaluation."

331,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Wrist ganglion. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Wrist ganglion. TITLE OF PROCEDURE: Excision of dorsal wrist ganglion. PROCEDURE: After administering appropriate antibiotics and general anesthesia, the upper extremity was prepped and draped in the usual standard fashion. The arm was exsanguinated with an Esmarch and tourniquet inflated to 250 mmHg. I made a transverse incision directly over the ganglion. Dissection was carried down through the extensor retinaculum, identifying the 3rd and the 4th compartments and retracting them. I then excised the ganglion and its stalk. In addition, approximately a square centimeter of the dorsal capsule was removed at the origin of stalk, leaving enough of a defect to prevent formation of a one-way valve. We then identified the scapholunate ligament, which was uninjured. I irrigated and closed in layers and injected Marcaine with epinephrine. I dressed and splinted the wound. The patient was sent to the recovery room in good condition, having tolerated the procedure well."
332,Orthopedic," SUBJECTIVE: The patient is here for a follow-up. The patient has a history of lupus, currently on Plaquenil 200-mg b.i.d. Eye report was noted and appreciated. The patient states that she is having some aches and pains of the hands and elbows that started recently a few weeks ago. She denied having any trauma. She states that the pain is bothering her. She denies having any fevers, chills, or any joint effusion or swelling at this point. She noted also that there is some increase in her hair loss in the recent times. OBJECTIVE: The patient is alert and oriented. General physical exam is unremarkable. Musculoskeletal exam reveals positive tenderness in both lateral epicondyles of both elbows, no effusion. Hand examination is unremarkable today. The rest of the musculoskeletal exam is unremarkable. ASSESSMENT: Epicondylitis, both elbows, possibly secondary to lupus flare-up. PLAN: We will inject both elbows with 40-mg of Kenalog mixed with 1 cc of lidocaine. The posterior approach was chosen under sterile conditions. The patient tolerated both procedures well. I will obtain CBC and urinalysis today. If the patient's pain does not improve, I will consider adding methotrexate to her therapy. Sample Doctor M.D."

334,Orthopedic," TITLE OF OPERATION: 1. Removal of painful hardware, first left metatarsal. 2. Excision of nonunion, first left metatarsal. 3. Incorporation of corticocancellous bone graft with internal fixation consisting of screws and plates of the first left metatarsal. PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Nonunion of fractured first left metatarsal osteotomy. 2. Painful hardware, first left metatarsal. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Nonunion of fractured first left metatarsal osteotomy. 2. Painful hardware, first left metatarsal. ANESTHESIA: General anesthesia with local infiltration of 5 mL of 0.5% Marcaine and 1% lidocaine plain with 1:100,000 epinephrine preoperatively and 15 mL of 0.5% Marcaine postoperatively. HEMOSTASIS: Left ankle tourniquet set at 250 mmHg for 60 minutes. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Less than 10 mL. MATERIALS USED: 2-0 Vicryl, 3-0 Vicryl, 4-0 Vicryl, 5-0 Prolene, as well as one corticocancellous allograft consisting of ASIS and one T-type plate prebent with six screw holes and five 3.0 partially threaded cannulated screws and a single 3.0 noncannulated screw from the OsteoMed and Synthes System respectively for the fixation of the bone graft and the plate on the first left metatarsal. INJECTABLES: 1 g Ancef IV 30 minutes preoperatively and the afore-mentioned lidocaine. DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table in the supine position. After general anesthesia was achieved by the anesthesia team, the above-mentioned anesthetic mixture was infiltrated directly into the patient's left foot to anesthetize the future surgical sites. The left ankle was covered with cast padding and an 18-inch ankle tourniquet was placed around the left ankle and set at 250 mmHg. The left foot was then prepped, scrubbed, and draped in normal sterile technique. The left ankle tourniquet was then inflated. Attention was then directed on the dorsal aspect of the first left metatarsal shaft where an 8-cm linear incision was placed directly parallel and medial to the course of the extensor hallucis longus tendon. The incision extended from the base of the first left metatarsal all the way to the first left metatarsophalangeal joint. The incision was deepened through subcutaneous tissues. All the bleeders were identified, cut, clamped, and cauterized. The incision was deepened to the level of the periosteum of the first left metatarsal. All the tendinous neurovascular structures were identified and retracted from the site to be preserved. Using sharp and dull dissection, the periosteal tissues were mobilized from their attachments on the first left metatarsal shaft. Dissection was carried down to the level of the lose screw fixation and the two screws were identified and removed intact. The screws were sent to pathology for examination. The nonunion was also identified closer to the base of the first left metatarsal and using the sagittal saw the nonunion and some of the healthy tissue on both ends of the previous osteotomy were resected and sent to pathology for identification. The remaining two ends of the previous osteotomy were then fenestrated with the use of a 0.045 Kirschner wire to induce bleeding. The corticocancellous bone graft was prepped according to the instructions in saline for at least 60 minutes and then interposed in the previous area of the osteotomy. Provisional fixation with K-wires was achieved and also correction of the bunion deformity of the first left metatarsophalangeal joint was also accomplished. The bone graft was then stabilized with the use of a T-type prebent plate with the use of fixed screws that were inserted using AO technique through the plate and the shaft of the first left metatarsal and compressed appropriately the graft. Removal of the K-wires and examination of fixation and graft incorporation into the previous nonunion area was found to be excellent. The area was flushed copiously flushed with saline. The periosteal and capsular tissues were approximated with 3-0 Vicryl and 2-0 Vicryl suture material. All the subcutaneous tissues were approximated with 4-0 Vicryl suture material and 5-0 Prolene was used to approximate the skin edges at this time. The left ankle tourniquet was deflated. Immediate hyperemia was noted to the entire left lower extremity upon deflation of the cuff. The patient's incision was covered with Xeroform, copious amounts of fluff and Kling, stockinette, and Ace bandage. The patient's left foot was placed in a surgical shoe. The patient was then transferred to the postanesthesia care unit with his vital signs stable and the vascular status at appropriate levels. The patient was given specific instructions and education on how to continue caring for his left foot surgery. The patient was also given pain medications, instructions on how to control his postoperative pain. The patient was eventually discharged from Hospital according to nursing protocol and was advised to follow up with Dr. X's office in one week's time for his first postoperative appointment."

There is a suggestion of generalized osteoporosis. The intervertebral disc spaces appear generally well preserved. The pedicles appear intact. IMPRESSION: 1. Mild chronic-appearing anterior wedging of what is believed to represent the T11 and 12 vertebral bodies. 2. Mild degenerative changes of the thoracic spine. 3. Osteoporosis."
336,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Degenerative osteoarthritis, right knee. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Degenerative osteoarthritis, right knee. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Right knee total arthroplasty. ANESTHESIA: The procedure was done under a subarachnoid block anesthetic in the supine position with a tourniquet utilized. TOTAL TOURNIQUET TIME: Approximately 90 minutes. SPECIFICATIONS: The entire procedure is done in the inpatient operating suite in the Room #1 at ABCD General Hospital. The following sizes of NexGen system were utilized: E on right femur, cemented; 5 tibial stem tray with a 10 mm polyethylene insert, and a 32 mm patellar button. HISTORY AND GROSS FINDINGS: This is a 58-year-old white female suffering increasing right knee pain for number of years prior to surgical intervention. She was completely refractory to conservative outpatient therapy. She had undergone two knee arthroscopies in the years preceding this. They were performed by myself. She ultimately failed this treatment and developed a collapsing-type valgus degenerative osteoarthritis with complete collapse and ware of the lateral compartment and degenerative changes noted to the femoral sulcus that were proved live. Medial compartment had minor changes present. There was no contracture of the lateral collateral ligament, but instead mild laxity on both sides. There was no significant flexion contracture preoperatively. OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: The patient was laid supine upon the operating table after receiving a subarachnoid block anesthetic by the Anesthesia Department. Thigh tourniquet was placed upon the patient's right leg. She was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner. The limb was elevated and exsanguinated and tourniquet placed 325 mmHg for the above noted time. A straight incision was carried down through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Hemostasis was controlled with electrocoagulation. Medial parapatellar arthrotomy was created and the knee cap was everted. The ligaments were balanced. A portion of the fat pad was removed and the ACL was completely removed. Drill hole was made in the distal femur. The size to an E, right. Care was taken to make up for the severe loss of articular cartilage on the posterior condyle in the lateral side. This was checked with the epicondylar abscess and with three degrees of external rotation, drill holes were made. Intramedullary guide was then placed, pegged, and anterior cut carried out. There was excellent resection. It was flat. Distal cutting guide was then placed in five degrees of valgus. Appropriate cuts were carried out. The standard cut was utilized. The finishing guide for E was held with pins as well as screws. Cutting was carried out posterior to anterior, then posterior chamfer and anterior chamfer, femoral sulcus cut was carried out and drill holes for pegs were made. The cutting guide was then removed. The bone was removed. Excess bone was taken out posteriorly. The posterior capsule was loosened up. There were two different fabellas in the posterolateral compartment and they were loosened. Posterolateral corner was then anchored with osteotome and was taken around the posterolateral corner. An extramedullary tibial cutting guide was then placed, pinned, and held. A cut was carried out parallel to the foot. Hard copy ________ was obtained, deemed to be satisfactory after evening up the edges. Trial range of motion was satisfactory. It was necessary to perform a lateral retinacular release to the patella. The patella was isolated. Approximately 10 mm to 11 mm were reamed off. The size to 32 mm button and drill hole guide was placed, impacted, and drilled. Trial range of motion was satisfactory. The tibial guide was then pinned. Drill hole was placed, broached, and utilized. Copious irrigation was carried out. Methylmethacrylate was mixed and was sequentially placed from the femur to the tibia to the patella. The implants were sequentially placed in tibia to femur to patella. Once excess methylmethacrylate was removed and cured, 10 mm Poly was placed. There was excellent ligament balancing. A separate portal was utilized for subcutaneous drain. Tourniquet was deflated and hemostasis was controlled with electrocoagulation. Interrupted #1 Ethibond suture was utilized for parapatellar closure, running #1 Vicryl suture was utilized for overstitch. Trial range of motion was satisfactory. Interrupted #2-0 Vicryl was utilized for subcutaneous fat closure and skin staples were placed to the skin. Adaptic, 4x4s, ABDs, and Webril were placed for compression dressing. Digits were pink and warm with brawny pulses distally at the end of the case. The patient was then transferred to PACU in apparent satisfactory condition. Expected surgical prognosis on this patient is fair."
337,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right hand Dupuytren disease to the little finger. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right hand Dupuytren disease to the little finger. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Excision of Dupuytren disease of the right hand extending out to the proximal interphalangeal joint of the little finger. COMPLICATIONS: None. BLOOD LOSS: Minimal. ANESTHESIA: Bier block. INDICATIONS: The patient is a 51-year-old male with left Dupuytren disease, which is causing contractions both at the metacarpophalangeal and the PIP joint as well as significant discomfort. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was taken to the operating room, laid supine, administered a bier block, and prepped and draped in the sterile fashion. A zig-zag incision was made down the palmar surface of the little finger and under the palm up to the mid palm region. Skin flaps were elevated carefully, dissecting Dupuytren contracture off the undersurface of the flaps. Both neurovascular bundles were identified proximally in the hand and the Dupuytren disease fibrous band was divided proximally, which essentially returned to normal-appearing tissue. The neurovascular bundles were then dissected distally resecting everything medial to the 2 neurovascular bundles and above the flexor tendon sheath all the way out to the PIP joint of the finger where the Dupuytren disease stopped. The wound was irrigated. The neurovascular bundles rechecked with no evidence of any injury and the neurovascular bundles were not significantly involved in the Dupuytren disease. The incisions were closed with 5-0 nylon interrupted sutures. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to the PACU in good condition."
338,Orthopedic," PROCEDURE: Bilateral L5, S1, S2, and S3 radiofrequency ablation. INDICATION: Sacroiliac joint pain. INFORMED CONSENT: The risks, benefits and alternatives of the procedure were discussed with the patient. The patient was given opportunity to ask questions regarding the procedure, its indications and the associated risks. The risk of the procedure discussed include infection, bleeding, allergic reaction, dural puncture, headache, nerve injuries, spinal cord injury, and cardiovascular and CNS side effects with possible of vascular entry of medications. I also informed the patient of potential side effects or reactions to the medications potentially used during the procedure including sedatives, narcotics, nonionic contrast agents, anesthetics, and corticosteroids. The patient was informed both verbally and in writing. The patient understood the informed consent and desired to have the procedure performed. PROCEDURE: Oxygen saturation and vital signs were monitored continuously throughout the procedure. The patient remained awake throughout the procedure in order to interact and give feedback. The x-ray technician was supervised and instructed to operate the fluoroscopy machine. The patient was placed in a prone position on the treatment table with a pillow under the chest and head rotated. The skin over and surrounding the treatment area was cleaned with Betadine. The area was covered with sterile drapes, leaving a small window opening for needle placement. Fluoroscopy was used to identify the bony landmarks of the sacrum and the sacroiliac joints and the planned needle approach. The skin, subcutaneous tissue, and muscle within the planned approach were anesthetized with 1% Lidocaine. With fluoroscopy, a 20 gauge 10-mm bent Teflon coated needle was gently guided into the groove between the SAP and the sacrum for the dorsal ramus of L5 and the lateral border of the posterior sacral foramen, for the lateral branches of S1, S2, and S3. Also, fluoroscopic views were used to ensure proper needle placement. The following technique was used to confirm correct placement. Motor stimulation was applied at 2 Hz with 1 millisecond duration. No extremity movement was noted at less than 2 volts. Following this, the needle trocar was removed and a syringe containing 1% lidocaine was attached. At each level, after syringe aspiration with no blood return, 0.5 mL of 1% lidocaine was injected to anesthetize the lateral branch and the surrounding tissue. After completion, a lesion was created at that level with a temperature of 80 degrees for 90 seconds. All injected medications were preservative free. Sterile technique was used throughout the procedure. ADDITIONAL DETAILS: None. COMPLICATIONS: None. DISCUSSION: Post-procedure vital signs and oximetry were stable. The patient was discharged with instructions to ice the injection site as needed for 15-20 minutes as frequently as twice per hour for the next day and to avoid aggressive activities for 1 day. The patient was told to resume all medications. The patient was told to be in relative rest for 1 day but then could resume all normal activities. The patient was instructed to seek immediate medical attention for shortness of breath, chest pain, fever, chills, increased pain, weakness, sensory or motor changes, or changes in bowel or bladder function. Follow up appointment was made at PM&R Spine Clinic in approximately one to two weeks."
339,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Closed type-III supracondylar fracture, left distal humerus. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Closed type-III supracondylar fracture, left distal humerus. 2. Tethered brachial artery, left elbow. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Closed reduction percutaneous pinning, left distal humerus. SPECIFICATIONS: The entire operative procedure was done in the inpatient operating suite, room #2 at ABCD General Hospital. A portion of the procedure was done in consult with Dr. X with separate dictation by him. HISTORY AND GROSS FINDINGS: This is a 4-year-old white male, apparently dominantly right-handed who suffered a severe injury to his left distal humerus after jumping off of a swing. He apparently had not had previous problems with his left arm. He was seen in the Emergency with a grossly deformed left elbow. His parents' were both present preoperatively. His x-ray exam as well as physical exam was consistent with a closed type-III supracondylar fracture of the left distal humerus with rather severe puckering of the skin anteriorly with significant ecchymosis in the same region. Gross neurologic exam revealed his ulnar, median, and radial nerves to be mostly intact, although a complete exam was impossible. He did have a radial pulse palpable. PROCEDURE: After discussing the alternatives of the case as well as advantages and disadvantages, risks, complications, and expectations with the patient's parents including malunion, nonunion, gross deformity, growth arrest, infection, loss of elbow motions, stiffness, instability, need for surgery in the future, nerve problems, artery problems, and compartment syndrome, they elected to proceed. The patient was laid supine upon operative table after receiving general anesthetic by Anesthesia Department. Closed reduction was accomplished in a sequential manner. Milking of the soft tissue envelope was carried out to try and reduce the shaft of the humerus back into its plane relative to the brachialis muscle and the neurovascular bundle anteriorly. Then a slow longitudinal traction was carried out. The elbow was hyperflexed. Pressure placed upon the olecranon tip and two 0.045 K-wires placed first, one being on the lateral side and with this placement on the medial side of medial epicondyle with care taken to protect the ulnar nerve. The close reduction was deemed to be acceptable once viewed on C-arm. After this, pulse was attempted to be palpated distally. Prior to the procedure, I talked to Dr. X of Vascular Surgery at ABCD Hospital. He had scrubbed in to the case to follow up on the loss of the radial artery distally. This was not present palpatory, but also by Doppler. A weak ulnar artery pulse was present via Doppler. Because of this, the severe displacement of the injury and the fact that the Doppler sound had an occlusion-type sound just above the fracture site or _______. A long discussion was carried out with Dr. X and myself, and we decided to proceed with exploration of the brachial artery. Prior to this, I went out to the waiting room to discuss with the patient's parents, the reasoning what we are going to do and the reasoning for this. I then came back in and then we proceeded. He was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner. Please see Dr. X's report for the discussion of the exploration and release of the brachial artery. There was no indication that it was actually in the fracture site, the soft tissue had tethered in its right angle towards the fracture site, thus reducing its efficiency of providing blood distally. Once it was released, both clinically on the table as well as by Doppler, the patient had bounding pulses. We then proceeded to close utilizing a #4-0 Vicryl for subcutaneous fat closure and a running #5-0 Vicryl subcuticular stitch for skin closure. Steri-Strips were placed. The patient's arm was placed in just a slight degree of flexion with a neutral position. He was splinted posteriorly. Adaptic and fluffs have been placed around the patient's pin sites. K-wires have been bent, cut, and pin caps placed. Expected surgical prognosis on this patient is guarded for the obvious reasons noted above. There is concern for growth plate disturbance. He will be watched very closely for the potential development of re-perfusing compartment syndrome. A full and complete neurologic exam will be impossible tonight, but will be carried on a sequential basis starting tomorrow morning. There is always a potential for loss of elbow motion, overall cosmetic elbow alignment, and elbow function."
340,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Autism with bilateral knee flexion contractures. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Autism with bilateral knee flexion contractures. PROCEDURE: Left distal medial hamstring release. ANESTHESIA: General anesthesia. Local anesthetic 10 mL of 0.25% Marcaine local. TOURNIQUET TIME: 15 minutes. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal. COMPLICATIONS: There were no intraoperative complications. DRAIN: None. SPECIMENS: None. HISTORY AND PHYSICAL: The patient is a 12-year-old boy born at a 32-week gestation and with drug exposure in utero. The patient has diagnosis of autism as well. The patient presented with bilateral knee flexion contractures, initially worse on right than left. He had right distal medial hamstring release performed in February 2007 and has done quite well and has noted significant improvement in his gait and his ability to play. The patient presents now with worsening left knee flexion contracture, and desires the same procedure to be performed. Risks and benefits of the surgery were discussed. The risks of surgery include risk of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of extremity, failure to restore normal anatomy, continued contracture, possible need for other procedures. All questions were answered and mother and son agreed to above plan. PROCEDURE NOTE: The patient was taken to operating room and placed supine on operating table. General anesthesia was administered. The patient received Ancef preoperatively. Nonsterile tourniquet was placed on the upper aspect of the patient's left thigh. The extremity was then prepped and draped in standard surgical fashion. The extremity was wrapped in Esmarch prior to inflation of tourniquet to 250 mmHg. Esmarch was then removed. A small 3 cm incision was made over the distal medial hamstring. Hamstring tendons were isolated and released in order of semitendinosus, semimembranosus, and sartorius. The wound was then irrigated with normal saline and closed used 2-0 Vicryl and then 4-0 Monocryl. The wound was cleaned and dried and dressed with Steri-Strips. The area was infiltrated with total 10 mL of 0.25% Marcaine. The wound was then covered with Xeroform, 4 x 4s, and Bias. Tourniquet was released at 15 minutes. The patient was then placed in knee immobilizer. The patient tolerated the procedure well and subsequently taken to recovery in stable condition. POSTOPERATIVE PLAN: The patient may weight bear as tolerated in his brace. He will start physical therapy in another week or two. The patient restricted from any PE for at least 6 week. He may return to school on 01/04/2008. He was given Vicodin for pain."
341,Orthopedic," EXAM:MRI RIGHT SHOULDER CLINICAL: A 32-year-old male with shoulder pain. FINDINGS: This is a second opinion interpretation of the examination performed on 02/16/06. Normal supraspinatus tendon without surface fraying, gap or fiber retraction and there is no muscular atrophy. Normal infraspinatus and subscapularis tendons. Normal long biceps tendon within the bicipital groove. There is no subluxation of the tendon under the transverse humeral ligament and the intracapsular portion of the tendon is normal. Normal humeral head without fracture or subluxation. There is myxoid degeneration within the superior labrum (oblique coronal images #47-48), but there is no discrete tear. The remaining portions of the labrum are normal without osseous Bankart lesion. Normal superior, middle and inferior glenohumeral ligaments. There is a persistent os acromiale, and there is minimal reactive marrow edema on both sides of the synchondrosis, suggesting that there may be instability (axial images #3 and 4). There is no diastasis of the acromioclavicular joint itself. There is mild narrowing of the subacromial space secondary to the os acromiale, in the appropriate clinical setting, this may be acting as an impinging lesion (sagittal images #56-59). Normal coracoacromial, coracohumeral and coracoclavicular ligaments. There are no effusions or masses. IMPRESSION: Changes in the superior labrum compatible with degeneration without a discrete surfacing tear. There is a persistent os acromiale, and there is reactive marrow edema on both sides of the synchondrosis suggesting instability. There is also mild narrowing of the subacromial space secondary to the os acromiale. This may be acting as an impinging lesion in the appropriate clinical setting. There is no evidence of a rotator cuff tear."
342,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Degenerative disk disease at L4-L5 and L5-S1. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Degenerative disk disease at L4-L5 and L5-S1. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Anterior exposure diskectomy and fusion at L4-L5 and L5-S1. ANESTHESIA: General. COMPLICATIONS: None. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 150 mL. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: Patient was prepped and draped in sterile fashion. Left lower quadrant incision was performed and taken down to the preperitoneal space with the use of the Bovie, and then preperitoneal space was opened. The iliac veins were carefully mobilized medially, and then the L4-L5 disk space was confirmed by fluoroscopy, and diskectomy fusion, which will be separately dictated by Dr. X, was performed after the adequate exposure was gained, and then after this L4-L5 disk space was fused and the L5-S1 disk space was carefully identified between the iliac vessels and the presacral veins and vessels were ligated with clips, disk was carefully exposed. Diskectomy and fusion, which will be separately dictated by Dr. X, were performed. Once this was completed, all hemostasis was confirmed. The preperitoneal space was reduced. X-ray confirmed adequate positioning and fusion. Then the fascia was closed with #1 Vicryl sutures, and then the skin was closed in 2 layers, the first layer being 2-0 Vicryl subcutaneous tissues and then a 4-0 Monocryl subcuticular stitch, then dressed with Steri-Strips and 4 x 4's. Then patient was placed in the prone position after vascular checks of the lower extremity confirmed patency of the arteries with warm bilateral lower extremities."
343,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Cellulitis with associated abscess, right foot. 2. Foreign body, right foot. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Cellulitis with associated abscess, right foot. 2. Foreign body, right foot. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: 1. Irrigation debridement. 2. Removal of foreign body of right foot. ANESTHESIA: Spinal with sedation. COMPLICATIONS: None. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal. GROSS FINDINGS: Include purulent material from the abscess located in the plantar aspect of the foot between the third and fourth metatarsal heads. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 61-year-old Caucasian male with a history of uncontrolled diabetes mellitus. The patient states that he was working in his garage over the past few days when he noticed some redness and edema in his right foot. He notes some itching as well as increasing pain and redness in the right foot and presented to ABCD General Hospital Emergency Room. He was evaluated by the Emergency Room staff as well as the medical team and the Department of Orthopedics. It was noted upon x-ray a foreign body in his foot and he had significant amount of cellulitis as well ________ right lower extremity. After a long discussion held with the patient, it was elected to proceed with irrigation debridement and removal of the foreign body. PROCEDURE: After all potential complications, risks, as well as anticipated benefits of the above-named procedures were discussed at length with the patient, informed consent was obtained. The operative extremity was then confirmed with the patient, operative surgeon, the Department of Anesthesia and nursing staff. The patient was then transferred to preoperative area to Operative Suite #5 and placed on the operating table in supine position. All bony prominences were well padded at this time. The Department of Anesthesia was administered spinal anesthetic to the patient. Once this anesthesia was obtained, the patient's right lower extremity was sterilely prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. Upon viewing of the plantar aspect of the foot, there was noted to be a swollen ecchymotic area with a small hole in it, which purulent fluid was coming from. At this time, after all bony and soft tissue landmarks were identified as well as the localization of the pus, a 2 cm longitudinal incision was made directly over this area, which was located between the second and third metatarsal heads. Upon incising this, there was a foul smelling purulent fluid, which flowed from this region. Aerobic and anaerobic cultures were taken as well as gram stain. The area was explored and it ________ to the dorsum of the foot. There was no obvious joint involvement. After all loculations were broken, 3 liters antibiotic-impregnated fluid were pulse-evac through the wound. The wound was again inspected with no more gross purulent or necrotic appearing tissue. The wound was then packed with an iodoform gauge and a sterile dressing was applied consisting of 4x4s, floss, and Kerlix covered by an Ace bandage. At this time, the Department of Anesthesia reversed the sedation. The patient was transferred back to the hospital gurney to Postanesthesia Care Unit. The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no complications. DISPOSITION: The patient will be followed on a daily basis for possible repeat irrigation debridement."
344,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Cervical spondylotic myelopathy with cord compression and cervical spondylosis. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Cervical spondylotic myelopathy with cord compression and cervical spondylosis. In addition to this, he had a large herniated disk at C3-C4 in the midline. PROCEDURE: Anterior cervical discectomy fusion C3-C4 and C4-C5 using operating microscope and the ABC titanium plates fixation with bone black bone procedure. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient placed in the supine position, the neck was prepped and draped in the usual fashion. Incision was made in the midline the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid at the level of C4. Skin, subcutaneous tissue, and vertebral muscles divided longitudinally in the direction of the fibers and the trachea and esophagus was retracted medially. The carotid sheath was retracted laterally after dissecting the longus colli muscle away from the vertebral osteophytes we could see very large osteophytes at C4-C5. It appeared that the C5-C6 disk area had fused spontaneously. We then confirmed that position by taking intraoperative x-rays and then proceeded to do discectomy and fusion at C3-C4, C4-C5. After placing distraction screws and self-retaining retractors with the teeth beneath the bellies of the longus colli muscles, we then meticulously removed the disk at C3-C4, C4-C5 using the combination of angled strip, pituitary rongeurs, and curettes after we had incised the anulus fibrosus with #15 blade. Next step was to totally decompress the spinal cord using the operating microscope and high-speed cutting followed by the diamond drill with constant irrigation. We then drilled off the uncovertebral osteophytes and midline osteophytes as well as thinning out the posterior longitudinal ligaments. This was then removed with 2-mm Kerrison rongeur. After we removed the posterior longitudinal ligament, we could see the dura pulsating nicely. We did foraminotomies at C3-C4 as well as C4-C5 as well. After having totally decompressed both the cord as well as the nerve roots of C3-C4, C4-C5, we proceeded to the next step, which was a fusion. We sized two 8-mm cortical cancellous grafts and after distracting the bone at C3-C4, C4-C5, we gently tapped the grafts into place. The distraction was removed and the grafts were now within. We went to the next step for the procedure, which was the instrumentation and stabilization of the fused area. We then placed a titanium ABC plate from C3-C5, secured it with 16-mm titanium screws. X-rays showed good position of the screws end plate. The next step was to place Jackson-Pratt drain to the vertebral fascia. Meticulous hemostasis was obtained. The wound was closed in layers using 2-0 Vicryl for the subcutaneous tissue. Steri-Strips were used for skin closure. Blood loss less than about 200 mL. No complications of the surgery. Needle counts, sponge count, and cottonoid count was correct."
345,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left knee medial femoral condyle osteochondritis dissecans. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left knee medial femoral condyle osteochondritis dissecans. PROCEDURES: Left knee arthroscopy with removal of the cartilage loose body and microfracture of the medial femoral condyle with chondroplasty. ANESTHESIA: General. TOURNIQUET TIME: Thirty-seven minutes. MEDICATIONS: The patient also received 30 mL of 0.5% Marcaine local anesthetic at the end of the case. COMPLICATIONS: No intraoperative complications. DRAINS AND SPECIMENS: None. INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS: The patient had a loose body that was found in the suprapatellar pouch upon entry of the camera. This loose body was then subsequently removed. It measured 24 x 14 mm. This was actually the OCD lesion seen on the MRI that had come from the weightbearing surface of just the lateral posterior aspect of the medial femoral condyle HISTORY AND PHYSICAL: The patient is 13-year-old male with persistent left knee pain. He was initially seen at Sierra Pacific Orthopedic Group where an MRI demonstrated unstable OCD lesion of the left knee. The patient presented here for a second opinion. Surgery was recommended grossly due to the instability of the fragment. Risks and benefits of surgery were discussed. The risks of surgery include risk of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion extremity, failure to relieve pain or restore the articular cartilage, possible need for other surgical procedures, and possible early arthritis. All questions were answered and parents agreed to the above plan. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating table. General anesthesia was then administered. The patient received Ancef preoperatively. A nonsterile tourniquet was placed on the upper aspect of the patient's left thigh. The extremity was then prepped and draped in standard surgical fashion. The standard portals were marked on the skin. The extremity was wrapped in Esmarch prior to inflation of tourniquet to 250 mmHg. The portal incisions were then made by an #11 blade. Camera was inserted into the lateral joint line. There was a noted large cartilage loose body in the suprapatellar pouch. This was subsequently removed with extension of the anterolateral portal. Visualization of the rest of the knee revealed significant synovitis. The patient had a large cartilage defect in the posterolateral aspect of the medial femoral condyle. The remainder of the knee demonstrated no other significant cartilage lesions, loose bodies, plica or meniscal pathology. ACL was also visualized to be intact in the intracondylar notch. Attention was then turned back to the large defect. The loose cartilage was debrided using a shaver. Microfracture technique was then performed to 4 mm depth at 2 to 3 mm distances. Tourniquet was released at the end of the case to ensure that there was fat and bleeding at the microfracture sites. All instruments were then removed. The portals were closed using #4-0 Monocryl. A total of 30 mL of 0.5% Marcaine was injected into the knee. Wounds were then cleaned and dried, and dressed in Steri-Strips, Xeroform, 4 x 4s, and bias. The patient was then placed in a knee immobilizer. The patient tolerated the procedure well. The tourniquet was released at 37 minutes. He was taken to recovery in stable condition. POSTOPERATIVE PLAN: The loose cartilage fragment was given to the family. The intraoperative findings were relayed with intraoperative photos. There was a large deficit in the weightbearing portion of medial femoral condyle. His prognosis is guarded given the fact of the fragile lesion and location, but in advantages of his age and his rehab potential down the road, if the patient still has symptoms, he may be a candidate for osteochondral autograft, a procedure which is not performed at Children's or possible cartilaginous transplant. All questions were answered. The patient will follow up in 10 days, may wet the wound in 5 days."
346,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Recurrent anterior dislocating left shoulder. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Recurrent anterior dislocating left shoulder. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Arthroscopic debridement of the left shoulder with attempted arthroscopic Bankart repair followed by open Bankart arthroplasty of the left shoulder. PROCEDURE: The patient was taken to OR #2, administered general anesthetic after ineffective interscalene block had been administered in the preop area. The patient was positioned in the modified beachchair position utilizing the Mayfield headrest. The left shoulder was propped posteriorly with a rolled towel. His head was secured to the Mayfield headrest. The left shoulder and upper extremity were then prepped and draped in the usual manner. A posterior lateral port was made for _____ the arthroscopic cannula. The scope was introduced into the glenohumeral joint. There was noted to be a complete tear of the anterior glenoid labrum off from superiorly at about 11:30 extending down inferiorly to about 6 o'clock. The labrum was adherent to the underlying capsule. The margin of the glenoid was frayed in this area. The biceps tendon was noted to be intact. The articular surface of the glenoid was fairly well preserved. The articular surface on the humeral head was intact; however, there was a large Hill-Sachs lesion on the posterolateral aspect of the humeral head. The rotator cuff was visualized and noted to be intact. The axillary pouch was visualized and it was free of injury. There were some cartilaginous fragments within the axillary pouch. Attention was first directed after making an anterior portal to fixation of the anterior glenoid labrum. Utilizing the Chirotech system through the anterior cannula, the labrum was secured with the pin and drill component and was then tacked back to the superior glenoid rim at about the 11 o'clock position. A second tack was then placed at about the 8 o'clock position. The labrum was then probed and was noted to be stable. With some general ranging of the shoulder, the tissue was pulled out from the tacks. An attempt was made at placement of two other tacks; however, the tissue was not of good quality to be held in position. Therefore, all tacks were either buried down to a flat surface or were removed from the anterior glenoid area. At this point, it was deemed that an open Bankart arthroplasty was necessary. The arthroscopic instruments were removed. An anterior incision was made extending from just lateral of the coracoid down toward the axillary fold. The skin incision was taken down through the skin. Subcutaneous tissues were then separated with the coag Bovie to provide hemostasis. The deltopectoral fascia was identified. It was split at the deltopectoral interval and the deltoid was reflected laterally. The subdeltoid bursa was then removed with rongeurs. The conjoint tendon was identified. The deltoid and conjoint tendons were then retracted with a self-retaining retractor. The subscapularis tendon was identified. It was separated about a centimeter from its insertion, leaving the tissue to do sew later. The subscapularis was reflected off superiorly and inferiorly and the muscle retracted medially. This allowed for visualization of the capsule. The capsule was split near the humeral head insertion leaving a tag for repair. It was then split longitudinally towards the glenoid at approximately 9 o'clock position. This provided visualization of the glenohumeral joint. The friable labral and capsular tissue was identified. The glenoid neck was already prepared for suturing, therefore, three Mitek suture anchors were then positioned to place at approximately 7 o'clock, 9 o'clock, and 10 o'clock. The sutures were passed through the labral capsular tissue and tied securely. At this point, the anterior glenoid rim had been recreated. The joint was then copiously irrigated with gentamicin solution and suctioned dry. The capsule was then repaired with interrupted #1 Vicryl suture and repaired back to its insertion site with #1 Vicryl suture. This later was then copiously irrigated with gentamicin solution and suctioned dry. Subscapularis was reapproximated on to the lesser tuberosity of the humerus utilizing interrupted #1 Vicryl suture. This later was then copiously irrigated as well and suctioned dry. The deltoid fascia was approximated with running #2-0 Vicryl suture. Subcutaneous tissues were approximated with interrupted #2-0 Vicryl and the skin was approximated with a running #4-0 subcuticular Vicryl followed by placement of Steri-Strips. 0.25% Marcaine was placed in the subcutaneous area for postoperative analgesia. The patient was then placed in a shoulder immobilizer after a bulky dressing had been applied. The patient was then transferred to the recovery room in apparent satisfactory condition."
347,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Rotated cuff tear, right shoulder. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Rotated cuff tear, right shoulder. 2. Glenoid labrum tear. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: 1. Arthroscopy with arthroscopic glenoid labrum debridement. 2. Subacromial decompression. 3. Rotator cuff repair, right shoulder. SPECIFICATIONS: Intraoperative procedure was done at Inpatient Operative Suite, room #1 at ABCD Hospital. This was done under interscalene and subsequent general anesthetic in the modified beach chair position. HISTORY AND GROSS FINDINGS: The patient is a 48-year-old with male who has been suffering increasing right shoulder pain for a number of months prior to surgical intervention. He was completely refractory to conservative outpatient therapy. After discussing the alternative care as well as the advantages, disadvantages, risks, complications, and expectations, he elected to undergo the above stated procedure on this date. Intraarticularly, the joint was observed. There was noted to be a degenerative glenoid labrum tear. The biceps complex was otherwise intact. There were minimal degenerative changes at the glenohumeral joint. Rotator cuff tear was appreciated on the inner surface. Subacromially, the same was true. This was an elliptical to V-type tear. The patient has a grossly positive type III acromion. OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: The patient was laid supine on the operating table after receiving interscalene and then general anesthetic by the Anesthesia Department. He was safely placed in modified beach chair position. He was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner. Portals were created outside to end, posterior to anterior, and ultimately laterally in the typical fashion. Upon complete diagnostic arthroscopy was carried out in the intraarticular aspect of the joint, a 4.2 meniscus shaver was placed anteriorly with the scope posteriorly. Debridement was carried out to the glenoid labrum. The biceps was probed and noted to be intact. Undersurface of the rotator cuff was debrided with the shaver along with debridement of the subchondral region of the greater tuberosity attachment. After this, instrumentation was removed. The scope was placed subacromially and a lateral portal created. Gross bursectomy was carried out in a stepwise fashion to the top part of the cuff as well as in the gutters. An anterolateral portal was created. Sutures were placed via express silk as well as other sutures with a #2 fiber wire. With passing of the suture, they were tied with a slip-tight knot and then two half stitches. There was excellent reduction of the tear. Superolateral portal was then created. A #1 Mitek suture anchor was then placed in the posterior cuff to bring this over to bleeding bone. _______ suture was placed. The implant was put into place. The loop was grabbed and it was impacted in the previously drilled holes. There was excellent reduction of the tear. Trial range of motion was carried out and seemed to be satisfactory. Prior to this, a subacromial decompression was accomplished after release of CA ligament with the vapor Bovie. A 4.8 motorized barrel burr was utilized to sequentially take this down from the type III acromion to a flat type I acromion. After all was done, copious irrigation was carried out throughout the joint. Gross bursectomy lightly was carried out to remove all bony elements. A pain buster catheter was placed through a separate portal and cut to length. 0.5% Marcaine was instilled after portals were closed with #4-0 nylon. Adaptic, 4 x 4s, ABDs, and Elastoplast tape placed for dressing. The patient was ultimately transferred to his cart and PACU in apparent satisfactory condition. Expected surgical prognosis of this patient is fair."
348,Orthopedic," CHIEF COMPLAINT: Right shoulder pain. HISTORY OF PRESENT PROBLEM: XYZ has had a six-month history of some right shoulder pain, and it has not gotten much better. She does not have a history of trauma. It does bother her at night when she sleeps, and she is here now to have it checked out. She has no other focal findings, no numbness or tingling to the fingers and no soreness at the elbow or neck. She is right hand dominant. CLINICAL/PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Musculoskeletal: Reveals a positive Hawkins sign to the right shoulder with full range of motion and minor tenderness in the rhomboids and to palpation along the ridge of the scapula. No winging of the scapula. Internal/external rotation is intact. No obvious signs of rotator cuff pathology or slack lesion. Elbow and wrist exams are otherwise unremarkable. Contralateral hand exam for comparison reveals no focal findings. CLINICAL IMPRESSION: Right shoulder impingement. EVALUATION/TREATMENT PLAN: At this point, with her consent, explaining the risks and benefits, we talked about cortisone shots. We will try some therapy, pain medicine only as needed and a sleep aide as needed, and then followup. If it is not better, she could consider an MRI before coming to visit and we will reassess. We will consider a cortisone shot at that point. All questions were answered. Therapy for shoulder impingement was outlined."
349,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Chondromalacia patella. 2. Patellofemoral malalignment syndrome. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Grade-IV chondromalacia patella. 2. Patellofemoral malalignment syndrome. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: 1. Diagnostic arthroscopy with partial chondroplasty of patella. 2. Lateral retinacular release. 3. Open tibial tubercle transfer with fixation of two 4.5 mm cannulated screws. ANESTHESIA: General. COMPLICATIONS: None. TOURNIQUET TIME: Approximately 70 minutes at 325 mmHg. INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS: Grade-IV chondromalacia noted to the central and lateral facet of the patella. There was a grade II to III chondral changes to the patellar groove. The patella was noted to be displaced laterally riding on the edge of the lateral femoral condyle. The medial lateral meniscus showed small amounts of degeneration, but no frank tears were seen. The articular surfaces and the remainder of the knee appeared intact. Cruciate ligaments also appeared intact to direct stress testing. HISTORY: This is a 36-year-old Caucasian female with a long-standing history of right knee pain. She has been diagnosed in the past with chondromalacia patella. She has failed conservative therapy. It was discussed with her the possibility of a arthroscopy lateral release and a tubercle transfer (anterior medialization of the tibial tubercle) to release stress from her femoral patellofemoral joint. She elected to proceed with the surgical intervention. All risks and benefits of the surgery were discussed with her. She was in agreement with the treatment plan. PROCEDURE: On 09/04/03, she was taken to Operating Room at ABCD General Hospital. She was placed supine on the operating table with the general anesthesia administered by the Anesthesia Department. Her leg was placed in a Johnson knee holder and sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion. A stab incision was made in inferolateral and parapatellar regions. Through this the cannula was placed and the knee was inflated with saline solution. Intraoperative pictures were obtained. The above findings were noted. Second portal site was initiated in the inferomedial parapatellar region. Through this, a arthroscopic shaver was placed and the chondroplasty in the patella was performed and removed the loose articular debris. Next, the camera was placed through the inferomedial portal. An arthroscopic Bovie was placed through the inferolateral portal. A release of lateral retinaculum was then performed using the Bovie. Hemostasis was controlled with electrocautery. Next, the knee was suctioned dry. An Esmarch was used to exsanguinate the lower extremity. Tourniquet was inflated to 325 mmHg. An oblique incision was made along the medial parapatellar region of the knee. The subcuticular tissues were carefully dissected and the hemostasis was again controlled with electrocautery. The retinaculum was then incised in line with the incision. The patellar tendon was identified. The lateral and medial border of the tibial tubercle were cleared of all soft tissue debris. Next, an osteotome was then used to cut the tibial tubercle to 45 degree angle leaving the base of the bone incision intact. The tubercle was then pushed anteriorly and medially decreasing her Q-angle and anteriorizing the tibial tubercle. It was then held in place with a Steinmann pin. Following this, a two 4.5 mm cannulated screws, partially threaded, were drilled in place using standard technique to help fixate the tibial tubercle. There was excellent fixation noted. The Q-angle was noted to be decreased to approximately 15 degrees. She was transferred approximately 1 cm in length. The wound was copiously irrigated and suctioned dry. The medial retinaculum was then plicated causing further medialization of the patella. The retinaculum was reapproximated using #0 Vicryl. Subcuticular tissue were reapproximated with #2-0 Vicryl. Skin was closed with #4-0 Vicryl running PDS suture. Sterile dressing was applied to the lower extremities. She was placed in a Donjoy knee immobilizer locked in extension. It was noted that the lower extremity was warm and pink with good capillary refill following deflation of the tourniquet. She was transferred to recovery room in apparent stable and satisfactory condition. Prognosis of this patient is poor secondary to the advanced degenerative changes to the patellofemoral joint. She will remain in the immobilizer approximately six weeks allowing the tubercle to reapproximate itself to the proximal tibia."
350,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Painful enlarged navicula, right foot. 2. Osteochondroma of right fifth metatarsal. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Painful enlarged navicula, right foot. 2. Osteochondroma of right fifth metatarsal. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: 1. Partial tarsectomy navicula, right foot. 2. Partial metatarsectomy, right foot. HISTORY: This 41-year-old Caucasian female who presents to ABCD General Hospital with the above chief complaint. The patient states that she has extreme pain over the navicular bone with shoe gear as well as history of multiple osteochondromas of unknown origin. She states that she has been diagnosed with hereditary osteochondromas. She has had previous dissection of osteochondromas in the past and currently has not been diagnosed in her feet as well as spine and back. The patient desires surgical treatment at this time. PROCEDURE: An IV was instituted by the Department of Anesthesia in the preoperative holding area. The patient was transported to the operating room and placed on operating table in the supine position with a safety belt across her lap. Copious amounts of Webril were placed on the left ankle followed by a blood pressure cuff. After adequate sedation by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 5 cc of 1:1 mixture of 1% lidocaine plain and 0.5% Marcaine plain were injected in the diamond block type fashion around the navicular bone as well as the fifth metatarsal. Foot was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile orthopedic fashion. Foot was elevated from the operating table and exsanguinated with an Esmarch bandage. The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was then inflated to 250 mmHg. The foot was lowered as well as the operating table. The sterile stockinet was reflected and the foot was cleansed with wet and dry sponge. Attention was then directed to the navicular region on the right foot. The area was palpated until the bony prominence was noted. A curvilinear incision was made over the area of bony prominence. At that time, a total of 10 cc with addition of 1% additional lidocaine plain was injected into the surgical site. The incision was then deepened with #15 blade. All vessels encountered were ligated for hemostasis. The dissection was carried down to the level of the capsule and periosteum. A linear incision was made over the navicular bone obliquely from proximal dorsal to distal plantar over the navicular bone. The periosteum and the capsule were then reflected from the navicular bone at this time. A bony prominence was noted both medially and plantarly to the navicular bone. An osteotome and mallet were then used to resect the enlarged portion of the navicular bone. After resection with an osteotome there was noted to be a large plantar shelf. The surrounding soft tissues were then freed from this plantar area. Care was taken to protect the attachments of the posterior tibial tendon as much as possible. Only minimal resection of its attachment to the fiber was performed in order to expose the bone. Sagittal saw was then used to resect the remaining plantar medial prominent bone. The area was then smoothed with reciprocating rasp until no sharp edges were noted. The area was flushed with copious amount of sterile saline at which time there was noted to be a palpable ________ where the previous bony prominence had been noted. The area was then again flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline and the capsule and periosteum were then reapproximated with #3-0 Vicryl. The subcutaneous tissues were then reapproximated with #4-0 Vicryl to reduce tension from the incision and running #5-0 Vicryl subcuticular stitch was performed. Attention was then directed to the fifth metatarsal. There was noted to be a palpable bony prominence dorsally with fifth metatarsal head as well as radiographic evidence laterally of an osteochondroma at the neck of the fifth metatarsal. Approximately 7 cm incision was made dorsolaterally over the fifth metatarsal. The incision was then deepened with #15 blade. Care was taken to preserve the extensor tendon. The incision was then created over the capsule and periosteum of the fifth metatarsal head. Capsule and periosteum were reflected both dorsally, laterally, and plantarly. At that time, there was noted to be a visible osteochondroma on the plantar lateral aspect of the fifth metatarsal neck as well as on the dorsal aspect of the head of the fifth metatarsal. A sagittal saw was used to resect both of these osteal prominences. All remaining sharp edges were then smoothed with reciprocating rasp. The area was inspected for the remaining bony prominences and none was noted. The area was flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline. The capsule and periosteum were then reapproximated with #3-0 Vicryl. Subcutaneous closure was then performed with #4-0 Vicryl in order to reduce tension around the incision line. Running #5-0 subcutaneous stitch was then performed. Steri-Strips were applied to both surgical sites. Dressings consisted of Adaptic, soaked in Betadine, 4x4s, Kling, Kerlix, and Coban. The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and the hyperemic flush was noted to all five digits of the right foot. The patient tolerated the above procedure and anesthesia well without complications. The patient was transferred to the PACU with vital signs stable and vascular status intact. The patient was given postoperative pain prescription and instructed to be partially weightbearing with crutches as tolerated. The patient is to follow-up with Dr. X in his office as directed or sooner if any problems or questions arise."
351,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Foreign body, right foot. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Foreign body, right foot. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: 1. Incision and drainage, right foot. 2. Removal of foreign body, right foot. HISTORY: This 7-year-old Caucasian male is an inpatient at ABCD General Hospital with a history of falling off his bike and having a root ________ angle inside of his foot. The patient has had previous I&D but continues to have to purulent drainage. The patient's parents agreed to performing a surgical procedure to further clean the wound. PROCEDURE: An IV was instituted by the Department of Anesthesia in the preoperative holding area. The patient was transported to the operating room and placed on the operating table in a supine position with a safety strap across his lap. General anesthesia was administered by the Department of Anesthesia. The foot was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile orthopedic fashion. The stockinette was reflected and the foot was cleansed with wet and dry sponge. There was noted to be some remaining periwound erythema. There was noted to be some mild crepitation about 2 cm proximal from the entry wound. The entry wound was noted to be over the third metatarsal head dorsally. Upon inspection of the wound, there was noted to be hard foreign filling substance deep within the wound. The entry site from the foreign body was extended proximally approximately about 0.5 cm. At this time, a large wooden foreign body was visualized and removed with a straight stat. The area was carefully inspected for any remaining piece of foreign body. Several small pieces were noted and they were removed. The area was palpated and there was no more remaining foreign body noted. At this time, the wound was inspected thoroughly. There was noted to be an area along the third metatarsal head more distally that did probe to the bone. There was no purulent drainage expressed. Area was flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline. Pulse lavage was performed with 3 liters of plain sterile saline. Wound cultures were obtained, aerobic and aerobic. The wound was then again inspected for any remaining foreign body or purulent drainage. None was noticed. The wound was packed with sterile new gauze packing lately and dressings consisted of 4x4s, ABDs, Kling, and Kerlix. The patient tolerated the above procedure and anesthesia well without complications. The patient was transported to the PACU with vital signs stable and vascular status intact. The patient is to be readministered to the pediatrics where daily dressing changes will be performed by podiatry. The patient had a postoperative pain prescription written for Tylenol, Elixir with codeine as needed."
352,Orthopedic," DIAGNOSIS: Ankle sprain, left ankle. HISTORY: The patient is a 31-year-old female who was referred to Physical Therapy secondary to a fall on 10/03/08. The patient states that she tripped over her dog toy and fell with her left foot inverted. The patient states that she received a series of x-rays and MRIs that were unremarkable. After approximately 1 month, the patient continued to have significant debilitating pain in her left ankle. She then received a walking boot and has been in the boot for the past month. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for hypertension, asthma, and cervical cancer. The cervical cancer was diagnosed as 15 years old. The patient states that her cancer is &quot;dormant.&quot; MEDICATIONS: 1. Hydrochlorothiazide. 2. Lisinopril. 3. Percocet. The patient states that the Percocet helps to take the edge of her pain, but does not completely eliminate it. SUBJECTIVE: The patient rates the pain at 2/10 on the pain analog scale. The patient states that with elevation and rest, her pain subsides. FUNCTIONAL ACTIVITIES/HOBBIES: Currently limited including basic household chores and activities, this does increases her pain. The patient states she also recently joined Weight Watchers and was involved in a walking routine and is currently unable to participate in this activity. WORK STATUS: The patient is currently on medical leave as a paraprofessional. The patient states that she works as a teacher's aide in the school system and is required to complete extensive walking and standing activities. The patient states that she is primarily on her feet while at work and rarely has a sitting break for extensive period of time. The patient's goal is to be able to stand and walk without pain. SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives in a private home with children and her father. The patient states that she does have stairs to negotiate without the use of a railing. She states that she is able to manage the stairs, however, is very slow with her movement. The patient smokes 1-1/2 packs of cigarettes a day and does not have a history of regular exercise routine. OBJECTIVE: Upon observation, the patient is a very obese female who is ambulating with significant antalgic gait pattern and altered normal gait due to the pain as well as the walking boot. Upon inspection of the left ankle, it appears to have swelling, unsure if this swelling is secondary to injury or water retention as the patient states she has significant water retention. When compared to right ankle edema, it is approximately equal. There is no evidence of discoloration or temperature. The patient states that she had no bruising at the time of injury. Active range of motion of left ankle is as follows: Dorsiflexion is 6 degrees past neutral and plantar flexion is 54 degrees, eversion 20 degrees, and inversion is 30 degrees. Left ankle dorsiflexion lacks 10 degrees from neutral and plantar flexion is 36 degrees, this motion is very painful. The patient was tearful during this activity. Eversion is 3 degrees and inversion is 25 degrees. The patient states this movement was difficult, but not painful. Strength testing of the right lower extremity is grossly 4+-5/5 and left ankle is 2/5 as the patient is unable to obtain full range of motion. PALPATION: The patient is very tender to palpation primarily along the lateral malleolus of the left ankle. JOINT PLAY: Unable to be assessed secondary to the patient's extreme tenderness and guarding of the ankle joint. SPECIAL TESTS: A 6-minute walk test. The patient was able to ambulate approximately 600 feet while wearing her walking boot prior to her pain significantly increasing in the ankle and requiring the test to be stopped. ASSESSMENT: The patient would benefit from skilled physical therapy intervention as a trial of treatment in order to address the following problem list: 1. Increased pain. 2. Decreased range of motion. 3. Decreased strength. 4. Decreased ability to complete work task and functional activities in the home. 5. Decreased gait pattern. SHORT-TERM GOALS TO BE COMPLETED IN 3 WEEKS: 1. The patient will demonstrate independence with home exercise program. 2. The patient will ambulate without her boot for 48 hours in order to decrease reliance upon the boot for ankle stabilization. 3. The patient will achieve left ankle dorsiflexion to neutral and plantar flexion to 45 degrees without significant increase in pain. 4. The patient will demonstrate 3/5 strength of the left ankle. 5. The patient will tolerate the completion of the 6-minute walk test without the use of a boot with minimal increase in pain. LONG-TERM GOALS TO BE COMPLETED IN 6 WEEKS: 1. The patient will report 0/10 pain in the 48-hour period without the use of medication and without wearing her boot. 2. The patient will return to go through the work without the use of the walking boot with report of minimal increase in pain and discomfort. PROGNOSIS: Fair for above-stated goals with full compliance to home exercise program and therapy treatment as well as the patient motivation. PLAN: The patient to be seen three times a week for 6 weeks for the following: 1. Therapeutic exercise with home exercise program in order to improve active range of motion and strength as functional activities. 2. Modalities to include ice and heat. 3. Manual therapy to include joint mobilization and soft tissue mobilization as tolerated. 4. Gait training in order to regain normal gait pattern and avoid any increase in additional joint involvement. I have explained the findings and the plan of care with the patient. The patient states she understands and agrees to comply with treatment and plan of care."
353,Orthopedic," CHIEF COMPLAINT: Left knee pain. SUBJECTIVE: This is a 36-year-old white female who presents to the office today with a complaint of left knee pain. She is approximately five days after a third Synvisc injection. She states that the knee is 35% to 40 % better, but continues to have a constant pinching pain when she full weight bears, cannot handle having her knee in flexion, has decreased range of motion with extension. Rates her pain in her knee as a 10/10. She does alternate ice and heat. She is using Tylenol No. 3 p.r.n. and ibuprofen OTC p.r.n. with minimal relief. ALLERGIES 1. PENICILLIN. 2. KEFLEX. 3. BACTRIM. 4. SULFA. 5. ACE BANDAGES. MEDICATIONS 1. Toprol. 2. Xanax. 3. Advair. 4. Ventolin. 5. Tylenol No. 3. 6. Advil. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Will be starting the Medifast diet, has discussed this with her PCP, who encouraged her to have gastric bypass, but the patient would like to try this Medifast diet first. Other than this, denies any further problems with her eyes, ears, nose, throat, heart, lungs, GI, GU, musculoskeletal, nervous system, except what is noted above and below. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION VITAL SIGNS: Pulse 72, blood pressure 130/88, respirations 16, height 5 feet 6.5 inches. GENERAL: This is a 36-year-old white female who is A&O x3, in no apparent distress with a pleasant affect. She is well developed, well nourished, appears her stated age. EXTREMITIES: Orthopedic evaluation of the left knee reveals there to be well-healed portholes. She does have some medial joint line swelling. Negative ballottement. She has significant pain to palpation of the medial joint line, none of the lateral joint line. She has no pain to palpation on the popliteal fossa. Range of motion is approximately -5 degrees to 95 degrees of flexion. It should be noted that she has extreme hyperextension on the right with 95+ degrees of flexion on the right. She has a click with McMurray. Negative anterior-posterior drawer. No varus or valgus instability noted. Positive patellar grind test. Calf is soft and nontender. Gait is stable and antalgic on the left. ASSESSMENT 1. Osteochondral defect, torn meniscus, left knee. 2. Obesity. PLAN: I have encouraged the patient to work on weight reduction, as this will only benefit her knee. I did discuss treatment options at length with the patient, but I think the best plan for her would be to work on weight reduction. She questions whether she needs a total knee; I don't believe she needs total knee replacement. She may, however, at some point need an arthroscopy. I have encouraged her to start formal physical therapy and a home exercise program. Will use ice or heat p.r.n. I have given her refills on Tylenol No. 3, Flector patch, and Relafen not to be taken with any other anti-inflammatory. She does have some abdominal discomfort with the anti-inflammatories, was started on Nexium 20 mg one p.o. daily. She will follow up in our office in four weeks. If she has not gotten any relief with formal physical therapy and the above-noted treatments, we will discuss with Dr. X whether she would benefit from another knee arthroscopy. The patient shows a good understanding of this treatment plan and agrees."
354,Orthopedic," EXAM:MRI RIGHT ANKLE CLINICAL:This is a 51 year old female who first came into the office 3/4/05 with right ankle pain. She stepped on ice the evening prior and twisted her ankle. PF's showed no frank fracture, dislocation, or subluxations. FINDINGS: Received for interpretation is an MRI examination performed on 4/28/2005. There is a &quot;high ankle sprain&quot; of the distal tibiofibular syndesmotic ligamentous complex involving the anterior tibiofibular ligament with marked ligamentous inflammatory thickening and diffuse interstitial edema. There is osteoarthritic spur formation at the anterior aspect of the fibula with a small 2mm osseous structure within the markedly thickened anterior talofibular ligament suggesting a small ligamentous osseous avulsion. The distal tibiofibular syndesmotic ligamentous complex remains intact without a complete rupture. There is no widening of the ankle mortis. The posterior talofibular ligament remains intact. There is marked ligamentous thickening of the anterior talofibular ligament of the lateral collateral ligamentous complex suggesting the sequela of a remote lateral ankle sprain. There is thickening of the posterior talofibular and calcaneofibular ligaments. There is a flat retromalleolar sulcus. There is a full-thickness longitudinal split tear of the peroneus brevis tendon within the retromalleolar groove. The tear extends to the level of the inferior peroneal retinaculum. There is anterior displacement of the peroneus longus tendon into the split peroneus tendon tear. There is severe synovitis of the peroneus longus tendon sheath with prominent fluid distention. The synovitis extends to the level of the inferior peroneal retinaculum. There is a focal area of chondral thinning of the hyaline cartilage of the medial talar dome with a focal area of subchondral plate cancellous marrow resorption consistent with and area of prior talar dome contusion but there is no focal osteochondral impaction or osteochondral defect. There is minimal fluid within the tibiotalar articulation. There is minimal fluid within the posterior subtalar articulation with mild anterior capsular prolapse.

PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was given intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis and thigh-high TED hoses were placed on the lower extremities while in the preanesthesia holding area. The patient was transported to the operative suite and on to the operative table in the supine position. General endotracheal anesthesia was induced. The head was placed on a well-padded head holder. The eyes and face were protected from pressure. A well-padded roll was placed beneath the neck and shoulders to help preserve the cervical lordosis. The arms were tucked and draped to the sides. All bony prominences were well padded. An x-ray was taken to confirm the correct level of the skin incision. The anterior neck was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. A straight transverse skin incision over the left side of the anterior neck was made and carried down sharply through the skin and subcutaneous tissues to the level of the platysma muscle, which was divided transversely using the electrocautery. The superficial and deep layers of the deep cervical fascia were divided. The midline structures were reflected to the right side. Care was taken during the dissection to avoid injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve and the usual anatomical location of that nerve was protected. The carotid sheath was palpated and protected laterally. An x-ray was taken to confirm the level of C5-C6 and C6-C7. The longus colli muscle was dissected free bilaterally from C5 to C7 using blunt dissection. Hemostasis was obtained using the electrocautery. The blades of the cervical retractor were placed deep to the longus colli muscles bilaterally. At C5-C6, the anterior longitudinal ligament was divided transversely. Straight pituitary rongeurs and a curette were used to remove the contents of the disc space. All cartilages were scraped off the inferior endplate of C5 and from the superior endplate of C6. The disc resection was carried posteriorly to the posterior longitudinal ligament and laterally to the uncovertebral joints. The posterior longitudinal ligament was resected using a 1 mm Kerrison rongeur. Beginning in the midline and extending into both neural foramen, posterior osteophytes were removed using a 1 m and a 2 mm Kerrison rongeurs. The patient was noted to have significant bony spondylosis causing canal and foraminal stenosis as well as a degenerative and protruding disc in agreement with preoperative diagnostic imaging studies. Following completion of the discectomy and osteophytectomy, a blunt nerve hook was passed into the canal superiorly and inferiorly as well as in the both neural foramen to make sure that there were no extruded disc fragments and to make sure the bony decompression was complete. A portion of the uncovertebral joint was resected bilaterally for additional nerve root decompression. Both nerve roots were visualized and noted to be free of encroachment. The same procedure was then carried out at C6-C7 with similar findings. The only difference in the findings was that at C6-C7 on the left side, the patient was found to have an extruded disc fragment in the canal and extending into the left side neural foramen causing significant cord and nerve root encroachment. In preparation for the arthrodesis, the endplates of C5, C6, and C7 were burred in a parallel fashion down to the level of bleeding bone using a high-speed cutting bur with irrigant solution for cooling. The disc spaces were then measured to the nearest millimeter. Attention was then turned toward preparation of the structural allograft, which consisted of two pieces of pre-machined corticocancellous bone. The grafts were further shaped to fit the disc spaces exactly in a press-fit manner with approximately 1.5 mm of distraction at each disc space. The grafts were shaped to be slightly lordotic to help preserve the cervical lordosis. The grafts were impacted into the disc spaces. There was complete bony apposition between the ends of the bone grafts and the vertebral bodies of C5, C6, and C7. A blunt nerve hook was passed posterior to each bone graft to make sure that the bone grafts were in good position. Anterior osteophytes were removed using a high-speed cutting bur with irrigant solution for cooling. An appropriate length Synthes cervical plate was selected and bent slightly to conform to the patient's cervical lordosis. The plate was held in the midline with provided instrumentation while a temporary fixation screw was applied at C6. Screw holes were then drilled using the provided drill and drill guide taking care to avoid injury to neurovascular structures. The plate was then rigidly fixed to the anterior spine using 14-mm cancellous screws followed by locking setscrews added to the head of each screw to prevent postoperative loosening of the plate and/or screws. An x-ray was taken, which confirmed satisfactory postioning of the plate, screws, and bone grafts. Blood loss was minimal. The wound was irrigated with irrigant solution containing antibiotics. The wound was inspected and judged to be dry. The wound was closed over a suction drain placed in the deepest portion of the wound by reapproximating the platysma muscle with #4-0 Vicryl running suture, the subdermal and subcuticular layers with #4-0 Monocryl interrupted sutures, and the skin with Steri-Strips. The sponge and needle count were correct. A sterile dressing was applied to the wound. The neck was placed in a cervical orthosis. The patient tolerated the procedure and was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition."
356,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Stenosing tendinosis, right thumb (trigger finger). POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Stenosing tendinosis, right thumb (trigger finger). PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Release of A1 pulley, right thumb. ANESTHESIA: IV regional with sedation. COMPLICATIONS: None. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal. TOURNIQUET TIME: Approximately 20 minutes at 250 mmHg. INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS: There was noted to be thickening of the A1 pulley. There was a fibrous nodule noted within the flexor tendon of the thumb, which caused triggering sensation to the thumb. HISTORY: This is a 51-year-old right hand dominant female with a longstanding history of pain as well as locking sensation to her right thumb. She was actually able to spontaneously trigger the thumb. She was diagnosed with stenosing tendinosis and wishes to proceed with release of A1 pulley. All risks and benefits of the surgery was discussed with her at length. She was in agreement with the above treatment plan. PROCEDURE: On 08/21/03, she was taken to operating room at ABCD General Hospital and placed supine on the operating table. A regional anesthetic was applied by the Anesthesia Department. Tourniquet was placed on her proximal arm. The upper extremity was sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion. An incision was made over the proximal crease of the thumb. Subcuticular tissues were carefully dissected. Hemostasis was controlled with electrocautery. The nerves were identified and retracted throughout the entire procedure. The fibers of the A1 pulley were identified. They were sharply dissected to release the tendon. The tendon was then pulled up into the wound and inspected. There was no evidence of gross tear noted. Fibrous nodule was noted within the tendon itself. There was no evidence of continuous locking. Once release of the pulley had been performed, the wound was copiously irrigated. It was then reapproximated using #5-0 nylon simple interrupted and horizontal mattress sutures. Sterile dressing was applied to the upper extremity. Tourniquet was deflated. It was noted that the thumb was warm and pink with good capillary refill. The patient was transferred to Recovery in apparent stable and satisfactory condition. Prognosis is fair."
357,Orthopedic," FINAL DIAGNOSES: 1. Herniated nucleuses pulposus, C5-6 greater than C6-7, left greater than C4-5 right with left radiculopathy. 2. Moderate stenosis C5-6. OPERATION: On 06/25/07, anterior cervical discectomy and fusions C4-5, C5-6, C6-7 using Bengal cages and Slimlock plate C4 to C7; intraoperative x-ray. This is a 60-year-old white male who was in the office on 05/01/07 because of neck pain with left radiculopathy and &quot;tension headaches.&quot; In the last year or so, he has had more and more difficulty and more recently has developed tingling and numbness into the fingers of the left hand greater than right. He has some neck pain at times and has seen Dr. X for an epidural steroid injection, which was very helpful. More recently he saw Dr. Y and went through some physical therapy without much relief. Cervical MRI scan was obtained and revealed a large right-sided disc herniation at C4-5 with significant midline herniations at C5-6 and a large left HNP at C6-7. In view of the multiple levels of pathology, I was not confident that anything short of surgical intervention would give him significant relief. The procedure and its risk were fully discussed and he decided to proceed with the operation. HOSPITAL COURSE: Following admission, the procedure was carried out without difficulty. Blood loss was about 125 cc. Postop x-ray showed good alignment and positioning of the cages, plate, and screws. After surgery, he was able to slowly increase his activity level with assistance from physical therapy. He had some muscle spasm and soreness between the shoulder blades and into the back part of his neck. He also had some nausea with the PCA. He had a low-grade fever to 100.2 and was started on incentive spirometry. Over the next 12 hours, his fever resolved and he was able to start getting up and around much more easily. By 06/27/07, he was ready to go home. He has been counseled regarding wound care and has received a neck sheet for instruction. He will be seen in two weeks for wound check and for a followup evaluation/x-rays in about six weeks. He has prescriptions for Lortab 7.5 mg and Robaxin 750 mg. He is to call if there are any problems."
358,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Dorsal ganglion, right wrist. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Dorsal ganglion, right wrist. OPERATIONS PERFORMED: Excision dorsal ganglion, right wrist. ANESTHESIA: Monitored anesthesia care with regional anesthesia applied by surgeon. TOURNIQUET TIME: minutes. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: With the patient under adequate anesthesia, the upper extremity was prepped and draped in a sterile manner. The arm was exsanguinated and the tourniquet was elevated to 290 mm/Hg. A transverse incision was made over the dorsal ganglion. Using blunt dissection the dorsal ulnar sensory nerve branches and radial sensory nerve branches were dissected and retracted out of the operative field. The extensor retinaculum was then incised and the extensor tendon was dissected and retracted out of the operative field. The ganglion was then further dissected to its origin from the dorsal distal scapholunate interosseus ligament and excised in toto. Care was taken to protect ligament integrity. Reactive synovium was then removed using soft tissue rongeur technique. The wound was then infiltrated with 0.25% Marcaine. The tendons were allowed to resume their normal anatomical position. The skin was closed with 3-0 Prolene subcuticular stitch. Sterile dressings were applied. The tourniquet was deflated. The patient was awakened from anesthesia and returned to the recovery room in satisfactory condition having tolerated the procedure well."
359,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Trimalleolar ankle fracture. 2. Dislocation right ankle. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Trimalleolar ankle fracture. 2. Dislocation right ankle. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Closed open reduction and internal fixation of right ankle. ANESTHESIA: Spinal with sedation. COMPLICATIONS: None. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal. TOTAL TOURNIQUET TIME: 75 minutes at 325 mmHg. COMPONENTS: Synthes small fragment set was used including a 2.5 mm drill bed. A six hole one-third tibial plate, one 12 mm 3.5 mm cortical screw fully threaded and two 16 mm 3.5 mm cortical fully-threaded screws. There were two 20 mm 4.0 cancellous screws and one 18 mm 4.0 cancellous screw placed. There were two 4.0 cancellous partially-threaded screws placed. GROSS FINDINGS: Include a comminuted fracture involving the lateral malleolus as well as a medial and posterior malleolus fracture as well. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is an 87-year-old Caucasian female who presented to ABCD General Hospital Emergency Room complaining of right ankle pain status post a trip and fall. The patient noted while walking with a walker, apparently tripped and fell. The patient had significant comorbidities, seen and evaluated by the Emergency Room Department as well as Department of Orthopedics while in the Emergency Room. At that time, a closed reduction was performed and she was placed in a Robert-Jones splint. After complete medical workup and clearance, we elected to take her to the operating room for definitive care. PROCEDURE: After all potential complications and risks as well as risks and benefits of the above-mentioned procedure was discussed at length with the patient and family, informed consent was obtained. The upper extremity was then confirmed with the operating surgeon, the patient, the nursing staff and Department of Anesthesia. The patient was then transferred to preoperative area in the Operative Suite #3 and placed on the operating room table in supine position. At this time, the Department of Anesthesia administered spinal anesthetic to the patient as well as sedation. All bony prominences were well padded at this time. A nonsterile tourniquet was placed on the right upper thigh of the patient. This was then removed and the right lower extremity was sterilely prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. The right lower extremity was then elevated and exsanguinated using Esmarch and tourniquet was then placed to 325 mmHg and kept up to a total of 75 minutes. Next, after all bony and soft tissue landmarks were identified, a 6 cm longitudinal incision was made directly over this vestibule on the right ankle. A sharp dissection was carefully taken down to the level of bone taking care to protect the neurovascular structures. Once the bone was reached, the fractured site was identified. The bony ends were then opened and divided of all hematoma as well as excess periosteum within the fracture site. The wound was copiously irrigated and dried. Next, the fracture was then reduced in anatomic position. There was noted to be quite a bit of comminution as well as soft overall status of the bone. It was held in place with reduction forceps. A six hole one-third tubular Synthes plate was then selected for instrumentation. It was contoured using ________ and placed on the lateral aspect of the distal fibula. Next, the three most proximal holes were sequentially drilled using a 2.5 mm drill bed, depth gauged and then a 3.5 mm fully threaded cortical screw was placed in each. The most proximal was a 12 mm and the next two were 16 mm in length. Next, the three most distal holes were sequentially drilled using a 2.5 mm drill bed, depth gauged, and a 4.0 cancellous screw was placed in each hole. The most distal with a 20 mm and two most proximal were 18 mm in length. Next the Xi-scan was used to visualize the hardware placement as well as the fracture reduction appeared to be in good anatomic position, all hardware was in good position. There was no lateralization of the joints. Attention was then directed towards the medial aspect of the ankle. Again, after all bony and soft tissue landmarks were identified, a 4 cm longitudinal incision was made directly over the medial malleolus. Again, the dissection was carefully taken down the level of the fracture site. The retractors were then placed to protect all neurovascular structures. Once the fracture site was identified, it was dried of all hematoma as well as excess periosteum. The fracture site was then displaced and the ankle joint was visualized including the dome of the talus. There appeared to be some minor degenerative changes of the talus, but no loose bodies. Next, the wound was copiously irrigated and suctioned dry. The medial malleolus was placed in reduced position and held in place with a 1.25 mm K-wire. Next, the 2.5 mm drill bed was then used to sequentially drill holes to full depth and 4.0 cancellous screws were placed in each, each with a 45 mm in length. These appeared to hold the fracture site securely in an anatomic position. Again, Xi-scan was brought in to confirm placement of the screws. They were in good overall position and there was no lateralization of the joint. At this time, each wound was copiously irrigated and suctioned dry. The wounds were then closed using #2-0 Vicryl suture in subcutaneous fashion followed by staples on the skin. A sterile dressing was applied consistent with Adaptic, 4x4s, Kerlix, and Webril. A Robert-Jones style splint was then placed on the right lower extremity. This was covered by a 4-inch Depuy dressing. At this time, the Department of Anesthesia reversed the sedation. The patient was transferred back to the hospital gurney and to the Postanesthetic Care Unit. The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no complications."
360,Orthopedic," HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is an 18-year-old girl brought in by her father today for evaluation of a right knee injury. She states that approximately 3 days ago while playing tennis she had a non-contact injury in which she injured the right knee. She had immediate pain and swelling. At this time, she complains of pain and instability in the knee. The patient's past medical history is significant for having had an ACL injury to the knee in 2008. She underwent anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction by Dr. X at that time, subsequently in the same year she developed laxity of the graft due in part to noncompliance and subsequently, she sought attention from Dr. Y who performed a revision ACL reconstruction at the end of 2008. The patient states she rehabbed the knee well after that and did fine with good stability of the knee until this recent injury. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: She claims no chronic illnesses. PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: She had an anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction in 03/2008, and subsequently had a revision ACL reconstruction in 12/2008. She has also had arm surgery when she was 6 years old. MEDICATIONS: She takes no medications on a regular basis ALLERGIES: She is allergic to Keflex and has skin sensitivity to Steri-Strips. SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is single. She is a full-time student at University. Uses no tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs. She exercises weekly, mainly tennis and swelling. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Significant for recent weight gain, occasional skin rashes. The remainder of her systems negative. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION GENERAL: The patient is 4 foot 10 inches tall, weighs 110 pounds. EXTREMITIES: She ambulates with some difficulty with a marked limp on the right side. Inspection of the knee reveals a significant effusion in the knee. She has difficulty with passive range of motion of the knee secondary to pain. She does have tenderness to palpation at the medial joint line and has a positive Lachman's exam. NEUROVASCULAR: She is neurovascularly intact. IMPRESSION: Right knee injury suggestive of a recurrent anterior cruciate ligament tear, possible internal derangement. PLAN: The patient will be referred for an MRI of the right knee to evaluate the integrity of her revision ACL graft. In the meantime, she will continue to use ice as needed. Moderate her activities and use crutches. She will follow up as soon as the MRI is performed."

HISTORY: This 51-year-old female presented to ABCD preoperative holding area after keeping herself NPO since mid night for surgery on her painful right foot bunion, hammer toes, and Tailor's bunion. The patient has a long history of crippling severe rheumatoid arthritis. She has pain with shoe gear and pain with every step. She has tried multiple conservative measures under Dr. X's supervision consisting of wide shoe's and accommodative padding all which have provided inadequate relief. At this time, she desires attempted surgical reconstruction/correction. The consent is available on the chart for review and the risks versus benefits of this procedure have been discussed with patient in detail by Dr. X. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: After IV was established by the Department of Anesthesia, the patient was taken to the operating room via cart and placed on the operating table in a supine position and a safety strap was placed across her waist for her protection. Next, copious amounts of Webril were applied about the right ankle and a pneumatic ankle tourniquet was applied over the Webril. Next, after adequate IV sedation was administered by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 20 cc of 1:1 mixture of 0.5% Marcaine plain and 1% lidocaine were instilled into the right foot using a standard ankle block technique. Next, the foot was prepped and draped in the usual aseptic fashion. An Esmarch bandage was used to exsanguinate the foot and the pneumatic ankle tourniquet was elevated to 230 mmHg. The foot was lowered in the operative field. The sterile stockinette was reflected and attention was directed to the right first metatarsophalangeal joint. The joint was found to be severely contracted with lateral deviation of the hallux with a slightly overlapping contracted second toe. In addition, the range of motion was less than 5 degrees of the first ray. There was medial pinch callus and callus on the plantar right second metatarsal. Using a #10 blade, a linear incision over the first metatarsophalangeal joint was then created approximately 4 cm in length. Next, a #15 blade was used to deepen the incision to the subcutaneous tissue all which was found to be very thin taking care to protect the medial neurovascular bundle and the lateral extensor hallucis longus tendon. Any small vein traversing the operative site were clamped with hemostat and ligated with electrocautery. Next, the medial and lateral wound margins were undermined with sharp dissection. The joint capsule was then visualized. Two apparent soft tissue masses probably consistent with rheumatoid nodules were found at the distal medial aspect of the first metatarsal capsule. A dorsal linear incision to the capsular tissue down to bone was performed with a #15 blade. The capsule and periosteal tissues were elevated sharply off the metatarsal head and the base of proximal phalanx. A large amount of hypertrophic synovium was encountered over the metatarsophalangeal joint. In addition, multiple hypertrophic exostosis were found dorsally, medially, and laterally over the metatarsal. Upon entering the joint, the base of the proximal phalanx was grossly deformed and the medial and lateral aspect were widely flared and encompassing the metatarsal head. A sagittal saw was used to carefully remove the base of the proximal phalanx just distal to the metaphyseal flare. Next, the bone was passed out as specimen. The head of the metatarsal had evidence of erosion and eburnation. The tibial sesamoid was practically absent, but was found to be a conglomeration of hypertrophic synovium and poorly differentiated appearing exostosis and bony tissue. This was hindering the range of motion of the joint and was removed. The fibular sesamoid was in the interspace. A lateral release was performed in addition. Next, the McGlamry elevators were inserted into the first metatarsal head and all of the plantar adhesions were freed. The metatarsal head was remodeled with a sagittal saw and all of the medial eminence the dorsal and lateral hypertropic bone was removed and the metatarsal head was shaped into more acceptable contoured structure. Next, the Biopro sizer was used and it was found that a median large implant would be the best fit for this patient's joint. A small drill hole was made in the central aspect at the base of the proximal phalanx. The trial sizer median large was placed in the joint and an excellent fit and increased range of motion was observed. Next, the joint was flushed with copious amounts of saline. A median large porous Biopro implant was inserted using the standard technique and was tapped with the mallet into position. It had an excellent fit and the range of motion again was markedly increased from the preoperative level. Next, the wound was again flushed with copious amounts of saline. The flexor tendon was inspected and was found to be intact plantarly. A #3-0 Vicryl was used to close the capsule in a running fashion. A medial capsulorrhaphy performed and the toe assumed to more rectus position and the joint was more congruous. Next, the subcutaneous layer was closed with #4-0 Vicryl in a simple interrupted technique. Next, the skin was closed with #5-0 Monocryl in a running subcuticular fashion. Attention was directed to the right second toe, which was found to be markedly contracted and rigid in nature. There was a clavus in the dorsal aspect of the head of the proximal phalanx noted. A linear incision was made over the proximal phalanx approximately 2 cm in length. The incision was deepened with #15 blade down to the subcutaneous tissue. Next, the medial and lateral aspects of the wound were undermined with sharp dissection taking care to protect the neurovascular structures. Next, after identifying the extensor expansion and long extensor tendon, a #15 blade was used to transect the tendon at the level of the joint. The tendon was peeled off sharply, proximally, and distally. The medial and lateral collateral ligaments were released and the head of the proximal phalanx was delivered into the wound. The bone was found to be extremely soft in the toe joints and the head of the proximal phalanx was oddly shaped and the cartilage was eroded. The base of the middle phalanx, however, had a normal-appearing cartilage. A sagittal saw was used to transect the head of the proximal phalanx just proximal to metaphyseal flare. Next, the base of the middle phalanx was also resected. A 0.045 inch Kirschner wire was retrograded out at the end of the toe and then back through the residual proximal phalanx shaft. The toe assumed a straight and markedly increased straight position. An extensor hood resection was performed to assist in keeping the proximal phalanx plantar flexed. The joint was flushed with copious amounts of saline. A #3-0 Vicryl was used to reapproximate the tendon after arthrodesis. A #4-0 nylon was used to close the skin with a combination of simple interrupted and horizontal mattress suture technique. The wire was cut, capped, and bent in the usual fashion. Attention was directed to the right third toe where an exact same procedure as performed in the second digit was repeated. The same suture material was used and the same 0.045 Kirschner wire was used for external wire fixation. Attention was directed to the right fourth toe with exact same procedure was repeated. The same suture material was used. However, a 0.062 Kirschner wire was used to fixate the arthrodesis site as the bone was very soft and a 0.045 Kirschner wire was attempted but was found to be slipping in the soft bone and was inadequately holding the arthrodesis site tight. Next, attention was directed to the fifth digit, which was found to be contracted as well. A linear incision was made over the proximal phalanx with a #10 blade approximately 2 cm in length. A #15 blade was used to deepen the incision to the subcutaneous tissue down to the level of the long extensor tendon, which was identified and transected. The medial and lateral collateral ligaments were transected and the head of the proximal phalanx was delivered into the wound. A sagittal saw was used to resect the head of the proximal phalanx just proximal to metaphyseal flare. The toe assumed to more rectus position. The reciprocating rasp was used to smooth the all bony surfaces. The joint was again flushed with saline. Next, the long extensor tendon was reapproximated with #3-0 Vicryl in a simple interrupted technique. The skin was closed with #4-0 nylon in a simple interrupted technique. Next, attention was directed to the fifth metatarsal head, which was found to have a lateral exostosis and bursa under the skin. A #10 blade was used to make a 2.5 cm dorsal incision over the fifth metatarsal head. The incision was deepened with a #15 blade to the subcutaneous tissue. Any small vein traversing subcutaneous layer were ligated with electrocautery. Care was taken to avoid abductor digiti minimi tendon and extensor digitorum longus tendon respectively. Next, the dorsal linear capsular incision was made down to the bone with a #15 blade. The capsular and periosteal tissues were elevated off the bone with a #15 blade and the metatarsal head was delivered into the wound. Hypertrophic bone was noted to be found dorsally and laterally as well as plantarly. A sagittal saw was used to resect all hypertrophic bone. A reciprocating rasp was used to smooth all bony surfaces. Next, the wound was flushed with copious amounts of saline. The capsular and periosteal tissues wee closed with #3-0 Vicryl in a simple interrupted technique. Next, the subcutaneous layer was closed with #4-0 Vicryl in a simple interrupted technique. A bursa which was found consisting of a white glistening hypertrophic synovium was removed and sent as specimen as was also found in two of the second and third digit in the above procedures. The skin was closed with #5-0 Monocryl in a running subcuticular fashion. The ______ was reinforced with horizontal mattress sutures with #5-0 Monocryl. Attention was directed to the fourth metatarsophalangeal joint where the joint was found to be contracted and the proximal phalanx was still found to be elevated. Therefore, a #15 blade was used to make a stab incision over the joint lateral to the extensor digitorum longus tendon. The tendon was transected. Next, a blade was inserted in the dorsal, medial, and lateral aspects of the metatarsophalangeal joint and tenotomy was performed. Next, the proximal phalanx residual bone was plantar flexed and found to assume a more rectus position. One #4-0 nylon suture was placed in the skin. Mastisol tape was applied to the first metatarsal and fifth metatarsal postoperative wounds. Betadine-soaked Owen silk was applied to all wounds. Betadine-soaked 4 x 4 splints were applied to all toes. The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted to all digits. All the wires have previously been bent and cut and all were capped. A standard postoperative consisting of 4x4s, Kling, Kerlix, and Coban were applied. The patient tolerated the above anesthesia and procedure without complications. She was transported via cart to the Postanesthesia Care Unit with vital signs stable and vascular status intact. She was given prescription for Tylenol #3, #40 one to two p.o. q.4-6h. p.r.n. pain and Naprosyn 375 mg p.o. b.i.d. p.c. She is to continue her rheumatoid arthritis drugs preoperatively prescribed by the rheumatologist. She is to follow up with Dr. X in the office. She was given emergency contact numbers and standard postoperative instructions. She was given Darco OrthoWedge shoe and a pair of crutches. She was discharged in stable condition."
362,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Chronic plantar fasciitis, right foot. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Chronic plantar fasciitis, right foot. PROCEDURE: Open plantar fasciotomy, right foot. ANESTHESIA: Local infiltrate with IV sedation. INDICATIONS FOR SURGERY: The patient has had a longstanding history of foot problems. The foot problem has been progressive in nature and has not been responsive to conservative care despite multiple attempts at conservative care. The preoperative discussion with the patient including alternative treatment options, the procedure itself was explained, and risk factors such as infection, swelling, scar tissue, numbness, continued pain, recurrence, falling arch, digital contracture, and the postoperative management were discussed. The patient has been advised, although no guarantee for success could be given, most of the patients have improved function and less pain. All questions were thoroughly answered. The patient requested for surgical repair since the problem has reached a point to interfere with normal daily activities. The purpose of the surgery is to alleviate the pain and discomfort. DETAILS OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was given 1 g Ancef for antibiotic prophylaxis 30 minutes prior to the procedure. The patient was brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position. Following a light IV sedation, a posterior tibial nerve block and local infiltrate of the operative site was performed with 10 mL, and a 1:1 mixture of 1% lidocaine with epinephrine, and 0.25% Marcaine was affected. The lower extremity was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner. Balance anesthesia was obtained. PROCEDURE: Plantar fasciotomy, right foot. The plantar medial tubercle of the calcaneus was palpated and a vertical oblique incision, 2 cm in length with the distal aspect overlying the calcaneal tubercle was affected. Blunt dissection was carried out to expose the deep fascia overlying the abductor hallucis muscle belly and the medial plantar fascial band. A periosteal elevator did advance laterally across the inferior aspect of the medial and central plantar fascial bands, creating a small and narrow soft tissue tunnel. Utilizing a Metzenbaum scissor, transection of the medial two-third of the plantar fascia band began at the junction of the deep fascia of the abductor hallucis muscle belly and medial plantar fascial band, extending to the lateral two-thirds of the band. The lateral plantar fascial band was left intact. Visualization and finger probe confirmed adequate transection. The surgical site was flushed with normal saline irrigation. The deep layer was closed with 3-0 Vicryl and the skin edges coapted with combination of 1 horizontal mattress and simples. The dressing consisted of Adaptic, 4 x 4, conforming bandages, and an ACE wrap to provide mild compression. The patient tolerated the procedure and anesthesia well, and left the operating room to recovery room in good postoperative condition with vital signs stable and arterial perfusion intact. A walker boot was dispensed and applied. The patient will be allowed to be full weightbearing to tolerance, in the boot to encourage physiological lengthening of the release of plantar fascial band. The next office visit will be in 4 days. The patient was given prescriptions for Keflex 500 mg 1 p.o. three times a day x10 days and Lortab 5 mg #40, 1 to 2 p.o. q.4-6 h. p.r.n. pain, 2 refills, along with written and oral home instructions. After a short recuperative period, the patient was discharged home with vital signs stable and in no acute distress."
363,Orthopedic," PROCEDURE: Medial branch rhizotomy, lumbosacral. INFORMED CONSENT: The risks, benefits and alternatives of the procedure were discussed with the patient. The patient was given opportunity to ask questions regarding the procedure, its indications and the associated risks. The risk of the procedure discussed include infection, bleeding, allergic reaction, dural puncture, headache, nerve injuries, spinal cord injury, and cardiovascular and CNS side effects with possible of vascular entry of medications. I also informed the patient of potential side effects or reactions to the medications potentially used during the procedure including sedatives, narcotics, nonionic contrast agents, anesthetics, and corticosteroids. The patient was informed both verbally and in writing. The patient understood the informed consent and desired to have the procedure performed. SEDATION: The patient was given conscious sedation and monitored throughout the procedure. Oxygenation was given. The patient's oxygenation and vital signs were closely followed to ensure the safety of the administration of the drugs. PROCEDURE: The patient remained awake throughout the procedure in order to interact and give feedback. The x-ray technician was supervised and instructed to operate the fluoroscopy machine. The patient was placed in the prone position on the treatment table with a pillow under the abdomen to reduce the natural lumbar lordosis. The skin over and surrounding the treatment area was cleaned with Betadine. The area was covered with sterile drapes, leaving a small window opening for needle placement. Fluoroscopy was used to identify the boney landmarks of the spine and the planned needle approach. The skin, subcutaneous tissue, and muscle within the planned approach were anesthetized with 1% Lidocaine. With fluoroscopy, a Teflon coated needle, ***, was gently guided into the region of the Medial Branch nerves from the Dorsal Ramus of ***. Specifically, each needle tip was inserted to the bone at the groove between the transverse process and superior articular process on lumbar vertebra, or for sacral vertebrae at the lateral-superior border of the posterior sacral foramen. Needle localization was confirmed with AP and lateral radiographs. The following technique was used to confirm placement at the Medial Branch nerves. Sensory stimulation was applied to each level at 50 Hz; paresthesias were noted at *** volts. Motor stimulation was applied at 2 Hz with 1 millisecond duration; corresponding paraspinal muscle twitching without extremity movement was noted at *** volts. Following this, the needle Trocar was removed and a syringe containing 1% lidocaine was attached. At each level, after syringe aspiration with no blood return, 1cc 1% lidocaine was injected to anesthetize the Medial Branch nerve and surrounding tissue. After completion of each nerve block a lesion was created at that level with a temperature of 85 degrees Celsius for 90 seconds. All injected medications were preservative free. Sterile technique was used throughout the procedure. COMPLICATIONS: None. No complications. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was sent to the recovery room in good condition. DISCUSSION: Post-procedure vital signs and oximetry were stable. The patient was discharged with instructions to ice the injection site as needed for 15-20 minutes as frequently as twice per hour for the next day and to avoid aggressive activities for 1 day. The patient was told to resume all medications. The patient was told to be in relative rest for 1 day but then could resume all normal activities. The patient was instructed to seek immediate medical attention for shortness of breath, chest pain, fever, chills, increased pain, weakness, sensory or motor changes, or changes in bowel or bladder function. Follow up appointment was made in approximately 1 week."
364,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Erythema of the right knee and leg, possible septic knee. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Erythema of the right knee superficial and leg, right septic knee ruled out. INDICATIONS: Mr. ABC is a 52-year-old male who has had approximately eight days of erythema over his knee. He has been to multiple institutions as an outpatient for this complaint. He has had what appears to be prepatellar bursa aspirated with little to no success. He has been treated with Kefzol and 1 g of Rocephin one point. He also reports, in the emergency department today, an attempt was made to aspirate his actual knee joint which was unsuccessful. Orthopedic Surgery was consulted at this time. Considering the patient's physical exam, there is a portal that would prove to be outside of the erythema that would be useful for aspiration of the knee. After discussion of risks and benefits, the patient elected to proceed with aspiration through the anterolateral portal of his knee joint. PROCEDURE: The patient's right anterolateral knee area was prepped with Betadine times two and a 20-gauge spinal needle was used to approach the knee joint approximately 3 cm anterior and 2 cm lateral to the superolateral pole of the patella. The 20-gauge spinal needle was inserted and entered the knee joint. Approximately, 4 cc of clear yellow fluid was aspirated. The patient tolerated the procedure well. DISPOSITION: Based upon the appearance of this synovial fluid, we have a very low clinical suspicion of a septic joint. We will send this fluid to the lab for cell count, crystal exam, as well as culture and Gram stain. We will follow these results. After discussion with the emergency department staff, it appears that they tend to try to treat his erythema which appears to be cellulitis with IV antibiotics."
365,Orthopedic," CC: Weakness. HX: This 30 y/o RHM was in good health until 7/93, when he began experiencing RUE weakness and neck pain. He was initially treated by a chiropractor and, after an unspecified length of time, developed atrophy and contractures of his right hand. He then went to a local neurosurgeon and a cervical spine CT scan, 9/25/92, revealed an intramedullary lesion at C2-3 and an extramedullary lesion at C6-7. He underwent a C6-T1 laminectomy with exploration and decompression of the spinal cord. His clinical condition improved over a 3 month post-operative period, and then progressively worsened. He developed left sided paresthesia and upper extremity weakness (right worse than left). He then developed ataxia, nausea, vomiting, and hyperreflexia. On 8/31/93, MRI C-spine showed diffuse enlargement of the cervical and thoracic spine and multiple enhancing nodules in the posterior fossa. On 9/1/93, he underwent suboccipital craniotomy with tumor excision, decompression, and biopsy which was consistent with hemangioblastoma. His symptoms stabilized and he underwent 5040 cGy in 28 fractions to his brain and 3600 cGy in 20 fractions to his cervical and thoracic spinal cord from 9/93 through 1/19/94. He was evaluated in the NeuroOncology clinic on 10/26/95 for consideration of chemotherapy. He complained of progressive proximal weakness of all four extremities and dysphagia. He had difficulty putting on his shirt and raising his arms, and he had been having increasing difficulty with manual dexterity (e.g. unable to feed himself with utensils). He had difficulty going down stairs, but could climb stairs. He had no bowel or bladder incontinence or retention. MEDS: none. PMH: see above. FHX: Father with Von Hippel-Lindau Disease. SHX: retired truck driver. smokes 1-3 packs of cigarettes per day, but denied alcohol use. He is divorced and has two sons who are healthy. He lives with his mother. ROS: noncontributory.

There is diffuse atrophy and claw-hands, bilaterally. He is unable to manipulate hads to any great extent. 4+/4+ strength throughout BLE. There is also diffuse atrophy throughout the lower extremities though not as pronounced as in the upper extremities. SENSORY: There was a right T3 and left T8 cord levels to PP on the posterior thorax. Decreased LT in throughout the 4 extremities. COORD: difficult to assess due to weakness. Station: BUE pronator drift. Gait: stands without assistance, but can only manage to walk a few steps. Spastic gait. Reflexes: Hyperreflexic on left (3+) and Hyporeflexic on right (1). Babinski signs were present bilaterally. Gen exam: unremarkable. COURSE: 9/8/95, GS normal. By 11/14/95, he required NGT feeding due to dysphagia and aspiration risk confirmed on cookie swallow studies.MRI Brain, 2/19/96, revealed several lesions (hemangioblastoma) in the cerebellum and brain stem. There were postoperative changes and a cyst in the medulla. On 10/25/96, he presented with a 1.5 week h/o numbness in BLE from the mid- thighs to his toes, and worsening BLE weakness. He developed decubitus ulcers on his buttocks. He also had had intermittent urinary retention for month, chronic SOB and dysphagia. He had been sitting all day long as he could not move well and had no daytime assistance. His exam findings were consistent with his complaints. He had had no episodes of diaphoresis, headache, or elevated blood pressures. An MRI of the C-T spine, 10/26/96, revealed a prominent cervicothoracic syrinx extending down to T10. There was evidence of prior cervical laminectomy of C6-T1 with expansion of the cord in the thecalsac at that region. Multiple intradural extra spinal nodular lesions (hyperintense on T2, isointense on T1, enhanced gadolinium) were seen in the cervical spine and cisterna magna. The largest of which measures 1.1 x 1.0 x 2.0cm. There are also several large ring enhancing lesions in cerebellum. The lesions were felt to be consistent with hemangioblastoma. No surgical or medical intervention was initiated. Visiting nursing was provided. He has since been followed by his local physician"
366,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left carpal tunnel syndrome. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left carpal tunnel syndrome. OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: 1. Left endoscopic carpal tunnel release. 2. Endotracheal fasciotomy. ANESTHESIA: General. COMPLICATIONS: None. INDICATION: The patient is a 62-year-old lady with the aforementioned diagnosis refractory to nonoperative management. All risks and benefits were explained. Questions answered. Options discussed. No guarantees were made. She wished to proceed with surgery. PROCEDURE: After administering appropriate antibiotics and MAC anesthesia, the upper extremity was prepped and draped in the usual standard fashion, the arm was exsanguinated with Esmarch, and the tourniquet inflated to 250 mmHg. I made a transverse incision one fingerbreadth proximal to the distal volar wrist crease. Dissection was carried down to the antebrachial fascia, which was cut in a distally based fashion. Bipolar electrocautery was used to maintain meticulous hemostasis. I then performed an antebrachial fasciotomy proximally. I entered the extra bursal space deep into the transverse carpal ligament and used the spatula probe and then the dilators and then the square probe to enlarge the area. Great care was taken to feel the washboard undersurface of the transverse carpal ligament and the hamate on the ulnar side. Great care was taken with placement. A good plane was positively identified. I then placed the endoscope in and definitely saw the transverse striations of the deep surface of the transverse carpal ligament. Again, I felt the hook of the hamate ulnar to me. I had my thumb on the distal aspect of the transverse carpal ligament. I then partially deployed the blade, and starting 1 mm from the distal edge, the transverse carpal ligament was positively identified. I pulled back and cut and partially tightened the transverse carpal ligament. I then feathered through the distal ligament and performed a full-thickness incision through the distal half of the ligament. I then checked to make sure this was properly performed and then cut the proximal aspect. I then entered the carpal tunnel again and saw that the release was complete, meaning that the cut surfaces of the transverse carpal ligament were separated; and with the scope rotated, I could see only one in the field at a time. Great care was taken and at no point was there any longitudinal structure cut. Under direct vision through the incision, I made sure that the distal antebrachial fascia was cut. Following this, I irrigated and closed the skin. The patient was dressed and sent to the recovery room in good condition."
367,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Hallux abductovalgus deformity with bunion of the left foot. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Hallux abductovalgus deformity with bunion of the left foot. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Scarf bunionectomy procedure of the first metatarsal of the left foot. ANESTHESIA: IV sedation with local. HISTORY: This patient is a 55-year-old female who presents to ABCD preoperative holding area after keeping herself n.p.o., since mid night for surgery for her painful left bunion. The patient has had increasing pain over time and is having difficulty ambulating and wearing shoes. The patient has failed to conservative treatment and desires surgical correction at this time. Risks versus benefits of the procedure have been explained in detail by Dr. X, and consent is available on the chart for review. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: After an IV established by the Department of Anesthesia, the patient was given preoperatively 600 mg of clindamycin intravenously. The patient was then taken to the Operating Suite via cart and was placed on the operating table in a supine position and a safety strap was placed across her waist for protection. Next, a pneumatic ankle tourniquet was applied over her left ankle with copious amounts of Webril for the patient's protection. After adequate IV sedation was applied, the patient was given a local injection consisting of 17 cc of 4.5 cc 1% lidocaine plain, 4.5 cc of 0.5% Marcaine plain, and 1.0 cc of Solu-Medrol mixture in the standard Mayo block to the left foot. The foot was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile orthopedic fashion. The foot was then elevated, the Esmarch was applied and the tourniquet was inflated to 250 mmHg. The foot was then lowered to the operating field. A sterile stockinet was reflected and the attention was directed to the first metatarsophalangeal joint of the left foot. After sufficient anesthesia, using a #10 blade a linear incision was made approximately 5 to 6 cm in length over the first metatarsophalangeal joint dorsally, just near to the extensor hallucis longus tendon. Then using a fresh #15 blade, this incision was deepened through the skin into the subcutaneous layer after all small traversing veins were ligated and cauterized with electrocautery. A neurovascular bundle was identified and reflected medially. Laterally the extensor hallucis longus tendon was identified and protected with retraction as well. Care was then taken to undermine the medial and lateral margins of the first metatarsophalangeal joint carefully. The first metatarsophalangeal joint capsule was then identified and using a #15 blade, a linear incision made down to the bone through the joint capsule. The periosteum was reflected and elevated off of its bone and the metatarsal head as well as the base of the proximal phalanx to a small degree. Noted was a large hypertrophic bone spur on the dorsal medial aspect of the first metatarsal head as well as some small osteophytes along the medial portion of the proximal phalanx. Care was then taken to reflect and dissect the periosteum off of the shaft of the first metatarsal proximally into the proximal portion of the metatarsal close to the first metatarsocuneiform joint. The bone cortex was noted to be intact and in good condition. Following this, using a sagittal saw with a #138 blade, the attention was directed to the medial hypertrophic bone of the first metatarsal head. In the sagittal plane with the blade angulated from dorsolateral to proximal medial, the medial eminence of bone was resected. Plantarly it was noted that the tibial sesamoid groove was intact and the sesamoid apparatus was intact as well. Following this bone cut, 0.45 K-wire was inserted from medial to lateral through the medial portion of the first metatarsal head directed in the dorsal third of the metatarsal head. Then using the Reese osteotomy guide, the guide was directed from the distal portion of the metatarsal head proximally to the proximal portion of the first metatarsal. A second 0.45 K-wire was inserted proximally as well. Following this, using the sagittal saw with the #138 blade a transverse linear osteotomy cut was made through the first metatarsal from medial to lateral. After reaching the distal as well as the proximal portions of the bone and ensuring that cortex was cut on both the medial as well as lateral side, the Reese osteotomy guide was removed and the dorsal and plantar incision cuts were made. This began with the dorsal distal cut, which extended from medial to lateral with the dorsal portion of the blade angled proximally about five degrees through the dorsal third of the distal first metatarsal. Following this, attention was directed proximally and an incision osteotomy cut through the bone was made, directed medially to laterally with the inferior portion of the blade angled distally to transect the cortex of the bone. Following this, the distal portion of the osteotomy cut was freely movable and was able to be translocated medially. The head was then slit medially several millimeters until it was noted to be in good position and no chopping was present in the medullary canal of the bone. Following this, the bone was stabilized using a 0.45 K-wire distally as well as proximally directed from dorsal to planar direction. Next using the normal AO manner, the distal cortex was drilled from dorsal to plantar with a 2.0 mm drill bit and then over drilled proximally with the cortex using a 2.7 mm drill bit. The proximal cortex was then _________ and then the drill hole was measured and it was determined to be 18 mm in length from dorsal to plantar cortex. Then using 2.7 mm tap, the thread holes were placed and using an 18 x 2.7 mm screw ___________ was achieved and good apposition of the bone and tightness were achieved. Intramedullary sludge was noted to exit from the osteotomy cut. Following this, attention was directed proximally and the 0.45 K-wire was removed and the holes were predrilled using a 2.0 mm screw then over-drilled using 2.7 mm screw and counter sucked. Following this, the holes were measured, found to 20 mm in length and the drill hole was tapped using a 2.7 mm tap. Following this, a 20 mm full threaded screw was inserted and tightened. Good intramedullary sludge was noted and compression was achieved. Attention was then directed to the distal screw where it was once again tightened and found to be in good position with good bite. Following this, range of motion was performed on the first metatarsophalangeal joint and some lateral deviation of the hallux was noted. Based on this, a lateral release was performed. The extensor hallucis longus tendon was identified and was transected medially and a linear incision was placed down using a #15 blade into the first interspace. The incision was then deepened with sharp and blunt dissection and using a curved hemostat, the transverse as well as the oblique fibers of the abductor hallucis tendon were identified and transected. Care was taken to perform lateral release around the fibular sesamoid through these suspensory ligaments as well as the transverse metatarsal ligament and the collateral ligament. Upon completion of this, the hallux was noted to be in a rectus position with good alignment. The area was then flushed and irrigated with copious amounts of sterile saline. After this, attention was directed back to the medial capsule and a medial capsulorrhaphy was performed and the capsule was closed using #3-0 Vicryl suture. Subcutaneous tissues were closed using #3-0 and #4-0 Vicryl sutures to close in layers. The skin was then reapproximated and closed using #5-0 Monocryl suture. Following this, the incisions were dressed and bandaged in the normal manner using Owen silk, 4x4s, Kling, and Kerlix as well as Coban dressing. The tourniquet was then dropped with a total tourniquet time of 99 minutes at 250 mmHg. The patient followed the procedure and the anesthesia well and vascular status was intact as noted by immediate hyperemia to digits one through five of the left foot. The patient was then transferred back to the cart and escorted on the cart to the Postanesthesia Care Unit. Following this, the patient was given prescription for Vicoprofen total #20 to be taken one every six hours as necessary for moderate to severe pain. The patient was also given prescription for clindamycin to be taken 300 mg four times a day. The patient was given surgical shoe and was placed in a posterior sling. The patient was given crutches and instructed to use them for ambulation. The patient was instructed to keep her foot iced and elevated and to remain nonweightbearing over the weekend. The patient will follow up with Dr. X on Tuesday morning at 11'o clock in his Livonia office. The patient was concerned about any possible allergic reaction to medication and was placed on codeine and antibiotics due to that. The patient has Dr. X's pager and will contact him over this weekend if she has any problems or complaints or return to Emergency Department if any difficulty should arise. X-rays were taken and the patient was discharged home upon completion of this."
368,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES 1. Herniated disc, C5-C6. 2. Cervical spondylosis, C5-C6. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES 1. Herniated disc, C5-C6. 2. Cervical spondylosis, C5-C6. PROCEDURES 1. Anterior cervical discectomy with decompression, C5-C6. 2. Anterior cervical fusion, C5-C6. 3. Anterior cervical instrumentation, C5-C6. 4. Allograft C5-C6. ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal. COMPLICATIONS: None. PATIENT STATUS: Taken to recovery room in stable condition. INDICATIONS: The patient is a 36-year-old female who has had severe, recalcitrant right upper extremity pain, numbness, tingling, shoulder pain, axial neck pain, and headaches for many months. Nonoperative measures failed to relieve her symptoms and surgical intervention was requested. We discussed reasonable risks, benefits, and alternatives of various treatment options. Continuation of nonoperative care versus the risks associated with surgery were discussed. She understood the risks including bleeding, nerve vessel damage, infection, hoarseness, dysphagia, adjacent segment degeneration, continued worsening pain, failed fusion, and potential need for further surgery. Despite these risks, she felt that current symptoms will be best managed operatively. SUMMARY OF SURGERY IN DETAIL: Following informed consent and preoperative administration of antibiotics, the patient was brought to the operating suite. General anesthetic was administered. The patient was placed in the supine position. All prominences and neurovascular structures were well accommodated. The patient was noted to have pulse in this position. Preoperative x-rays revealed appropriate levels for skin incision. Ten pound inline traction was placed via Gardner-Wells tongs and shoulder roll was placed. The patient was then prepped and draped in sterile fashion. Standard oblique incision was made over the C6 vertebral body in the proximal nuchal skin crease. Subcutaneous tissue was dissected down to the level of the omohyoid which was transected. Blunt dissection was carried out with the trachea and the esophagus in the midline and the carotid sheath in its vital structures laterally. This was taken down to the prevertebral fascia which was bluntly split. Intraoperative x-ray was taken to ensure proper levels. Longus colli was identified and reflected proximally 3 to 4 mm off the midline bilaterally so that the anterior cervical Trimline retractor could be placed underneath the longus colli, thus placing no new traction on the surrounding vital structures. Inferior spondylosis was removed with high-speed bur. A scalpel and curette was used to remove the disc. Decompression was carried posterior to the posterior longitudinal ligament down to the uncovertebral joints bilaterally. Disc herniation was removed from the right posterolateral aspect of the interspace. High-speed bur was used to prepare the endplate down to good bleeding bone and preparation for fusion. Curette and ball tip dissector was then passed out the foramen and along the ventral aspect of the dura. No further evidence of compression was identified. Hemostasis was achieved with thrombin-soaked Gelfoam. Interspace was then distracted with Caspar pin distractions set gently. Interspace was then gently retracted with the Caspar pin distraction set. An 8-mm allograft was deemed in appropriate fit. This was press fit with demineralized bone matrix and tamped firmly into position achieving excellent interference fit. The graft was stable to pull-out forces. Distraction and traction was then removed and anterior cervical instrumentation was completed using a DePuy Trimline anterior cervical plate with 14-mm self-drilling screws. Plate and screws were then locked to the plate. Final x-rays revealed proper positioning of the plate, excellent distraction in the disc space, and apposition of the endplates and allograft. Wounds were copiously irrigated with normal saline. Omohyoid was approximated with 3-0 Vicryl. Running 3-0 Vicryl was used to close the platysma. Subcuticular Monocryl and Steri-Strips were used to close the skin. A deep drain was placed prior to wound closure. The patient was then allowed to awake from general anesthetic and was taken to the recovery room in stable condition. There were no intraoperative complications. All needle and sponge counts were correct. Intraoperative neurologic monitoring was used throughout the entirety of the case and was normal."
369,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Sacro-iliitis (720.2), lumbo-sacral segmental dysfunction (739.3), thoraco-lumbar segmental dysfunction (739.2), associated with myalgia/fibromyositis (729.1). POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Sacro-iliitis (720.2), lumbo-sacral segmental dysfunction (739.3), thoraco-lumbar segmental dysfunction (739.2), associated with myalgia/fibromyositis (729.1). ANESTHESIA: Conscious Sedation. INFORMED CONSENT: After adequate explanation of the medical surgical and procedural options, this patient has decided to proceed with the recommended spinal Manipulation under Anesthesia (MUA). The patient has been informed that more than one procedure may be necessary to achieve the satisfactory results. INDICATION: This patient has failed extended conservative care of condition/dysfunction by means of aggressive physical medical and pharmacological intervention. COMMENTS: This patient understands the essence of the diagnosis and the reasons for the MUA- The associated risks of the procedure, including anesthesia complications, fracture, vascular accidents, disc herniation and post-procedure discomfort, were thoroughly discussed with the patient. Alternatives to the procedure, including the course of the condition without MUA, were discussed. The patient understands the chances of success from undergoing MUA and that no guarantees are made or implied regarding outcome. The patient has given both verbal and written informed consent for the listed procedure. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was draped in the appropriate gowning and accompanied to the operative area. Following their sacral block injection, they were asked to lie supine on the operative table and they were placed on the appropriate monitors for this procedure. When the patient and I were ready, the anesthesiologist administered the appropriate medications to assist the patient into the twilight sedation using medication which allows the stretching, mobilization, and adjustments necessary for the completion of the outcome I desired. THORACIC SPINE: With the patient in the supine position on the operative table, the upper extremities were flexed at the elbow and crossed over the patient's chest to achieve maximum traction to the patient's thoracic spine. The first assistant held the patient's arms in the proper position and assisted in rolling the patient for the adjusting procedure. With the help of the first assist, the patient was rolled to their right side, selection was made for the contact point and the patient was rolled back over the doctor's hand. The elastic barrier of resistance was found, and a low velocity thrust was achieved using a specific closed reduction anterior to posterior/superior manipulative procedure. The procedure was completed at the level of TI-TI2. Cavitation was achieved. LUMBAR SPINE/SACRO-ILIAC JOINTS: With the patient supine on the procedure table, the primary physician addressed the patient's lower extremities which were elevated alternatively in a straight leg raising manner to approximately 90 degrees from the horizontal. Linear force was used to increase the hip flexion gradually during this maneuver. Simultaneously, the first assist physician applied a myofascial release technique to the calf and posterior thigh musculature. Each lower extremity was independently bent at the knee and tractioned cephalad in a neutral sagittal plane, lateral oblique cephalad traction, and medial oblique cephalad traction maneuver. The primary physician then approximated the opposite single knee from his position from neutral to medial slightly beyond the elastic barrier of resistance. (a piriformis myofascial release was accomplished at this time). This was repeated with the opposite lower extremity. Following this, a Patrick-Fabere maneuver was performed up to and slightly beyond the elastic barrier of resistance. With the assisting physician stabling the pelvis and femoral head (as necessary), the primary physician extended the right lower extremity in the sagittal plane, and while applying controlled traction gradually stretched the para-articular holding elements of the right hip by means gradually describing an approximately 30-35 degree horizontal arc. The lower extremity was then tractioned, and straight caudal and internal rotation was accomplished. Using traction, the lower extremity was gradually stretched into a horizontal arch to approximately 30 degrees. This procedure was then repeated using external rotation to stretch the para-articular holding elements of the hips bilaterally. These procedures were then repeated on the opposite lower extremity. By approximating the patient's knees to the abdomen in a knee-chest fashion (ankles crossed), the lumbo-pelvic musculature was stretched in the sagittal plane, by both the primary and first assist, contacting the base of the sacrum and raising the lower torso cephalad, resulting in passive flexion of the entire lumbar spine and its holding elements beyond the elastic barrier of resistance With the patient's lower extremities kept in hip/knee flexion,, the patient's torso was secured by the first assistant and the lumbar fascia/musculature elongated obliquely to the right and midline, in a controlled manner up to and beyond the elastic barrier of resistance. Cavitation was noted. This was repeated on the opposite side by the first assist. With the use of the undersheets, the patient was carefully placed in the decubitus position (right side down) and positioned so that the lumbar spine overlay the kidney plate to the point where the lumbar spine attained the horizontal and was derotated to avoid facet imbrication. The patient's body was stabilized in the extended position by the first assist. Segmental localization of the appropriate lumbar motion units was made by the primary physician and the elastic barrier of resistance found. A low velocity impulse thrust was applied achieving cavitation. .The sacro-iliac joint was then adjusted in the same position as above. The procedure was repeated on the opposite side by the first assist. The patient was then repositioned supine by means of the undersheet. With appropriate assistance, the patient was transferred from the procedure table to the gurney and was returned to the recovery room, where appropriate monitoring equipment was utilized to monitor vital signs. The IV was maintained to the point where the patient was fully alert and stable, and the patient was then transferred to a sitting recovery position and was given fluids and a light snack. Following this, the patient was discharged with appropriate home and rehabilitation instructions. COMPLICATIONS: The patient tolerated the procedure well with no untoward incident or complication. SUMMARY: The patient tolerated the procedure well and without complications and recovered from the anesthesia without difficulty. The patient is to return per standing orders."
370,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Carpal tunnel syndrome, bilateral. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Carpal tunnel syndrome, bilateral. ANESTHESIA: General NAME OF OPERATION: Bilateral open carpal tunnel release. FINDINGS AT OPERATION: The patient had identical, very thick, transverse carpal ligaments, with dull synovium. PROCEDURE: Under satisfactory anesthesia, the patient was prepped and draped in a routine manner on both upper extremities. The right upper extremity was exsanguinated, and the tourniquet inflated. A curved incision was made at the the ulnar base, carried through the subcutaneous tissue and superficial fascia, down to the transverse carpal ligament. This was divided under direct vision along its ulnar border, and wound closed with interrupted nylon. The wound was injected, and a dry, sterile dressing was applied. An identical procedure was done to the opposite side. The patient left the operating room in satisfactory condition."
371,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS (ES): Osteoarthritis, right knee. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS (ES): Osteoarthritis, right knee. PROCEDURE: Right total knee arthroplasty. DESCRIPTION OF THE OPERATION: The patient was brought to the Operating Room and after the successful placement of an epidural, as well as general anesthesia, administration 1 gm of Ancef preoperatively, the patient's right thigh, knee and leg were scrubbed, prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. The leg was exsanguinated by gravity and pneumatic tourniquet was inflated to 300 mmHg. A straight anterior incision was carried down through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Unilateral flaps were developed and a median retinacular parapatellar incision was made. The extensor mechanism was partially divided and the patella was everted. Some of the femoral bone spurs were resected using an osteotome and a rongeur. Ascending drill hole was made in the distal femur and the distal femoral cut, anterior and posterior and chamfer cuts were accomplished for a 67.5 femoral component. At this point the ACL was resected. Some of the fat pad and synovium were resected, as well as both medial and lateral menisci. A posterior cruciate retractor was utilized, the tibia brought forward and a centering drill hole made in the tibia. The intramedullary guide was used for cutting the tibia. It was set at 8 mm. An additional 2 mm was resected because of a moderate defect medially. A trial reduction was done with a 71 tibial baseplate. This was pinned and drilled and then trial reduction done with a 10-mm insert. This gave good stability and a full range of motion. The patella was measured with the calibers and 9 mm of bone was resected with an oscillating saw. A 34-mm component was drilled for. A further trial reduction was done and two liters of pulse lavage were used to clean the bony surfaces. A packet of cement was hand mixed, pressurized with a spatula into the proximal tibia. Multiple drill holes were made on the medial side of the tibia where the bone was somewhat sclerotic. The tibia baseplate was secured and the patella was inserted, held with a clamp. The extraneous cement was removed. At this point the tibial baseplate was locked into place and the femoral component also seated solidly. The knee was extended, held in this position for another 5-6 minutes until the cement was cured. Further extraneous cement was removed. The pneumatic tourniquet was released, hemostasis was obtained with electrocoagulation. Retinaculum, quadriceps and extensor were repaired with multiple figure-of-eight #1 Vicryl sutures, the subcutaneous tissue with 2-0 and the skin with skin staples. A sterile, bulky compression dressing was placed. The patient was stable on operative release."
372,Orthopedic," HISTORY: The patient is to come to the hospital for bilateral L5 kyphoplasty. The patient is an 86-year-old female with an L5 compression fracture. The patient has a history of back and buttock pain for some time. She was found to have an L5 compression fracture. She was treated conservatively over several months, but did not improve. Unfortunately, she has continued to have significant ongoing back pain and recent CT scan has shown a sclerosis with some healing of her L5 compression fracture, but without complete healing. The patient has had continued pain and at this time, is felt to be a candidate for kyphoplasty. She denies bowel or bladder incontinence. She does complain of back pain. She has been wearing a back brace and corset. She does not have weakness. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: The patient has a history of multiple medical problems including hypothyroidism, hypertension, and gallbladder difficulties. PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: She has had multiple previous surgeries including bowel surgery, hysterectomy, rectocele repair, and appendectomy. She also has a diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: She is on multiple medications currently. ALLERGIES: SHE IS ALLERGIC TO CODEINE, PENICILLIN, AND CEPHALOSPORINS. FAMILY HISTORY: The patient's parents are deceased. PERSONAL AND SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives locally. She is a widow. She does not smoke cigarettes or use illicit drugs. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: GENERAL: The patient is an elderly frail white female in no distress. LUNGS: Clear. HEART: Sounds are regular. ABDOMEN: She has a protuberant abdomen. She has tenderness to palpation in the lumbosacral area. Sciatic notch tenderness is not present. Straight leg raise testing evokes back pain. NEUROLOGICAL: She is awake, alert, and oriented. Speech is intact. Comprehension is normal. Strength is intact in the upper extremities. She has giveaway strength in the lower extremities. Reflexes are diminished at the knees and ankles. Gait is otherwise normal. DATA REVIEWED: Plain studies of the lumbar spine show an L5 compression fracture. A CT scan has shown some healing of this fracture. She has degenerative change at the L4-L5 level with a very slight spondylolisthesis at this level. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: The patient is a woman with a history of longstanding back, buttock, and leg pain. She has a documented L5 compression fracture, which has not healed despite appropriate conservative treatments. At this point, I believe the patient is a good candidate for L5 kyphoplasty. I have discussed the procedure with her and I have reviewed with her and her family risks, benefits, and alternatives to surgery. Risks of surgery including but not limited to bleeding, infection, stroke, paralysis, death, failure to improve, spinal fluid leak, need for further surgery, cement extravasation, failure to improve her pain, and other potential complications have all been discussed. The patient understands the issues involved. She requested that we proceed with surgery as noted above and will come to the hospital for this surgery on 01/18/08."

374,Orthopedic," HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 38-year-old woman presenting to our clinic for the first time for evaluation of hip pain, right greater than left, of greater than 2 years duration. The patient states that she began with right hip pain getting steadily worse over the last 2 years and has now developed some pain in the left hip. The pain is located laterally as well as anteriorly into the groin. She states that the pain is present during activities such as walking, and she does get some painful popping and clicking in the right hip. She is here for evaluation for the first time. She sought no previous medical attention for this. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for depression and reflux disease. PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Cesarean section x 2. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Listed in the chart and reviewed with the patient. ALLERGIES: The patient has no known drug allergies. SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is married.

She exercises monthly mainly walking and low impact aerobics. She also likes to play softball. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Significant for occasional indigestion and nausea as well as anxiety and depression. The remainder of the systems negative. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient is 5 foot, 2 inches tall, weighs 155 pounds. The patient ambulates independently without an assist device with normal stance and gait. Inspection of the hips reveals normal contour and appearance and good symmetry. The patient is able to do an active straight leg raise against gravity and against resistance bilaterally. She has no significant trochanteric tenderness. She does, however, have some tenderness in the groin bilaterally. There is no crepitus present with passive or active range of motion of the hips. She is grossly neurologically intact in the bilateral lower extremities. DIAGNOSTIC DATA: X-rays performed today in the clinic include an AP view of the pelvis and a frog-leg lateral of the right hip. There are no acute findings. No fractures or dislocations. There are minimal degenerative changes noted in the joint. There is, however, the suggestion of an exostosis on the superior femoral neck, which could be consistent with femoroacetabular impingement. IMPRESSION: Bilateral hip pain, right worse than left, possibly suggesting femoroacetabular impingement based on x-rays and her clinical picture is also consistent with possible labral tear. PLAN: After discussing possible diagnoses with the patient, I have recommended that we get MRI arthrograms of the bilateral hips to evaluate the anatomy and especially concentrating on the labrum in the right hip. We will get that done as soon as possible. In the meantime, she is asked to moderate her activities. She will follow up as soon as the MRIs are performed."
375,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS (ES): Left supracondylar, intercondylar distal femur fracture. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS (ES): Left supracondylar, intercondylar distal femur fracture. PROCEDURE: Open reduction internal fixation of the left supracondylar, intercondylar distal femur fracture (27513). OPERATIVE FINDINGS: He had intercondylar split, and then he had a medial Hoffa fracture. He also had some comminution of the medial femoral condyle which prohibited an anatomic key between the two segments of the medial condyle. IMPLANTS: We used 2.4 and 3.5 cortical screws, as well as a LISS Synthes femoral locking plate. COMPLICATIONS: None. IV FLUIDS: 2000 ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 40 mL URINE OUTPUT: 650 HISTORY: This 45-year-old male had a ground-level fall, sustaining this injury. He was admitted for definitive operative fixation. Risks and benefits were discussed, he agreed to go ahead with the procedure. DESCRIPTION OF THE OPERATION: The patient was identified in preop holding, then taken to the operating room. Once adequate anesthesia was obtained, his left lower extremity was prepped and draped in a routine sterile fashion. He was given antibiotics. He placed a traction pin through his proximal tibia, and pulled weight off the end of the bed. I made a midline approach and then did the lateral parapatellar arthrotomy. We excised some of the fat pad to give us better visibility into the notch. We excised a good bit of his synovium and synovial pouch. At this time we were able to identify the fracture fragments. Again, there was an intercondylar split and then two free pieces of the medial condyle. The femur fracture was very distal through the metaphysis. At this time we thoroughly cleaned out all the clot between all the fracture fragments and cleaned the cortical margins. Next we began the reduction. There was no reduction key between the two segments of the Hoffa fracture. Therefore, we reduced the anterior portion of the medial condyle to the lateral condyle, held it with point-of-reduction clamp and K-wires, and then secured it with 2.4 mini fragment lag screws. Next, with this medial anterior piece in place, we had some contour over the notch with which we were able to reduce the posterior medial Hoffa fragment. This gave us a nice notch contour. Again, there was some comminution laterally so that the fracture between the Hoffa segments did not have a perfect key. Once we had it reduced, based on the notch reduction, we then held it with K-wires. We secured it with two 3.5 cortical screws from the lateral condyle into this posterior segment. We then secured it with 2.4 cortical screws from the anterior medial to the posterior medial segment just subchondral. Then, finally, we secured it with a 3.5 cortical screw from the anterior medial to the posterior medial piece. All screws ran between and out of the notch. With the condyle now well reduced, we reduced it to the metaphysis. We slid a 13-hole LISS plate submuscularly. We checked on AP and lateral views that showed we had good reduction of the fracture and appropriate plate placement. We placed the tip threaded guidewire through the A-hole of the plate jig and got it parallel to the joint. We then clamped the plate down to the bone. Proximally, we made a stab incision for the trocar at the 13-hole position, placed our tip threaded guidewire in the lateral aspect of the femur, checked it on lateral view, and had it in good position. With the jig in appropriate position and clamped, we then proceeded to fill the distal locking screws to get purchase into the condyles. We then placed multiple unicortical locking screws in the shaft and metaphyseal segment. Our most proximal screw was proximal to the tip of the prosthesis. At this time we took the jig off and put the final screw into the A-hole of the plate. We then took final C-arm views which showed we had a good reduction on AP and lateral views, the plate was in good position, we had full range of motion of the knee, and good reduction clinically and radiographically. We then pulse lavaged the knee with 3 liters of fluid. We closed the quad tendon and lateral retinaculum with interrupted 0 Vicryl over a Hemovac drain. Subdermal tissue was closed with 2-0 Vicryl, skin with staples. Sterile dressing and a hinged knee brace were applied. The patient was awakened from anesthesia and taken to Recovery in stable condition. PLAN: 1. Nonweightbearing for 3 months. 2. CPM for 0 to 90 degrees as tolerated."
376,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Foraminal disc herniation of left L3-L4. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Foraminal disc herniation of left L3-L4. 2. Enlarged dorsal root ganglia of the left L3 nerve root. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Transpedicular decompression of the left L3-L4 with discectomy. ANESTHESIA: General. COMPLICATIONS: None. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal. SPECIMEN: None. HISTORY: This is a 55-year-old female with a four-month history of left thigh pain. An MRI of the lumbar spine has demonstrated a mass in the left L3 foramen displacing the nerve root, which appears to be a foraminal disc herniation effacing the L3 nerve root. Upon exploration of the nerve root, it appears that there was a small disc herniation in the foramen, but more impressive was the abnormal size of the dorsal root ganglia that was enlarged more medially than laterally. There was no erosion into the bone surrounding the area rather in the pedicle above or below or into the vertebral body, so otherwise the surrounding anatomy is normal. I was prepared to do a discectomy and had not consented the patient for a biopsy of the nerve root. But because of the sequela of cutting into a nerve root with residual weakness and persistent pain that the patient would suffer, at this point I was not able to perform this biopsy without prior consent from the patient. So, surgery ended decompressing the L3 foramen and providing a discectomy with idea that we will obtain contrasted MRIs in the near future and I will discuss the findings with the patient and make further recommendations. OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: The patient was taken to OR #5 at ABCD General Hospital in a gurney. Department of Anesthesia administered general anesthetic. Endotracheal intubation followed. The patient received the Foley catheter. She was then placed in a prone position on a Jackson table. Bony prominences were well padded. Localizing x-rays were obtained at this time and the back was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. A midline incision was made over the L3-L4 disc space taking through subcutaneous tissues sharply, dissection was then carried out to the left of the midline with lumbodorsal fascia incised and the musculature was elevated in a supraperiosteal fashion from the level of L3. Retractors were placed into the wound to retract the musculature. At this point, the pars interarticularis was identified and the facet joint of L2-L3 was identified. A marker was placed over the pedicle of L3 and confirmed radiographically. Next, a microscope was brought onto the field. The remainder of the procedure was noted with microscopic visualization. A high-speed drill was used to remove the small portions of the lateral aspects of the pars interarticularis. At this point, soft tissue was removed with a Kerrison rongeur and the nerve root was clearly identified in the foramen. As the disc space of L3-L4 is identified, there is a small prominence of the disc, but not as impressive as I would expect on the MRI. A discectomy was performed at this time removing only small portions of the lateral aspect of the disc. Next, the nerve root was clearly dissected out and visualized, the lateral aspect of the nerve root appears to be normal in structural appearance. The medial aspect with the axilla of the nerve root appears to be enlarged. The color of the tissue was consistent with a nerve root tissue. There was no identifiable plane and this is a gentle enlargement of the nerve root. There are no circumscribed lesions or masses that can easily be separated from the nerve root. As I described in the initial paragraph, since I was not prepared to perform a biopsy on the nerve and the patient had not been consented, I do not think it is reasonable to take the patient to this procedure, because she will have persistent weakness and pain in the leg following this procedure. So, at this point there is no further decompression. A nerve fork was passed both ventral and dorsal to the nerve root and there was no compression for lateral. The pedicle was palpated inferiorly and medially and there was no compression, as the nerve root can be easily moved medially. The wound was then irrigated copiously and suctioned dry. A concoction of Duramorph and ______ was then placed over the nerve root for pain control. The retractors were removed at this point. The fascia was reapproximated with #1 Vicryl sutures, subcutaneous tissues with #2 Vicryl sutures, and Steri-Strips covering the incision. The patient transferred to the hospital gurney, extubated by Anesthesia, and subsequently transferred to Postanesthesia Care Unit in stable condition."
377,Orthopedic," PROCEDURE: Subcutaneous ulnar nerve transposition. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: After administering appropriate antibiotics and MAC anesthesia, the upper extremity was prepped and draped in the usual standard fashion. The arm was exsanguinated with Esmarch, and the tourniquet inflated to 250 mmHg. A curvilinear incision was made over the medial elbow, starting proximally at the medial intermuscular septum, curving posterior to the medial epicondyle, then curving anteriorly along the path of the ulnar nerve. Dissection was carried down to the ulnar nerve. Branches of the medial antebrachial and the medial brachial cutaneous nerves were identified and protected. Osborne's fascia was released, an ulnar neurolysis performed, and the ulnar nerve was mobilized. Six cm of the medial intermuscular septum was excised, and the deep periosteal origin of the flexor carpi ulnaris was released to avoid kinking of the nerve as it was moved anteriorly. The subcutaneous plane just superficial to the flexor-pronator mass was developed. Meticulous hemostasis was maintained with bipolar electrocautery. The nerve was transposed anteriorly, superficial to the flexor-pronator mass. Motor branches were dissected proximally and distally to avoid tethering or kinking the ulnar nerve. A semicircular medially based flap of flexor-pronator fascia was raised and sutured to the subcutaneous tissue in such a way as to prevent the nerve from relocating. The subcutaneous tissue and skin were closed with simple interrupted sutures. Marcaine with epinephrine was injected into the wound. The elbow was dressed and splinted. The patient was awakened and sent to the recovery room in good condition, having tolerated the procedure well."
378,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right pectoralis major tendon rupture. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right pectoralis major tendon rupture. OPERATION PERFORMED: Open repair of right pectoralis major tendon. ANESTHESIA: General with an interscalene block. COMPLICATIONS: None. Needle and sponge counts were done and correct. INDICATION FOR OPERATION: The patient is a 26-year-old right hand dominant male who works in sales, who was performing heavy bench press exercises when he felt a tearing burning pain severe in his right shoulder. The patient presented with mild bruising over the proximal arm of the right side with x-ray showing no fracture. Over concerns for pectoralis tendon tear, he was sent for MRI evaluation where a complete rupture of a portion of the pectoralis major tendon was noted. Due to the patient's young age and active lifestyle surgical treatment was recommended in order to obtain best result. The risks and benefits of the procedure were discussed in detail with the patient including, but not limited to scarring, infection, damage to blood vessels and nerves, re-rupture, need further surgery, loss of range of motion, inability to return to heavy activity such as weight lifting, complex usual pain syndrome, and deep vein thrombosis as well as anesthetic risks. Understanding all risks and benefits, the patient desires to proceed with surgery as planned. FINDINGS: 1. Following deltopectoral approach to the right shoulder, the pectoralis major tendon was encountered. The clavicular head was noted to be intact. There was noted to be complete rupture of the sternal head of the pectoralis major tendon with an oblique-type tear having some remaining cuff on the humerus and some tendon attached to the retracted portion. 2. Following freeing of adhesions using tracks and sutures, the pectoralis major tendon was able to reapproximated to its insertion site on the humerus just lateral to the biceps. 3. A soft tissue repair was performed with #5 FiberWire suture and a single suture anchor of 5 x 5 bioabsorbable anchor was placed in order to decrease tension at the repair site. Following repair of soft tissue and using the bone anchor, there was noted to be good apposition of the tendon with edges and a solid repair. OPERATIVE REPORT IN DETAIL: The patient was identified in the preop holding area. His right shoulder was identified, marked his appropriate surgical site after verification with the patient. He was then taken to the operating room where he was transferred to the operative table in supine position and placed under general anesthesia by anesthesiology team. He then received prophylactic antibiotics. A time-out was then undertaken verifying the correct patient, extremity, surgery performed, administration of antibiotics, and the availability of equipment. At this point, the patient was placed to a modified beech chair position with care taken to ensure all appropriate pressure points were padded and there was no pressure over the eyes. The right upper extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. Preoperative markings were still visible at this point. A deltopectoral incision was made utilizing the inferior portion. Dissection was carried down. The deltoid was retracted laterally. The clavicular head of the pectoralis major was noted to be intact with the absence of the sternal insertion. There was a small cuff of tissue left on the proximal humerus associated with the clavicular head. Gentle probing medially revealed the end of the sternal retracted portion, traction sutures of #5 Ethibond were used in this to allow for retraction and freeing from light adhesion. This allowed reapproximation of the retracted tendon to the tendon stump. At this point, a repair using #5 FiberWire was then performed of the pectoralis major tendon back to stump on the proximal humerus noting good apposition of the tendon edges and no gapping of the repair site. At this point, a single metal suture anchor was attempted to be implanted just lateral to the insertion of the pectoralis in order to remove tension off the repair site; however, the inserted device attached to the metal anchor broke during insertion due to significant hardness of the bone. For this reason, the starting hole was tapped and a 5x5 bioabsorbable anchor was placed, doubly loaded. The sutures were then weaved through the lateral aspect of the torn tendon and a modified Krackow type performed and sutured thereby relieving tension off the soft tissue repair. At this point, there was noted to be excellent apposition of the soft tissue ends and a solid repair to gentle manipulation. Aggressive external rotation was not performed. The wound was then copiously irrigated. The cephalic vein was not injured during the case. The skin was then closed using a 2-0 Vicryl followed by a 3-0 subcuticular Prolene suture with Steri-Strips. Sterile dressing was then placed. Anesthesia was then performed, interscalene block. The patient was then awakened from anesthesia and transported to postanesthesia care in stable condition in a shoulder immobilizer with the arm adducted and internally rotated. Plan for this patient, the patient will remain in the shoulder immobilizer until followup visit in approximately 10 days. We will then start a gentle Codman type exercises and having limited motion until the 4-6 week point based on the patient's progression."
379,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Herniated nucleus pulposus, C5-C6, greater than C6-C7 and C4-C5 with left radiculopathy. 2. Cervical stenosis with cord compression, C5-C6 (723.0). POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Herniated nucleus pulposus, C5-C6, greater than C6-C7 and C4-C5 with left radiculopathy. 2. Cervical stenosis with cord compression, C5-C6 (723.0), with surgical findings confirmed. PROCEDURES: 1. Anterior cervical discectomy at C4-C5, C5-C6, and C6-C7 for neural decompression (63075, 63076, 63076). 2. Anterior interbody fusion at C4-C5, C5-C6, and C6-C7 (22554, 22585, 22585) utilizing Bengal cages times three (22851). 3. Anterior instrumentation for stabilization by Slim-LOC plate C4, C5, C6, and C7 (22846); with intraoperative x-ray times two. ANESTHESIA: General. SERVICE: Neurosurgery. OPERATION: The patient was brought into the operating room, placed in a supine position where general anesthesia was administered. Then the anterior aspect of the neck was prepped and draped in a routine sterile fashion. A linear skin incision was made in the skin fold line from just to the right of the midline to the leading edge of the right sternocleidomastoid muscle and taken sharply to platysma, which was dissected in a subplatysmal manner, and then the prevertebral space was encountered and prominent anterior osteophytes were well visualized once longus colli muscle was cauterized along its mesial border, and self-retaining retractors were placed to reveal the anterior osteophytic spaces. Large osteophytes were excised with a rongeur at C4-5, C5-C6, and C6-C7 revealing a collapsed disc space and a #11 blade was utilized to create an annulotomy at all three interspaces with discectomies being performed with straight disc forceps removing grossly degenerated and very degenerated discs at C4-C5, then at C5-C6, then at C6-C7 sending specimen for permanent section to Pathology in a routine and separate manner. Residual disc fragments were drilled away as drilling extended into normal cortical and cancellous elements in order to perform a wide decompression all the way posteriorly to the spinal canal itself finally revealing a ligament, which was removed in a similar piecemeal fashion with 1 and 2-mm micro Kerrison rongeurs also utilizing these instruments to remove prominent osteophytes, widely laterally bilaterally at each interspace with one at C4-C5, more right-sided. The most prominent osteophyte and compression was at C5-C6 followed by C6-C7 and C4-C5 with a complete decompression of the spinal canal allowing the dura to finally bulge into the interspace at all three levels, once the ligaments were proximally removed as well and similarly a sign of a decompressed status. The nerve roots themselves were inspected with a double ball dissector and found to be equally decompressed. The wound was irrigated with antibiotic solution and hemostasis was well achieved with pledgets of Gelfoam subsequently irrigated away. Appropriate size Bengal cages were filled with the patient's own bone elements and countersunk into position, filled along with fusion putty, and once these were quite tightly applied and checked, further stability was added by the placement of a Slim-LOC plate of appropriate size with appropriate size screws, and a post placement x-ray showed well-aligned elements. The wound was irrigated with antibiotic solution again and inspected, and hemostasis was completely achieved and finally the wound was closed in a routine closure by approximation of the platysma with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl, and the skin with a subcuticular stitch of 4-0 Vicryl, and this was sterilely dressed, and incorporated a Penrose drain, which was carried from the prevertebral space externally to the skin wound and safety pin for security in a routine fashion. At the conclusion of the case, all instruments, needle, and sponge counts were accurate and correct, and there were no intraoperative complications of any type."
380,Orthopedic," Mr. XYZ is a 63-year-old right-handed white male who has been referred by the legal firm of ABCD Inc. for evaluation and ongoing pain management. The patient has been under the care of Dr. A for a number of years and for insurance purposes, is now to be transferred to our practice. There have been no issues with Dr. A and the patient has been quite content about his treatment. There are no drug related issues according to the few notes that I have from Dr. A's office and the patient is not a candidate for any further surgery. Mr. XYZ forgot his hearing aids at home today and is severely hearing impaired and most of the interview had to be conducted with me yelling at him at the top of my voice. For all these reasons, this was not really under the best circumstances and I had to curtail the amount of time I spent trying to get a history because of the physical effort required in extracting information from this patient. The patient was seen late because he had not filled in the patient questionnaire. To summarize the history here, Mr. XYZ who is not very clear on events from the past, sustained a work-related injury some time in 1998. At that time, he was driving an 18-wheeler truck. The patient indicated that he slipped off the rear of his truck while loading vehicles to his trailer. He experienced severe low back pain and eventually a short while later, underwent a fusion of L4-L5 and L5-S1. The patient had an uneventful hospital course from the surgery, which was done somewhere in Florida by a surgeon, who he does not remember. He was able to return to his usual occupation, but then again had a second work-related injury in May of 2005. At that time, he was required to boat trucks to his rig and also to use a chain-pulley system to raise and lower the vehicles. Mr. XYZ felt a popping sound in his back and had excruciating low back pain and had to be transported to the nearest hospital. He was MRI'ed at that time, which apparently showed a re-herniation of an L5-S1 disc and then, he somehow ended up in Houston, where he underwent fusion by Dr. W from L3 through S2. This was done on 12/15/2005. Initially, he did fairly well and was able to walk and move around, but then gradually the pain reappeared and he started getting severe left-sided leg pain going down the lateral aspect of the left leg into his foot. He is still complaining of the severe pain right now with tingling in the medial two toes of the foot and significant weakness in his left leg. The patient was referred to Dr. A, pain management specialist and Dr. A has maintained him on opioid medications consisting of Norco 10/325 mg for breakthrough pain and oxycodone 30 mg t.i.d. with Lunesta 3 mg q.h.s. for sleep, Carisoprodol 350 mg t.i.d., and Lyrica 100 mg q.daily. The patient states that he is experiencing no side effects from medications and takes medications as required. He has apparently been drug screened and his drug screening has been found to be normal. The patient underwent an extensive behavioral evaluation on 05/22/06 by TIR Rehab Center. At that time, it was felt that Mr. XYZ showed a degree of moderate level of depression. There were no indications in the evaluation that Mr. XYZ showed any addictive or noncompliant type behaviors. It was felt at that time that Mr. XYZ would benefit from a brief period of individual psychotherapy and a course of psychotropic medications. Of concern to the therapist at that time was the patient's untreated and unmonitored hypertension and diabetes. Mr. XYZ indicated at that time, they had not purchased any prescription medications or any of these health-related issues because of financial limitations. He still apparently is not under really good treatment for either of these conditions and on today's evaluation, he actually denies that he had diabetes. The impression was that the patient had axis IV diagnosis of chronic functional limitations, financial loss, and low losses with no axis III diagnosis. This was done by Rhonda Ackerman, Ph.D., a psychologist. It was also suggested at that time that the patient should quit smoking. Despite these evaluations, Mr. XYZ really did not get involved in psychotherapy and there was poor attendance of these visits, there was no clearance given for any surgical interventions and it was felt that the patient has benefited from the use of SSRIs. Of concern in June of 2006 was that the patient had still not stopped smoking despite warnings. His hypertension and diabetes were still not under good control and the patient was assessed at significant risk for additional health complications including stroke, reduced mental clarity, and future falls. It was felt that any surgical interventions should be put on hold at that time. In September of 2006, the patient was evaluated at Baylor College of Medicine in the Occupational Health Program. The evaluation was done by a physician at that time, whose report is clearly documented in the record. Evaluation was done by Dr. B. At present, Mr. XYZ continues on with his oxycodone and Norco. These were prescribed by Dr. A two and a half weeks ago and the patient states that he has enough medication left to last him for about another two and a half weeks. The patient states that there has been no recent change in either the severity or the distribution of his pain. He is unable to sleep because of pain and his activities of daily living are severely limited. He spends most of his day lying on the floor, watching TV and occasionally will walk a while. ***** from detailed questioning shows that his activities of daily living are practically zero. The patient denies smoking at this time. He denies alcohol use or aberrant drug use. He obtains no pain medications from no other sources. Review of MRI done on 02/10/06 shows laminectomies at L3 through S1 with bilateral posterior plates and pedicle screws with granulation tissue around the thecal sac and around the left L4-5 and S1 nerve roots, which appear to be retracted posteriorly. There is a small right posterior herniation at L1-L2. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. The patient does not know what medications he is taking for diabetes and denies any diabetes. CABG in July of 2006 with no preoperative angina, shortness of breath, or myocardial infarction. History of depression, lumbar fusion surgery in 2000, left knee surgery 25 years ago. SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is on disability. He does not smoke. He does not drink alcohol. He is single. He lives with a girlfriend. He has minimal activities of daily living. The patient cannot recollect when last a urine drug screen was done. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: No fevers, no headaches, chest pain, nausea, shortness of breath, or change in appetite. Depressive symptoms of crying and decreased self-worth have been noted in the past. No neurological history of strokes, epileptic seizures. Genitourinary negative. Gastrointestinal negative. Integumentary negative. Behavioral, depression. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient is short of hearing. His cognitive skills appear to be significantly impaired. The patient is oriented x3 to time and place. Weight 185 pounds, temperature 97.5, blood pressure 137/92, pulse 61. The patient is complaining of pain of a 9/10. Musculoskeletal: The patient's gait is markedly antalgic with predominant weightbearing on the left leg. There is marked postural deviation to the left. Because of pain, the patient is unable to heel-toe or tandem gait. Examination of the neck and cervical spine are within normal limits. Range of motion of the elbow, shoulders are within normal limits. No muscle spasm or abnormal muscle movements noted in the neck and upper extremities. Head is normocephalic. Examination of the anterior neck is within normal limits. There is significant muscle wasting of the quadriceps and hamstrings on the left, as well as of the calf muscles. Skin is normal. Hair distribution normal. Skin temperature normal in both the upper and lower extremities. The lumbar spine curvature is markedly flattened. There is a well-healed central scar extending from T12 to L1. The patient exhibits numerous positive Waddell's signs on exam of the low back with inappropriate flinching and wincing with even the lightest touch on the paraspinal muscles. Examination of the paraspinal muscles show a mild to moderate degree of spasm with a significant degree of tenderness and guarding, worse on the left than the right. Range of motion testing of the lumbar spine is labored in all directions. It is interesting that the patient cannot flex more than 5 in the standing position, but is able to sit without any problem. There is a marked degree of sciatic notch tenderness on the left. No abnormal muscle spasms or muscle movements were noted. Patrick's test is negative bilaterally. There are no provocative facetal signs in either the left or right quadrants of the lumbar area. Neurological exam: Cranial nerves II through XII are within normal limits. Neurological exam of the upper extremities is within normal limits with good motor strength and normal biceps, triceps and brachioradialis reflexes. Neurological exam of the lower extremities shows a 2+ right patellar reflex and -1 on the left. There is no ankle clonus. Babinski is negative. Sensory testing shows a minimal degree of sensory loss on the right L5 distribution. Muscle testing shows decreased L4-L5 on the left with extensor hallucis longus +2/5. Ankle extensors are -3 on the left and +5 on the right. Dorsiflexors of the left ankle are +2 on the left and +5 on the right. Straight leg raising test is positive on the left at about 35 . There is no ankle clonus. Hoffman's test and Tinel's test are normal in the upper extremities. Respiratory: Breath sounds normal. Trachea is midline. Cardiovascular: Heart sounds normal. No gallops or murmurs heard. Carotid pulses present. No carotid bruits. Peripheral pulses are palpable. Abdomen: Hernia site is intact. No hepatosplenomegaly. No masses. No areas of tenderness or guarding. IMPRESSION: 1. Post-laminectomy low back syndrome. 2. Left L5-S1 radiculopathy. 3. Severe cognitive impairment with minimal ***** for rehabilitation or return to work. 4. Opioid dependence for pain control. TREATMENT PLAN: The patient will continue on with his medications prescribed by Dr. Chang and I will see him in two weeks' time and probably suggest switching over from OxyContin to methadone. I do not think this patient is a good candidate for spinal cord stimulation due to his grasp of exactly what is happening and his cognitive impairment. I will get a behavioral evaluation from Mr. Tom Welbeck and refer the patient for ongoing physical therapy. The prognosis here for any improvement or return to work is zero."
381,Orthopedic," CHIEF COMPLAINT: Left foot pain. HISTORY: XYZ is a basketball player for University of Houston who sustained an injury the day prior. They were traveling. He came down on another player's foot sustaining what he describes as an inversion injury. Swelling and pain onset immediately. He was taped but was able to continue playing He was examined by John Houston, the trainer, and had tenderness around the navicular so was asked to come over and see me for evaluation. He has been in a walking boot. He has been taped firmly. Pain with weightbearing activities. He is limping a bit. No significant foot injuries in the past. Most of his pain is located around the dorsal aspect of the hindfoot and midfoot. PHYSICAL EXAM: He does have some swelling from the hindfoot out toward the midfoot. His arch is maintained. His motion at the ankle and subtalar joints is preserved. Forefoot motion is intact. He has pain with adduction and abduction across the hindfoot. Most of this discomfort is laterally. His motor strength is grossly intact. His sensation is intact, and his pulses are palpable and strong. His ankle is not tender. He has minimal to no tenderness over the ATFL. He has no medial tenderness along the deltoid or the medial malleolus. His anterior drawer is solid. His external rotation stress is not painful at the ankle. His tarsometatarsal joints, specifically 1, 2 and 3, are nontender. His maximal tenderness is located laterally along the calcaneocuboid joint and along the anterior process of the calcaneus. Some tenderness over the dorsolateral side of the talonavicular joint as well. The medial talonavicular joint is not tender. RADIOGRAPHS: Those done of his foot weightbearing show some changes over the dorsal aspect of the navicular that appear chronic. I don't see a definite fracture. The tarsometarsal joints are anatomically aligned. Radiographs of his ankle again show changes along the dorsal talonavicular joint but no other fractures identified. Review of an MR scan of the ankle dated 12/01/05 shows what looks like some changes along the lateral side of the calcaneocuboid joint with disruption of the lateral ligament and capsular area. Also some changes along the dorsal talonavicular joint. I don't see any significant marrow edema or definitive fracture line. IMPRESSION: Left Chopart joint sprain. PLAN: I have spoken to XYZ about this. Continue with ice and boot for weightbearing activities. We will start him on a functional rehab program and progress him back to activities when his symptoms allow. He is clear on the prolonged duration of recovery for these hindfoot type injuries."
382,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Ruptured distal biceps tendon, right elbow. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Ruptured distal biceps tendon, right elbow. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Repair of distal biceps tendon, right elbow. PROCEDURE: The patient was taken to OR, Room #2 and administered a general anesthetic. The right upper extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual manner. A sterile tourniquet was placed on the proximal aspect of the right upper extremity. The extremity was then elevated and exsanguinated with an Esmarch bandage and tourniquet was inflated to 250 mmHg. Tourniquet time was 74 minutes. A curvilinear incision was made in the antecubital fossa of the right elbow down through the skin. Hemostasis was achieved utilizing electrocautery. Subcutaneous fat was separated and the skin flaps elevated. The _________ was identified. It was incised. The finger was placed approximately up the anterior aspect of the arm and the distal aspect of the biceps tendon was found. There was some serosanguineous fluid from the previous rupture. This area was suctioned clean. The biceps tendon ends were then placed over a sterile tongue blade and were then sharply cut approximately 5 mm to 7 mm from the tip to create a fresh surface. At this point, the #2 fiber wire was then passed through the tendon. Two fiber wires were utilized in a Krackow-type suture. Once this was completed, dissection was taken digitally down into the antecubital fossa in the path where the biceps tendon had been previously. The radial tuberosity was palpated. Just ulnar to this, a curved hemostat was passed through the soft tissues and was used to tent the skin on the radial aspect of the elbow. A skin incision was made over this area. Approximately two inches down to the skin and subcutaneous tissues, the fascia was split and the extensor muscle was also split. A stat was then attached through the tip of that stat and passed back up through the antecubital fossa. The tails of the fiber wire suture were grasped and pulled down through the second incision. At this point, they were placed to the side. Attention was directed at exposure of the radial tuberosity with a forearm fully pronated. The tuberosity came into view. The margins were cleared with periosteal elevator and sharp dissection. Utilizing the power bur, a trough approximately 1.5 cm wide x 7 mm to 8 mm high was placed in the radial tuberosity. Three small drill holes were then placed along the margin for passage of the suture. The area was then copiously irrigated with gentamicin solution. A #4-0 pullout wire was utilized to pass the sutures through the drill holes, one on each outer hole and two in the center hole. The elbow was flexed and the tendon was then pulled into the trough with the forearm supinated. The suture was tied over the bone islands. Both wounds were then copiously irrigated with gentamicin solution and suctioned dry. Muscle fascia was closed with running #2-0 Vicryl suture on the lateral incision followed by closure of the skin with interrupted #2-0 Vicryl and small staples. The anterior incision was approximated with interrupted #2-0 Vicryl for Subq. and then skin was approximated with small staples. Both wounds were infiltrated with a total of 30 cc of 0.25% Marcaine solution for postop analgesia. A bulky fluff dressing was applied to the elbow, followed by application of a long-arm plaster splint maintaining the forearm in the supinated position. Tourniquet was inflated prior to application of the splint. Circulatory status returned to the extremity immediately. The patient was awakened. He was rather boisterous during his awakening, but care was taken to protect the right upper extremity. He was then transferred to the recovery room in apparent satisfactory condition."
383,Orthopedic," PROCEDURE: Total hip replacement. PROCEDURE DESCRIPTION: The patient was bought to the operating room and placed in the supine position. After induction of anesthesia, the patient was turned on the side and secured in the hip table. An incision was made, centered over the greater trochanter. Dissection was sharply carried down through the subcutaneous tissues. The gluteus maximus was incised and split proximally. The piriformis and external rotators were identified. These were removed from their insertions on the greater trochanter as a sleeve with the hip capsule. The hip was dislocated. A femoral neck cut was made using the guidance of preoperative templating. The femoral head was removed. Extensive degenerative disease was found on the femoral head as well as in the acetabulum. Baseline leg-length measurements were taken. The femur was retracted anteriorly and a complete labrectomy was performed. Reaming of the acetabulum was then performed until adequate bleeding subchondral bone was identified in the key areas. The trial shell was placed and found to have an excellent fit. The real shell was opened and impacted into position in the appropriate amount of anteversion and abduction. Screws were placed by drilling into the pelvis, measuring, and placing the appropriate length screw. Excellent purchase was obtained. The trial liner was placed. The femur was then flexed and internally rotated. The extra trochanteric bone was removed, as was any leftover lateral soft tissue at the piriformis insertion. An intramedullary hole was drilled into the femur to define the canal. Reaming was performed until the appropriate size was reached. The broaches were then used to prepare the femur with the appropriate amount of version. Once the appropriate size broach was reached, it was used as a trial with head and neck placement. Hip range-of-motion was checked in all planes, including flexion-internal rotation, the position of sleep, and extension-external rotation. The hip was found to have excellent stability with the final chosen head-neck combination. Leg length measurements were taken and found to be within acceptable range, given the necessity for stability. The real stem was opened and impacted into position. The real head was impacted atop the stem. If cement was used, the canal was thoroughly washed and dried and plugged with a restrictor, and then the cement was injected and pressurized and the stem was implanted in the appropriate version. Excess cement was removed from the edges of the component. Range of motion and stability were once again checked and found to be excellent. Adequate hemostasis was obtained. Vigorous power irrigation was used to remove all debris from the joint prior to final reduction. The arthrotomy and rotators were closed using #1 Ethibond through drill holes in the bone, recreating the posterior hip structural anatomy. The gluteus maximus was repaired using 0 Ethibond and 0 Vicryl. The subcutaneous tissues were closed after further irrigation with 2-0 Vicryl and Monocryl sutures. The skin was closed with nylon. Xeroform and a sterile dressing were applied followed by a cold pack and Ace wrap. The patient was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition, having tolerated the procedure well."
384,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Right ankle trimalleolar fracture. 2. Right distal tibia plafond fracture with comminuted posterolateral impacted fragment. OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: Delayed open reduction internal fixation with plates and screws, 6-hole contoured distal fibular plate and screws reducing posterolateral malleolar fragment, as well as medial malleolar fragment. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Right ankle trimalleolar fracture. 2. Right distal tibia plafond fracture with comminuted posterolateral impacted fragment. TOURNIQUET TIME: 80 minutes. HISTORY: This 50-year-old gentleman was from the area and riding his motorcycle in Kentucky. The patient lost control of his motorcycle when he was traveling approximately 40 mile per hour. He was on a curve and lost control. He is unsure what exactly happened, but he thinks his right ankle was pinned underneath the motorcycle while he was sliding. There were no other injuries. He was treated in Kentucky. A close reduction was performed and splint applied. Orthopedic surgeon called myself with regards to this patient's fracture management and suggested a CT scan. The patient returned to Ohio and his friend drove him all the way from Kentucky to Northwest Ohio overnight. The patient showed up in the emergency department where a CT scan was asked to be performed. This was performed and reviewed. The patient, however, had significant amount of soft tissue swelling and therefore he was asked to follow up in 2 days. At this time, he still had significant swelling, but because of the amount of swelling that he had particularly with the long car ride for many hours with his leg dependent, it was felt to be best to wait. Indeed after 7 days, the patient started to develop fracture blisters on the posterior medial aspect of his ankle with large blisters measuring approximately 2 to 3 inches. The patient was x-rayed in the office. He had lost some of his reduction. Therefore, he was re-reduced at approximately 7 days and then each time the patient had examination of tissues, he was re-reduced just to keep the pressure off the skin. An x-ray showed the distal fibular fracture starting at the mortise region laterally. It appeared as an abduction type injury with minimal rotation. This was comminuted, fragmented, and impacted. The medial malleolus fracture was an avulsion type. The syndesmosis appeared to be intact. This appeared as an AO type B fracture. However, this was not a rotational injury. There is a posterior malleolar fragment attached to the distal fibular fragment, which appeared to be avulsed as well, but comminuted. CT scan revealed a more serious fracture with an anterior as well as posterior plafond fracture of an anterior fragment, which was undisplaced in the posterior medial corner. A posterior Tillaux fragment appeared to be separate. However, in this area, there was significant comminution in the mid portion of the ankle joint. There were many fragments and defects in this region. The medial mortise however appeared to be intact with regards to the tibial plafond even though there was an anterior undisplaced fragment. We discussed delayed open reduction internal fixation with the patient. He understood the risk of surgery including infection, decreased range of motion, stiffness, neurovascular injury, weakness, and numbness. We discussed seriously the risk of osteoarthritis because of the comminution in the intraarticular surface shown on the CT scan. We discussed deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, skin slough, skin necrosis, infection, and need for second surgery. We discussed shortening, decreased strength, limited use, disability of operative extremity, malunion, nonunion, compartment syndrome, stiffness of the operative extremity, numbness, and weakness. Examination of the patient revealed that he had slightly decreased sensation on the dorsum of his foot. The patient was able to flex and extend his toes, had good capillary refill, good dorsalis pedis, and posterior tibial pulse. The patient's tissues were edematous and we has waited approximately 10 days before performing the surgery when the skin could be wrinkled anteriorly. We discussed his incision, the medial incision as well as lateral incision and the lateral incision would be more posterolateral to maintain a bridge of at least 6 to 8 cm between the 2 incisions. We did discuss the skin slough as well as skin necrosis, particularly medially where the most skin pressure was because of displacement laterally. He understood the posterolateral comminution of the tibial plafond, which would be reduced by aligning up the cortex posteriorly. We discussed the posterolateral approach with reduction of the fibula. We discussed that likely the distal fibula would not be removed completely to assess the articular surface as this would likely comminute the fibula, even more fragmentation would occur, and would not be able to obtain an anatomic reduction. He understood this distal fibular fracture was comminuted and there were missing fragments of bone because they were impacted into intramedullary cancellous space. With this, the patient understood that the hardware may necessitate removal as well in the future. We discussed hardware irritation. We also discussed risk of osteoarthritis, which was nearly 100% particularly because of comminution of this area posteriorly. With these risks discussed and listed on the consent, the patient wanted the procedure. OPERATIVE NOTE: The patient was brought to operating theater and given successful general anesthetic. His right leg was prepped and draped in the usual fashion. Before prep and drape was performed, a close reduction was tried to be obtained to see whether there was any obstruction to reduction. It was felt that at one point the posterior tibialis tendon may be intraarticular. The reduction appeared to line up. However, there was significant gap of approximately 1.5 to 2 cm between the avulsed medial malleolus fragment and distal tibia. A lateral incision was made over the fracture site approximately 8 cm long and was taken to subcutaneous tissue. The superficial peroneal nerve was seen and this was avoided. The incision was placed posterolateral to fibula. This was to ensure good flap of tissue between the 2 incisions medial and laterally. The fracture was seen. The fracture was elevated and medialized and de-rotated. The anterior portion of the distal fibula was significantly comminuted with defect. The posterior aspect was still intact. However, there were multiple fracture lines demonstrating a crush-type injury. This was reduced manually. At this point, dissection was performed bluntly behind the peroneal tendons in between this and flexor hallucis longus tendon. No sharp dissection was performed. The posterior malleolar fragment was palpated with the distal fibula reduced. The posterior malleolar fragment appeared to be reduced as well. X-ray views confirmed this. An incision was made, standard incision, curvilinear, medially distal to the medial corner of the mortise and curving anterior and posteriorly around the tip of the medial malleolus. This was taken only through subcutaneous tissue. The saphenous vein was found, dissected out. Its branches were cauterized. Penrose drain was placed around this. Dissection was undertaken. The periosteal tissue was seen and was invaginated into the joint. This was recovered and flipped back on both sides. Next, the towel clip was used. Ends were freshened up using irrigation. The joint surface appeared to be congruent anteriorly and posteriorly medially. Anatomic reduction was performed in the medial malleolus using 2 mm K-wires and exchanging these for a 35 mm and a 40 mm, anterior and posterior respectively, partially threaded cancellous screws. Anatomic reduction was gained. X-rays were taken showing excellent anatomic reduction. Next, attention was drawn towards the fibula. Standard 6-hole one-third tubular plate was applied to this. Again, this was more of a transverse impacted fracture. Therefore, interfragmentary screw on an angle could not be used. The posterior cortex was used to assess anatomic reduction. Screws were placed. It was used as a spring plate pushing the distal fibular fragment medially. Screw holes were filled. They were double-checked. Screws had excellent purchase and were tightened up. At this point, lateral views were taken as well as palpation of posterior lateral fragment was performed in the plafond. This appeared to show anatomic reduction and did not appear to be a step on the articular surface or the posterior cortex of the distal tibia. The screw was then placed from anterior medial to posterior lateral into this comminuted fragment. A 2 mm K-wire was used. Finger was placed on this fragment and the pin was advanced even before the finger. X-ray views could show the posterior cortex and location of the pin. This was then exchanged for a 55 mm partially threaded cancellous screw after tapping was performed. This was double checked to ensure good positioning and this was so. On the lateral view, we could see this was not in the joint. AP views and mortise views showed this was not in the joint. One could palpate this as well. The screw was placed slightly proximal to distal in the anteroposterior plane. At the distal tip of it, it was just in the subchondral bone but not in the joint. There was slight to excellent purchase of this posterior lateral fragment. Wounds were copiously irrigated followed by closing using 2-0 Vicryl in inverted fashion followed by staples to skin. Adaptic, 4 x 4s, abdominal pad was placed on wound, held in place with Kerlix followed by an extensor bandage. Posterior splint was placed on the patient. The patient's leg was placed in neutral position. Significant amount of cast padding were used and large bulky trauma ABD type dressings. The heel was padded and leg was padded with approximately 2 inches of padding. Tourniquet was deflated. The patient had good capillary refill, good pulses, and the patient returned to recovery room in stable condition with no complications. Physician assistant assisted during the case with retracting as well as holding the medial malleolar fragment and fragments in position while placement screws were applied. Positioning of the leg was accomplished by the physician assistant. As well, physician assistant assisted in transport of patient to and from the recovery room, assisted in cautery as well as dissection and retraction of tissue. The patient is expected to do well overall. He does have an area of comminution shown on the CT scan. However, by x-rays, it appears that there is anatomic reduction gained at this posterolateral fragment. Nonetheless, this area was crushed and the patient will have degenerative changes in the future caused by this crushing area."
385,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left patellar chondromalacia. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left patellar chondromalacia with tight lateral structures. PROCEDURE: Left knee arthroscopy with lateral capsular release. ANESTHESIA: Surgery performed under general anesthesia. TOURNIQUET TIME: 47 minutes. MEDICATION: The patient received 0.5% Marcaine local anesthetic 32 mL. COMPLICATIONS: No intraoperative complications. DRAINS AND SPECIMENS: None. HISTORY AND PHYSICAL: The patient is a 14-year-old girl who started having left knee pain in the fall of 2007. She was not seen in Orthopedic Clinic until November 2007. The patient had an outside MRI performed that demonstrated left patellar chondromalacia only. The patient was referred to physical therapy for patellar tracking exercises. She was also given a brace. The patient reported increasing pain with physical therapy and mother strongly desired other treatment. It was explained to the mother in detail that this is a difficult problem to treat although majority of the patients get better with physical therapy. Her failure with nonoperative treatment is below the standard 6-month trial; however, given her symptoms and severe pain, lateral capsular release was offered. Risk and benefits of surgery were discussed. Risks of surgery including risk of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion extremity, failure of procedure to relieve pain, need for postoperative rehab, and significant postoperative swelling. All questions were answered, and mother and daughter agreed to the above plans. PROCEDURE NOTE: The patient was taken to the operating room and placed on the operating table. General anesthesia was then administered. The patient received Ancef preoperatively. A nonsterile tourniquet was placed on the upper aspect of left thigh. The extremity was then prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion. A medial suprapatellar portal was marked on the skin as well as anteromedial and anterolateral joint line. The extremity was wrapped in Esmarch prior to inflation of tourniquet to 250 mmHg. Esmarch was then removed. Incisions were then made. Camera was initially inserted into the lateral joint line. Visualization of patellofemoral joint revealed type 2 chondromalacia with slight lateral subluxation. The patient did have congruent articulation about 30 degrees of knee flexion. Visualization of the medial joint line revealed no loose bodies. There was a small plica. Visualization of the medial joint line revealed no significant chondromalacia. Menisci was probed and tested with no signs of tears and instability. ACL was noted to be intact. The intercondylar notch and lateral joint line also revealed no significant chondromalacia or meniscal pathology. Lateral gutter also demonstrated no loose bodies or plica. The camera was then removed and inserted into the anteromedial portal using two 18-gauge needles. The extent of lateral capsular release was marked using a monopolar coblator, lateral capsular release was performed. The patient had significant improvement in anteromedial translation from 25% to 50%. At the end of the case, all instruments were removed. The knee was injected with 32 mL of 0.5% Marcaine with additional epinephrine. Please note, the patient received 30 mL of 1:500,000 dilution epinephrine at the beginning of the case. The portals were then closed using 4-0 Monocryl. The wound was clean and dry, and dressed with Steri-Strips, Xeroform, and 4 x 4s. The kneecap was translated medially under pressure and a bias placed. The tourniquet was released at 47 minutes. The patient was then placed in the knee immobilizer. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was subsequently extubated and taken to the recovery in stable condition. POSTOPERATIVE PLAN: The patient will weightbear as tolerated in the knee immobilizer. She will start physical therapy within 1 to 2 weeks to work on patella mobilization as well as reconditioning and strengthening. Intraoperative findings were relayed to the mother. All questions were answered."

387,Orthopedic, EXAM:MRI OF THE LEFT KNEE WITHOUT CONTRAST CLINICAL:Left knee pain. Twisting injury. FINDINGS: The images reveal a sizable joint effusion. The joint effusion appears to be complex with mixed signal intensity material within. The patella is slightly laterally tilted towards the left. The mid portion of the patella cartilage shows some increased signal and focal injury to the patellar cartilage is suspected. Mildly increased bone signal overlying the inferolateral portion of the patella is identified. No significant degenerative changes about the patella can be seen. The quadriceps tendon as well as the infrapatellar ligament both look intact. There is some prepatellar soft tissue edema. The bone signal shows a couple of small areas of cystic change in the proximal aspect of the tibia. NO significant areas of bone edema are appreciated. There is soft tissue edema along the lateral aspect of the knee. There is a partial tear of the lateral collateral ligament complex. The medial collateral ligament complex looks intact. A small amount of edema is identified immediately adjacent to the medial collateral ligament complex. The posterior cruciate ligament looks intact. The anterior cruciate ligament is thickened with significant increased signal. I suspect at least a high grade partial tear. The posterior horn of the medial meniscus shows some myxoid degenerative changes. The posterior horn and anterior horn of the lateral meniscus likewise shows myxoid degenerative type changes. I don�t see a definite tear extending to the articular surface. IMPRESSION: Sizeable joint effusion which is complex and may contain blood products. Myxoid degenerative type changes medial and lateral meniscus with no definite evidence of a tear. Soft tissue swelling and partial tear of the lateral collateral ligament complex. At least high grade partial tear of the anterior cruciate ligament with significant thickening and increased signal of this structure. The posterior cruciate ligament is intact. Injury to the patellar cartilage as above.
388,Orthopedic," DIAGNOSIS: Low back pain and degenerative lumbar disk. HISTORY: The patient is a 59-year-old female, who was referred to Physical Therapy, secondary to low back pain and degenerative disk disease. The patient states she has had a cauterization of some sort to the nerves in her low back to help alleviate with painful symptoms. The patient states that this occurred in October 2008 as well as November 2008. The patient has a history of low back pain, secondary to a fall that originally occurred in 2006. The patient states that she slipped on a newly waxed floor and fell on her tailbone and low back region. The patient then had her second fall in March 2006. The patient states that she was qualifying on the range with a handgun and lost her footing and states that she fell more due to weakness in her lower extremities rather than loss of balance. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Past medical history is significant for allergies and thyroid problems. PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: The patient has a past surgical history of appendectomy and hysterectomy. MEDICATIONS: 1. TriCor. 2. Vytorin. 3. Estradiol. 4. Levothyroxine. 5. The patient is also taking ibuprofen 800 mg occasionally as needed for pain management. The patient states she rarely takes this and does not like to take pain medication if at all possible. The patient states that she has had uncomplicated pregnancies in the past. SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient states she lives in a single-level home with her husband, who is in good health and is able to assist with any tasks or activities the patient is having difficulty with. The patient rates her general health as excellent and denies any smoking and reports very occasional alcohol consumption. The patient does state that she has completed exercises on a daily basis of one to one and a half hours a day. However, has not been able to complete these exercise routine since approximately June 2008, secondary to back pain. The patient is working full-time as a project manager, and is required to do extensive walking at various periods during a workday. MEDICAL IMAGING: The patient states that she has had an MRI recently performed; however, the results are not available at the time of the evaluation. The patient states she is able to bring the report in upon next visit. SUBJECTIVE: The patient rates her pain at 7/10 on a Pain Analog Scale, 0 to 10, 10 being worse. The patient describes her pain as a deep aching, primarily on the right lower back and gluteal region. Aggravating factors include stairs and prolonged driving, as well as general limitations with home tasks and projects. The patient states she is a very active individual and is noticing extreme limitations with ability to complete home tasks and projects she used to be able to complete. NEUROLOGICAL SYMPTOMS: The patient reports having occasional shooting pains into the lower extremities. However, these are occurring less frequently and is now occurring more frequently in the right versus the left lower extremity when they do occur. FUNCTIONAL ACTIVITIES AND HOBBIES: Include exercising and general activities. PATIENT'S GOAL: The patient would like to improve her overall body movements and return to daily exercise routine as able and well maintaining safety. OBJECTIVE: Upon observation, the patient ambulates independently without the use of assistive device. However, does present with mild limp and favoring the left lower extremity after extensive standing and walking activity. The patient does have mild difficulty transferring from the seated position to standing. However, once is upright, the patient denies any increased pain or symptoms. ACTIVE RANGE OF MOTION OF LUMBAR SPINE: Forward flexion is 26 cm, fingertip to floor, lateral side bend, fingertip to floor is 52.5 cm bilaterally. STRENGTH: Strength is grossly 4/5. The patient denies any significant tenderness to palpation. However, does have mild increase in tenderness on the right versus left. A six-minute walk test revealed painful symptoms and achiness occurring after approximately 400 feet of walking. The patient was able to continue; however, stopped after 700 feet. There were two minutes remaining in the six-minute walk test. The patient does have tight hamstrings as well as a negative slump test. ASSESSMENT: The patient would benefit from skilled physical therapy intervention in order to address the following problem list. PROBLEM LIST: 1. Increased pain. 2. Decreased ability to complete tasks and hobbies. 3 Decreased lumbar range of motion. SHORT-TERM GOALS TO BE COMPLETED IN THREE WEEKS: 1. The patient will demonstrate independence with a home exercise program. 2. The patient will report max pain of 5/10 in a 24-hour period without medication use. 3. The patient will tolerate 1000 feet of walking and complete a six-minute walk test, without significant increase in pain. LONG-TERM GOALS TO BE COMPLETED IN SIX WEEKS: The patient will return to full daily exercise routine without increase in pain and maintain safety. PROGNOSIS: Prognosis is good for above-stated goals, with compliance with home exercise program and therapy treatments. PLAN OF CARE: The patient to be seen three times a week for six weeks for the following: 1. Therapeutic exercise with home exercise program. 2. Modalities to include ice, heat, ultrasound, electrical stimulation in order to reduce pain and inflammation. 3. Manual therapy to include soft tissue mobilization and joint mobilization as needed in order to promote increased mobility and decreased muscle tightness. I have discussed the plan of care with the patient as well as the findings of the evaluation. The patient reports understanding and agrees to be compliant with physical therapy intervention."
389,Orthopedic," REASON FOR VISIT: New patient visit for right hand pain. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 28-year-old right-hand dominant gentleman, who punched the wall 3 days prior to presentation. He complained of ulnar-sided right hand pain and was seen in the emergency room. Reportedly, he had some joints in his hand pushed back and placed by somebody in emergency room. Today, he admits that his pain is much better. Currently, since that time he has been in the splint with minimal pain. He has had no numbness, tingling or other concerning symptoms. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Negative. SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is a nonsmoker and does not use illegal drugs. Occasionally drinks. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: A 12-point review of systems is negative. MEDICATIONS: None. ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies. FINDINGS: On physical exam, he has swelling and tenderness over the ulnar dorsum of his hand. He has a normal cascade. He has 70 degrees of MCP flexion and full IP flexion and extension. He has 3 to 5 strength in his grip and intrinsics. He has intact sensation to light touch in the radial, ulnar, and median nerve distribution. Two plus radial pulse. X-rays taken from today were reviewed, include three views of the right hand. They show possible small fractures of the base of the fourth and third metacarpals. Joint appears to be located. A 45-degree oblique view was obtained and confirmed adduction of the CMC joints of the fourth and fifth metacarpals. His injury films from 09/15/07 were reviewed and demonstrated what appears to be CMC dislocations of the third and fourth metacarpals. ASSESSMENT: Status post right third and fourth metacarpal carpometacarpal dislocations. PLANS: The patient was placed into a short-arm cast and intrinsic plus. I would like him to wear this for 2 weeks and then follow up with us. At that time, we will transition him to an OT splint and begin range of motion activities of the fingers and wrist. We should see him back in 2 weeks' time at which time he should obtain three views of the right hand and a 45-degree oblique view out of cast."
390,Orthopedic," TITLE OF OPERATION: 1. Austin-Akin bunionectomy with internal screw fixation of the first right metatarsophalangeal joint. 2. Weil osteotomy with internal screw fixation, first right metatarsal. 3. Arthroplasty, second right PIP joint. PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Bunion deformity, right foot. 2. Dislocated second right metatarsophalangeal joint. 3. Hammertoe deformity, second right digit. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Bunion deformity, right foot. 2. Dislocated second right metatarsophalangeal joint. 3. Hammertoe deformity, second right digit. ANESTHESIA: Monitored anesthesia care with 20 mL of 1:1 mixture of 0.5% Marcaine and 1% lidocaine plain. HEMOSTASIS: 60 minutes, a right ankle tourniquet set at 250 mmHg. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Less than 10 mL. PREOPERATIVE INJECTABLES: 1 g Ancef IV 30 minutes preoperatively. MATERIALS USED: 3-0 Vicryl, 4-0 Vicryl, 5-0 Prolene, as well as two 16-mm partially treaded cannulated screws of the OsteoMed system, one 18-mm partially treaded cannulated screw of the OsteoMed system of the 3.0 size. One 10-mm 2.0 partially threaded cannulated screw of the OsteoMed system. DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table in the supine position. After adequate sedation was achieved by the anesthesia team, the above-mentioned anesthetic mixture was infiltrated directly into the patient's right foot to anesthetize the future surgical sites. The right ankle was covered with cast padding and an 18-inch ankle tourniquet was placed around the right ankle and set up at 250 mmHg. The right foot was then prepped, scrubbed, and draped in a normal sterile technique. The right ankle tourniquet was then inflated. Attention was then directed on the dorsomedial aspect of the first right metatarsophalangeal joint where a 6-cm linear incision was placed parallel and medial to the course of the extensor hallucis longus tendon to the right great toe. The incision was deepened through subcutaneous tissues. All the bleeders were identified, cut, clamped, and cauterized. The incision was deepened to the level of the capsule and the periosteum of the first right metatarsophalangeal joint. All the tendinous and neurovascular structures were identified and retracted from the site to be preserved. Using sharp and dull dissection, the periosteal and capsular tissues were mobilized from the head and neck of the first right metatarsal and the base of the proximal phalanx of the right great toe. The conjoint tendon was identified on the lateral plantar aspect of the base of the proximal phalanx and resected transversely. A lateral capsulotomy was also performed at the level of the first right metatarsophalangeal joint. Using sharp and dull dissection, the dorsomedial prominence of the first right metatarsal head was adequately exposed and resected with the use of a sagittal saw. The same saw was used to perform the Austin osteotomy on the capital aspect of the first right metatarsal with its apex distal and its base proximal. The dorsal arm of the osteotomy was longer than the plantar arm and noted to accommodate for the future internal fixation. The capital fragment of the first right metatarsal was then transposed laterally and impacted on the shaft of the first right metatarsal. Two wires of the OsteoMed system were also used as provisional fixation wires and also as guidewires for the insertion of the future screws. The wires were inserted dorsal distal to plantar proximal through the dorsal arm of the osteotomy. The two screws from the 3.0 OsteoMed system were inserted over the wires using AO technique. One screw measured 16 mm, second screw measured 18 mm in length. Both 3.0 screws were then evaluated for the fixation of the osteotomy after the wires were removed. Fixation of the osteotomy was found to be excellent. The dorsomedial prominence of the first right metatarsal shaft was then resected with the sagittal saw. To improve the correction of the hallux abductus angle, an Akin osteotomy was also performed on the base of the proximal phalanx of the right great toe with its base medially and its apex laterally. Upon removal of the base wedge from the base of the proximal phalanx, the osteotomy was reduced with the OsteoMed smooth wire, which was also used as a guidewire for the insertion of a 16-mm partially threaded cannulated screw from the OsteoMed 3.0 system. Upon insertion of the screw, using AO technique, the wire was removed. The screw was inserted proximal medial to distal lateral through the osteotomy of the base of the proximal phalanx of the right great toe. Fixation of the osteotomy was found to be excellent. Reduction of the bunion deformity was also found to be excellent and position of the first right metatarsophalangeal joint was found to be anatomical. Range of motion of that joint was uninhibited. The area was flushed copiously with saline. Then, 3-0 suture material was used to approximate the periosteum and capsular tissues, 4-0 was used to approximate the subcutaneous tissues, and Steri-Strips were used to reinforce the incision. Attention was directed over the neck of the second right metatarsal head where a 3-cm linear incision was placed directly over the surgical neck of the second right metatarsal. The incision was deepened through subcutaneous tissues. All the bleeders were identified, cut, clamped and cauterized. The incision was deepened through the level of the periosteum over the surgical neck of the second right metatarsal. All the tendinous and neurovascular structures were identified and retracted from the site to be preserved. Using sharp and dull dissection, the surgical neck of the second right metatarsal was adequately exposed and then Weil-type osteotomy was performed from dorsal distal to plantar proximal through the surgical neck of the second right metatarsal. The capital fragment was then transposed proximally and impacted on the shaft of the second right metatarsal. The 2.0 Osteo-Med system was also used to fixate this osteotomy wire from that system was inserted dorsal proximal to plantar distal through the second right metatarsal osteotomy and the wire was used as a guidewire for the insertion of the 10-mm partially threaded 2.0 cannulated screw. Upon insertion of the screw, using AO technique, the wire was then removed. Fixation of the osteotomy with 2.0 screw was found to be excellent. The second right metatarsophalangeal joint was then relocated and the dislocation of that joint was completely reduced. Range of motion of the second right metatarsophalangeal joint was found to be excellent. Then, 3-0 Vicryl suture material was used to approximate the periosteal tissues. Then, 4-0 Vicryl was used to approximate the skin incision. Attention was then directed at the level of the PIP joint of the second right toe where two semi-elliptical incisions were placed directly over the bony prominence at the level of the second right PIP joint. The island of skin between the two semi-elliptical incisions was resected in toto. The dissection was carried down to the level of extensor digitorum longus of the second right toe, which was resected transversely at the level of the PIP joint. A capsulotomy and a medial and lateral collateral ligament release of the PIP joint of the second right toe was also performed and head of the proximal phalanx of the second right digit was adequately exposed. Using the double-action bone cutter, the head of the proximal phalanx of the second right toe was then resected. The area was copiously flushed with saline. The capsular and periosteal tissues were approximated with 2-0 Vicryl and 3-0 Vicryl suture material was also used to approximate the extensor digitorum longus to the second right toe. A 5-0 Prolene was used to approximate the skin edges of the two semi-elliptical incisions. Correction of the hammertoe deformity and relocation of the second right metatarsophalangeal joint were evaluated with the foot loaded and were found to be excellent and anatomical. At this time, the patient's three incisions were covered with Xeroform, copious amounts of fluff and Kling, stockinette, and Ace bandage. The patient's right ankle tourniquet was deflated, time was 60 minutes. Immediate hyperemia was noted on the entire right lower extremity upon deflation of the cuffs. The patient's right foot was placed in a surgical shoe and the patient was transferred to the recovery room under the care of anesthesia team with the vital signs stable and the vascular status at appropriate levels. The patient was given instructions and education on how to continue caring for her right foot surgery. The patient was eventually discharged from Hospital according to nursing protocol and was advised to follow up with Dr. X's office in one week's time for her first postoperative appointment."
391,Orthopedic," REASON FOR EVALUATION: Evaluation for chronic pain program. COMPENSABLE INJURY: Left knee. CHIEF COMPLAINT: Left knee and low back pain. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. XYZ is an otherwise fairly healthy 44-year-old right-handed aircraft mechanic. On her date of injury, she reports that she was working on an aircraft when she fell between the airplane and a stand with about an 18-inch gap in between. She injured her left knee and underwent two arthroscopic procedures followed by patellar replacement and subsequently a left total knee arthroplasty in Month DD, YYYY. The patient is seen with no outside images, but an MRI report of the left knee and office notes from Dr. ABCD. The patient reports that she has undergone a full course of physical therapy and complains primarily of pain in the anterior aspect of the left knee and primarily over the medial and lateral tibial components with pain extending proximally to the distal femur and distally down into the anterior tibial plateau area. She has intermittent numbness and tingling in the posterolateral thigh and no symptoms at all into her feet. She has axial low back pain as an ancillary symptom. Her pain is worse with walking and is associated with swelling, popping and grinding. She complains of pins and needles sensation over the area of the common peroneal nerve overlying the fibular head. She has no dysesthetic or allodynic symptoms with light touch over the remainder of the knee and the femoral nerve area. Heavy pressure and light percussion of the fibular head produce painful numbness, tingling, and pins and needles sensation. The patient underwent a left knee MRI in September of 2006 revealing nonspecific edema anterior to the patellar tendon, but no evidence of an acute fracture or a femoropatellar ligament avulsion or abnormality. She has continued to complain of persistent instability and pain. She is not working. She has a number of allergies to different pain medications and feels that her back has been bothersome mostly due to her gait disturbances relating to her knee. Her pain is described as constant, shooting, cramping, aching, throbbing, pulling, sharp, and stabbing in nature. It occasionally awakens her at night. It is better in recumbency with her leg elevated. Exacerbating factors include standing, walking, pushing, puling. VAS pain scale is rated as 6/10 for her average and current pain, 10/10 for worst pain, and 3/10 for her least pain. OSWESTRY PAIN INVENTORY: Significant impact on every aspect of her quality of life. The patient is not working and relates no particular functional goals. She does relate that she has put on quite a bit of weight since her injury. Apparently, Dr. ABCD has entertained the possibility of having of revising her tibial tray with a taller one. She has finished physical therapy and continues at home with quadriceps and hamstrings exercises. She has discontinued use of her knee brace. She would like to avoid surgery, if at all possible. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Otherwise, negative. PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Otherwise, negative. MEDICATIONS: No medications. ALLERGIES: Phenergan, morphine, Flexeril, Keflex, Bactrim, general anesthetics, Benadryl, and pain meds. FAMILY HISTORY: Remarkable for cervical cancer, heart disease, COPD, dementia, diabetes, and CHF. SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is not working. Rates her stress level as an 8/10. She is single with no children. Does not smoke, drink, or utilize illicit substances. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: A thirteen-point review of systems was surveyed including constitutional, HEENT, cardiac, pulmonary, GI, GU, endocrine, integument, hematological, immunological, neurological, musculoskeletal, psychological and rheumatological. Review of systems is otherwise, negative. See as per HPI. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Weight 255 pounds, temp 97.6, pulse 74, BP 140/94. The patient walks with an antalgic gait to the left. She has pain vocalization with standing, walking, and range of motion of the knee. Head is normocephalic and atraumatic. Cranial nerves II through XII are grossly intact. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Heart has regular rate and rhythm with normal S1, S2. No murmurs, rubs, or gallops are appreciated. The abdomen is obese, though nontender, nondistended without palpable organomegaly or pulsatile masses. The skin is warm and dry to the touch with peripheral pulses equally palpable over the radial, dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial areas. Neurological examination of the upper extremities is grossly intact to sensory and motor testing. Lower extremity neurologic exam reveals positive Tinel's features over the lateral aspect of the left fibular head. There is sensitivity over the distal aspect of her midline scar. No dystrophic features are evident. There is edema over the anterior tibial plateau and tenderness over both the medial, as well as lateral aspects of the tibial plateau. There is no discernible erythema over the knee. No discoloration. No trophic changes. She can extend almost to roughly about 10 and can flex to just at around 90 with pain behaviors. The patient is able to perform a straight leg lift and has otherwise normal engagement of all her distal musculature. Palpation of her axial skeleton reveals no bony step-off, skin tags, clefts or deformities. There is mild lumbar facetal features at the lumbosacral junction with extension and lateral bending. I can detect no clear pelvic asymmetry. IMPRESSION AND PLAN: Status post left knee injury with subsequent knee replacement and continued chronic painful left knee, mostly mechanical low back pain without evidence of radicular features. I think she may have a small sensory neuralgia of her left common peroneal nerve and has ongoing pain over her tibial plateau. The patient is not yet a year out from her surgery and understands that it may take several more months for her knee to settle down. There is no MR evidence of marrow edema or ligamentous disruption. She may have patellofemoral and/or tibial plateau related pain as well. She may do extremely well on a chronic pain program and is intolerant to most oral analgesics. She has worked since her date of injury and will need a graduated incremental return to her normal activities of daily living. Therefore, I have referred her for a chronic pain program through the Pain Care Center to be seen in followup upon completion."
392,Orthopedic," PROCEDURE: Trigger thumb release. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: After administering appropriate antibiotics and MAC anesthesia, the upper extremity was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. The arm was exsanguinated with Esmarch, and the tourniquet inflated to 250 mmHg. A transverse incision was made over the MPJ crease of the thumb. Dissection was carried down to the flexor sheath with care taken to identify and protect the neurovascular bundles. The flexor sheath was opened under direct vision with a scalpel, and then a scissor was used to release the A1 pulley under direct vision on the radial side, from its proximal extent to its distal extent at the junction of the proximal and middle thirds of the proximal phalanx. Meticulous hemostasis was maintained with bipolar electrocautery. The flexor pollicis longus tendon was identified and atraumatically pulled to ensure that no triggering remained. The patient then actively moved the thumb and no triggering was noted. After irrigating out the wound with copious amounts of sterile saline, the skin was closed with 5-0 nylon simple interrupted sutures. The wound was dressed and the patient was sent to the recovery room in good condition, having tolerated the procedure well."
393,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right failed total knee arthroplasty. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right failed total knee arthroplasty. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Revision right total knee arthroplasty. FIRST ANESTHESIA: Spinal. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Approximately 75 cc. TOURNIQUET TIME: 123 minutes. Then it was let down for approximately 15 minutes and then reinflated for another 26 minutes for a total of 149 minutes. COMPONENTS: A Zimmer NexGen Legacy knee size D right stemmed femoral component was used. A NexGen femoral component with a distal femoral augmented block, size 5 mm. A NexGen tibial component, size 3 mm was used. A size 14 mm constrained polyethylene surface was used as well. Original patellar component that the patient had was maintained. COMPLICATIONS: None. BRIEF HISTORY: The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of knee pain for 13 years. She had previous total knee arthroplasty and revision at an outside facility. She had continued pain, snapping, malalignment, difficulty with ambulation, and giving away and wished to undergo additional revision surgery. PROCEDURE: The patient was taken to the operative suite and placed on the operating table. Department of Anesthesia administered the spinal anesthetic. Once adequately anesthetized, the patient was placed in a supine position. Care was ensured and she was adequately secured and well padded in position. Once this was obtained, the right lower extremity was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. Tourniquet was inflated to approximately 325 mmHg on the right thigh. At this point, an incision was made over her anterior previous knee scar taking this down to the subcutaneous tissue of the overlying retinaculum. A medial parapatellar arthrotomy was then made by using a second knife and this was taken both distally and proximally to allow us to sublux the patella on the lateral aspect to allow exposure to the joint surface. There was noted to be no evidence of purulence or gross clinical appearance of infection, however, intraoperative cultures were taken to asses this as well. At this point, the previous articular surface was then removed using an osteotome until this was left free and then removed. This was done without difficulty. Attention was then directed removing the femoral component. Osteotome was taken around each of the edges until this was gently lifted up and then a femoral extractor was placed around it and this was back flapped until this was easily removed. After this was performed, attention was then directed to the tibial component. An osteotome was again inserted around the surface and this was easily pried loose. There was noted to be minimal difficulty with this and did not appear to have adequate cement fixation. This was evaluated. The bone stalk appeared to be adequate, however, there were noted to be some deficits where we need to trim cement, so we elected to proceed with stemmed component. The attention was first directed to the femur and the femoral canal was opened up and superficially reamed up to a size 18 mm proximal portion for the Zimmer stemmed component. At this point, the distal femoral cut was evaluated with a intramedullary guide and this was noted to be cut in a varus cut leaving us a large deficit of the medial femoral cut. We elected because of this large amount of retic to take off the medial condyle to correct this varus cut to a six degree valgus cut. We elected to augment the medial aspect and take only 5 mm off of the lateral condyle instead of a full 10 to 12. At this point, the distal femoral cutting guide based on the intramedullary head was then placed. Care was ensured that this was aligned in proper rotation with the external epicondylar axis. Once this was pinned in position, approximately a six degree valgus cut was then made. This allowed a portion of the medial condyle to be removed distally. The anterior cut was checked next using the intramedullary guide. The anterior surface cutting block was then placed. This aligned us to anterior cutting block. We ensured again that rotation was aligned with the epicondylar axis. Once this was adequately aligned with this and gave us some external rotation, this was pinned in position and new anterior cut was made. It was noted that minimal bone was taken off the surface, only a slight portion on the medial anterior surface. _______ was then removed and the chamfer cutting guide was then placed on. This allowed us to make a box cut and recut some of the angled cuts of the distal femur. Once this was placed and pinned in position. Care was then again taken to check that this was in proper rotation and then the chamfer cuts were recut. It was noted that the anterior chamfers did not need to be cut, take off no bone. The posterior chamfers did remove some bony aspects. This was also taken off some of the posterior aspects of the condyles and then the ossicle saw and reciprocal saw were used to take off a notch cut to open up a constrained component. After all these cuts were taken, the guides were then removed and the trial component with a medial 5 mm augment was then placed. This appeared to have an adequate fit and then packed in position. It appeared to be satisfactory. At this point, this was removed and attention was then directed to the tibia. The intramedullary canal was again opened up using a proximal drill and this was reamed to the appropriate size until good _______ was obtained. At this point, the intramedullary guide was used to evaluate a tibial cut. This appeared to be adequate, however, we elected to remove 2 mm of bone to give us a new fresh bony surface. The cutting guide was placed in adequate alignment and checked both the with intramedullary guide and an external alignment rod, which allowed us to ensure that we had proper external rotation of this tibial component. At this point, this was pinned in position and the tibial cut was made to remove an extra 2 mm of bone. This was again removed and a trial tibial stemmed component was then placed as well as the trial augmented stemmed femoral component. This was placed in a proper position. A 10 mm articular surface was placed in the knee and this was taken through range of motion. This was found to have better alignment and satisfactory position. We elected to take an intraoperative x-ray at this point, to evaluate our cut. The intraoperative x-ray demonstrates satisfactory cuts and alignment of the prosthesis. At this point, all trials were removed. The patella was then examined. The rongeur was used to remove the surrounding synovium. The patella was evaluated and found to have mild wear on the lateral aspect of the inferior butt, however, this was very mild and overall had a good position and was well fixed to the bone. It was elected at this time to maintain this anatomic patella that was previously placed. At this point, the joint again was reevaluated and any bone loose fragments removed. There was noted to be some posterior tightness and mild osteophytes. These were removed with a rongeur. At this time, while preparing the canals, the tourniquet was deflated due to it being 123 minutes. Approximately 10 minutes did get by, as the knee was copiously irrigated and suctioned dried. The tourniquet was then reinflated. The canals were prepped for cementing. They were suction-dried and cleaned. The tibial component was cemented and then impacted into position and ensured it was adequately aligned in proper external rotation and alignment that was previously tried with the trial. Once this was fixed and secured, all extra cement was removed and attention was directed to the femoral component. The stemmed femoral component was then impacted in position and cemented. Again care was ensured that it was in adequate position and proper rotation. A size 14 mm poly was then inserted in between to provide compression. This was then taken through extension and held until cement cured. This was then removed and the components were evaluated. All excess cement was removed and they were well fixed. Size 14 mm trial Poly was then placed and this was taken through range of motion. This was found to have excellent range of motion and good stability. It was elected at this time that we would go with the size 14 mm Poly. This gave us extra Poly for ware and then provide excellent contact throughout the range of motion. The final articular surface was then placed and tightened into position to allow to _______ secured. The knee was then reduced and the knee was taken through range of motion. The patella was tracking with no-touch technique and adequately positioned. At this point, the tourniquet was deflated for second time and then the knee was copiously irrigated and suctioned dry. All bleeding was cauterized using a Bovie cautery. The retinaculum was then repaired using #1 Ethibond in a figure-of-eight fashion. This was reinforced with a running #2-0 Vicryl. The knee was then flexed and noted that the patella was tracking with good alignment. The wound was again copiously irrigated and suctioned dry. A drain was placed prior to retinaculum repair deep to this to provide adequate drainage. At this point, the subcutaneous tissue was closed with #2-0 Vicryl. Skin was approximated with skin clips. Sterile dressing of Adaptic, 4x4, Webril, and ABDs were then placed. A large Dupre dressing was then placed up the entire lower extremity. The patient was then transferred back to recovery in supine position. DISPOSITION: The patient tolerated the procedure well with no complications and transferred to PACU in satisfactory condition."
394,Orthopedic," ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: Right tibial plateau fracture. DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: Right tibial plateau fracture and also medial meniscus tear on the right side. PROCEDURES PERFORMED: Open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of right Schatzker III tibial plateau fracture with partial medial meniscectomy. CONSULTATIONS: To rehab, Dr. X and to Internal Medicine for management of multiple medical problems including hypothyroid, diabetes mellitus type 2, bronchitis, and congestive heart failure. HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient was admitted and consented for operation, and taken to the operating room for open reduction and internal fixation of right Schatzker III tibial plateau fracture and partial medial meniscectomy performed without incidence. The patient seemed to be recovering well. The patient spent the next several days on the floor, nonweightbearing with CPM machine in place, developed a brief period of dyspnea, which seems to have resolved and may have been a combination of bronchitis, thick secretions, and fluid overload. The patient was given nebulizer treatment and Lasix increased the same to resolve the problem. The patient was comfortable, stabilized, breathing well. On day #12, was transferred to ABCD. DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: The patient is to be transferred to ABCD after open reduction and internal fixation of right tibial plateau fracture and partial medial meniscectomy. DIET: Regular. ACTIVITY AND LIMITATIONS: Nonweightbearing to the right lower extremity. The patient is to continue CPM machine while in bed along with antiembolic stockings. The patient will require nursing, physical therapy, occupational therapy, and social work consults. DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Resume home medications, but increase Lasix to 80 mg every morning, Lovenox 30 mg subcu daily x2 weeks, Vicodin 5/500 mg one to two every four to six hours p.r.n. pain, Combivent nebulizer every four hours while awake for difficulty breathing, Zithromax one week 250 mg daily, and guaifenesin long-acting one twice a day b.i.d. FOLLOWUP: Follow up with Dr. Y in 7 to 10 days in office. CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: Stable."
395,Orthopedic," PROCEDURES 1. Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. 2. Arthroscopic subacromial decompression. 3. Arthroscopic extensive debridement, superior labrum anterior and posterior tear. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: After written consent was obtained from the patient, the patient was brought back into the operating room and identified. The patient was placed on the operating room table in supine position and given general anesthetic. Once the patient was under general anesthetic, a careful examination of the shoulder was performed. It revealed no patholigamentous laxity. The patient was then carefully positioned into a beach-chair position. We maintained the natural alignment of the head, neck, and thorax at all times. The shoulder and upper extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. Once we fully prepped and draped, we then began the surgery. We injected the glenohumeral joint with sterile saline with a spinal needle. This consisted of 60 cc of fluid. We then made a posterior incision for our portal, 2 cm inferior and 2 cm medial to the posterolateral angle of the acromion. Through this incision, a blunt trocar and cannula were placed in the glenohumeral joint. Through the cannula, a camera was placed; and the shoulder was insufflated with sterile saline through a preoperative feed. We then carefully examined the glenohumeral joint. We found the articular surface to be in good condition. There was a superior labral tear (SLAP). This was extensively debrided using a shaver through an anterior portal. We also found a full thickness rotator cuff tear. We then drained the glenohumeral joint. We redirected our camera into the subacromial space. An anterolateral portal was made, both superior and inferior. We then proceeded to perform a subacromial decompression using high-speed shaver. The bursa was extensively debrided. We then abraded the bone over the footprint of where the rotator cuff is usually attached. The corkscrew anchors were used to perform a rotator cuff repair. Pictures were taken. Through a separate incision, an indwelling pain catheter was then placed. It was carefully positioned. Pictures were taken. We then drained the joint. All instruments were removed. The patient did receive IV antibiotic preoperatively. All portals were closed using 4-0 nylon sutures. Xeroform, 4 x 4s, and OpSite were applied over the pain pump. ABD, tape, and a sling were also applied. A Cryo/Cuff was also placed over the shoulder. The patient was taken out of the beach-chair position maintaining the neutral alignment of the head, neck, and thorax. The patient was extubated and brought to the recovery room in stable condition. I then went out and spoke with the family, going over the case, postoperative instructions, and followup care."
396,Orthopedic," DIAGNOSES: 1. Cervical dystonia. 2. Post cervical laminectomy pain syndrome. Ms. XYZ states that the pain has now shifted to the left side. She has noticed a marked improvement on the right side, which was subject to a botulinum toxin injection about two weeks ago. She did not have any side effects on the Botox injection and she feels that her activities of daily living are increased, but she is still on the oxycodone and methadone. The patient's husband confirms the fact that she is doing a lot better, that she is more active, but there are still issues yet regarding anxiety, depression, and frustration regarding the pain in her neck. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient is appropriate. She is well dressed and oriented x3. She still smells of some cigarette smoke. Examination of the neck shows excellent reduction in muscle spasm on the right paraspinals, trapezius and splenius capitis muscles. There are no trigger points felt and her range of motion of the neck is still somewhat guarded, but much improved. On the left side, however, there is significant muscle spasm with tight bands involving the multifidus muscle with trigger point activity and a lot of tenderness and guarding. This extends down into the trapezius muscle, but the splenius capitis seems to be not involved. TREATMENT PLAN: After a long discussion with the patient and the husband, we have decided to go ahead and do botulinum toxin injection into the left multifidus/trapezius muscles. A total of 400 units of Botox is anticipated. The procedure is being scheduled. The patient's medications are refilled. She will continue to see Dr. Berry and continue her therapy with Mary Hotchkinson in Victoria."
397,Orthopedic," REASON FOR NEUROLOGICAL CONSULTATION: Cervical spondylosis and kyphotic deformity. The patient was seen in conjunction with medical resident Dr. X. I personally obtained the history, performed examination, and generated the impression and plan. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 45-year-old African-American female whose symptoms first started some one and a half years ago with pain in the left shoulder and some neck pain. This has subsequently resolved. She started vigorous workouts in November 2005. In March of this year, she suddenly could not feel her right foot on the bathroom floor and subsequently went to her primary care physician. By her report, she had a nerve conduction study and a diagnosis of radiculopathy was made. She had an MRI of lumbosacral spine, which was within normal limits. She then developed a tingling sensation in the right middle toe. Symptoms progressed to sensory symptoms of her knees, elbows, and left middle toe. She then started getting sensory sensations in the left hand and arm. She states that she feels a little bit wobbly at the knees and that she is slightly dragging her left leg. Symptoms have been mildly progressive. She is unaware of any trigger other than the vigorous workouts as mentioned above. She has no associated bowel or bladder symptoms. No particular position relieves her symptoms. Workup has included two MRIs of the C-spine, which were personally reviewed and are discussed below. She saw you for consultation and the possibility of surgical decompression was raised. At this time, she is somewhat reluctant to go through any surgical procedure. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Ocular migraines. 2. Myomectomy. 3. Infertility. 4. Hyperglycemia. 5. Asthma. 6. Hypercholesterolemia. MEDICATIONS: Lipitor, Pulmicort, Allegra, Xopenex, Patanol, Duac topical gel, Loprox cream, and Rhinocort. ALLERGIES: Penicillin and aspirin. Family history, social history, and review of systems are discussed above as well as documented in the new patient information sheet. Of note, she does not drink or smoke. She is married with two adopted children. She is a paralegal specialist. She used to exercise vigorously, but of late has been advised to stop exercising and is currently only walking. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: She does complain of mild blurred vision, but these have occurred before and seem associated with headaches. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On examination, blood pressure 138/82, pulse 90, respiratory rate 14, and weight 176.5 pounds. Pain scale is 0. A full general and neurological examination was personally performed and is documented on the chart. Of note, she has a normal general examination. Neurological examination reveals normal cognition and cranial nerve examination including normal jaw jerk. She has mild postural tremor in both arms. She has mild decreased sensation in the right palm and mild decreased light touch in the right palm and decreased vibration sense in both distal lower extremities. Motor examination reveals no weakness to individual muscle testing, but on gait she does have a very subtle left hemiparesis. She has hyperreflexia in her lower extremities, worse on the left. Babinski's are downgoing. PERTINENT DATA: MRI of the brain from 05/02/06 and MRI of the C-spine from 05/02/06 and 07/25/06 were personally reviewed. MRI of the brain is broadly within normal limits. MRI of the C-spine reveals large central disc herniation at C6-C7 with evidence of mild cord compression and abnormal signal in the cord suggesting cord edema. There is also a fairly large disc at C3-C4 with cord deformity and partial effacement of the subarachnoid space. I do not appreciate any cord edema at this level. IMPRESSION AND PLAN: The patient is a 45-year-old female with cervical spondylosis with a large C6-C7 herniated disc with mild cord compression and signal change at that level. She has a small disc at C3-C4 with less severe and only subtle cord compression. History and examination are consistent with signs of a myelopathy. Results were discussed with the patient and her mother. I am concerned about progressive symptoms. Although she only has subtle symptoms now, we made her aware that with progression of this process, she may have paralysis. If she is involved in any type of trauma to the neck such as motor vehicle accident, she could have an acute paralysis. I strongly recommended to her and her mother that she followup with you as soon as possible for surgical evaluation. I agree with the previous physicians who have told her not to exercise as I am sure that her vigorous workouts and weight training since November 2005 have contributed to this problem. I have recommended that she wear a hard collar while driving. The results of my consultation were discussed with you telephonically."
398,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Dural tear, postoperative laminectomy, L4-L5. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES 1. Dural tear, postoperative laminectomy, L4-L5. 2. Laterolisthesis, L4-L5. 3. Spinal instability, L4-L5. OPERATIONS PERFORMED 1. Complete laminectomy, L4. 2. Complete laminectomy plus facetectomy, L3-L4 level. 3. A dural repair, right sided, on the lateral sheath, subarticular recess at the L4 pedicle level. 4. Posterior spinal instrumentation, L4 to S1, using Synthes Pangea System. 5. Posterior spinal fusion, L4 to S1. 6. Insertion of morselized autograft, L4 to S1. ANESTHESIA: General. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 500 mL. COMPLICATIONS: None. DRAINS: Hemovac x1. DISPOSITION: Vital signs stable, taken to the recovery room in a satisfactory condition, extubated. INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION: The patient is a 48-year-old gentleman who has had a prior decompression several weeks ago. He presented several days later with headaches as well as a draining wound. He was subsequently taken back for a dural repair. For the last 10 to 11 days, he has been okay except for the last two days he has had increasing headaches, has nausea, vomiting, as well as positional migraines. He has fullness in the back of his wound. The patient's risks and benefits have been conferred him due to the fact that he does have persistent spinal leak. The patient was taken to the operating room for exploration of his wound with dural repair with possible stabilization pending what we find intraoperatively. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: After appropriate consent was obtained from the patient, the patient was wheeled back to the operating theater room #7. The patient was placed in the usual supine position and intubated under general anesthesia without any difficulties. The patient was given intraoperative antibiotics. The patient was rolled onto the OSI table in usual prone position and prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion. Initially, a midline incision was made from the cephalad to caudad level. Full-thickness skin flaps were developed. It was seen immediately that there was large amount of copious fluid emanating from the wound, clear-like fluid, which was the cerebrospinal fluid. Cultures were taken, aerobic, anaerobic, AFB, fungal. Once this was done, the paraspinal muscles were affected from the posterior elements. It was seen that there were no facet complexes on the right side at L4-L5 and L5-S1. It was seen that the spine was listhesed at L5 and that the dural sac was pinched at the L4-5 level from the listhesis. Once this was done; however, the fluid emanating from the dura could not be seen appropriately. Complete laminectomy at L4 was performed as well extending the L5 laminectomy more to the left. Complete laminectomy at L3 was done. Once this was done within the subarticular recess on the right side at the L4 pedicle level, a rent in the dura was seen. Once this was appropriately cleaned, the dural edges were approximated using a running 6-0 Prolene suture. A Valsalva confirmed no significant lead after the repair was made. There was a significant laterolisthesis at L4-L5 and due to the fact that there were no facet complexes at L5-S1 and L4-L5 on the right side as well as there was a significant concavity on the right L4-L5 disk space which was demonstrated from intraoperative x-rays and compared to preoperative x-rays, it was decided from an instrumentation. The lateral pedicle screws were placed at L4, L5, and S1 using the standard technique of Magerl. After this the standard starting point was made. Trajectory was completed with gearshift and sounded in all four quadrants to make sure there was no violation of the pedicle wall. Once this was done, this was undertapped at 1 mm and resounded in all four quadrants to make sure that there was no violation of the pedicle wall. The screws were subsequently placed. Tricortical purchase was obtained at S1 ________ appropriate size screws. Precontoured titanium rod was then appropriately planned and placed between the screws at L4, L5, and S1. This was done on the right side first. The screw was torqued at S1 appropriately and subsequently at L5. Minimal compression was then placed between L5 and L4 to correct the concavity as well as laterolisthesis and the screw appropriately torqued at L4. Neutral compression distraction was obtained on the left side. Screws were torqued at L4, L5, and S1 appropriately. Good placement was seen both in AP and lateral planes using fluoroscopy. Laterolisthesis corrected appropriately at L4 and L5. Posterior spinal fusion was completed by decorticating the posterior elements at L4-L5 and the sacral ala with a curette. Once good bleeding subchondral bone was appreciated, the morselized bone from the laminectomy was morselized with corticocancellous bone chips together with demineralized bone matrix. This was placed in the posterior lateral gutters. DuraGen was then placed over the dural repair, and after this, fibrin glue was placed appropriately. Deep retractors then removed from the confines of the wound. Fascia was closed using interrupted Prolene running suture #1. Once this was done, suprafascial drain was placed appropriately. Subcutaneous tissues were opposed using a 2-0 Prolene suture. The dermal edges were approximated using staples. Wound was dressed sterilely using bacitracin ointment, Xeroform, 4 x 4's, and tape. The drain was connected appropriately. The patient was rolled on stretcher in usual supine position, extubated uneventfully, and taken back to the recovery room in a satisfactory stable condition. No complications arose."
399,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Wrist de Quervain stenosing tenosynovitis. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Wrist de Quervain stenosing tenosynovitis. TITLE OF PROCEDURES 1. de Quervain release. 2. Fascial lengthening flap of the 1st dorsal compartment. ANESTHESIA: MAC. COMPLICATIONS: None. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: After MAC anesthesia and appropriate antibiotics were administered, the upper extremity was prepped and draped in the usual standard fashion. The arm was exsanguinated with an Esmarch and the tourniquet inflated to 250 mmHg. I made a transverse incision just distal to the radial styloid. Dissection was carried down directly to the 1st dorsal compartment with the superficial radial nerve identified and protected. Meticulous hemostasis was maintained with bipolar electrocautery. I dissected the sheath superficially free of any other structures, specifically the superficial radial nerve. I then incised it under direct vision dorsal to its axis and incised it both proximally and distally. The EPB subsheath was likewise released. I irrigated the wound thoroughly. In order to prevent tendon subluxation, I then back-cut both the dorsal and volar leafs of the sheath so that I could close them in an extended and lengthened position. I did this with 3-0 Vicryl. I then passed an instrument underneath to check and make sure that the sheath was not too tight. I then irrigated it and closed the skin, and then I dressed and splinted the wrist appropriately. The patient was sent to the recovery room in good condition, having tolerated the procedure well."
400,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Cervical spondylosis at C3-C4 with cervical radiculopathy and spinal cord compression. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Cervical spondylosis at C3-C4 with cervical radiculopathy and spinal cord compression. OPERATION PERFORMED 1. Anterior cervical discectomy of C3-C4. 2. Removal of herniated disc and osteophytes. 3. Bilateral C4 nerve root decompression. 4. Harvesting of bone for autologous vertebral bodies for creation of arthrodesis. 5. Grafting of fibular allograft bone for creation of arthrodesis. 6. Creation of arthrodesis via an anterior technique with fibular allograft bone and autologous bone from the vertebral bodies. 7. Placement of anterior spinal instrumentation using the operating microscope and microdissection technique. INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: This 62-year-old man has progressive and intractable right C4 radiculopathy with neck and shoulder pain. Conservative therapy has failed to improve the problem. Imaging studies showed severe spondylosis of C3-C4 with neuroforaminal narrowing and spinal cord compression. A detailed discussion ensued with the patient as to the nature of the procedure including all risks and alternatives. He clearly understood it and had no further questions and requested that I proceed. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was placed on the operating room table and was intubated using a fiberoptic technique. The methylprednisolone spinal cord protocol was instituted with bolus and continuous infusion doses. The neck was carefully prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner. A transverse incision was made on a skin crease on the left side of the neck. Dissection was carried down through the platysmal musculature and the anterior spine was exposed. The medial borders of the longus colli muscles were dissected free from their attachments to the spine. A needle was placed and it was believed to be at the C3-C4 interspace and an x-ray properly localized this space. Castoff self-retaining pins were placed into the body of the C3 and C4. Self-retaining retractors were placed in the wound keeping the blades of the retractors underneath the longus colli muscles. The annulus was incised and a discectomy was performed. Quite a bit of overhanging osteophytes were identified and removed. As I worked back to the posterior lips of the vertebral body, the operating microscope was utilized. There was severe overgrowth of spondylitic spurs. A high-speed diamond bur was used to slowly drill these spurs away. I reached the posterior longitudinal ligament and opened it and exposed the underlying dura. Slowly and carefully I worked out towards the C3-C4 foramen. The dura was extremely thin and I could see through it in several areas. I removed the bony compression in the foramen and identified soft tissue and veins overlying the root. All of these were not stripped away for fear of tearing this very tissue-paper-thin dura. However, radical decompression was achieved removing all the bony compression in the foramen, out to the pedicle, and into the foramen. An 8-mm of the root was exposed although I left the veins over the root intact. The microscope was angled to the left side where a similar procedure was performed. Once the decompression was achieved, a high-speed cortisone bur was used to decorticate the body from the greater posterior shelf to prevent backward graft migration. Bone thus from the drilling was preserved for use for the arthrodesis. Attention was turned to creation of the arthrodesis. As I had drilled quite a bit into the bodies, I selected a large 12-mm graft and distracted the space maximally. Under distraction the graft was placed and fit well. An x-ray showed good graft placement. Attention was turned to spinal instrumentation. A Synthes Short Stature plate was used with four 3-mm screws. Holes were drilled with all four screws were placed with pretty good purchase. Next, the locking screws were then applied. An x-ray was obtained which showed good placement of graft, plate, and screws. The upper screws were near the upper endplate of C3. The C3 vertebral body that remained was narrow after drilling off the spurs. Rather than replace these screws and risk that the next holes would be too near the present holes I decided to leave these screws intact because their position is still satisfactory as they are below the disc endplate. Attention was turned to closure. A Hemovac drain was placed in the anterior vertebral body space and brought out through a separate stab wound incision in the skin. The wound was then carefully closed in layers. Sterile dressings were applied along with a rigid Philadelphia collar. The operation was then terminated. The patient tolerated the procedure well and left for the recovery room in excellent condition. The sponge and needle counts were reported as correct and there were no intraoperative complications. Specimens were sent to Pathology consisted of bone and soft tissue as well as C3-C4 disc material."
401,Orthopedic," CHIEF COMPLAINT: Left elbow pain. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This 17-year-old male was fighting with some other kids in Juvenile Hall when he felt some pain in his left elbow, causing sudden pain. He also has pain in his left ankle, but he is able to walk normally. He has had previous pain in his left knee. He denies any passing out, any neck pain at this time even though he did get hit in the head. He has no chest or abdominal pain. Apparently, no knives or guns were involved. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: He has had toe problems and left knee pain in the past. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: No coughing, sputum production, dyspnea or chest pain. No vomiting or abdominal pain. No visual changes. No neurologic deficits other than some numbness in his left hand. SOCIAL HISTORY: He is in Juvenile Hall for about 25 more days. He is a nonsmoker. ALLERGIES: MORPHINE. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Abilify. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Stable. HEENT: PERRLA. EOMI. Conjunctivae anicteric. Skull is normocephalic. He is not complaining of bruising. HEENT: TMs and canals are normal. There is no Battle sign. NECK: Supple. He has good range of motion. Spinal processes are normal to palpation. LUNGS: Clear. CARDIAC: Regular rate. No murmurs or rubs. EXTREMITIES: Left elbow is tender. He does not wish to move it at all. Shoulder and clavicle are within normal limits. Wrist is normal to inspection. He does have some pain to palpation. Hand has good capillary refill. He seems to have decreased sensation in all three dermatomes. He has moderately good abduction of all fingers. He has moderate opponens strength with his thumb. He has very good extension of all of his fingers with good strength. We did an x-ray of his elbow. He has a spiral fracture of the distal one-third of the humerus, about 13 cm in length. The proximal part looks like it is in good position. The distal part has about 6 mm of displacement. There is no significant angulation. The joint itself appears to be intact. The fracture line ends where it appears above the joint. I do not see any extra blood in the joint. I do not see any anterior or posterior Siegert sign. I spoke with Dr. X. He suggests we go ahead and splint him up and he will follow the patient up. At this point, it does not seem like there needs to be any surgical revision. The chance of a compartment syndrome seems very low at this time. Using 4-inch Ortho-Glass and two assistants, we applied a posterior splint to immobilize his fingers, hand, and wrist all the way up to his elbow to well above the elbow. He had much better comfort once this was applied. There was good color to his fingers and again, much better comfort. Once that was on, I took some 5-inch Ortho-Glass and put in extra reinforcement around the elbow so he would not be moving it, straightening it or breaking the fiberglass. We then gave him a sling. We gave him #2 Vicodin p.o. and #4 to go. Gave him a prescription for #15 more and warned him to take it only at nighttime and use Tylenol or Motrin, and ice in the daytime. I gave him the name and telephone number of Dr. X whom they can follow up with. They were warned to come back here if he has increasing neurologic deficits in his hands or any new problems. DIAGNOSES: 1. Fracture of the humerus, spiral. 2. Possible nerve injuries to the radial and median nerve, possibly neurapraxia. 3. Psychiatric disorder, unspecified. DISPOSITION: The patient will follow up as mentioned above. They can return here anytime as needed."
402,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right distal femoral, subperiosteal abscess. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right distal femoral, subperiosteal abscess. OPERATION: Repeat irrigation and debridement of above. ANESTHESIA: General. BLOOD LOSS: Minimal. FLUID: Per anesthesia. DRAINS: Hemovac times two. COMPLICATIONS: None apparent. SPECIMENS: To microbiology. INDICATIONS: She is a 10-year-old girl who has history of burns and has developed a subperiosteal abscess at her right distal femur. I am bringing her back to the operating room for another exploration of this area and washout. This will be the third procedure for this. At the last time, there was gross purulence that was encountered. Since that time, the patient has defervesced. Her white count is slowly coming down. Her C-reactive protein is slowly coming down. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: After informed consent was obtained, operative site marked, and after preoperative antibiotics were given, the patient was brought back to the operating room and placed supine on the operating table, where Anesthesia induced general anesthesia. The patient's right lower extremity was prepped and draped in normal sterile fashion. Surgical timeout occurred verifying the patient's identification, surgical site, surgical procedure, and administration of antibiotics. The patient's previous incision sites had the sutures removed. We bluntly dissected down through to the IT band. These deep stitches were then removed. We exposed the area of the subperiosteal abscess. The tissue looked much better than at the last surgery. We irrigated this area with three liters of saline containing bacitracin. Next, we made our small medial window to assist with washout of the joint itself. We put another three liters of saline containing bacitracin through the knee joint. Lastly, we did another three liters into the area of the distal femur with three liters of plain saline. We then placed two Hemovac drains, one in the metaphysis and one superficially. We closed the deep fascia with #1 PDS. Subcutaneous layers with 2-0 Monocryl and closed the skin with 2-0 nylon. We placed a sterile dressing. We then turned the case over to Dr. Petty for dressing change and skin graft. PLAN: Our plan will be to pull the drains in 48 hours. We will then continue to watch the patient's fever curve and follow her white count to see how she is responding to the operative and medical therapies."
403,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Infected right hip bipolar arthroplasty, status post excision and placement of antibiotic spacer. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Infected right hip bipolar arthroplasty, status post excision and placement of antibiotic spacer. PROCEDURES: 1. Removal of antibiotic spacer. 2. Revision total hip arthroplasty. IMPLANTS 1. Hold the Zimmer trabecular metal 50 mm acetabular shell with two 6.5 x 30 mm screws. 2. Zimmer femoral component, 13.5 x 220 mm with a size AA femoral body. 3. A 32-mm femoral head with a +0 neck length. ANESTHESIA: Regional. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 500 cc. COMPLICATIONS: None. DRAINS: Hemovac times one and incisional VAC times one. INDICATIONS: The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of previous right bipolar hemiarthroplasty for trauma. This subsequently became infected. She has undergone removal of this prosthesis and placement of antibiotic spacer. She currently presents for stage II reconstruction with removal of antibiotic spacer and placement of a revision total hip. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the operating room by anesthesia personnel. She was placed supine on the operating table. A Foley catheter was inserted. A formal time out was obtained in identifying the correct patient, operative site. Preoperative antibiotics were held for intraoperative cultures. The patient was placed into the lateral decubitus position with the right side up. The previous surgical incision was identified. The right lower extremity was prepped and draped in standard fashion. The old surgical incision was reopened along its proximal extent. Immediately encountered was a large amount of fibrous scar tissue. Dissection was carried sharply down through this scar tissue. Soft tissue plains were extremely difficult to visualize due to all the scarring. There was no native tissue to orient oneself with. We carried our dissection down through the scar tissue to what seemed to be a fascial layer. We incised through the fascial layer down to some scarred gluteus maximus muscle and down over what was initially felt to be the greater trochanter. Dissection was carried down through soft tissue and the distal located antibiotic spacer was exposed. This was used as a landmark to orient remainder of the dissection. The antibiotic spacer was exposed and followed distally to expose the proximal femur. Dissection was continued posteriorly and proximally to expose the acetabulum. A cobra retractor was able to be inserted across the superior aspect of the acetabulum to enhance exposure. Once improved visualization was obtained, the antibiotic spacer was removed from the femur. This allowed further improved visualization of the acetabulum. The acetabulum was filled with soft tissue debris and scar tissue. This was removed with sharp excision with a knife as well as with a rongeur and a Bovie. Once soft tissue was removed, the acetabulum was reamed. Reaming was started with a 46-mm reamer and carried up sequentially to prepare for 50-mm shell. The 50 mm shell was trialed and had good stability and fit. Attention was then turned to continue preparation of the femur. The canal was then debrided with femoral canal curettes. Some fibrous tissue was removed from the canal. The length of the femoral stem was then checked with this canal curette in place. Following x-rays, we prepared to begin reaming the femur. This femur was reamed over a guide rod using flexible reaming rods. The canal was reamed up to 13.5 mm distally in preparation for 14 mm stem. The stem was selected and initially size A body was placed in trial. The body was too tight proximally to fit. The proximal canal was then reamed for a size AA body. A longer stem with an anterior bow was selected and a size AA trial was assembled. This fit nicely in the canal and had good fit and fill. Intraoperative radiographs were obtained to determine component position. Intraoperative radiographs revealed satisfactory length of the component past the distal of fractures in the femur. The remainder of the trial was then assembled and the hip was relocated and trialed. Initially, it was found to be unstable posteriorly. We changed from a 10 degree lip liner to 20 degree lip liner. Again, the hip was trialed and found to be unstable posteriorly. This was due to reversion of the femoral component. As we attempted to seat the prosthesis, the stent continued to attempt to turn in retroversion. The stem was extracted and retrialed. Improved stability was obtained and we decided to proceed with the real components. A 20 degree liner was inserted into the acetabular shell. The real femoral components were assembled and inserted into the femoral canal. Again, the hip was trialed. The components were found to be in relative retroversion. The real components were then backed down and the neck was placed in the more anteversion and reinserted. Again, the stem attempted to follow in the relative retroversion. Along with this time, however, it was improved from previous attempts. The femoral head trial was placed back on the components and the hip relocated. It was taken to a range of motion and found to have improved stability compared to previous trialing. Decision was made to accept the component position. The real femoral head was selected and implanted. The hip was then taken again to a range of motion. It was stable at 90 degrees of flexion with 20 degrees of adduction and 40 degrees of internal rotation. The patient reached full extension and had no instability anteriorly. The wound was then irrigated again with pulsatile lavage. Six liters of pulsatile lavage was used during the procedure. The wound was then closed in a layered fashion. A Hemovac drain was placed deep to the fascial layer. The subcutaneous tissues were closed with #1 PDS, 2-0 PDS, and staples in the skin. An incisional VAC was then placed over the wound as well. Sponge and needle counts were correct at the close of the case. DISPOSITION: The patient will be weightbearing as tolerated with posterior hip precautions."
404,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Internal derangement, left knee. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Internal derangement, left knee. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Arthroscopy of the left knee with medial meniscoplasty. ANESTHESIA: LMA. GROSS FINDINGS: Displaced bucket-handle tear of medial meniscus, left knee. PROCEDURE: After informed consent was obtained, the patient was taken to ABCD General Hospital Operating Room #1 where anesthesia was administered by the Department of Anesthesiology. The patient was then transferred to the operating room table in supine position with Johnson knee holder well-padded. Tourniquet was placed around the left upper thigh. The limb was then prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion. Standard anteromedial and anterolateral arthroscopy portals were obtained and a systematic examination of the knee was then performed. Patellofemoral joint showed frequent chondromalacia. Examination of the medial compartment showed a displaced bucket-handle tear of the medial meniscus involving the entire posterior, parietal, and portion of his anterior portion of the medial meniscus. The medial femoral condyle and medial tibial plateau were unaffected. Intercondylar notch examination revealed an intact ACL and PCL stable to drawer testing and probing and the lateral compartment showed an intact lateral meniscus. The femoral condyle and tibial plateau were all stable to probing. Attention was then directed back to the medial compartment where the detached portion of the meniscus was excised using arthroscopy scissors. A shaver was then used to smooth all the edges until the margins were stable to probing. The knee was then flushed with normal saline and suctioned dry. 20 cc of 0.25% Marcaine was injected into the knee and into the arthroscopy portals. A dressing consisting of Adaptic, 4x4s, ABDs, and Webril were applied followed by a TED hose. The patient was then transferred to the recovery room in stable condition."
405,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left tibial tubercle avulsion fracture. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Comminuted left tibial tubercle avulsion fracture with intraarticular extension. PROCEDURE: Open reduction and internal fixation of left tibia. ANESTHESIA: General. The patient received 10 ml of 0.5% Marcaine local anesthetic. TOURNIQUET TIME: 80 minutes. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal. DRAINS: One JP drain was placed. COMPLICATIONS: No intraoperative complications or specimens. Hardware consisted of two 4-5 K-wires, One 6.5, 60 mm partially threaded cancellous screw and one 45, 60 mm partially threaded cortical screw and 2 washers. HISTORY AND PHYSICAL: The patient is a 14-year-old male who reported having knee pain for 1 month. Apparently while he was playing basketball on 12/22/2007 when he had gone up for a jump, he felt a pop in his knee. The patient was seen at an outside facility where he was splinted and subsequently referred to Children's for definitive care. Radiographs confirmed comminuted tibial tubercle avulsion fracture with patella alta. Surgery is recommended to the grandmother and subsequently to the father by phone. Surgery would consist of open reduction and internal fixation with subsequent need for later hardware removal. Risks of surgery include the risks of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes on sensation in most of the extremity, hardware failure, need for later hardware removal, failure to restore extensor mechanism tension, and need for postoperative rehab. All questions were answered, and father and grandmother agreed to the above plan. PROCEDURE: The patient was taken to the operating and placed supine on the operating table. General anesthesia was then administered. The patient was given Ancef preoperatively. A nonsterile tourniquet was placed on the upper aspect of the patient's left thigh. The patient's extremity was then prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion. Midline incision was marked on the skin extending from the tibial tubercle proximally and extremities wrapped in Esmarch. Finally, the patient had tourniquet that turned in 75 mmHg. Esmarch was then removed. The incision was then made. The patient had significant tearing of the posterior retinaculum medially with proximal migration of the tibial tubercle which was located in the joint there was a significant comminution and intraarticular involvement. We were able to see the underside of the anterior horn of both medial and lateral meniscus. The intraarticular cartilage was restored using two 45 K-wires. Final position was checked via fluoroscopy and the corners were buried in the cartilage. There was a large free floating metaphyseal piece that included parts of proximal tibial physis. This was placed back in an anatomic location and fixed using a 45 cortical screw with a washer. The avulsed fragment with the patellar tendon was then fixed distally to this area using a 6.5, 60 mm cancellous screw with a washer. The cortical screw did not provide good compression and fixation at this distal fragment. Retinaculum was repaired using 0 Vicryl suture as best as possible. The hematoma was evacuated at the beginning of the case as well as the end. The knee was copiously irrigated with normal saline. The subcutaneous tissue was re-approximated using 2-0 Vicryl and the skin with 4-0 Monocryl. The wound was cleaned, dried, and dressed with Steri-Strips, Xeroform, and 4 x4s. Tourniquet was released at 80 minutes. JP drain was placed on the medium gutter. The extremity was then wrapped in Ace wrap from the proximal thigh down to the toes. The patient was then placed in a knee mobilizer. The patient tolerated the procedure well. Subsequently extubated and taken to the recovery in stable condition. POSTOP PLAN: The patient hospitalized overnight to decrease swelling and as well as manage his pain. He may weightbear as tolerated using knee mobilizer. Postoperative findings relayed to the grandmother. The patient will need subsequent hardware removal. The patient also was given local anesthetic at the end of the case."
406,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Medial meniscal tear, posterior horn of left knee. 2. Carpal tunnel syndrome chronic right hand with intractable pain, numbness, and tingling. 3. Impingement syndrome, right shoulder with acromioclavicular arthritis, bursitis, and chronic tendonitis. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Carpal tunnel syndrome, right hand, severe. 2. Bursitis, tendonitis, impingement, and AC arthritis, right shoulder. 3. Medial and lateral meniscal tears, posterior horn old, left knee. PROCEDURE: 1. Right shoulder arthroscopy, subacromial decompression, distal clavicle excision, bursectomy, and coracoacromial ligament resection. 2. Right carpal tunnel release. 3. Left knee arthroscopy and partial medial and lateral meniscectomy. ANESTHESIA: General with regional. COMPLICATIONS: None. DISPOSITION: To recovery room in awake, alert, and in stable condition. OPERATIVE INDICATIONS: A very active 50-year-old gentleman who had the above problems and workup revealed the above problems. He failed nonoperative management. We discussed the risks, benefits, and possible complications of operative and continued nonoperative management, and he gave his fully informed consent to the following procedure. OPERATIVE REPORT IN DETAIL: The patient was brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position on the operating room table. After adequate induction of general anesthesia, he was placed in the left lateral decubitus position. All bony prominences were padded. The right shoulder was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner using standard Betadine prep, entered through three standard arthroscopic portals anterolateral and posterior incising the skin with a knife using sharp and blunt trocar. Serial examination of the intraarticular portion of the shoulder showed all the structures to be normal including the biceps tendon ligaments, articular surfaces, and labrum. Subacromial space was entered. Visualization was poor due to the hemorrhagic bursitis, and this was resected back. It was essentially a type-3 acromion, which was converted to a type 1 by aiming the burr anterior from the posterior portal excising the larger anterior spur. Rotator cuff was little bit fray, but otherwise intact. Thus, the deep deltoid bursa and the markedly thickened coracoacromial ligament were removed. The burr was then introduced to the anterior portal and the distal clavicle excision carried out. The width of burr about 6 mm being careful to preserve the ligaments in the capsule, but removing the spurs and the denuded arthritic joint. The patient tolerated the procedure very well. The shoulder was then copiously irrigated, drained free of any residual debris. The wound was closed with 3-0 Prolene. Sterile compressive dressing applied. The patient was then placed on his back in the supine position and the right upper extremity and the left lower extremity were prepped and draped in usual sterile manner using a standard Betadine prep. The attention was first turned to the right hand where it was elevated, exsanguinated using an Esmarch bandage, and the tourniquet was inflated to 250 mmHg for about 25 minutes. Volar approach to the carpal ligament was performed incising the skin with a knife and using cautery for hemostasis. Tenotomy and forceps dissection carried out through the superficial palmar fascia, carried down to the volar carpal ligament, which was then transected sharply with a knife and carried proximal and distal under direct vision using the scissors being careful to avoid the neurovascular structures. Cautery was used for hemostasis. The never had an hourglass appearance where it was a kind of constricted as a result of the compression from the ligament, and so a small amount of Celestone was dripped onto the nerve to help quite it down. The patient tolerated this portion of the procedure very well. The hand was then irrigated, closed with Monocryl and Prolene, and sterile compressive dressing was applied and the tourniquet deflated. Attention was then turned to the left knee where it was entered through inferomedial and inferolateral portals incising the skin with a knife and using sharp and blunt trocars. After entering the knee through inferomedial and inferolateral standard arthroscopic portals, examination of the knee showed a displaced bucket-handle tear in the medial meniscus and a radial tear at the lateral meniscus. These were resected back to the stable surface using a basket forceps and full-radius shaver. There was no evidence of any other significant arthritis in the knee. There was a lot of synovitis, and so after the knee was irrigated out and free of any residual debris, the knee was injected with Celestone and Marcaine with epinephrine. The patient tolerated the procedure very well, and the wounds were closed with 3-0 Prolene and sterile compressive dressing was applied, and then the patient was taken to the recovery room, extubated, awake, alert, and in stable condition."
407,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Volar laceration to right ring finger with possible digital nerve injury with possible flexor tendon injury. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Laceration to right ring finger with partial laceration to the ulnar slip of the FDS which is the flexor digitorum superficialis. 2. 25% laceration to the flexor digitorum profundus of the right ring finger and laceration 100% of the ulnar digital nerve to the right ring finger. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: 1. Repair of nerve and tendon, right ring finger. 2. Exploration of digital laceration. ANESTHESIA: General. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Less than 10 cc. TOTAL TOURNIQUET TIME: 57 minutes. COMPLICATIONS: None. DISPOSITION: To PACU in stable condition. BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 13-year-old male who had sustained a laceration from glass and had described numbness and tingling in his right ring finger. GROSS OPERATIVE FINDINGS: After wound exploration, it was found there was a 100% laceration to the ulnar digital neurovascular bundle. The FDS had a partial ulnar slip laceration and the FDP had a 25% transverse laceration as well. The radial neurovascular bundle was found to be completely intact. OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: The patient was taken to the operating room and placed in the supine position. All bony prominences were adequately padded. Tourniquet was placed on the right upper extremity after being packed with Webril, but not inflated at this time. The right upper extremity was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. The hand was inspected. Palmar surface revealed approximally 0.5 cm laceration at the base of the right ring finger at the base of proximal phalanx, which was approximated with nylon suture. The sutures were removed and the wound was explored. It was found that the ulnar digital neurovascular bundle was 100% transected. The radial neurovascular bundle on the right ring finger was found to be completely intact. We explored the flexor tendon and found that there was a partial laceration of the ulnar slip of the FDS and a 25% laceration in a transverse fashion to the FDP. We copiously irrigated the wound. Repair was undertaken of the FDS with #3-0 undyed Ethibond suture. The laceration of the FDP was not felt that it need to repair due to majority of the substance in the FDP was still intact. Attention during our repair at the flexor tendon, the A1 pulley was incised for better visualization as well as better tendon excursion after repair. Attention was then drawn to the ulnar digital bundle which has been transected prior during the injury. The digital nerve was dissected proximally and distally to likely visualize the nerve. The nerve was then approximated using microvascular technique with #8-0 nylon suture. The hands were well approximated. The nerve was not under undue tension. The wound was then copiously irrigated and the skin was closed with #4-0 nylon interrupted horizontal mattress alternating with simple suture. Sterile dressing was placed and a dorsal extension Box splint was placed. The patient was transferred off of the bed and placed back on a gurney and taken to PACU in stable condition. Overall prognosis is good."
408,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES 1. Neck pain with bilateral upper extremity radiculopathy. 2. Residual stenosis, C3-C4, C4-C5, C5-C6, and C6-C7 with probable instability. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES 1. Neck pain with bilateral upper extremity radiculopathy. 2. Residual stenosis, C3-C4, C4-C5, C5-C6, and C6-C7 secondary to facet arthropathy with scar tissue. 3. No evidence of instability. OPERATIVE PROCEDURE PERFORMED 1. Bilateral C3-C4, C4-C5, C5-C6, and C6-C7 medial facetectomy and foraminotomy with technical difficulty. 2. Total laminectomy C3, C4, C5, and C6. 3. Excision of scar tissue. 4. Repair of dural tear with Prolene 6-0 and Tisseel. FLUIDS: 1500 cc of crystalloid. URINE OUTPUT: 200 cc. DRAINS: None. SPECIMENS: None. COMPLICATIONS: None. ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal anesthesia. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Less than 250 cc. INDICATIONS FOR THE OPERATION: This is the case of a very pleasant 41 year-old Caucasian male well known to me from previous anterior cervical discectomy and posterior decompression. Last surgery consisted of four-level decompression on 08/28/06. The patient continued to complain of posterior neck pain radiating to both trapezius. Review of his MRI revealed the presence of what still appeared to be residual lateral recess stenosis. It also raised the possibility of instability and based on this I recommended decompression and posterolateral spinal instrumention; however, intraoperatively, it appeared like there was no abnormal movement of any of the joint segments; however, there was still residual stenosis since the laminectomy that was done previously was partial. Based on this, I did total decompression by removing the lamina of C3 through C6 and doing bilateral medial facetectomy and foraminotomy at C3-C4, C4-C5, C5-C6, and C6-C7 with no spinal instrumentation. Operation and expected outcome risks and benefits were discussed with him prior to the surgery. Risks include but not exclusive of bleeding and infection. Infection can be superficial, but may also extend down to the epidural space, which may require return to the operating room and evacuation of the infection. There is also the risk of bleeding that could be superficial but may also be in the epidural space resulting in compression of spinal cord. This may result in weakness of all four extremities, numbness of all four extremities, and impairment of bowel and bladder function, which will require an urgent return to the operating room and evacuation of the hematoma. There is also the risk of a dural tear with its attendant problems of CSF leak, headache, nausea, vomiting, photophobia, pseudomeningocele, and dural meningitis. This too may require return to the operating room for evacuation of said pseudomeningocele and repair. The patient understood the risk of the surgery. I told him there is just a 30% chance that there will be no improvement with the surgery; he understands this and agreed to have the procedure performed. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the operating room, awake, alert, not in any form of distress. After smooth induction and intubation, a Foley catheter was inserted. Monitoring leads were also placed by Premier Neurodiagnostics for both SSEP and EMG monitoring. The SSEPs were normal, and the EMGs were silent during the entire case. After completion of the placement of the monitoring leads, the patient was then positioned prone on a Wilson frame with the head supported on a foam facial support. Shave was then carried out over the occipital and suboccipital region. All pressure points were padded. I proceeded to mark the hypertrophic scar for excision. This was initially cleaned with alcohol and prepped with DuraPrep. After sterile drapes were laid out, incision was made using a scalpel blade #10. Wound edge bleeders were carefully controlled with bipolar coagulation and a hot knife was utilized to excise the hypertrophic scar. Dissection was then carried down to the cervical fascia, and by careful dissection to the scar tissue, the spinous process of C2 was then identified. There was absence of the spinous process of C3, C4, C5, and C6, but partial laminectomy was noted; removal of only 15% of the lamina. With this completed, we proceeded to do a total laminectomy at C3, C4, C5, and C6, which was technically difficult due to the previous surgery. There was also a dural tear on the right C3-C4 space that was exposed and repaired with Prolene 6-0 and later with Tisseel. By careful dissection and the use of a -5 and 3 mm bur, total laminectomy was done as stated with bilateral medial facetectomy and foraminotomy done at C3-C4, C4-C5, C5-C6, and C6-C7. There was significant epidural bleeding, which was carefully coagulated. At two points, I had to pack this with small pieces of Gelfoam. After repair of the dural tear, Valsalva maneuver showed no evidence of any CSF leakage. Area was irrigated with saline and bacitracin and then lined with Tisseel. The wound was then closed in layers with Vicryl 0 simple interrupted sutures to the fascia; Vicryl 2-0 inverted interrupted sutures to the dermis and a running nylon 2-0 continuous vertical mattress stitch. The patient was extubated and transferred to recovery."
409,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Hallux valgus, right foot. 2. Hallux interphalangeus, right foot. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Hallux valgus, right foot. 2. Hallux interphalangeus, right foot. PROCEDURES PERFORMED: 1. Bunionectomy with distal first metatarsal osteotomy and internal screw fixation, right foot. 2. Akin bunionectomy, right toe with internal wire fixation. ANESTHESIA: TIVA/local. HISTORY: This 51-year-old female presents to ABCD preoperative holding area after keeping herself NPO since mid night for a surgery on her painful bunion through her right foot. The patient has a history of gradual onset of a painful bunion over the past several years. She has tried conservative methods such as wide shoes, accommodative padding on an outpatient basis with Dr. X all of which have provided inadequate relief. At this time, she desires attempted surgical correction. The risks versus benefits of the procedure have been discussed with the patient in detail by Dr. X and the consent is available on the chart for review. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: After IV was established by the Department of Anesthesia, the patient was taken to the operating room via cart and placed on the operative table in supine position and a safety strap was placed across her waist for her protection. Copious amounts of Webril were applied about the right ankle and a pneumatic ankle tourniquet was placed over the Webril. After adequate IV sedation was administered by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 15 cc of 1:1 mixture of 0.5% Marcaine plain and 1% Lidocaine plain was injected into the foot in a standard Mayo block fashion. The foot was elevated off the table. Esmarch bandages were used to exsanguinate the right foot. The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was elevated to 250 mmHg. The foot was lowered in the operative field and the sterile stockinet was reflected. A sterile Betadine was wiped away with a wet and dry sponge and one toothpick was used to test anesthesia, which was found to be adequate. Attention was directed to the first metatarsophalangeal joint, which was found to be contracted, laterally deviated, and had decreased range of motion. A #10 blade was used to make a 4 cm dorsolinear incision. A #15 blade was used to deepen the incision through the subcutaneous layer. All superficial subcutaneous vessels were ligated with electrocautery. Next, a linear capsular incision was made down the bone with a #15 blade. The capsule was elevated medially and laterally off the metatarsal head and the metatarsal head was delivered into the wound. A hypertrophic medial eminence was resected with a sagittal saw taking care not to strike the head. The medial plantar aspect of the metatarsal head had some erosive changes and eburnation. Next, a 0.45 inch Kirschner wire was placed with some access guide slightly plantar flexing the metatarsal taking care not to shorten it. A sagittal saw was used to make a long-arm Austin osteotomy in the usual fashion. Standard lateral release was also performed as well as a lateral capsulotomy freeing the fibular sesamoid complex. The capital head was shifted laterally and impacted on the residual metatarsal head. Nice correction was achieved and excellent bone to bone contact was achieved. The bone stock was slightly decreased, but adequate. Next, a 0.45 inch Kirschner wire was used to temporarily fixate the metatarsal capital fragment. A 2.7 x 18 mm Synthes cortical screw was thrown using standard AO technique. Excellent rigid fixation was achieved. A second 2.0 x 80 mm Synthes fully threaded cortical screw was also thrown using standard AO technique at the proximal aspect of the metatarsal head. Again, an excellent rigid fixation was obtained and the screws were tight. The temporary fixation was removed. A medial overhanging bone was resected with a sagittal saw. The foot was loaded and the hallux was found to have an interphalangeus deformity present. A sagittal saw was used to make a proximal cut in approximately 1 cm dorsal to the base of the proximal phalanx, leaving a lateral intact cortical hinge. A distal cut parallel with the nail base was performed and a standard proximal Akin osteotomy was done. After the wedge bone was removed, the saw blade was reinserted and used to tether the osteotomy with counter-pressure used to close down the osteotomy. A #15 drill blade was used to drill two converging holes on the medial aspect of the bone. A #28 gauge monofilament wire was inserted loop to loop and pulled through the bone. The monofilament wire was twisted down and tapped into the distal drill hole. The foot was loaded again and the toe had an excellent cosmetic straight appearance and the range of motion of the first metatarsophalangeal joint was then improved. Next, reciprocating rasps were used to smooth all bony surfaces. Copious amounts of sterile saline was used to flush the joint. Next, a #3-0 Vicryl was used to reapproximate the capsular periosteal tissue layer. Next, #4-0 Vicryl was used to close the subcutaneous layer. #5-0 Vicryl was used to the close the subcuticular layer in a running fashion. Next, 1 cc of dexamethasone phosphate was then instilled in the joint. The Steri-Strips were applied followed by standard postoperative dressing consisting of Owen silk, 4 x 4s, Kling, Kerlix, and Coban. The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted to the digits. The patient tolerated the above anesthesia and procedure without complications. She was transported via cart to the Postanesthesia Care Unit with vital signs stable and vascular status intact to the right foot. She is to be partial weightbearing with crutches. She is to follow with Dr. X. She was given emergency contact numbers and instructions to call if problems arise. She was given prescription for Vicodin ES #25 one p.o. q.4-6h. p.r.n. pain and Naprosyn one p.o. b.i.d. 500 mg. She was discharged in stable condition."
410,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Torn lateral meniscus, right knee. 2. Chondromalacia of the patella, right knee. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Torn lateral meniscus, right knee. 2. Chondromalacia of the patella, right knee. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: 1. Arthroscopic lateral meniscoplasty. 2. Patellar shaving of the right knee. ANESTHESIA: General. COMPLICATIONS: None. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal. TOTAL TOURNIQUET TIME: Zero. GROSS FINDINGS: A complex tear involving the lateral and posterior horns of the lateral meniscus and grade-II chondromalacia of the patella. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 45-year-old Caucasian male presented to the office complaining of right knee pain. He complained of pain on the medial aspect of his right knee after an injury at work, which he twisted his right knee. PROCEDURE: After all potential complications, risks, as well as anticipated benefits of the above-named procedures were discussed at length with the patient, informed consent was obtained. The operative extremity was then confirmed with the operative surgeon, the patient, the Department of Anesthesia and the nursing staff. The patient was then transferred to preoperative area to Operative Suite #2, placed on the operating table in supine position. Department of Anesthesia administered general anesthetic to the patient. All bony prominences were well padded at this time. The right lower extremity was then properly positioned in a Johnson knee holder. At this time, 1% lidocaine with epinephrine 20 cc was administered to the right knee intra-articularly under sterile conditions. The right lower extremity was then sterilely prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion. Next, after all bony soft tissue landmarks were identified, an inferolateral working portal was established by making a 1-cm transverse incision at the level of the joint line lateral to the patellar tendon. The cannula and trocar were then inserted through this, putting the patellofemoral joint. An arthroscopic camera was then inserted and the knee was sequentially examined including the patellofemoral joint, the medial and lateral gutters, medial lateral joints, and the femoral notch. Upon viewing of the patellofemoral joint, there was noted to be grade-II chondromalacia changes of the patella. There were no loose bodies noted in the either gutter. Upon viewing of the medial compartment, there was no chondromalacia or meniscal tear was noted. While in this area, attention was directed to establish the inferomedial instrument portal. This was first done using a spinal needle for localization followed by 1-cm transverse incision at the joint line. A probe was then inserted through this portal and the meniscus was further probed. Again, there was noted to be no meniscal tear. The knee was taken through range of motion and there was no chondromalacia. Upon viewing of the femoral notch, there was noted to be intact ACL with negative drawer sign. PCL was also noted to be intact. Upon viewing of the lateral compartment, there was noted to be a large bucket-handle tear involving the lateral and posterior horns. It was reduced from the place, however, involved the white and red white area was elected to excise the bucket-handle. An arthroscopic scissor was then inserted and the two remaining attachments the posterior and lateral attachments were then clipped and a Schlesinger grasper was then used to remove the resected meniscus. It was noted that the meniscus was followed out to the whole and the entire piece was taken out of the knee. Pictures were taken both pre-meniscal resection and post-meniscal resection. The arthroscopic shaver was then inserted into the medial portal and the remaining meniscus was contoured. The lateral gutter was then examined and was noted to be no loose bodies and ______ was intact. Next, attention was directed to the inner surface of the patella. This was debrided using the 2.5 arthroscopic shaver. It was noted to be quite smooth and postprocedure the patient was taken ________ well. The knee was then copiously irrigated and suctioned dry and all instrumentation was removed. 20 cc of 0.25% Marcaine was then administered to each portal as well as intra-articularly. Sterile dressing was then applied consisting of Adaptic, 4x4s, ABDs, and sterile Webril and a stockinette to the right lower extremity. At this time, Department of Anesthesia reversed the anesthetic. The patient was transferred back to the hospital gurney to the Postanesthesia Care Unit. The patient tolerated the procedure and there were no complications."
411,Orthopedic," IDENTIFICATION: The patient is a 15-year-old female. CHIEF COMPLAINT: Right ankle pain. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient was running and twisted her right ankle. There were no other injuries. She complains of right ankle pain on the lateral aspect. She is brought in by her mother. Her primary care physician is Dr. Brown. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Otherwise negative except as stated above. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: None. PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: None. MEDICATIONS: None. SOCIAL HISTORY: Mother appears loving and caring. There is no evidence of abuse. ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: General: The patient is alert and oriented x4 in mild distress without diaphoresis. She is nonlethargic and nontoxic. Vitals: Within normal limits. The right ankle shows no significant swelling. There is no ecchymosis. There is no significant tenderness to palpation. The ankle has good range of motion. The foot is nontender. Vascular: +2/2 dorsalis pedis pulse. All compartments are soft. Capillary refill less than 2 seconds. DIAGNOSTIC TEST: The patient had an x-ray of the right ankle, which interpreted by myself shows no acute fracture or dislocation. MEDICAL DECISION MAKING: Due to the fact this patient has no evidence of an ankle fracture, she can be safely discharged to home. She is able to walk on it without significant pain, thus I recommend rest for 1 week and follow up with the doctor if she has persistent pain. She may need to see a specialist, but at this time this is a very mild ankle injury. There is no significant physical finding, and I foresee no complications. I will give her 1 week off of PE. MORBIDITY/MORTALITY: I expect no acute complications. A full medical screening exam was done and no emergency medical condition exists upon discharge. COMPLEXITY: Moderate. The differential includes fracture, contusion, abrasion, laceration, and sprain. ASSESSMENT: Right ankle sprain. PLAN: Discharge the patient home and have her follow up with her doctor in 1 week if symptoms persist. She is advised to return immediately p.r.n. severe pain, worsening, not better, etc."
412,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES 1. EMG-proven left carpal tunnel syndrome. 2. Tenosynovitis of the left third and fourth fingers at the A1 and A2 pulley level. 3. Dupuytren's nodule in the palm. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES 1. EMG-proven left carpal tunnel syndrome. 2. Tenosynovitis of the left third and fourth fingers at the A1 and A2 pulley level. 3. Dupuytren's nodule in the palm. PROCEDURE: Left carpal tunnel release with flexor tenosynovectomy; cortisone injection of trigger fingers, left third and fourth fingers; injection of Dupuytren's nodule, left palm. ANESTHESIA: Local plus IV sedation (MAC). ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Zero. SPECIMENS: None. DRAINS: None. PROCEDURE DETAIL: Patient brought to the operating room. After induction of IV sedation the left hand was anesthetized suitable for carpal tunnel release; 10 cc of a mixture of 1% Xylocaine and 0.5% Marcaine was injected in the distal forearm and proximal palm suitable for carpal tunnel surgery. Routine prep and drape was employed. Arm was exsanguinated by means of elevation of Esmarch elastic tourniquet and tourniquet inflated to 250 mmHg pressure. Hand was positioned palm up in the lead hand-holder. A short curvilinear incision about the base of the thenar eminence was made. Skin was sharply incised. Sharp dissection was carried down to the transverse carpal ligament and this was carefully incised longitudinally along its ulnar margin. Care was taken to divide the entire length of the transverse retinaculum including its distal insertion into deep palmar fascia in the midpalm. Proximally the antebrachial fascia was released for a distance of 2-3 cm proximal to the wrist crease to insure complete decompression of the median nerve. Retinacular flap was retracted radially to expose the contents of the carpal canal. Median nerve was identified, seen to be locally compressed with moderate erythema and mild narrowing. Locally adherent tenosynovium was present and this was carefully dissected free. Additional tenosynovium was dissected from the flexor tendons, individually stripping and peeling each tendon in sequential order so as to debulk the contents of the carpal canal. Epineurotomy and partial epineurectomy were carried out on the nerve in the area of mild constriction to relieve local external scarring of the epineurium. When this was complete retinacular flap was laid loosely in place over the contents of the carpal canal and skin only was closed with interrupted 5-0 nylon horizontal mattress sutures. A syringe with 3 cc of Kenalog-10 and 3 cc of 1% Xylocaine using a 25 gauge short needle was then selected; 1 cc of this mixture was injected into the third finger A1 and A2 pulley tendon sheaths using standard trigger finger injection technique; 1 cc was injected into the fourth finger A1/A2 pulley tendon sheath using standard tendon sheath injection technique; 1 cc was injected into the Dupuytren's nodule in the midpalm to relieve local discomfort. Routine postoperative hand dressing with well-padded, well-molded volar plaster splint and lightly compressive Ace wrap was applied. Tourniquet was deflated. Good vascular color and capillary refill were seen to return to the tips of all digits. Patient discharged to the ambulatory recovery area and from there discharged home. Discharge medication is Darvocet-N 100, 30 tablets, one to two PO q.4h. p.r.n. Patient asked to begin gentle active flexion, extension and passive nerve glide exercises beginning 24-48 hours after surgery. She was asked to keep the dressings clean, dry and intact and follow up in my office."
413,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Bunion, left foot. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Bunion, left foot. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: 1. Bunionectomy with first metatarsal osteotomy base wedge type with internal screw fixation. 2. Akin osteotomy with internal wire fixation of left foot. HISTORY: This 19-year-old Caucasian female presents to ABCD General Hospital with the above chief complaint. The patient states she has had worsening bunion deformity for as long as she could not remember. She does have a history of Charcot-Marie tooth disease and desires surgical treatment at this time. PROCEDURE: An IV was instituted by the Department of Anesthesia in the preoperative holding area. The patient was transported to the operating room and placed on operating table in the supine position with a safety belt across her lap. Copious amounts of Webril were placed on the left ankle followed by a blood pressure cuff. After adequate sedation by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 15 cc of 1:1 mixture of 1% lidocaine plain and 0.5% Marcaine plain were injected in a Mayo block type fashion surrounding the lower left first metatarsal. The foot was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile orthopedic fashion. The foot was elevated from the operating table and exsanguinated with an Esmarch bandage. The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was inflated to 250 mmHg and the foot was lowered to the operating field. The stockinette was reflected, the foot was cleansed with a wet and dry sponge. Approximately 5 cm incision was made dorsomedially over the first metatarsal. The incision was then deepened with #15 blade. All vessels encountered were ligated for hemostasis. Care was taken to preserve the extensor digitorum longus tendon. The capsule over the first metatarsal phalangeal then was identified where a dorsal capsular incision was then created down to the level of bone. Capsule and periosteum was reflected off the first metatarsal head. At this time, the cartilage was inspected and noted to be white, shiny, and healthy cartilage. There was noted to be a prominent medial eminence. Attention was then directed to first interspace where a combination of blunt and sharp dissection was done to perform a standard lateral release. The abductor tendon attachments were identified and transected. The lateral capsulotomy was performed. The extensor digitorum brevis tendon was identified and transected. Attention was then directed to the prominent medial eminence, which was resected with a sagittal saw. Intraoperative assessment of pes was performed and pes was noted to be normal. At this time, a regional incision was carried more approximately about 1.5 cm. The capsular incision was then extended and the proximal capsule and periosteum were reflected off the first metatarsal. The first metatarsal cuneiform joint was identified. A 0.45 K-wire was then inserted into the base of the first metatarsal approximately 1 cm from the first cuneiform joint perpendicular to the weightbearing surface. This K-wire was used as an access guide for a Juvaro type oblique base wedge osteotomy. The sagittal saw was then used to creat a closing base wedge osteotomy with the apex being proximal medial. The osteotomy site was then feathered and tilted with tight estimation of the bony edges. The cortical hinge was maintained. A 0.27 x 24 mm screw was then inserted in a standard AO fashion. At this time, there was noted to be tight compression of the osteotomy site. A second 2.7 x 16 mm screw was then inserted more distally in the standard AO fashion with compression noted. The ________ angle was noted to be significantly released. Reciprocating rasp was then used to smoothen any remaining sharp edges. The 0.45 k-wire was removed. The foot was loaded and was noted to fill the remaining abduction of the hallux. At this time, it was incised to perform an Akin osteotomy. Original incision was then extended distally approximately 1 cm. The incision was then deepened down to the level of capsule over the base of the proximal phalanx. Again care was taken to preserve the extensor digitorum longus tendon. The capsule was reflected off of the base of the proximal phalanx. An Akin osteotomy was performed with the apex being lateral and the base being medial. After where the bone was resected, it was feathered until tight compression was noted without tension at the osteotomy site. Care was taken to preserve the lateral hinge. At 1.5 wire passed and a drill was then used to create drill hole proximal and distally to the osteotomy site in order for passage of 28 gauge monofilament wire. The #28 gauge monofilament wire was passed through the drill hole and tightened down until compression and tight ________ osteotomy site was noted. The remaining edge of the wire was then buried in the medial most distal drill hole. The area was then inspected and the foot was noted with significant reduction of the bunion deformity. The area was then flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline. Capsule was closed with #3-0 Vicryl followed by subcutaneous closure with #4-0 Vicryl in order to decrease tension of the incision site. A running #5-0 subcuticular stitch was then performed. Steri-Strips were applied. Total of 1 cc dexamethasone phosphate was then injected into the surgical site. Dressings consisted of Owen silk, 4x4s, Kling, Kerlix. The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted to all five digits of the left foot. Posterior splint was then placed on the patient in the operating room. The patient tolerated the above procedure and anesthesia well without complications. The patient was transferred back to the PACU with vital signs stable and vascular status intact to the left foot. The patient was given postoperative instructions to be strictly nonweightbearing on the left foot. The patient was given postop pain prescriptions for Vicodin and instructed to take one q.4-6h. p.r.n. for pain as well as Naprosyn 500 mg p.o. q. b.i.d. The patient is to follow-up with Dr. X in his office in four to five days as directed."
414,Orthopedic," RICE stands for the most important elements of treatment for many injuries---rest, ice, compression, and elevation. REST: Stop using the injured part as soon as you realize that an injury has taken place. Use crutches to avoid bearing weight on injuries of the foot, ankle, knee, or leg. Use splints for injuries of the hand, wrist, elbow, or arm. Continued exercise or activity could cause further injury, increased pain, or a delay in healing. ICE: Ice helps stop bleeding from injured blood vessels and capillaries. Sudden cold causes the small blood vessels to contract. This contraction decreases the amount of blood that can collect around the wound. The more blood that collects, the longer the healing time. Ice can be safely applied in many ways: * For injuries to small areas, such as a finger, toe, foot, or wrist, immerse the injured area for 15 to 35 minutes in a bucket of ice water. Use ice cubes to keep the water cold, adding more as the ice cubes dissolve. * For injuries to larger areas, use ice packs. Avoid placing the ice directly on the skin. Before applying the ice, place a towel, cloth, or one or two layers of an elasticized compression bandage on the skin to be iced. To make the ice pack, put ice chips or ice cubes in a plastic bag or wrap them in a thin towel. Place the ice pack over the cloth. The pack may sit directly on the injured part, or it may be wrapped in place. * Ice the injured area for about 30 minutes. * Remove the ice to allow the skin to warm for 15 minutes. * Reapply the ice. * Repeat the icing and warming cycles for 3 hours. Follow the instructions below for compression and elevation. If pain and swelling persist after 3 hours call our office. You may need to change the icing schedule after the first 3 hours. Regular ice treatment is often discontinued after 24 to 48 hours. At that point, heat is sometimes more comfortable. COMPRESSION: Compression decreases swelling by slowing bleeding and limiting the accumulation of blood and plasma near the injured site. Without compression, fluid from adjacent normal tissue seeps into the injured area. To apply compression safely to an injury: * Use an elasticized bandage (Ace bandage) for compression, if possible. If you do not have one available, any kind of cloth will suffice for a short time. * Wrap the injured part firmly, wrapping over the ice. Begin wrapping below the injury site and extend above the injury site. * Be careful not to compress the area so tightly that the blood supply is impaired. Signs of deprivation of the blood supply include pain, numbness, cramping, and blue or dusky nails. Remove the compression bandage immediately if any of theses symptoms appears. Leave the bandage off until all signs of impaired circulation disappear. Then rewrap the area--less tightly this time. ELEVATION: Elevating the injured part above the level of the heart is another way to decrease swelling and pain at the injury site. Elevate the iced, compressed area in whatever way is most convenient. Prop an injured leg on a solid object or pillows. Elevate an injured arm by lying down and placing pillows under the arm or on the chest with the arm folded across."
415,Orthopedic," The patient is an 84-year-old retired male who is referred to our office by Dr. O. He comes in today with the chief complaint of low back pain which started about six to eight months ago. He states that he does live here and also travels between here and Iowa and he does have a family in Iowa, which he is very active with his grandchildren doing shopping and plenty of walking. He also recently cut down some trees. He states that he started noticing some pain in his back and his hips and difficulty when beginning ambulation after getting up from a seated position due to the hip pains and the back pains. He states he has not had any treatment for this problem. He just does take Aleve. He states that he began to wear a back brace, which only helps him some. He says his pain is pretty manageable and low when he is not active, but it does increase with more activity that he does. He is very leery about any surgical procedure, even a referral to come see us today for his brother most recently died from complications of back surgery. He states that his back pain is intermittent. On a 1 to 10 pain scale, he rates it a 2. He has tried Aleve, which only helps him some. On the body image drawing, he draws low back pain and bilateral hip pain, no radiating pain down the legs. He describes his pain as 100% in low back and hip. Lying down is the only alleviating factor. Walking, light and heavy exercise exacerbate his pain. FAMILY HISTORY: His parents are deceased.

FINDINGS: The patient brings in lumbar spine MRI for 11/15/2007, which demonstrates degenerative disc disease throughout. At L4-L5 and L5-S1 he has severe disc space narrowing. At L3-L4, he has degenerative changes of the facet with ligamentum flavum hypertrophy and annular disc bulge, which caused moderate neuroforaminal narrowing. At L4-L5, degenerative changes within the facets with ligamentum flavum hypertrophy as well causing neuroforaminal narrowing and central stenosis. At L5-S1, there is an annular disc bulge more to the right causing right-sided neuroforaminal stenosis, which is quite severe compared to that on the left. ASSESSMENT: Low back pain, degenerative disc disease, spinal stenosis, diabetes, and history of prostate cancer status post radiation. PLAN: We discussed treatment options with this patient including: 1. Do nothing. 2. Conservative therapies. 3. Surgery. The patient states that his pain is very well tolerated by minimizing his activity and would like to do just pain management with some pain pills only as needed. We went ahead and obtained an EKG in the office today due to the fact that I heard a murmur on exam. I did phone the patient's primary care doctor, Dr. O. Unfortunately Dr. O is out of the country, and I did speak with Dr. K, who is covering for Dr. O. I informed Dr. K that the patient had a new-onset murmur and that I did have some concerns for the patient does not recollect having this diagnosis before, so I obtained an EKG. A copy was provided to the patient and the patient was referred back to his primary care physician for workup. He was also released from our care at this time to a p.r.n. basis, but the patient does not wish to proceed with any neurosurgical intervention nor any conservative measures besides medications, which he will receive from his primary doctor. All questions and concerns were addressed. If he should have any further questions, concerns, or complications, he will contact our office immediately. Otherwise, we will see him p.r.n. Warning signs and symptoms were gone over with him. Case was reviewed and discussed with Dr. L."
416,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Left carpal tunnel syndrome (354.0). 2. Left ulnar nerve entrapment at the elbow (354.2). POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Left carpal tunnel syndrome (354.0). 2. Left ulnar nerve entrapment at the elbow (354.2). OPERATIONS PERFORMED: 1. Left carpal tunnel release (64721). 2. Left ulnar nerve anterior submuscular transposition at the elbow (64718). 3. Lengthening of the flexor pronator muscle mass in the proximal forearm to accommodate the submuscular position of the ulnar nerve (25280). ANESTHESIA: General anesthesia with intubation. INDICATIONS OF PROCEDURE: This patient is insulin-dependant diabetic. He is also has end-stage renal failure and has chronic hemodialysis. Additionally, the patient has had prior heart transplantation. He has been evaluated for ischemic problems to both lower extremities and also potentially to the left upper extremity. However, it is our contention that this patient's prime problem of the left upper extremity is probably neuropathic ulcers from total lack of sensation along the ulnar border of the left little finger. These started initially as unrecognized paper cuts. Additionally, the patient appears to have a neurogenic pain affecting predominantly the areas innovated by the median nerve, but also to the little finger. Finally, this patient does indeed have occlusive arterial disease to the left upper extremity in that he has a short segment radial artery occlusion and he does appear to have a narrowed segment in the ulnar artery, but the arteriogram shows distal perfusion down the ulnar border of the hand and into the little finger. Thus, we have planned to proceed first with nerve entrapment releases and potentially at the later date do arterial reconstruction if deemed necessary. Thirdly, this patient does have chronic distal ischemic problems with evidence of &quot;ping-pong ball sign&quot; due to fat atrophy at the finger tips and some periodic cracking and ulceration at the tips of the fingers. However, this patient has no clinical sign at all of tissue necrosis at the finger tips at this time. The patient has also previously had an arteriovenous shunt in the forearm, which has been deactivated within the last 3 weeks. Thus, we planned to bring this patient to the operating room for left carpal tunnel release as well as anterior submuscular transposition of the ulnar nerve. This patient had electro diagnostic studies performed, which showed severe involvement of both the ulnar nerve at the elbow and the medial nerve at the carpal tunnel. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: After general anesthesia being induced and the patient intubated, he is given intravenous Ancef. The entire left upper extremity is prepped with Betadine all the way to the axilla and draped in a sterile fashion. A sterile tourniquet and webril are placed higher on the arm. The arm is then exsanguinated with Ace bandage and tourniquet inflated to 250 mmHg. I started first at the carpal tunnel release and a longitudinal curvilinear incision is made parallel to the thenar crease and stopping short of the wrist flexion crease. Dissection continued through subcutaneous tissue to the palmer aponeurosis, which is divided longitudinally from distal to proximal. I next encountered the transverse carpal ligament, which in turn is also divided longitudinally from distal to proximal, and the proximal most division of the transverse carpal ligament is done under direct vision into the distal forearm. Having confirmed a complete release of the transverse carpal ligament, I next evaluated the contents of the carpal tunnel. The synovium was somewhat thickened, but not unduly so. There was some erythema along the length of the median nerve, indicating chronic compression. The motor branch of the median nerve was clearly identified. The contents of the carpal canal were retracted in a radial direction and the floor of the canal evaluated and no other extrinsic compressive pathology was identified. The wound was then irrigated with normal saline and wound edges were reapproximated with interrupted 5-0 nylon sutures. I next turned my attention to the cubital tunnel problem and a longitudinal curvilinear incision is made on the medial aspect of the arm extending into the forearm with the incision passing directly between the olecranon and the medial epicondyle. Dissection continues through fascia and then skin clamps are elevated to the level of the fascia on the flexor pronator muscle mass. In the process of elevating this skin flap I elevated and deactivated shunt together with the skin flap. I now gained access to the radial border of the flexor pronator muscle mass, dissected down the radial side, until I identified the median nerve. I turned my attention back to the ulnar nerve and it is located immediately posterior to the medial intramuscular septum in the upper arm, and I dissected it all the way proximally until I encountered the location with ulnar the nerve passed from the anterior to the posterior compartments in the upper portion of the arm. The entire medial intramuscular septum is now excised. The ulnar nerve is mobilized between vessel loops and includes with it is accompanying vascular structures. Larger penetrating vascular tributaries to the muscle ligated between hemoclips. I continued to mobilize the nerve around the medial epicondyle and then took down the aponeurosis between the two heads of the flexor carpi ulnaris and continued to dissect the nerve between the FCU muscle fibers. The nerve is now mobilized and I had retained the large muscular branches and dissected them out into the muscle and also proximally using microvascular surgical techniques. In this way, the nerve was able to be mobilized between vessiloops and easily transposed anterior to the flexor pronator muscle mass in tension free manner. I now made an oblique division of the entire flexor pronator muscle mass proximally in the forearm and the ulnar nerve was able to be transposed deep to the muscle in a nonkinking and tension-free manner. Because of the oblique incision into the flexor pronator muscle mass the muscle edges were now able to slide on each other. So that in effect a lengthening is performed. Fascial repair is done with interrupted figure-of-eight 0-Ethibond sutures. I now ranged the arm through the full range of flexion and extension at the elbow and there was no significant kinking on the nerve and there was a tension-free coverage of the muscle without any impingement on the nerve. The entire arm is next wrapped with a Kerlix wrap and I released the tourniquet and after allowing the reactive hyperemia to subside, I then unwrap the arm and check for hemostasis. Wound is copiously irrigated with normal saline and then a 15-French Round Blake drainage placed through a separate stab incision and laid along the length of the wound. A layered wound closure is done with interrupted Vicryl subcutaneously, and a running subcuticular Monocryl to the skin. A 0.25% plain Marcaine then used to infiltrate all the wound edges to help with post operative analgesia and dressings take the form of Adaptic impregnated Bacitracin ointment, followed by a well-fluffed gauze and a Kerlix dressing and confirming Kerlix and webril, and an above elbow sugar-tong splint is applied extending to the support of the wrist. Fingers and femoral were free to move. The splint is well padded with webril and is in turn held in place with Kerlix and Ace bandage. Meanwhile the patient is awakened and extubated in the operating room and returned to the recovery room in good condition. Sponge and needle counts reported as correct at the end of the procedure."
417,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Herniated nucleus pulposus T8-T9. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Herniated nucleus pulposus T8-T9. OPERATION PERFORMED: Thoracic right-sided discectomy at T8-T9. BRIEF HISTORY AND INDICATION FOR OPERATION: The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of right thoracic rib pain related to a herniated nucleus pulposus at T8-T9. She has failed conservative measures and sought operative intervention for relief of her symptoms. For details of workup, please see the dictated operative report. DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: Appropriate informed consent was obtained and the patient was taken to the operating room and placed under general anesthetic. She was placed in a position of comfort on the operating table with all bony prominences and soft tissues well padded and protected. Second check was made prior to prepping and draping. Following this, we did needle localization with reviews of AP and lateral multiple times to make sure we had the T8-T9 level. We then made an approach through a midline incision and came out over the pars. We dissected down carefully to identify the pars. We then went on the outside of the pars and identified the foramen and then we took another series of x-rays to confirm the T8-T9 level. We did this under live fluoroscopy. We confirmed T8-T9 and then went ahead and took a Midas Rex and removed the superior portion of the pedicle overlying the outside of the disc and then worked our way downward removing portion of the transverse process as well. We found the edge of the disc and then worked our way and we were able to remove some of the disc material but then decided to go ahead and take down the pars. The pars was then drilled out. We identified the disc even further and found the disc herniation material that was under the spinal cord. We then took a combination of small pituitaries and removed the disc material without difficulty. Once we had disc material out, we went ahead and made a small cruciate incision in the disc space and entered the disc space in earnest removing more disc material making sure there is nothing free to herniate further. Once we had done that, we inspected up by the nerve root, found some more disc material there and removed that as well. We could trace the nerve root out freely and easily. We made sure there was no evidence of further disc material. We used an Epstein curette and placed a nerve hook under the nerve root. The Epstein curette removed some more disc material. Once we had done this, we were satisfied with the decompression. We irrigated the wound copiously to make sure there is no further disc material and then ready for closure. We did place some steroid over the nerve root and readied for closure. Hemostasis was meticulous. The wound was closed with #1 Vicryl suture for the fascial layer, 2 Vicryl suture for the skin, and Monocryl and Steri-Strips applied. Dressing was applied. The patient was awoken from anesthesia and taken to the recovery room in stable condition. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 150 mL. COMPLICATIONS: None. DISPOSITION: To PACU in stable condition having tolerated the procedure well, to mobilize routinely when she is comfortable to go to her home."

Left diabetic foot abscess and infection. 2. Left calcaneus fracture with infection. 3. Right first ray amputation. OPERATION AND PROCEDURE: 1. Left below-the-knee amputation. 2. Dressing change, right foot. ANESTHESIA: General. BLOOD LOSS: Less than 100 mL. TOURNIQUET TIME: 24 minutes on the left, 300 mmHg. COMPLICATIONS: None. DRAINS: A one-eighth-inch Hemovac. INDICATIONS FOR SURGERY: The patient is a 62 years of age with diabetes. He developed left heel abscess. He had previous debridements, developed a calcaneal fracture and has now had several debridement with placement of the antibiotic beads. After re-inspecting the wound last week, the plan was for possible debridement and he desired below-the-knee amputation. We are going to change the dressing on the right side also. The risks, benefits, and alternatives of surgery were discussed. The risks of bleeding, infection, damage to nerves and blood vessels, persistent wound healing problems, and the need for future surgery. He understood all the risks and desired operative treatment. OPERATIVE PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: After appropriate informed consent obtained, the patient was taken to the operating room and placed in the supine position. General anesthesia induced. Once adequate anesthesia had been achieved, cast padding placed on the left proximal thigh and tourniquet was applied. The right leg was redressed. I took the dressing down. There was a small bit of central drainage, but it was healing nicely. Adaptic and new sterile dressings were applied. The left lower extremity was then prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion. A transverse incision made about the mid shaft of the tibia. A long posterior flap was created. It was taken to the subcutaneous tissues with electrocautery. Please note that tourniquet had been inflated after exsanguination of the limb. Superficial peroneal nerve identified, clamped, and cut. Anterior compartment was divided. The anterior neurovascular bundle identified, clamped, and cut. The plane was taken between the deep and superficial compartments. The superficial compartment was reflected posteriorly. Tibial nerve identified, clamped, and cut. Tibial vessels identified, clamped, and cut. Periosteum of the tibia elevated proximally along with the fibula. The tibia was then cut with Gigli saw. It was beveled anteriorly and smoothed down with a rasp. The fibula was cut about a cm and a half proximal to this using a large bone cutter. The remaining posterior compartment was divided. The peroneal bundle identified, clamped, and cut. The leg was then passed off of the field. Each vascular bundle was then doubly ligated with 0 silk stick tie and 0 silk free tie. The nerves were each pulled at length, injected with 0.25% Marcaine with epinephrine, cut, and later retracted proximally. The tourniquet was released. Good bleeding from the tissues and hemostasis obtained with electrocautery. Copious irrigation performed using antibiotic-impregnated solution. A one-eighth-inch Hemovac drain placed in the depth of wound adhering on the medial side. A gastroc soleus fascia brought up and attached to the anterior fascia and periosteum with #1 Vicryl in an interrupted fashion. The remaining fascia was closed with #1 Vicryl. Subcutaneous tissues were then closed with 2-0 PDS suture using 2-0 Monocryl suture in interrupted fashion. Skin closed with skin staples. Xeroform gauze, 4 x 4, and a padded soft dressing applied. He was placed in a well-padded anterior and posterior slab splint with the knee in extension. He was then awakened, extubated, and taken to recovery in stable condition. There were no immediate operative complications, and he tolerated the procedure well."
420,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Mass, left second toe. 2. Tumor. 3. Left hallux bone invasion of the distal phalanx. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Mass, left second toe. 2. Tumor. 3. Left hallux with bone invasion of the distal phalanx. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: 1. Excision of mass, left second toe. 2. Distal Syme's amputation, left hallux with excisional biopsy. HISTORY: This 47-year-old Caucasian male presents to ABCD General Hospital with a history of tissue mass on his left foot. The patient states that the mass has been present for approximately two weeks and has been rapidly growing in size. The patient also has history of shave biopsy in the past. The patient does state that he desires surgical excision at this time. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: An IV was instituted by the Department of Anesthesia in the preoperative holding area. The patient was transported from the operating room and placed on the operating room table in the supine position with the safety belt across his lap. Copious amount of Webril was placed around the left ankle followed by a blood pressure cuff. After adequate sedation by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 6 cc mixed with 1% lidocaine plain with 0.5% Marcaine plain was injected in a digital block fashion at the base of the left hallux as well as the left second toe. The foot was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile orthopedic fashion. The foot was elevated from the operating table and exsanguinated with an Esmarch bandage. Care was taken with the exsanguination to perform exsanguination below the level of the digits so as not to rupture the masses. The foot was lowered to the operating table. The stockinet was reflected and the foot was cleansed with wet and dry sponge. A distal Syme's incision was planned over the distal aspect of the left hallux. The incision was performed with a #10 blade and deepened with #15 down to the level of bone. The dorsal skin flap was removed and dissected in toto off of the distal phalanx. There was noted to be in growth of the soft tissue mass into the dorsal cortex with erosion in the dorsal cortex and exposure of cortical bone at the distal phalanx. The tissue was sent to Pathology where Dr. Green stated that a frozen sample would be of less use for examining for cancer. Dr. Green did state that he felt that there was an adequate incomplete excision of the soft tissue for specimen. At this time, a sagittal saw was then used to resect all ends of bone of the distal phalanx. The area was inspected for any remaining suspicious tissues. Any suspicious tissue was removed. The area was then flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline. The skin was then reapproximated with #4-0 nylon with a combination of simple and vertical mattress sutures. Attention was then directed to the left second toe. There was noted to be a dorsolateral mass over the dorsal distal aspect of the left second toe. A linear incision was made just medial to the tissue mass. The mass was then dissected from the overlying skin and off of the underlying capsule. This tissue mass was hard, round, and pearly-gray in appearance. It does not invade into any other surrounding tissues. The area was then flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline and the skin was closed with #4-0 nylon. Dressings consisted of Owen silk soaked in Betadine, 4x4s, Kling, Kerlix, and an Ace wrap. The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted to all five digits of the left foot. The patient tolerated the above procedure and anesthesia well without complications. The patient was transported to PACU with vital signs stable and vascular status intact. The patient was given postoperative pain prescription for Vicodin and instructed to follow up with Dr. Bonnani in his office as directed. The patient will be contacted immediately pending the results of pathology. Cultures obtained in the case were aerobic and anaerobic gram stain, Silver stain, and a CBC."
421,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Carpal tunnel syndrome. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Carpal tunnel syndrome. TITLE OF PROCEDURE: Open carpal tunnel release. COMPLICATIONS: None. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: After administering appropriate antibiotics and general anesthesia the Left upper extremity was prepped and draped in the usual standard fashion. The arm was exsanguinated with Esmarch, and the tourniquet inflated to 250 mmHg. A longitudinal incision was made in line with the 4th ray. The dissection was carried down to the superficial aponeurosis, which was cut. The distal edge of the transverse carpal ligament was identified with a hemostat. The hemostat was gently placed under the transverse carpal ligament to protect the contents of the carpal tunnel, and the ligament was cut on its ulnar side with a knife directly onto the hemostat. The antebrachial fascia was cut proximally under direct vision with scissors. After irrigating the wound with copious amounts of normal saline, the skin was repaired with 4-0 nylon interrupted stitches. Marcaine with epinephrine was injected into the wound, which was then dressed and splinted. The patient was sent to the recovery room in good condition, having tolerated the procedure well."
422,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Pathologic insufficiency. 2. Fracture of the T8 vertebrae and T9 vertebrae. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Pathologic insufficiency. 2. Fracture of the T8 vertebra and T9 vertebra. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: 1. Fracture reduction with insertion of prosthetic device at T8 with kyphoplasty. 2. Vertebroplasties at T7 and T9 with insertion of prosthetic device. ANESTHESIA: Local with sedation. SPECIMEN: Bone from the T8 vertebra. COMPLICATIONS: None. SURGICAL INDICATIONS: The patient is an 80-year-old female who had previous history of compression fractures. She had recently undergone an additional compression fracture of the T8 vertebrae. She was in extreme pain. This pain interfered with activities of daily living and was unimproved with conservative treatment modalities. She is understanding the risks, benefits, and potential complications as well as all treatment alternatives. The patient provided informed consent. OPERATIVE TECHNIQUE: The patient was taken to OR #2 where she was placed prone on the Jackson spinal table. She was given sedative. The thoracodorsal spine was then sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion. Biplanar image intensification was utilized to localize the T8, T7, and T9 vertebrae. Local anesthetic of 1% Marcaine with epinephrine and lidocaine were 50:50 mixed. Approximately 7 cc was instilled on the left side. This was directly over the posterior aspect of the pedicle on the left. Once this was localized, the right side was localized as well. Stab incisions were then created over the pedicles of T8 bilaterally. Jamshidi needles were then placed percutaneously. Their position was verified in both AP and lateral images. They were advanced slowly under direct image intensification in biplanar fashion. Once these were satisfactorily placed, the inner trocar was removed and a guidewire was inserted into the depths of the T7 vertebrae. The Jamshidi needles were then removed. A biopsy was then harvested with a biopsy trocar placed into the T8 vertebrae. This bone was then removed and sent to the lab. The injection cannulas were then placed over the guidewires and their position was verified in both AP and lateral images. Once this was completed, a second Jamshidi needle was placed at the T7 vertebrae on the left at the entrance of the pedicle. This was advanced under direct image intensification in a biplanar fashion. Once this was deemed satisfactory, it was impacted. The inner trocar was removed and a guidewire was then placed. An injection cannula was then placed over the guidewire into the body of T7. In a similar fashion, T9 was dressed on the left side as well. A guidewire was then placed through the Jamshidi needle, which was verified in both AP and lateral images. The cement injection cannula was then placed over this entering the T9 vertebrae body. Attention was then turned to the kyphoplasty portion of the procedure at the T8 vertebrae. The balloons were inserted bilaterally. The balloons were then inflated under direct image intensification and pressurized to approximately 200 mmHg. These were allowed to expand and reduce the fracture. Once this was completed, the balloons were deflated and removed. The inner cannulas of all four entrance holes were removed and approximately 1.5 cc of cement was injected in each of the cannulas. This was done directly under image intensification. Once this was completed, additional cement was injected into T9 as there was a larger vertebra. The cement was allowed to cure. The cannula was removed and final radiographs were obtained. The stab incisions were then cleansed with water and antibiotic irrigation. The wounds were then approximated with #4-0 Nylon in interrupted fashion. Compression dressings were applied and fixed with tape. She was aroused and moved to her inpatient bed. She was moving all four extremities without deficit. She had no significant pain."
423,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Severely comminuted fracture of the distal radius, left. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Severely comminuted fracture of the distal radius, left. OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: Open reduction and internal fixation, high grade Frykman VIII distal radius fracture. ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal. PREOPERATIVE INDICATIONS: This is a 52-year-old patient of mine who I have repaired both shoulder rotator cuffs, the most recent one in the calendar year 2007. While he was climbing a ladder recently in the immediate postop stage, he fell suffering the aforementioned heavily comminuted Frykman fracture. This fracture had a fragment that extended in the distal radial ulnar joint, a die-punch fragment in the center of the radius. The ulnar styloid and the radial styloid were off and there were severe dorsal comminutions. He presented to my office the morning of April 3, 2007, having had a left reduction done elsewhere a day ago. The reduction, although adequate, had allowed for the fragments to settle and I discussed with him the severity of the injury on a scale of 1-8, this was essentially an 8. The best results have been either with external fixation or internal fixation, most recently volar plating of a locking variety has been popular, and I felt that this would be appropriate in his case. Risks and benefits otherwise described were bleeding, infection, need to do operative revise or removal of hardware. He is taking a job out of state in the next couple of months. Hence I felt that even with close followup, this is a particularly difficult fracture as far as the morbidity of the injury proceeds. OPERATIVE NOTE: After adequate general endotracheal anesthesia was obtained, one gram of Ancef was given intravenously. The left upper extremity was prepped and draped in supine position with the left hand in the arm table, magnification was used throughout. The time out procedure was done to the satisfaction of all present that this was indeed the appropriate extremity on the appropriate patient. A small C-arm was brought in to help guide the incision which was a volar curvilinear incision that included as part of this due to the fracture blisters eminent compartment syndrome and numbness in fingers. A carpal tunnel release was done with the transverse carpal ligament being protected with a Freer elevator. The usual amount of dissection of the pronator quadratus was necessary to view the distal radial fragment. The pronator quadratus actually grasped several of the fragments itself which had to be dissected free from them, specifically the distal radial ulnar joint and die-punch fragment. At this point, a locking Synthes distal radius plate from the modular handset was selected that had five articular screws as well as five locking shaft screws. The ulnar styloid was not affixed in any portion of this repair. The plate was viewed under the image intensification device, i.e., x-ray and the screws were placed in this order. The most proximal shaft screw was placed to allow the remainder of the plate to form a buttress to then rearrange the fragments around the locking screws and a locking plate having been selected from the volar approach, a locking 12-mm screw through 16-mm screws were placed in the following order. Most proximal on the radial shaft of the plate, then the radial styloid, i.e., the most distal and lateral screw, the next most proximal shaft screw followed by the distal radial ulnar joint screw. Three screws were locking across the die-punch fragment. The remaining two screws were placed into the radial shaft. All of these were locking screws of 2 mm in diameter and as the construct was created, the relative motion of the intra-articular fragment in dorsal comminution all diminished greatly, although the exposure as well as the amount of reduction force used was substantial. The tourniquet time was 1.5 hours. At this point, the tourniquet was let down. The entire construct was irrigated with copious amounts of bacitracin and normal saline. Closure was affected with 0 Vicryl underneath the skin surface followed by 3-0 Prolene in interrupted sutures in the volar wound. Several image intensification x-rays were taken at the conclusion of the case to check screw length. Screw lengths were changed out during the case as needed based on the x-ray findings. The wound was injected with Marcaine, lidocaine, Depo-Medrol, and Kantrex. A very heavily padded fluffy cotton Jones-type dressing was applied with a volar splint. Estimated blood loss was 10 mL. There were no specimens. Tourniquet time was 1.5 hours."

Hallux abductovalgus deformity, right foot. 2. Tailor bunion deformity, right foot. PROCEDURES PERFORMED: Tailor bunionectomy, right foot, Weil-type with screw fixation. ANESTHESIA: Local with MAC, local consisting of 20 mL of 0.5% Marcaine plain. HEMOSTASIS: Pneumatic ankle tourniquet at 200 mmHg. INJECTABLES: A 10 mL of 0.5% Marcaine plain and 1 mL of dexamethasone phosphate. MATERIAL: A 2.4 x 14 mm, 2.4 x 16 mm, and 2.0 x 10 mm OsteoMed noncannulated screw. A 2-0 Vicryl, 3-0 Vicryl, 4-0 Vicryl, and 5-0 nylon. COMPLICATIONS: None. SPECIMENS: None. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table in the usual supine position. At this time, a pneumatic ankle tourniquet was placed on the patient's right ankle for the purpose of maintaining hemostasis. Number of the anesthesias was obtained and then induced mild sedation and local anesthetic as described above was infiltrated about the surgical site. The right foot was then scrubbed, prepped, and draped in the usual aseptic manner. An Esmarch bandage was then used to exsanguinate the patient's right foot, and the pneumatic ankle tourniquet inflated to 200 mmHg. Attention was then directed to dorsal aspect of the first metatarsophalangeal joint where a linear longitudinal incision measuring approximately a 3.5 cm in length was made. The incision was carried deep utilizing both sharp and blunt dissections. All major neurovascular structures were avoided. At this time, through the original skin incision, attention was directed to the first intermetatarsal space where utilizing both sharp and blunt dissection the deep transverse intermetatarsal ligament was identified. This was then incised fully exposing the tendon and the abductor hallucis muscle. This was then resected from his osseous attachments and a small tenotomy was performed. At this time, a small lateral capsulotomy was also performed. Lateral contractures were once again reevaluated and noted to be grossly reduced. Attention was then directed to the dorsal aspect of the first metatarsal phalangeal joint where linear longitudinal and periosteal and capsular incisions were made following the first metatarsal joint and following the original shape of the skin incision. The periosteal capsular layers were then reflected both medially and laterally from the head of the first metatarsal and a utilizing an oscillating bone saw, the head of the first metatarsal and medial eminence was resected and passed from the operative field. A 0.045 inch K-wire was then driven across the first metatarsal head in order to act as an access dye. The patient was then placed in the frog-leg position, and two osteotomy cuts were made, one from the access guide to the plantar proximal position and one from the access guide to the dorsal proximal position. The dorsal arm was made longer than the plantar arm to accommodate for fixation. At this time, the capital fragment was resected and shifted laterally into a more corrected position. At this time, three portions of the 0.045-inch K-wire were placed across the osteotomy site in order to access temporary forms of fixation. Two of the three of these K-wires were removed in sequence and following the standard AO technique two 3.4 x 15 mm and one 2.4 x 14 mm OsteoMed noncannulated screws were placed across the osteotomy site. Compression was noted to be excellent. All guide wires and 0.045-inch K-wires were then removed. Utilizing an oscillating bone saw, the overhanging wedge of the bone on the medial side of the first metatarsal was resected and passed from the operating field. The wound was then once again flushed with copious amounts of sterile normal saline. At this time, utilizing both 2-0 and 3-0 Vicryl, the periosteal and capsular layers were then reapproximated. At this time, the skin was then closed in layers utilizing 4-0 Vicryl and 4-0 nylon. At this time, attention was directed to the dorsal aspect of the right fifth metatarsal where a linear longitudinal incision was made over the metatarsophalangeal joint just lateral to the extensor digitorum longus tension. Incision was carried deep utilizing both sharp and blunt dissections and all major neurovascular structures were avoided. A periosteal and capsular incision was then made on the lateral aspect of the extensor digitorum longus tendon and periosteum and capsular layers were then reflected medially and laterally from the head of the fifth metatarsal. Utilizing an oscillating bone saw, the lateral eminence was resected and passed from the operative field. Utilizing the sagittal saw, a Weil-type osteotomy was made at the fifth metatarsal head. The head was then shifted medially into a more corrected position. A 0.045-inch K-wire was then used as a temporary fixation, and a 2.0 x 10 mm OsteoMed noncannulated screw was placed across the osteotomy site. This was noted to be in correct position and compression was noted to be excellent. Utilizing a small bone rongeur, the overhanging wedge of the bone on the dorsal aspect of the fifth metatarsal was resected and passed from the operative field. The wound was once again flushed with copious amounts of sterile normal saline. The periosteal and capsular layers were reapproximated utilizing 3-0 Vicryl, and the skin was then closed utilizing 4-0 Vicryl and 4-0 nylon. At this time, 10 mL of 0.5% Marcaine plain and 1 mL of dexamethasone phosphate were infiltrated about the surgical site. The right foot was then dressed with Xeroform gauze, fluffs, Kling, and Ace wrap, all applied in mild compressive fashion. The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was then deflated and a prompt hyperemic response was noted to all digits of the right foot. The patient was then transported from the operating room to the recovery room with vital sings stable and neurovascular status grossly intact to the right foot. After a brief period of postoperative monitoring, the patient was discharged to home with proper written and verbal discharge instructions, which included to keep dressing clean, dry, and intact and to follow up with Dr. A. The patient is to be nonweightbearing to the right foot. The patient was given a prescription for pain medications on nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and was educated on these. The patient tolerated the procedure and anesthesia well. Dr. A was present throughout the entire case."
425,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Hammertoe deformity of the right second digit. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Hammertoe deformity of the right second digit. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Arthroplasty of the right second digit. The patient is a 77-year-old Hispanic male who presents to ABCD Hospital for surgical correction of a painful second digit hammertoe. The patient has failed attempts at conservative treatment and is unable to wear shoes without pain to his second toe. The patient presents n.p.o. since mid night last night and consented to sign in the chart. H&P is complete. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: After an IV was instituted by the Department of Anesthesia in the preoperative holding area, the patient was escorted to the operating room and placed on the table in the supine position. Using Webril, the distal leg and ankle was padded and a ankle pneumatic tourniquet was placed around the right ankle, but left deflated at this time. Restraining, a lap belt was then placed around the patient's abdomen while laying on the table. After adequate anesthesia was administered by the Department of Anesthesia, a local digital block using 5 cc of 0.5% Marcaine plain was used to provide local anesthesia. The foot was then prepped and draped in the normal sterile orthopedic manner. The foot was then elevated and Esmarch bandage was applied, after which time the tourniquet was inflated to 250 mmHg. The foot was then brought down to the level of the table and stockinet was cut and reflected after the Esmarch bandage was removed. A wet and dry sponge was then used to cleanse the operative site and using a skin skribe a dorsal incisional line was outlined extending from the proximal phalanx over the proximal interphalangeal joint on to the middle phalanx. Then using a fresh #15 blade, a dorsolinear incision was made, partial thickness through the skin after testing anesthesia with one to two pickup. Then using a fresh #15 blade, incision was deepened and using medial to lateral pressure, the incision was opened into the subcutaneous tissue. Care was taken to reflect the subcutaneous tissue from the underlying deep fascia to mobilize the skin. This was performed with the combination of blunt and dull dissection. Care was taken to avoid proper digital arteries and neurovascular bundles as were identified. Attention was then directed to the proximal interphalangeal joint and after identifying the joint line, a transverse linear incision was made over the dorsal surface of the joint. The medial and lateral sides of the joint capsule were then also incised on the superior half in order to provide increased exposure. Following this, the proximal portion of the transected extensor digitorum longus tendon was identified using an Adson-Brown pickup. It was elevated with fresh #15 blade. The tendon and capsule was reflected along with the periosteum from the underlying bone dorsally. Following this, the distal portion of the tendon was identified in a like manner. The tendon and the capsule as well as the periosteal tissue was reflected from the dorsal surface of the bone. The proximal interphalangeal joint was then distracted and using careful technique, #15 blade was used to deepen the incision and while maintaining close proximity to the bone and condyles, the lateral and medial collateral ligaments were freed up from the side of the proximal phalanx head. Following this, the head of the proximal phalanx was known to have adequate exposure and was freed from soft tissues. Then using a sagittal saw with a #139 blade, the head of he proximal phalanx was resected. Care was taken to avoid the deep flexor tendon. The head of the proximal phalanx was taken with the Adson-Brown and using a #15 blade, the plantar periosteal tissue was freed up and the head was removed and sent to pathology. The wound was then flushed using a sterile saline with gentamicin and the digit was noted to be in good alignment. The digit was also noted to be in rectus alignment. Proximal portion of the tendon was shortened to allow for removal of the redundant tendon after correction of the deformity. Then using a #3-0 Vicryl suture, three simple interrupted sutures were placed for closure of the tendon and capsular tissue. Then following this, #4-0 nylon was used in a combination of horizontal mattress and simple interrupted sutures to close the skin. The toe was noted to be in good alignment and then 1 cc of dexamethasone phosphate was injected into the incision site. Following this, the incision was dressed using a sterile Owen silk soaked in saline and gentamicin. The toe was bandaged using 4 x 4s, Kling, and Coban. The tourniquet was deflated and immediate hyperemia was noted to the digits I through V of the right foot. The patient was then transferred to the cart and was escorted to the Postanesthesia Care Unit where the patient was given postoperative surgical shoe. Total tourniquet time for the case was 30 minutes. While in the recovery, the patient was given postoperative instructions to include, ice and elevation to his right foot. The patient was given pain medications of Tylenol #3, quantity 30 to be taken one to two tablets every six to eight hours as necessary for moderate to severe pain. The patient was also given prescription for cane to aid in ambulation. The patient will followup with Dr. X on Tuesday in his office for postoperative care. The patient was instructed to keep the dressings clean, dry, and intact and to not remove them before his initial office visit. The patient tolerated the procedure well and the anesthesia with no complications."

Complete tear anterior cruciate ligament, right knee. 2. Complex tear of the posterior horn lateral meniscus. 3. Tear of posterior horn medial meniscus. 4. Patellofemoral instability. 5. Chondromalacia patella. PROCEDURES PERFORMED: 1. Diagnostic operative arthroscopy with repair and reconstruction of anterior cruciate ligament using autologous hamstring tendon, a 40 mm bioabsorbable femoral pin, and a 9 mm bioabsorbable tibial pin. 2. Repair of lateral meniscus using two fast fixed meniscal repair sutures. 3. Partial medial meniscectomy. 4. Partial chondroplasty of patella. 5. Lateral retinacular release. 6. Open medial plication as well of the right knee. ANESTHESIA: General. COMPLICATIONS: None. TOURNIQUET TIME: 130 minutes at 325 mmHg. INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS: There was noted to be a grade-II chondromalacia patellofemoral joint. The patella was noted to be situated laterally past the lateral femoral condyle. There was a tear to the posterior horn of the medial meniscus within the white zone. There was a complex tear involving a horizontal cleavage component to the posterior horn of the lateral meniscus as well in the entire meniscus. There was a complete tear of the anterior cruciate ligament. The posterior cruciate ligament appeared intact. Preoperatively, she had a positive Lachman with a positive pivot shift test as well as increased patellofemoral instability. HISTORY: This is a 39-year-old female who has sustained a twisting injury to her knee while on trampoline in late August. She was diagnosed per MRI. An MRI confirmed the clinical diagnosis of anterior cruciate ligament tear. She states she has had multiple episodes of instability to the patellofemoral joint throughout the years with multiple dislocations. She elected to proceed with surgery to repair the anterior cruciate ligament as well as possibly plicate the medial retinaculum to help prevent further dislocations of the patellofemoral joint. All risks and benefits of surgery were discussed with her at length. She was in agreement with the treatment plan. PROCEDURE: On 09/11/03, she was taken to the operating room at ABCD General Hospital. She was placed supine on the operating table. General anesthetic was applied by the Anesthesiology Department. Tourniquet was placed on the proximal thigh and it was then placed in a knee holder. She was sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion. An Esmarch was used to exsanguinate the lower extremity. Tourniquet was inflated to 325 mmHg. Longitudinal incision was made just medial to the tibial tubercle. The subcutaneous tissue was carefully dissected. Hemostasis was controlled with electrocautery. The tendons of gracilis and semitendinosus were identified and isolated, and then stripped off the musculotendinous junction. They were taken on the back table. The soft tissue debris was removed from the tendons. The ends of the tendons were sewn together using #5 Tycron whip type sutures. The tendons were measured on back table and found to be 8 mm as the most adequate size, they were then placed under tension on the back table. Stab incision was made in the inferolateral parapatellar region, through this camera was placed in the knee. The knee was inflated with saline solution and operative pictures were obtained. The above findings were noted. A second port site was initiated in the inferomedial parapatellar region. Through this, a probe was placed. Tear in the posterior horn medial meniscus was identified. It was resected using a meniscal resector. It was then further contoured using arthroscopic shaver. Attention was then taken to the lateral compartment. A partial meniscectomy was performed using the resector and the shaver. The posterior periphery of the lateral meniscus was also noticed to be unstable. A repair was then performed using two fasting fixed meniscal repair sutures to help anchor the meniscus around the popliteus tendon. There was noted to be excellent fixation. The shaver was then taken into the intrachondral notch. First a partial chondroplasty was performed on the patella to remove the loose articular debris as well as a partial synovectomy to the medial aspect of the patellar femoral joint. Next, the remnant of the anterior cruciate ligament was removed using the arthroscopic shaver and arthroplasty was then performed on the medial aspect of the lateral femoral condyle. Next, a tibial guide was placed through the anterior medial portal. A ___ pin was then placed up through the anterior incision entering the tibial eminence just anterior to the posterior cruciate ligament. This tibial tunnel was then drilled using 8 mm cannulated drill. Next, an over-the-top guide was then placed at approximately the 11:30 position. A ____ pin was then placed into the femur and 8 mm drill was then used to drill this femoral tunnel approximately 35 mm. Next the U shape guide was placed through tibial tunnel into the femur. A pin was then placed through the distal femur from lateral to medial, through the U-shaped guide a puller wire was then passed through the distal femur. It was then pulled out through the tibial tunnel using the You-shaped guide. The tendon was then placed around the wire. The wire was pulled back up through the tibial into the femoral tunnel. A 40 mm bioabsorbable pin was then placed through the femoral tunnel securing the hamstring tendons. Attention was then pulled through the tibial tunnel. The knee was cycled approximately 20 times. A 9 mm bioabsorbable screw was then placed through the tibial tunnel fixating the distal aspect of the graft. There was noted definite fixation of the graft. There was no evidence of impingement either in full flexion or full extension. The knee was copiously irrigated and it was then suctioned dry. A longitudinal incision was made just medial to the patellofemoral joint. Soft tissues were carefully dissected and the medial retinaculum was incised along with the incision. Following this, a release of lateral retinaculum was performed using a knife to further release the patellofemoral joint and allow further medial plication. The medial retinaculum was then plicated using #1 Ethibond sutures and then oversewn with #0 Vicryl suture. The subcuticular tissues were reapproximated with #2-0 Vicryl simple interrupted sutures followed by a #4-0 PDS running subcuticular stitch. She was placed in a DonJoy knee immobilizer. The tourniquet was deflated. It was noted the lower extremity was warm and pink with good capillary refill. She was transferred to the recovery room in apparent stable and satisfactory condition. Prognosis for this patient is guarded. She will be full weightbearing on the lower extremity using the knee immobilizer locked in extension. She may remove her dressing two to three days, however, follow back in the office in 10 to 14 days for suture removal. She will require one to two more physical therapy to help regain motion and strength to the lower extremity."
427,Orthopedic," CHIEF COMPLAINT: Left hip pain. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 32-year-old male seen by Dr. ABC several weeks ago for persistent left hip pain. He has a long eight to ten year history of pain into the left hip. He has been worked up by several specialists and evaluated. He was thought initially to have low back pain with radiculopathy. He does have a history of antibiotic steroid use as well as heavy drinking. He reports his symptoms started approximately eight years ago when he was doing some construction at which time he began to have left hip pain. He has had difficulties on and off ever since then. On the last visit, radiographs revealed severe degenerative changes of the left hip joint with apparent AVN of the left femoral head. He was given some pain medication and discussion took place regarding referring him to a specialist for evaluation of possible hip resurfacing versus conventional total hip replacement. He came for a second opinion in the area and we discussed his problems further. He continues to have primarily groin pain, which limits his daily activities. He has used a cane in the past for a short period and he continues to have difficulty with the left hip. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Diabetes and high blood pressure. PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: He had a history of surgery for an undescended testicle. MEDICATIONS: Metformin, Prozac, lisinopril, Norco, and glimepiride. ALLERGIES: No know drug allergies. SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient current smokes. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Reveals significant limited internal rotation of the left hip. He essentially has 0 degrees of internal rotation compared to the contralateral hip, which has approximately 30 degrees. He has significant pain with hip range of motion. There is no significant leg length discrepancy. He has no numbness or tingling distal and 2+ pulses. X-RAYS: Review of films taken previously reveals severe degenerative changes consistent with AVN. ASSESSMENT: Left hip avascular necrosis. PLAN: I had a long discussion with the patient regarding his problem and he voiced understanding. We discussed the possibility of hip arthrodesis versus hip replacement versus hip resurfacing and the high likelihood that any one of these procedures may require further operations throughout his life secondary to his young age and high activity level. We discussed a referral to a hip specialist, who performs resurfacing procedures specifically Dr. XYZ in Houston. Referral will be arranged for him. All questions were answered to his satisfaction. He was also given a prescription of Norco 10/325, #60 and Flexeril until he is able to arrange an appointment with a hip specialist."
428,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Bunion left foot. 2. Hammertoe, left second toe. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Bunion left foot. 2. Hammertoe, left second toe. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: 1. Bunionectomy, SCARF type, with metatarsal osteotomy and internal screw fixation, left. 2. Arthroplasty left second toe. HISTORY: This 39-year-old female presents to ABCD General Hospital with the above chief complaint. The patient states that she has had bunion for many months. It has been progressively getting more painful at this time. The patient attempted conservative treatment including wider shoe gear without long-term relief of symptoms and desires surgical treatment. PROCEDURE: An IV was instituted by the Department of Anesthesia in the preop holding area. The patient was transported to the operating room and placed on the operating table in the supine position with a safety belt across her lap. Copious amount of Webril were placed around the left ankle followed by a blood pressure cuff. After adequate sedation was achieved by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 15 cc of 0.5% Marcaine plain was injected in a Mayo and digital block to the left foot. The foot was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile orthopedic fashion. The foot was elevated from the operating table and exsanguinated with an Esmarch bandage. The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was inflated to 250 mmHg and the foot was lowered to the operating table. The stockinette was reflected. The foot was cleansed with wet and dry sponge. Attention was then directed to the first metatarsophalangeal joint of the left foot. An incision was created over this area approximately 6 cm in length. The incision was deepened with a #15 blade. All vessels encountered were ligated for hemostasis. The skin and subcutaneous tissue was then dissected from the capsule. Care was taken to preserve the neurovascular bundle. Dorsal linear capsular incision was then created. The capsule was then reflected from the head of the first metatarsal. Attention was then directed to the first interspace where a lateral release was performed. A combination of sharp and blunt dissection was performed until the abductor tendons were identified and transected. A lateral capsulotomy was performed. Attention was then directed back to the medial eminence where sagittal saw was used to resect the prominent medial eminence. The incision was then extended proximally with further dissection down to the level of the bone. Two 0.45 K-wires were then inserted as access guides for the SCARF osteotomy. A standard SCARF osteotomy was then performed. The head of the first metatarsal was then translocated laterally in order to reduce the first interspace in the metatarsal angle. After adequate reduction of the bunion deformity was noted, the bone was temporarily fixated with a 0.45 K-wire. A 3.0 x 12 mm screw was then inserted in the standard AO fashion with compression noted. A second 3.0 x 14 mm screw was also inserted with tight compression noted. The remaining prominent medial eminence medially was then resected with a sagittal saw. Reciprocating rasps were then used to smooth any sharp bony edges. The temporary fixation wires were then removed. The screws were again checked for tightness, which was noted. Attention was directed to the medial capsule where a medial capsulorrhaphy was performed. A straight stat was used to assist in removing a portion of the capsule. The capsule was then reapproximated with #2-0 Vicryl medially. Dorsal capsule was then reapproximated with #3-0 Vicryl in a running fashion. The subcutaneous closure was performed with #4-0 Vicryl followed by running subcuticular stitch with #5-0 Vicryl. The skin was then closed with #4-0 nylon in a horizontal mattress type fashion. Attention was then directed to the left second toe. A dorsal linear incision was then created over the proximal phalangeal joint of the left second toe. The incision was deepened with a #15 blade and the skin and subcutaneous tissue was dissected off the capsule to be aligned laterally. An incision was made on either side of the extensor digitorum longus tendon. A curved mosquito stat was then used to reflex the tendon laterally. The joint was identified and the medial collateral ligamentous attachments were resected off the head of the proximal phalanx. A sagittal saw was then used to resect the head of the proximal head. The bone was then rolled and the lateral collateral attachments were transected and the bone was removed in toto. The extensor digitorum longus tendon was inspected and noted to be intact. Any sharp edges were then smoothed with reciprocating rasp. The area was then flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline. The skin was then reapproximated with #4-0 nylon. Dressings consisted of Owen silk, 4x4s, Kling, Kerlix, and Coban. Pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and an immediate hyperemic flush was noted to all five digits of the left foot. The patient tolerated the above procedure and anesthesia well without complications. The patient was transported to PACU with vital signs stable and vascular status intact to the left foot. The patient is to follow up with Dr. X in his clinic as directed."
429,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Cervical degenerative disc disease, spondylosis, severe myelopathy, spinal cord compression especially at C3-C4, C4-C5, and C5-C6, and progressive quadriparesis. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Cervical degenerative disc disease, spondylosis, severe myelopathy, spinal cord compression especially at C3-C4, C4-C5, and C5-C6, progressive quadriparesis, and very poor bone quality as well as difficulty with hemostasis with the patient having been on aspirin. OPERATIVE PROCEDURE 1. Anterior cervical discectomy, osteophytectomy, foraminotomies, spinal cord decompression at C3-C4, C4-C5, and C5-C6. 2. Microscope. 3. Fusion with machined allografts at C3-C4, C4-C5, and C5-C6. 4. Eagle titanium plate from C3 to C6. 5. Jackson-Pratt drain placement. 6. Intraoperative monitoring with EMGs and SSEPs. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 350 cc. ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal anesthesia. COMPLICATIONS: None. COUNTS: Correct. SPECIMENS SENT: None. CLINICAL HISTORY: The patient is a 77-year-old male who was admitted through the emergency room for progressive weakness and falling. He was worked by the neurologist, Dr. X, and found to have cervical spondylosis with myelopathy. I was consulted and elected to do a lumbar and cervical myelogram CT scan, which showed lumbar stenosis but also cervical stenosis with more pathology anteriorly than posteriorly. The patient had worst disease at level C3-C4, C4-C5, and C5-C6. The patient was significantly weak and almost quadriparetic, stronger on the right side than on the left side. I thought that surgery was indicated to prevent progressive neurological deterioration, as well as to prevent a central cord syndrome if the patient were to get into a motor vehicle accident or simply fall. Conservative management was not an option. The patient was preoped and consented, and was medically cleared. I discussed the indications, risks, and benefits of the surgery with the patient and the patient's family. The risks of bleeding, hoarseness, swallowing difficulty, pseudoarthrosis as well as plate migration and hardware failure were all discussed with the patient. An informed consent was obtained from the patient as such. He was brought into the OR today for the operative procedure. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was brought into the OR, intubated, and given a general anesthetic. Intubation was done under C-spine precautions. The patient received preoperative vancomycin and Decadron. He was hooked up to the SSEP apparatus and had poor baselines and delays. With a large a shoulder roll, I extended the patient's neck, and landmark incision in crease in the right upper neck, and the area was then prepped and sterilely draped. All the lines had been put in and the arms were padded. Using a knife and cautery, I took the incision down through the skin and subcutaneous tissue and arrived at the cervical spine. Prominent osteophyte at C5-C6 was noted, lesser at C4-C5. Intraoperative x-ray confirmed our levels, and we were fully exposed from C3-C6. Trimline retractors were put in, and I cut the discs out as well as removed the superficial hyperstatic bone and osteophytes. With the drill, I performed a superficial discectomy and endplate resection, curetting the endplate as I went. I then brought in the microscope, under the microscopic guidance, firmly removed the end plates and drilled through the posterior longitudinal ligament to decompress the spinal cord. Worst findings at C3-C4 followed C5-C6 and then C4-C5. Excellent thecal sac decompression was achieved and foraminal decompression was also achieved. With change in intraoperative monitoring, a microscope was used for this decompressive procedure. The patient was very oozy throughout this procedure, and during the decompression part, the oozing was constant. This was partly due to the patient's cancellous bone, but he had been on aspirin which was stopped only 2 days ago, and the option was not available to wait 2 to 3 weeks which would have made this man worse simply over time. I thus elected to give him DDAVP, platelets, and used Horsley bone wax for excellent hemostasis. This took literally half-an-hour to an hour and added to the complexity and difficulty of this case. Eventually, with blood pressure controlled and all the other parameters under control, bleeding was somewhat slow. I then selected two 10 and one 9-mm cadaveric allograft, which had soaking in bacitracin solution. These were trimmed to the desired dimensions, and under slight distraction, these were tapped into position. Excellent graft alignment was achieved. I now brought in a DePuy titanium eagle plate, and I fixed it to the spine from C3 to C6. Fourteen millimeter screws were used; all the screws were tightened and torqued. The patient's bone quality was poor, but the screws did torque appropriately. I inspected the plate, controlled the hemostasis, assessed post-fixation x-ray, and was really happy with the screw length and the overall alignment. The wound was irrigated with antibiotic solution; a Jackson-Pratt drain 10-French was put in with trocar. Decision was made to start the closure. So, I closed the platysma with 3-0 Vicryl and used staples for the skin. A simple Primapore or Medpore dressing was applied. The patient was extubated in the OR and taken to the PSU in stable medical condition. When I saw the patient in the ICU, he was awake, alert, and moving all four extremities, somewhat weak on the left side. He had done well from the surgery. Blood loss was 350 cc. All instrument, needle, and sponge counts were correct. No complications, no change in intraoperative monitoring. No specimens were sent. The patient's wife was spoken to and fully appraised of the intraoperative findings and the expected prognosis. The patient will be kept n.p.o. tonight and will gradually advance his diet, and also will gradually advance his activity. I will keep him on Decadron and keep the collar on. I do not think there is need for halo rest. We will be obtaining formal C-spine films in the morning. Prognosis is guarded but favorable at this time."
430,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Osteomyelitis, left hallux. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Osteomyelitis, left hallux. PROCEDURES PERFORMED: Resection of infected bone, left hallux, proximal phalanx, and distal phalanx. ANESTHESIA: TIVA/Local. HISTORY: This 77-year-old male presents to ABCD preoperative holding area after keeping himself NPO since mid night for surgery on his infected left hallux. The patient has a history of chronic osteomyelitis and non-healing ulceration to the left hallux of almost 10 years' duration. He has failed outpatient antibiotic therapy and conservative methods. At this time, he desires to attempt surgical correction. The patient is not interested in a hallux amputation at this time; however, he is consenting to removal of infected bone. He was counseled preoperatively about the strong probability of the hallux being a &quot;floppy tail&quot; after the surgery and accepts the fact. The risks versus benefits of the procedure were discussed with the patient in detail by Dr. X and the consent is available on the chart for review. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient's wound was debrided with a #15 blade and down to good healthy tissue preoperatively. The wound was on the planar medial, distal and dorsal medial. The wound's bases were fibrous. They did not break the bone at this point. They were each approximately 0.5 cm in diameter. After IV was established by the Department of Anesthesia, the patient was taken to the operating room and placed on the operating table in supine position with safety straps placed across his waist for his protection. Due to the patient's history of diabetes and marked calcifications on x-ray, a pneumatic ankle tourniquet was not applied. Next, a total of 3 cc of a 1:1 mixture of 0.5% Marcaine plain and 1% lidocaine plain was used to infiltrate the left hallux and perform a digital block. Next, the foot was prepped and draped in the usual aseptic fashion. It was lowered in the operative field and attention was directed to the left hallux after the sterile stockinet was reflected. Next, a #10 blade was used to make a linear incision approximately 3.5 cm in length along the dorsal aspect of the hallux from the base to just proximal to the eponychium. Next, the incision was deepened through the subcutaneous tissue. A heavy amount of bleeding was encountered. Therefore, a Penrose drain was applied at the tourniquet, which failed. Next, an Esmarch bandage was used to exsanguinate the distal toes and forefoot and was left in the forefoot to achieve hemostasis. Any small veins crossing throughout the subcutaneous layer were ligated via electrocautery. Next, the medial and lateral margins of the incision were under marked with a sharp dissection down to the level of the long extension tendon. The long extensor tendon was thickened and overall exhibited signs of hypertrophy. The transverse incision through the long extensor tendon was made with a #15 blade. Immediately upon entering the joint, yellow discolored fluid was drained from the interphalangeal joint. Next, the extensor tendon was peeled dorsally and distally off the bone. Immediately the head of the proximal phalanx was found to be lytic, disease, friable, crumbly, and there were free fragments of the medial aspect of the bone, the head of the proximal phalanx. This bone was removed with a sharp dissection. Next, after adequate exposure was obtained and the collateral ligaments were released off the head of proximal phalanx, a sagittal saw was used to resect the approximately one-half of the proximal phalanx. This was passed off as the infected bone specimen for microbiology and pathology. Next, the base of the distal phalanx was exposed with sharp dissection and a rongeur was used to remove soft crumbly diseased medial and plantar aspect at the base of distal phalanx. Next, there was diseased soft tissue envelope around the bone, which was also resected to good healthy tissue margins. The pulse lavage was used to flush the wound with 1000 cc of gentamicin-impregnated saline. Next, cleaned instruments were used to take a proximal section of proximal phalanx to label a clean margin. This bone was found to be hard and healthy appearing. The wound after irrigation was free of all debris and infected tissue. Therefore anaerobic and aerobic cultures were taken and sent to microbiology. Next, OsteoSet beads, tobramycin-impregnated, were placed. Six beads were placed in the wound. Next, the extensor tendon was re-approximated with #3-0 Vicryl. The subcutaneous layer was closed with #4-0 Vicryl in a simple interrupted technique. Next, the skin was closed with #4-0 nylon in a horizontal mattress technique. The Esmarch bandage was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted at the digits. A standard postoperative dressing was applied consisting of 4 x 4s, Betadine-soaked #0-1 silk, Kerlix, Kling, and a loosely applied Ace wrap. The patient tolerated the above anesthesia and procedure without complications. He was transported via a cart to the Postanesthesia Care Unit. His vitals signs were stable and vascular status was intact. He was given a medium postop shoe that was well-formed and fitting. He is to elevate his foot, but not apply ice. He is to follow up with Dr. X. He was given emergency contact numbers. He is to continue the Vicodin p.r.n. pain that he was taking previously for his shoulder pain and has enough of the medicine at home. The patient was discharged in stable condition."
431,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Herniated nucleus pulposus, C5-C6, with spinal stenosis. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Herniated nucleus pulposus, C5-C6, with spinal stenosis. PROCEDURE: Anterior cervical discectomy with fusion C5-C6. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was placed in supine position. The neck was prepped and draped in the usual fashion. An incision was made from midline to the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid in the right side. Skin and subcutaneous tissue were divided sharply. Trachea and esophagus were retracted medially. Carotid sheath was retracted laterally. Longus colli muscles were dissected away from the vertebral bodies of C5-C6. We confirmed our position by taking intraoperative x-rays. We then used the operating microscope and cleaned out the disk completely. We then sized the interspace and then tapped in a #7 mm cortical cancellous graft. We then used the DePuy Dynamic plate with 14-mm screws. Jackson-Pratt drain was placed in the prevertebral space and brought out through a separate incision. The wound was closed in layers using 2-0 Vicryl for muscle and fascia. The blood loss was less than 10-20 mL. No complication. Needle count, sponge count, and cottonoid count was correct."
432,Orthopedic," HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 26-year-old female, referred to Physical Therapy for low back pain. The patient has a history of traumatic injury to low back. The patient stated initial injury occurred eight years ago, when she fell at a ABC Store. The patient stated she received physical therapy, one to two visits and received modality treatment only, specifically electrical stimulation and heat pack per patient recollection. The patient stated that she has had continuous low-back pain at varying degrees for the past eight years since that fall. The patient gave birth in August 2008 and since the childbirth, has experienced low back pain. The patient also states that she fell four to five days ago, while mopping her floor. The patient stated that she landed on her tailbone and symptoms have increased since that fall. The patient stated that her initial physician examination with Dr. X was on 01/10/09, and has a followup appointment on 02/10/09. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: The patient denies high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, lung disease, thyroid, kidney, or bladder dysfunctions. The patient stated that she quit smoking prior to her past childbirth and is currently not pregnant. The patient has had a C-section and also an appendectomy. The patient was involved in a motor vehicle accident four to five years ago and at that time, the patient did not require any physical therapy nor did she report any complaints of increased back pain following that accident. MEDICATIONS: Patient currently states she is taking: 1. Vicodin 500 mg two times a day. 2. Risperdal. 3. Zoloft. 4. Stool softeners. 5. Prenatal pills. DIAGNOSTIC IMAGERY: The patient states she has not had an MRI performed on her lumbar spine. The patient also states that Dr. X took x-rays two weeks ago, and no fractures were found at that time. Per physician note, dated 12/10/08, Dr. X dictated that the x-ray showed an anterior grade 1 spondylolisthesis of L5 over S1, and requested Physical Therapy to evaluate and treat. SUBJECTIVE: The patient states that pain is constant in nature with a baseline of 6-7/10 with pain increasing to 10/10 during the night or in cold weather. The patient states that pain is dramatically less, when the weather is warmer. The patient also states that pain worsens as the day progresses, in that she also hard time getting out of bed in the morning. The patient states that she does not sleep at night well and sleeps less than one hour at a time. Aggravating factors include, sitting for periods greater than 20 minutes or lying supine on her back. Easing factors include side lying position in she attempts to sleep. OBJECTIVE: AGE: 26 years old. HEIGHT: 5 feet 2 inches. WEIGHT: The patient is an obese 26-year-old female. ACTIVE RANGE OF MOTION: Lumbar spine, flexion, lateral flexion and rotation all within functional limits without complaints of pain or soreness while performing them during evaluation. PALPATION: The patient complained of bilateral SI joint point tenderness. The patient also complained of left greater trochanter hip point tenderness. The patient also complained of bilateral paraspinal tenderness on cervical spine to lumbar spine. STRENGTH: RIGHT LOWER EXTREMITY: Knee extension 5/5, hip flexion 5/5, knee flexion 4/5, internal and external hip rotation was 4/5. With manual muscle testing of knee flexion, hip, internal and external rotation, the patient reports an increase in right SI joint pain to 8/10. LEFT LOWER EXTREMITY: Hip flexion 5/5, knee extension 5/5, knee flexion 4/5, hip internal and external rotation 4/5, with slight increase in pain level with manual muscle testing and resistance. It must be noted that PT did not apply as much resistance during manual muscle testing, secondary to the 8/10 pain elicited during the right lower extremity. NEUROLOGICAL: The patient subjectively complains of numbness with tingling in her bilateral extremities when she sits longer than 25 minutes. However, they subside when she stands. The patient did complain of this numbness and tingling during the evaluation and the patient was seated for a period of 20 minutes. Upon standing, the patient stated that the numbness and tingling subsides almost immediately. The patient stated that Dr. X told her that he believes that during her past childbirth when the epidural was being administered that there was a possibility that a sensory nerve may have been also affected during the epidural less causing the numbness and tingling in her bilateral lower extremities. The patient does not demonstrate any sensation deficits with gentle pressure to the lumbar spine and during manual muscle testing. GAIT: The patient ambulated out of the examination room, while carrying her baby in a car seat. ASSESSMENT: The patient is a 26-year-old overweight female, referred to Physical Therapy for low back pain. The patient presents with lower extremity weakness, which may be contributing to her lumbosacral pain, in that she has poor lumbar stabilization with dynamic ADLs, transfers, and gait activity when fatigued. At this time, the patient may benefit from skilled physical therapy to address her decreased strength and core stability in order to improve her ADL, transfer, and mobility skills. PROGNOSIS: The patient's prognosis for physical therapy is good for dictated goals. SHORT-TERM GOALS TO BE ACHIEVED IN TWO WEEKS: 1. The patient will be able to sit for greater than 25 minutes without complaints of paraesthesia or pain in her bilateral lower extremities or bilateral SI joints. 2. The patient will increase bilateral hip internal and external rotation to 4/5 with SI joint pain less than or equal to 5/10. 3. The patient will report 25% improvement in her functional and ADL activities. 4. Pain will be less than 4/10 while performing __________ while at PT session. LONG-TERM GOALS TO BE ACCOMPLISHED IN ONE MONTH: 1. The patient will be independent with home exercise program. 2. Bilateral hamstring, bilateral hip internal and external rotation strength to be 4+/5 with SI joint pain less than or equal to 2/10, while performing manual muscle test. 3. The patient will report 60% improvement or greater in functional transfers in general ADL activity. 4. The patient will be able to sit greater than or equal to 45 minutes without complaint of lumbosacral pain. 5. The patient will be able to sleep greater than 2 hours without pain. TREATMENT PLAN: 1. Therapeutic exercises to increase lower extremity strength and assist with lumbar sacral stability. 2. Modalities as indicated for pain and inflammation relief. Modalities to include ice, heat, electrical stimulation and ultrasound as appropriate. 3. Instruction of home exercise program/patient education. FREQUENCY AND DURATION: The patient is to be seen by Physical Therapy two times a week x4 weeks. I have discussed the findings of the initial evaluation with the patient. The patient is in agreement to the plan of care as outlined above. We will refer the patient back to the physician if the current plan does not seem to decrease the patient's pain level or increase her functional abilities. Thank you for this referral. If you have any questions, comments, or concerns, please feel free to contact our office."
433,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES 1. Left neck pain with left upper extremity radiculopathy. 2. Left C6-C7 neuroforaminal stenosis secondary to osteophyte. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES 1. Left neck pain with left upper extremity radiculopathy. 2. Left C6-C7 neuroforaminal stenosis secondary to osteophyte. OPERATIVE PROCEDURE 1. Anterior cervical discectomy with decompression C6-C7. 2. Arthrodesis with anterior interbody fusion C6-C7. 3. Spinal instrumentation using Pioneer 20 mm plate and four 12 x 4.0 mm screws. 4. PEEK implant 7 mm. 5. Allograft using Vitoss. ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal anesthesia. FINDINGS: Showed osteophyte with a disc complex on the left C6-C7 neural foramen. FLUIDS: 1800 mL of crystalloids. URINE OUTPUT: No Foley catheter. DRAINS: Round French 10 JP drain. SPECIMENS: None. COMPLICATIONS: None. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 250 mL. The need for an assistant is important in this case, since her absence would mean prolonged operative time and may increase operative morbidity and mortality. CONDITION: Extubated with stable vital signs. INDICATIONS FOR THE OPERATION: This is the case of a very pleasant 46-year-old Caucasian female with subarachnoid hemorrhage secondary to ruptured left posteroinferior cerebellar artery aneurysm, which was clipped. The patient last underwent a right frontal ventricular peritoneal shunt on 10/12/07. This resulted in relief of left chest pain, but the patient continued to complaint of persistent pain to the left shoulder and left elbow. She was seen in clinic on 12/11/07 during which time MRI of the left shoulder showed no evidence of rotator cuff tear. She did have a previous MRI of the cervical spine that did show an osteophyte on the left C6-C7 level. Based on this, negative MRI of the shoulder, the patient was recommended to have anterior cervical discectomy with anterior interbody fusion at C6-C7 level. Operation, expected outcome, risks, and benefits were discussed with her. Risks include, but not exclusive of bleeding and infection, bleeding could be soft tissue bleeding, which may compromise airway and may result in return to the operating room emergently for evacuation of said hematoma. There is also the possibility of bleeding into the epidural space, which can compress the spinal cord and result in weakness and numbness of all four extremities as well as impairment of bowel and bladder function. Should this occur, the patient understands that she needs to be brought emergently back to the operating room for evacuation of said hematoma. There is also the risk of infection, which can be superficial and can be managed with p.o. antibiotics. However, the patient may develop deeper-seated infection, which may require return to the operating room. Should the infection be in the area of the spinal instrumentation, this will cause a dilemma since there might be a need to remove the spinal instrumentation and/or allograft. There is also the possibility of potential injury to the esophageus, the trachea, and the carotid artery. There is also the risks of stroke on the right cerebral circulation should an undiagnosed plaque be propelled from the right carotid. There is also the possibility hoarseness of the voice secondary to injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve. There is also the risk of pseudoarthrosis and hardware failure. She understood all of these risks and agreed to have the procedure performed. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient brought to the operating room, awake, alert, not in any form of distress. After smooth induction and intubation, a Foley catheter was inserted. Monitoring leads were placed by Premier Neurodiagnostics and this revealed normal findings, which remained normal during the entire case. The EMGs were silent and there was no evidence of any stimulation. After completion of the placement of the monitoring leads, the patient was positioned supine on the operating table with the neck placed on hyperextension. The head was supported on a foam doughnut. The right cervical area was then exposed by turning the head about 45 to 60 degrees to the left side. A linear incision was made about two to three fingerbreadths from the suprasternal notch along the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle to a distance of about 3 cm. The area was then prepped with DuraPrep. After sterile drapes were laid out, the incision was made using a scalpel blade #10. Wound edge bleeders were controlled with bipolar coagulation and a hot knife was utilized to carry the dissection down to the platysma in the similar fashion as the skin incision. The anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle was identified as well as the sternohyoid/omohyoid muscles. Dissection was then carried lateral and superior to the omohyoid muscle and lateral to the esophagus and the trachea, and medial to the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the carotid sheath. The prevertebral fascia was identified and cut sharply. A localizing x-ray verified the marker to be at the C6-C7 interspace. Proceeded to the strip the longus colli muscles off the vertebral body of C6 and C7. Self-retaining retractor was then laid out. The annulus was then cut in a quadrangular fashion and piecemeal removal of the dura was done using a straight pituitary rongeurs, 3 and 5 mm burr. The interior endplate of C6 and superior endplate of C7 was likewise was drilled down together with posteroinferior edge of C6 and the posterior superior edge of C7. There was note of a new osteophyte on the left C6-C7 foramen. This was carefully drilled down. After decompression and removal of pressure, there was noted to be release of the epidural space with no significant venous bleeders. They were controlled with slight bipolar coagulation, temporary tamponade with Gelfoam. After this was completed, Valsalva maneuver showed no evidence of any CSF leakage. A 7-mm implant was then tapped into placed after its interior was packed with Vitoss. The plate was then applied and secured in place with four 12 x 4.7 mm screws. Irrigation of the area was done. A round French 10 JP drain was laid out over the graft and exteriorized through a separate stab incision on the patient's right inferiorly. The wound was then closed in layers with Vicryl 3-0 inverted interrupted sutures as well as Vicryl 4-0 subcuticular stitch for the dermis. The wound was reinforced with Dermabond. The catheter was anchored to the skin with nylon 3-0 stitch and dressing was applied only at the exit site. C-collar was placed and the patient was transferred to Recovery after extubation."
434,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Comminuted fracture, dislocation left proximal humerus. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Comminuted fracture, dislocation left proximal humerus. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Hemiarthroplasty of left shoulder utilizing a global advantage system with an #8 mm cemented humeral stem and 48 x 21 mm modular head replacement. PROCEDURE: The patient was taken to OR #2, administered general anesthetic. He was positioned in the modified beach chair position on the operative table utilizing the shoulder apparatus. The left shoulder and upper extremities were then prepped and draped in the usual manner. A longitudinal incision was made extending from a point just lateral to the coracoid down towards deltoid tuberosity of the humerus. This incision was taken down through the skin and subcutaneous tissues were split utilizing the coag cautery. Hemostasis was achieved with the cautery. The deltoid fascia were identified, skin flaps were then created. The deltopectoral interval was identified and the deltoid split just lateral to the cephalic vein. The deltoid was then retracted. There was marked hematoma and swelling within the subdeltoid bursa. This area was removed with rongeurs. The biceps tendon was identified which was the landmark for the rotator interval. Mayo scissors was utilized to split the remaining portion of the rotator interval. The greater tuberosity portion with the rotator cuff was identified. Excess bone was removed from the greater tuberosity side to allow for closure later. The lesser tuberosity portion with the subscapularis was still attached to the humeral head, therefore, osteotome was utilized to separate the lesser tuberosity from the humeral head fragment. Excess bone was removed from the lesser tuberosity as well. Both of these were tagged with Ethibond sutures for later. The humeral head was delivered out of the wound. It was localized to the area of the anteroinferior glenoid region. The glenoid was then inspected, and noted to be intact. The fracture was at the level of the surgical neck on the proximal humerus. The canal was repaired with the broaches. An #8 stem was chosen as it was going to be cemented into place. The trial stem was impacted into position and the shaft of the bone marked with the cautery to the appropriate retroversion. Trial reduction was performed. The 48 x 21 mm head was the most appropriate size, matching the patient's as well as the soft tissue tension on the shoulder. At this point, the wound was copiously irrigated with gentamycin solution. The canal was copiously irrigated as well and suctioned dry. Methyl methacrylate cement was mixed. The cement gun was filled and the canal was filled with the cement. The #8 stem was then impacted into place and held in the position in the appropriate retroversion until the cement had cured. Excess cement was removed by sharp dissection. Prior to cementation of the stem, a hole was drilled in the shaft of proximal humerus and #2 fiber wires were placed through this hole for closure later. Once the cement was cured, the modular head was impacted on to the Morse taper. It was stable and the shoulder was reduced. The lesser tuberosity was then reapproximated back to the original site utilizing the #2 fiber wire suture that was placed in the humeral shaft as well as the holes in the humeral implant. The greater tuberosity portion with rotator cuff was also attached to the implant as well as the shaft of the humerus utilizing #2 fiber wires as well. The rotator interval was closed with #2 fiber wire in an interrupted fashion. The biceps tendon was ________ within this closure. The wound was copiously irrigated with gentamycin solution, suctioned dry. The deltoid fascia was then approximated with interrupted #2-0 Vicryl suture. Subcutaneous layer was approximated with interrupted #2-0 Vicryl and skin approximated with staples. Subcutaneous tissues were infiltrated with 0.25% Marcaine solution. A bulky dressing was applied to the wound followed by application of a large arm sling. Circulatory status was intact in the extremity at the completion of the case. The patient was then transferred to recovery room in apparent satisfactory condition."

Cervical spondylotic myelopathy. OPERATIVE PROCEDURES 1. Radical anterior discectomy, C3-C4 with removal of posterior osteophytes, foraminotomies, and decompression of the spinal canal (CPT 63075). 2. Radical anterior discectomy C4-C5 with removal of posterior osteophytes, foraminotomies, and decompression of the spinal canal (CPT 63076). 3. Anterior cervical fusion, C3-C4 (CPT 22554) 4. Anterior cervical fusion, C4-C5 (CPT 22585). 5. Utilization of allograft for purposes of spinal fusion (CPT 20931). 6. Application of anterior cervical locking plate C3-C5 (CPT 22845). ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal. COMPLICATIONS: None. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 250 cc. OPERATIVE INDICATIONS: The patient is a 50-year-old gentleman who presented to the hospital after a fall, presenting with neck and arm pain as well as weakness. His MRI confirmed significant neurologic compression in the cervical spine, combined with a clinical exam consistent with radiculopathy, myelopathy, and weakness. We discussed the diagnosis and the treatment options. Due to the severity of his neurologic symptoms as well as the amount of neurologic compression seen radiographically, I recommended that he proceed with surgical intervention as opposed to standard nonsurgical treatment such as physical therapy, medications, and steroid injections. I explained the surgery itself which will be to remove pressure from the spinal cord via anterior cervical discectomy and fusion at C3-C4 and C4-C5. We reviewed the surgery itself as well as risks including infection and blood vessels or nerves, leakage of spinal fluid, weakness or paralysis, failure of the pain to improve, possible worsening of the pain, failure of the neurologic symptoms to improve, possible worsening of the neurologic symptoms, and possible need for further surgery including re-revision and/or removal. Furthermore I explained that the fusion may not become solid or that the hardware could break. We discussed various techniques available for obtaining fusion and I recommended allograft and plate fixation. I explained the rationale for this as well as the options of using his own bone. Furthermore, I explained that removing motion at the fusion sites will transfer stress to other disc levels possibly accelerating there degeneration and causing additional symptoms and/or necessitating additional surgery in the future. OPERATIVE TECHNIQUE: After obtaining the appropriate signed and informed consent, the patient was taken to the operating room, where he underwent general endotracheal anesthesia without complications. He was then positioned supine on the operating table, and all bony prominences were padded. Pulse oximetry was maintained on both feet throughout the case. The arms were carefully padded and tucked at his sides. A roll was placed between the shoulder blades. The areas of the both ears were sterilely prepped and cranial tongs were applied in routine fashion. Ten pounds of traction was applied. A needle was taped to the anterior neck and an x-ray was done to determine the appropriate level for the skin incision. The entire neck was then sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion. A transverse skin incision was made and carried down to the platysma muscle. This was then split in line with its fibers. Blunt dissection was carried down medial to the carotid sheath and lateral to the trachea and esophagus until the anterior cervical spine was visualized. A needle was placed into a disc and an x-ray was done to determine its location. The longus colli muscles were then elevated bilaterally with the electrocautery unit. Self-retaining retractors were placed deep to the longus colli muscle in an effort to avoid injury to the sympathetic chains. Radical anterior discectomies were performed at C3-C4 and C4-C5. This included complete removal of the anterior annulus, nucleus, and posterior annulus. The posterior longitudinal ligament was removed as were the posterior osteophytes. Foraminotomies were then accomplished bilaterally. Once all of this was accomplished, the blunt-tip probe was used to check for any residual compression. The central canal was wide open at each level as were the foramen. A high-speed bur was used to remove the cartilaginous endplates above and below each interspace. Bleeding cancellous bone was exposed. The disc spaces were measured and appropriate size allografts were placed sterilely onto the field. After further shaping of the grafts with the high-speed bur, they were carefully impacted in to position. There was good juxtaposition against the bleeding decorticated surfaces and good distraction of each interspace. All weight was then removed from the crania tongs. The appropriate size anterior cervical locking plate was chosen and bent into gentle lordosis. Two screws were then placed into each of the vertebral bodies at C3, C4, and C5. There was excellent purchase. A final x-ray was done confirming good position of the hardware and grafts. The locking screws were then applied, also with excellent purchase. Following a final copious irrigation, there was good hemostasis and no dural leaks. The carotid pulse was strong. A drain was placed deep to the level of the platysma muscle and left at the level of the hardware. The wounds were then closed in layers using 4-0 Vicryl suture for the platysma muscle, 4-0 Vicryl suture for the subcutaneous tissue, and 4-0 Vicryl suture in a subcuticular skin closure. Steri-Strips were placed followed by application of a sterile dressing. The drain was hooked to bulb suction. A Philadelphia collar was applied. The cranial tongs were carefully removed. The soft tissue overlying the puncture site was massaged to free it up from the underlying bone. There was good hemostasis. The patient was then carefully returned to the supine position on his hospital bed where he was reversed and extubated and taken to the recovery room having tolerated the procedure well."
436,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Displaced left subtrochanteric femur fracture. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Displaced left subtrochanteric femur fracture. OPERATION: Intramedullary rod in the left hip using the Synthes trochanteric fixation nail measuring 11 x 130 degrees with an 85-mm helical blade. COMPLICATIONS: None. TOURNIQUET TIME: None. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 50 mL. ANESTHESIA: General. INDICATIONS: The patient suffered a fall at which time she was taken to the emergency room with pain in the lower extremities. She was diagnosed with displaced left subcapital hip fracture, now was asked to consult. With this diagnosis, she was indicated the above-noted procedure. This procedure as well as alternatives to this procedure was discussed at length with the patient and her son, who has the power of attorney, and they understood them well. Risks and benefits were also discussed. Risks include bleeding, infection, damage to blood vessels, damage to nerves, risk of further surgery, chronic pain, restricted range of motion, risk of continued discomfort, risk of malunion, risk of nonunion, risk of need for further reconstructive procedures, risk of need for altered activities and altered gait, risk of blood clots, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, and risk of death were discussed. She understood these well and consented, and the son signed the consent for the procedure as described. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was placed on the operating table and general anesthesia was achieved. The patient was then placed in fracture boots and manipulated under fluoroscopic control until we could obtain near anatomic alignment. External positions were felt to be present. At this point, the left hip and left lower extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner. A guidewire was then placed percutaneously into the tip of the greater trochanter and a small incision was made overlying the guidewire. An overlying drill was inserted to the proper depths. A Synthes 11 x 130 degrees trochanteric fixation that was chosen was placed into the intramedullary canal to the proper depth. Proper rotation was obtained and the guide for the helical blade was inserted. A small incision was made for this as well. A guidewire was inserted and felt to be in proper position, in the posterior aspect of the femoral head, lateral, and the center position on AP. This placed the proper depths and lengths better. The outer cortex was enlarged and an 85-mm helical blade was attached to the proper depths and proper fixation was done. Appropriate size screw was then tightened down. At this point, a distal guide was then placed and drilled across both the cortices. Length was better. Appropriate size screw was then inserted. Proper size and fit of the distal screw was also noted. At this point, on fluoroscopic control, it was confirming in AP and lateral direction. We did a near anatomical alignment to the fracture site and all hardware was properly fixed. Proper size and fit was noted. Excellent bony approximation was noted. At this point, both wounds were thoroughly irrigated, hemostasis confirmed, and closure was then begun. The fascial layers were then reapproximated using #1 Vicryl in a figure-of-eight manner, the subcutaneous tissues were reapproximated in layers using #1 and 2-0 Vicryl sutures, and the skin was reapproximated with staples. The area was then infiltrated with a mixture of a 0.25% Marcaine with Epinephrine and 1% plain lidocaine. Sterile dressing was then applied. No complication was encountered throughout the procedure. The patient tolerated the procedure well. The patient was taken to the recovery room in stable condition."

She is presenting today for release of the first dorsal extensor compartment. She is aware of the risks, benefits, alternatives and has consented to this operation. PROCEDURE: The patient was given intravenous prophylactic antibiotics. She was taken to the operating suite under the auspices of Anesthesiology. She was given a left upper extremity bier block. Her left upper extremity was then prepped and draped in the normal fashion with Betadine solution. Afterwards, a transverse incision was made over the extensor retinaculum of the first dorsal extensor compartment. Dissection was carried down through the dermis into the subcutaneous tissue. The dorsal radial sensory branches were kept out of harm's way. They were retracted gently to the ulnar side of the wrist. The retinaculum was incised with a #15 scalpel blade in the longitudinal fashion and the retinaculum was released completely both proximally and distally. Both the extensor pollices brevis and abductor pollices longus tendons were identified. There was no pathology noted within the first dorsal extensor compartment. The wound was irrigated. Hemostasis was obtained with bipolar cautery. The wound was infiltrated with _0.25% Marcaine solution and then closure performed with #6-0 nylon suture utilizing a horizontal mattress stitch. Sterile occlusive dressing was applied along with the thumb spica splint. The tourniquet was released and the patient was transported to the recovery area in stable and satisfactory condition."

Polyethylene exchange, left knee. COMPLICATION: None. TOURNIQUET TIME: 58 minutes. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal. ANESTHESIA: General. INDICATIONS: This patient underwent an uncomplicated left total knee replacement. Postoperatively, unfortunately did not follow up with PT/INR blood test and he was taking Coumadin. His INR was seemed to elevated and developed hemarthrosis. Initially, it did look very benign, although over the last 24 hours it did become irritable and inflamed, and he therefore was indicated with the above-noted procedure. This procedure as well as alternatives was discussed in length with the patient and he understood them well. Risks and benefits were also discussed. Risks such as bleeding, infection, damage to blood vessels, damage to nerve roots, need for further surgeries, chronic pain with range of motion, risk of continued discomfort, risk of need for further reconstructive procedures, risk of need for total knee revision, risk of blood clots, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, and risk of death were discussed. He understood them well. All questions were answered and he signed consent for the procedure as described. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was placed on operating table and general anesthesia was achieved. The left lower extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner. The leg was elevated and the tourniquet was inflated to 325 mmHg. A longitudinal incision was then made and carried down through subcutaneous tissues. This was made through the prior incision site. There were some fatty necrotic tissues through the incision region and all necrotic tissue was debrided sharply on both sides of the incision site. Medial and lateral flaps were then made. The prior suture was identified, the suture removed and then a medial parapatellar arthrotomy was then performed. Effusion within the knee was noted. All hematoma was evacuated. I then did flex the knee and removed the polyethylene. Once the polyethylene was removed I did irrigate the knee with total of 9 liters of antibiotic solution. Further debridement was performed of all inflamed tissue and thickened synovial tissue. A 6 x 16-mm Stryker polyethylene was then snapped back in position. The knee has excellent stability in all planes and I did perform a light manipulation to improve the flexion of the knee. Further irrigation was performed on the all soft tissue in the knee with additional 3 liters of normal saline. The knee was placed in a flexed position and the extensor mechanism was reapproximated using #2 Ethibond suture in a figure-of-eight manner. The subcutaneous tissue was reapproximated in layers using #1 and 2-0 Vicryl sutures, and the skin was reapproximated using staples. Prior to closure a Hemovac drain was inserted through a superolateral approach into the knee joint. No complications were encountered throughout the procedure, and the patient tolerated the procedure well. The patient was taken to recovery room in stable condition."

440,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Right shoulder rotator cuff tear. 2. Glenohumeral rotator cuff arthroscopy. 3. Degenerative joint disease. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Right shoulder rotator cuff tear. 2. Glenohumeral rotator cuff arthroscopy. 3. Degenerative joint disease. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Right shoulder hemiarthroplasty. ANESTHESIA: General. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Approximately 125 cc. COMPLICATIONS: None. COMPONENTS: A DePuy 10 mm global shoulder system stem was used cemented and a DePuy 44 x 21 mm articulating head was used. BRIEF HISTORY: The patient is an 82-year-old right-hand dominant female who presents for shoulder pain for many years now and affecting her daily living and function and pain is becoming unbearable failing conservative treatment. PROCEDURE: The patient was taken to the operative suite, placed on the operative field. Department of Anesthesia administered general anesthetic. Once adequately sedated, the patient was placed in the beach chair position. Care was ensured that she was well positioned, adequately secured and padded. At this point, the right upper extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. A deltopectoral approach was used and taken down to the skin with a #15 blade scalpel. At this point, blunt dissection with Mayo scissors was used to come to the overlying subscapular tendon and bursal tissue. Any perforating bleeders were cauterized with Bovie to obtain hemostasis. Once the bursa was seen, it was removed with a Rongeur and subscapular tendon could be easily visualized. At this point, the rotator cuff in the subacromial region was evaluated. There was noted to be a large rotator cuff, which was irreparable. There was eburnated bone on the greater tuberosity noted. The articular surface could be visualized. The biceps tendon was intact. There was noted to be diffuse discolored synovium around this as well as some fraying of the tendon in the intraarticular surface. The under surface of the acromion, it was felt there was mild ware on this as well. At this point, the subscapular tendon was then taken off using Bovie cautery and Metzenbaum scissors that was tied with Metzenbaum suture. It was separated from the capsule to have a two layered repair at closure. The capsule was also reflected posterior. At this point, the glenoid surface could be easily visualized. It was evaluated and had good cartilage contact and appeared to be intact. The humeral head was evaluated. There was noted to be ware of the cartilage and eburnated bone particularly in the central portion of the humeral head. At this point, decision was made to proceed with the arthroplasty, since the rotator cuff tear was irreparable and there was significant ware of the humoral head. The arm was adequately positioned. An oscillating saw was used to make the head articular cut. This was done at the margin of the articular surface with the anatomic neck. This was taken down to appropriate level until this articular surface was adequately removed. At this point, the intramedullary canal and cancellous bone could be easily visualized. The opening hand reamers were then used and this was advanced to a size #10. Under direct visualization, this was performed easily. At this point, the 10 x 10 proximal flange cutter was then inserted and impacted into place to cut grooves for the fins. This was then removed. A trial component was then impacted into place, which did fit well and trial heads were then sampled and it was felt that a size 44 x 21 mm head gave us the best fit and appeared adequately secured. It did not appear overstuffed with evidence of excellent range of motion and no impingement. At this point, the trial component was removed. Wound was copiously irrigated and suctioned dry. Cement was then placed with a cement gun into the canal and taken up to the level of the cut. The prosthesis was then inserted into place and held under direct visualization. All excess cement was removed and care was ensured that no cement was left in the posterior aspect of the joint itself. This _______ cement was adequately hard at this point. The final component of the head was impacted into place, secured on the Morris taper and checked, and this was reduced. The final component was then taken through range of motion and found to have excellent stability and was satisfied with its position. The wound was again copiously irrigated and suctioned dry. At this point, the capsule was then reattached to its insertion site in the anterior portion. Once adequately sutured with #1-Vicryl, attention was directed to the subscapular. The subscapular was advanced superiorly and anchored not only to the biceps tendon region, but also to the top anterior portion of the greater tuberosity. This was opened to allow some type of coverage points of the massive rotator cuff tear. This was secured to the tissue and interosseous sutures with size #2 fiber wire. After this was adequately secured, the wound was again copiously irrigated and suctioned dry. The deltoid fascial split was then repaired using interrupted #2-0 Vicryl, subcutaneous tissue was then approximated using interrupted #24-0 Vicryl, skin was approximated using a running #4-0 Vicryl. Steri-Strips and Adaptic, 4 x 4s, and ABDs were then applied. The patient was then placed in a sling and transferred back to the gurney, reversed by Department of Anesthesia. DISPOSITION: The patient tolerated well and transferred to Postanesthesia Care Unit in satisfactory condition."
441,Orthopedic," This is a middle-aged female with moderate pain, severe swelling and a growth on the arm which is reportedly enlarging with limited range of motion for three months. FINDINGS: There is diffuse subcutis space edema extending along the posteromedial aspect of the elbow adjacent to the medial epicondyle, extending to the olecranon process and along the superficial aspect of the epicondylo-olecranon ligament. There is no demonstrated solid, cystic or lipomatous mass lesion. There is enlargement with hyperintense signal of the ulnar nerve within the cubital tunnel. There is inflammation with mild laxity of the epicondylo-olecranon ligament. The combined findings are most consistent with a ulnar nerve neuritis possibly secondary to a subluxing ulnar nerve however the ulnar nerve at this time is within the cubital tunnel. There is no accessory muscle within the cubital tunnel. The common flexor tendon origin is normal. Normal ulnar collateral ligamentous complex. There is mild epimysial sheath edema of the pronator teres muscle consistent with a mild epimysial sheath sprain but no muscular tear. There is minimal intratendinous inflammation of the common extensor tendon origin consistent with a mild tendinitis. There is no demonstrated common extensor tendon tear. Normal radial collateral ligamentous complex. Normal radiocapitellum and ulnotrochlear articulations. Normal triceps and biceps tendon insertions. There is peritendinous inflammation of the brachialis tendon insertion but an intrinsically normal tendon. IMPRESSION: Edema of the subcutis adipose space overlying the posteromedial aspect of the elbow with interstitial inflammation of the epicondylo-olecranon ligament. Enlarged edematous ulnar nerve most compatible with ulnar nerve neuritis. The above combined findings suggest a subluxing ulnar nerve. Mild epimysial sheath strain of the pronator teres muscle but no muscular tear. Mild lateral epicondylitis with focal tendinitis of the origin of the common extensor tendon. Peritendinous edema of the brachialis tendon insertion. No solid, cystic or lipomatous mass lesion."

443,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Idiopathic toe walker. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Idiopathic toe walker. PROCEDURE: Bilateral open Achilles lengthening with placement of short leg walking cast. ANESTHESIA: Surgery performed under general anesthesia. A total of 10 mL of 0.5% Marcaine local anesthetic was used. COMPLICATIONS: No intraoperative complications. DRAINS: None. SPECIMENS: None. TOURNIQUET TIME: On the left side was 30 minutes, on the right was 21 minutes. HISTORY AND PHYSICAL: The patient is a 10-year-old boy who has been a toe walker since he started ambulating at about a year. The patient had some mild hamstring tightness with his popliteal angle of approximately 20 degrees bilaterally. He does not walk with a crouched gait but does toe walk. Given his tightness, surgery versus observation was recommended to the family. Family however wanted to correct his toe walking. Surgery was then discussed. Risks of surgery include risks of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremities, failure to resolve toe walking, possible stiffness, cast, and cast problems. All questions were answered and parents agreed to above surgical plan. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating table General anesthesia was then administered. The patient received Ancef preoperatively. The patient was then subsequently placed prone with all bony prominences padded. Two bilateral nonsterile tourniquets were placed on each thigh. Both extremities were then prepped and draped in a standard surgical fashion. We turned our attention first towards the left side. A planned incision of 1 cm medial to the Achilles tendon was marked on the skin. The extremity was wrapped in Esmarch prior to inflation of tourniquet to 250 mmHg. Incision was then made and carried down through subcutaneous fat down to the tendon sheath. Achilles tendon was identified and Z-lengthening was done with the medial distal half cut. Once Z-lengthening was completed proximally, the length of the Achilles tendon was then checked. This was trimmed to obtain an end-on-end repair with 0 Ethibond suture. This was also oversewn. Wound was then irrigated. Achilles tendon sheath was reapproximated using 2-0 Vicryl as well as the subcutaneous fat. The skin was closed using 4-0 Monocryl. Once the wound was cleaned and dried and dressed with Steri-Strips and Xeroform, the area was injected with 0.5% Marcaine. It was then dressed with 4 x 4 and Webril. Tourniquet was released at 30 minutes. The same procedure was repeated on the right side with tourniquet time of 21 minutes. While the patient was still prone, two short-leg walking casts were then placed. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was subsequently flipped supine on to hospital gurney and taken to PACU in stable condition. POSTOPERATIVE PLAN: The patient will be discharged on the day of surgery. He may weightbear as tolerated in his cast, which he will have for about 4 to 6 weeks. He is to follow up in approximately 10 days for recheck as well as prescription for intended AFOs, which he will need up to 6 months. The patient may or may not need physical therapy while his Achilles lengthenings are healing. The patient is not to participate in any PE for at least 6 months. The patient is given Tylenol No. 3 for pain."

445,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Plantar flex third metatarsal, right foot. 2. Talus bunion, right foot. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Plantar flex third metatarsal, right foot. 2. Talus bunion, right foot. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: 1. Third metatarsal osteotomy, right foot. 2. Talus bunionectomy, right foot. 3. Application of short-leg cast, right foot. ANESTHESIA: TIVA/local. HISTORY: This 31-year-old female presents to ABCD Preoperative Holding Area after keeping herself n.p.o., since mid night for surgery on her painful right third plantar flex metatarsal. In addition, she complains of a painful right talus bunion to the right foot. She has tried conservative methods such as wide shoes and serial debridement and accommodative padding, all of which provided inadequate relief. At this time she desires to attempt a surgical correction. The risks versus benefits of the procedure have been explained to the patient by Dr. X and the consent is available on the chart for review. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: After IV was established by the Department Of Anesthesia, the patient was taken to the operating room via cart. She was placed on the operating table in supine position and a safety strap was placed across her waist for retraction. Next, copious amounts of Webril were applied around the right ankle and a pneumatic ankle tourniquet was applied. Next, after adequate IV sedation was administered by the Department Of Anesthesia, a total of 10 cc mixture of 4.5 cc of 1% lidocaine/4.5 cc of 0.5% Marcaine/1 cc of Kenalog was injected into the right foot in an infiltrative type block. Next, the foot was prepped and draped in the usual aseptic fashion. An Esmarch bandage was used to exsanguinate the foot and the pneumatic ankle tourniquet was elevated to 250 mmHg. Next, the foot was lowered in the operative field and attention was directed to the dorsal third metatarsal area. There was a plantar hyperkeratotic lesion and a plantar flex palpable third metatarsal head. A previous cicatrix was noted with slight hypertrophic scarring. Using a #10 blade, a lazy S-type incision was created over the dorsal aspect of the third metatarsal, approximately 3.5 cm in length. Two semi-elliptical converging incisions were made over the hypertrophic scar and it was removed and passed off as a specimen. Next, the #15 blade was used to deepen the incision down to the subcutaneous tissue. Any small traversing veins were ligated with electrocautery. Next, a combination of blunt and sharp dissection were used to undermine the long extensor tendon, which was tacked down with a moderate amount of fibrosis and fibrotic scar tissue. Next, the extensor tendon was retracted laterally and the deep fascia over the metatarsals was identified. A linear incision down to bone was made with a #15 blade to the capsuloperiosteal tissues. Next, the capsuloperiosteal tissues were elevated using a sharp dissection with a #15 blade, off of the third metatarsal. McGlamry elevator was carefully inserted around the head of the metatarsal and freed and all the plantar adhesions were freed. A moderate amount of plantar adhesions were encountered. The third toe was plantar flex and the third metatarsal was delivered into the wound. Next, a V-shaped osteotomy with an apex distally was created using a sagittal saw. The metatarsal head was allowed to float. The wound was flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline. #3-0 Vicryl was used to close the capsuloperiosteal tissues, which kept the metatarsal head contained. Next, #4-0 Vicryl was used to close the subcutaneous layer in a simple interrupted suture technique. Next, #4-0 nylon was used to close the skin in a simple interrupted technique. Attention was directed to the right fifth metatarsal. There was a large palpable hypertrophic prominence, which is the area of maximal pain, which the patient complained of preoperatively. A #10 blade was used to make a 3 cm incision through the skin. Next, a #15 blade was used to deepen the incision through the subcutaneous tissue. Next, the medial and lateral aspects were undermined. The abductor tendon was identified and retracted. A capsuloperiosteal incision was made with a #15 blade in a linear fashion down to the bone. The capsuloperiosteal tissues were elevated off the bone with a Freer elevator and a #15 blade. Next, the sagittal saw was used to resect the large hypertrophic dorsal exostosis. A reciprocating rasp was used to smooth all bony prominences. The wound was flushed with copious amount of sterile saline. #3-0 Vicryl was used to close the capsuloperiosteal tissues. #4-0 Vicryl was used to close subcutaneous layer with a simple interrupted suture. Next, #4-0 nylon was used to close the skin in a simple interrupted technique. Next, attention was directed to the plantar aspect of the third metatarsal where a bursal sac was felt to be palpated under the plantar flex third metatarsal head. A #15 blade was used to make a small linear incision under the third metatarsal head. The incision was deepened through the dermal layer and curved hemostats and Metzenbaum scissors were used to undermine the skin from the underlying bursa. The wound was flushed and two simple interrupted sutures with #4-0 nylon were applied. Standard postoperative dressing was applied consisting of Xeroform, 4x4s, Kerlix, Kling, and Coban. The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted to the digits. A sterile stockinet was placed on the toes just below the knee. Copious amounts of Webril were placed on all bony prominences. 3 inch and 4 inch fiberglass cast tape was used to create a below the knee well-padded, well-moulded cast. One was able to insert two fingers to the distal and proximal aspects of the _cast. The capillary refill time to the digits was less than three seconds after cast application. The patient tolerated the above anesthesia and procedures without complications. She was transported via cart to the Postanesthesia Care Unit with vital signs stable and vascular status intact to the right foot. She was given standard postoperative instructions to rest, ice and elevate her right foot. She was counseled on smoking cessation. She was given Vicoprofen #30 1 p.o. q.4-6h p.r.n., pain. She was given Keflex #30 1 p.o. t.i.d. She is to follow up with Dr. X on Monday. She is to be full weightbearing with a cast boot. She was given emergency contact numbers to call us if problem arises."
446,Orthopedic," CHIEF COMPLAINT: Right middle finger triggering and locking, as well as right index finger soreness at the PIP joint. HISTORY OF OCCUPATIONAL INJURY OR ILLNESS: The patient has been followed elsewhere, and we reviewed his records. Essentially, he has had a trigger finger and a mucocyst, and he has had injections. This has been going on for several months. He is now here for active treatment because the injections were not helpful, nonoperative treatment has not worked, and he would like to move forward in order to prevent this from keeping on locking and causing his pain. He is referred over here for evaluation regarding that. SIGNIFICANT PAST MEDICAL AND SURGICAL HISTORY: General health/review of systems: See H&P. Allergies: See H&P. Medications: See H&P. Social History: See H&P. Family History: See H&P. Previous Hospitalizations: See H&P. CLINICAL ASSESSMENT AND FINDINGS: Musculoskeletal: Shows point tenderness to palpation to the right middle finger A1 pulley. The right index finger has some small soreness at the PIP joint, but at this time no obvious mucocyst. He has flexion/extension of his fingers intact. There is no crepitation at the wrist, forearm, elbow or shoulder with full range of motion. Contralateral arm exam for comparison reveals no focal findings. Neurological: APB, EPL and first dorsal interosseous 5/5. LABORATORY, RADIOGRAPHIC, AND/OR IMAGING TESTS ORDERS & RESULTS: Special lab studies: CLINICAL IMPRESSION: 1. Tendinitis, left middle finger. 2. PIP joint synovitis and mucocyst, but controlled on nonoperative treatment. 3. Middle finger trigger, failed nonoperative treatment, requiring a trigger finger release to the right middle finger. EVALUATION/TREATMENT PLAN: Risks, benefits and alternatives were discussed. All questions were answered. No guarantees were made. We will schedule for surgery. We would like to move forward in order to help him significantly improve since he has failed injections. All questions were answered. Followup appointment was given."
447,Orthopedic," EXAM: Noncontrast CT scan of the lumbar spine REASON FOR EXAM: Left lower extremity muscle spasm. COMPARISONS: None. FINDINGS: Transaxial thin slice CT images of the lumbar spine were obtained with sagittal and coronal reconstructions on emergency basis, as requested. No abnormal paraspinal masses are identified. There are sclerotic changes with anterior effusion of the sacroiliac joints bilaterally. There is marked intervertebral disk space narrowing at the L5-S1 level with intervertebral disk vacuum phenomenon and advanced endplate degenerative changes. Posterior disk osteophyte complex is present, most marked in the left paracentral to lateral region extending into the lateral recess on the left. This most likely will affect the S1 nerve root on the left. There are posterior hypertrophic changes extending into the neural foramina bilaterally inferiorly. There is mild neural foraminal stenosis present. Small amount of extruded disk vacuum phenomenon is present on the left in the region of the exiting nerve root. There is facet sclerosis bilaterally. Mild lateral recess stenosis just on the right, there is prominent anterior spondylosis. At the L4-5 level, mild bilateral facet arthrosis is present. There is broad based posterior annular disk bulging or protrusion, which mildly effaces the anterior aspect of the thecal sac and extends into the inferior aspect of the neural foramina bilaterally. No moderate or high-grade central canal or neural foraminal stenosis is identified. At the L3-4 level anterior spondylosis is present. There are endplate degenerative changes with mild posterior annular disk bulging, but no evidence of moderate or high-grade central canal or neural foraminal stenosis. At the L2-3 level, there is mild bilateral ligamentum flavum hypertrophy. Mild posterior annular disk bulging is present without evidence of moderate or high-grade central canal or neural foraminal stenosis. At the T12-L1 and L1-2 levels, there is no evidence of herniated disk protrusion, central canal, or neural foraminal stenosis. There is arteriosclerotic vascular calcification of the abdominal aorta and iliac arteries without evidence of aneurysm or dilatation. No bony destructive changes or acute fractures are identified. CONCLUSIONS: 1. Advanced degenerative disk disease at the L5-S1 level. 2. Probable chronic asymmetric herniated disk protrusion with peripheral calcification at the L5-S1 level, laterally in the left paracentral region extending into the lateral recess causing lateral recess stenosis. 3. Mild bilateral neural foraminal stenosis at the L5-S1 level. 4. Posterior disk bulging at the L2-3, L3-4, and L4-5 levels without evidence of moderate or high-grade central canal stenosis. 5. Facet arthrosis to the lower lumbar spine. 6. Arteriosclerotic vascular disease."
448,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome. PROCEDURES: 1. Right open carpal tunnel release. 2. Cortisone injection, left carpal tunnel. ANESTHESIA: General LMA. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal. COMPLICATIONS: None. INDICATIONS: This patient is a 50-year-old male with bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome, which is measured out as severe. He is scheduled for the above-mentioned procedures. The planned procedures were discussed with the patient including the associated risks. The risks included but are not limited to bleeding, infection, nerve damage, failure to heal, possible need for reoperation, possible recurrence, or any associated risk of the anesthesia. He voiced understanding and agreed to proceed as planned. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was identified in the holding area and correct operative site was identified by the surgeon's mark. Informed consent was obtained. The patient was then brought to the operating room and transferred to the operating table in supine position. Time-out was then performed at which point the surgeon, nursing staff, and anesthesia staff all confirmed the correct identification. After adequate general LMA anesthesia was obtained, a well-padded tourniquet was placed on the patient's right upper arm. The right upper extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. Planned skin incision was marked along the base of the patient's right palm. Right upper extremity was then exsanguinated using Esmarch. The tourniquet was then inflated to 250 mmHg. Skin incision was then made and dissection was carried down with scalpel to the level of the palmar fascia which was sharply divided by the skin incision. Bleeding points were identified with electrocautery using bipolar electrocautery. Retractors were then placed to allow visualization of the distal extent of the transverse carpal ligament, and this was then divided longitudinally under direct vision. Baby Metzenbaum scissors were used to dissect distal to this area to confirm the absence of any remaining crossing obstructing fibrous band. Retractors were then replaced proximally to allow visualization of proximal extent of the transverse carpal ligament and the release was continued proximally until complete release was performed. This was confirmed by visually and palpably. Next, baby Metzenbaum scissors were used to dissect anteroposterior adjacent antebrachial fascia, and this was divided longitudinally under direct vision using baby Metzenbaum scissors to a level of approximately 3 cm proximal to the proximal extent of the skin incision. Carpal canal was then inspected. The median nerve was flattened and injected. No other abnormalities were noted. Wounds were then irrigated with normal saline and antibiotic additive. Decadron 4 mg was then placed adjacent to the median nerve. Skin incision was then closed with interrupted 5-0 nylon suture. The wound was then dressed with Adaptic, 4 x 4s, Kling, and Coban. The tourniquet was then deflated. Attention was then directed to the left side. Using sterile technique, the left carpal canal was injected with a mixture of 40 mg of Depo-Medrol, 1 cc of 1% lidocaine, and 1 cc of 0.25% Marcaine. Band-Aid was then placed over the injection site. The patient was then awakened, extubated, and transferred over to his hospital bed. He was transported to recovery room in stable condition. There were no intraoperative or immediate postoperative complications. All counts were reported as correct."
449,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Acetabular fracture on the left posterior column/transverse posterior wall variety with an accompanying displaced fracture of the intertrochanteric variety to the left hip. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Acetabular fracture on the left posterior column/transverse posterior wall variety with an accompanying displaced fracture of the intertrochanteric variety to the left hip. PROCEDURES: 1. Osteosynthesis of acetabular fracture on the left, complex variety. 2. Total hip replacement. ANESTHESIA: General. COMPLICATIONS: None. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient in the left side up lateral position under adequate general endotracheal anesthesia, the patient's left lower extremity and buttock area were prepped with iodine and alcohol in the usual fashion, draped with sterile towels and drapes so as to create a sterile field. Kocher Langenbeck variety incision was utilized and carried down through the fascia lata with the split fibers of the gluteus maximus in line. The femoral insertion of gluteus maximus was tenotomized close to its femoral insertion. The piriformis and obturator internus tendons and adjacent gemelli were tenotomized close to their femoral insertion, tagged, and retractor was placed in the lesser notch as well as a malleable retractor in the greater notch enabling the exposure of the posterior column. The major transverse fracture was freed of infolded soft tissue, clotted blood, and lavaged copiously with sterile saline solution and then reduced anatomically with the aid of bone hook in the notch and provisionally stabilized utilizing a tenaculum clamp and definitively stabilized utilizing a 7-hole 3.5 mm reconstruction plate with the montage including two interfragmentary screws. It should be mentioned that prior to reduction and stabilization of the acetabular fracture its femoral head component was removed from the joint enabling direct visualization of the articular surface. Once a stable fixation of the reduced fracture of the acetabulum was accomplished, it should be mentioned that in the process of doing this, the posterior wall fragment was hinged on its soft tissue attachments and a capsulotomy was made in the capsule in line with the rent at the level of the posterior wall. Once this was accomplished, the procedure was turned over to Dr. X and his team, who proceeded with placement of cup and femoral components as well and cup was preceded by placement of a trabecular metal tray for the cup with screw fixation of same. This will be dictated in separate note. The patient tolerated the procedure well. The sciatic nerve was well protected and directly visualized to the level of the notch."

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS AND HOSPITAL COURSE: For details, please refer to clinic notes and OP notes. In brief, the patient is a 47-year-old female with a posttraumatic AV in the right femoral head. She came in consult with Dr. X who after reviewing the clinical and radiological findings recommended she undergo a right total hip arthroplasty and removal of old hardware. After being explained the risks, benefits, alternative options, and possible outcomes of surgery, she was agreeable and consented to proceed and therefore on the day of her admission, she was sent to the operating room where she underwent a right total hip arthroplasty and removal of hardware without any complications. She was then transferred to PACU for recovery and postop orthopedic floor for convalescence, physical therapy, and discharge planning. DVT prophylaxis was initiated with Lovenox. Postop pain was adequately managed with the aid of Acute Pain team. Postop acute blood loss anemia was treated with blood transfusions to an adequate level of hemoglobin. Physical therapy and occupational therapy were initiated and continued to work with her towards discharge clearance on the day of her discharge. DISPOSITION: Home. On the day of her discharge, she was afebrile, vital signs were stable. She was in no acute distress. Her right hip incision was clean, dry, and intact. Extremity was warm and well perfused. Compartments were soft. Capillary refill less than two seconds. Distal pulses were present. PREDISCHARGE LABORATORY FINDINGS: White count of 10.9, hemoglobin of 9.5, and BMP is pending. DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: Continue diet as before. ACTIVITY: Weightbearing as tolerated in the right lower extremity as instructed. Do not lift, drive, move furniture, do strenuous activity for six weeks.

451,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left distal radius fracture displaced. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left distal radius fracture displaced. SURGERY: Closed reduction and placement of long-arm cast, CPT code 25605. ANESTHESIA: General LMA. FINDINGS: The patient was found to have a displaced fracture. She was found to be in perfect alignment after closed reduction and placement of cast. The radial deviation was well corrected. INDICATIONS: The patient is 5 years old. She was seen in our office today 1 week after being placed into a cast for a displaced fracture. She was noted to have significant loss of alignment especially on the lateral view. She was indicated for closed reduction and placed of the long-arm cast. Risks and benefits were discussed at length with the family. They wished to proceed. PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table in supine position. General anesthesia was induced without incident. Previous cast was previously removed. An arm was approached and a closed reduction was performed. This was checked under AP and lateral projection and was found to be in adequate alignment. There was very mild residual dorsiflexion deformity noted. A long-arm cast was then placed with plaster and molding. Repeat x-rays demonstrated adequate alignment on both views. The cast was then reinforced with fiberglass. The patient was awakened from anesthesia and taken to recovery room in good condition. There were no complications. All instruments, sponge, and needle counts were correct at the end of case. PLAN: The patient will be discharged home. She will return in 3 weeks for cast removal and clinical examination. She would likely be placed into a wrist-guard at that time. She has a prescription for Tylenol with codeine elixir."

Station: No pronator drift. Romberg's test not documented. Gait: Unsteady wide-based. Able to TT and HW. Poor TW. Reflexes: 3/3 BUE. Hoffman's signs were present bilaterally. 4/4 patellae. 3+/3+ Achilles with 3-4 beat nonsustained clonus. Plantar responses were extensor on the right and flexor on the left. Gen. Exam: Unremarkable. COURSE: CBC, GS, PT, PTT, ESR, FT4, TSH, ANA, Vit B12, Folate, VDRL and Urinalysis were normal. MRI T-spine, 10/27/92, was unremarkable. MRI Brain, 10/28/92, revealed multiple areas of abnormally increased signal on T2 weighted images in the white matter regions of the right corpus callosum, periventricular region, brachium pontis and right pons. The appearance of the lesions was felt to be strongly suggestive of multiple sclerosis. 10/28/92, Lumbar puncture revealed the following CSF results: RBC 1, WBC 9 (8 lymphocytes, 1 histiocyte), Glucose 55mg/dl, Protein 46mg/dl (normal 15-45), CSF IgG 7.5mg/dl (normal 0.0-6.2), CSF IgG index 1.3 (normal 0.0-0.7), agarose gel electrophoresis revealed oligoclonal bands in the gamma region which were not seen on the serum sample. Beta-2 microglobulin was unremarkable. An abnormal left tibial somatosensory evoked potential was noted consistent with central conduction slowing. Visual and Brainstem Auditory evoked potentials were normal. HTLV-1 titers were negative. CSF cultures and cytology were negative. She was not treated with medications as her symptoms were primarily sensory and non-debilitating, and she was discharged home. She returned on 11/7/92 as her symptoms of RUE dysesthesia, lower extremity paresthesia and weakness, all worsened. On 11/6/92, she developed slow slurred speech and had marked difficulty expressing her thoughts. She also began having difficulty emptying her bladder. Her 11/7/92 exam was notable for normal vital signs, lying motionless with eyes open and nodding and rhythmically blinking every few minutes. She was oriented to place and time of day, but not to season, day of the week and she did not know who she was. She had a leftward gaze preference and right lower facial weakness. Her RLE was spastic with sustained ankle clonus. There was dysesthetic sensory perception in the RUE. Jaw jerk and glabellar sign were present. MRI brain, 11/7/92, revealed multiple enhancing lesions in the peritrigonal region and white matter of the centrum semiovale. The right peritrigonal region is more prominent than on prior study. The left centrum semiovale lesion has less enhancement than previously. Multiple other white matter lesions are demonstrated on the right side, in the posterior limb of the internal capsule, the anterior periventricular white matter, optic radiations and cerebellum. The peritrigonal lesions on both sides have increased in size since the 10/92 MRI. The findings were felt more consistent with demyelinating disease and less likely glioma. Post-viral encephalitis, Rapidly progressive demyelinating disease and tumor were in the differential diagnosis. Lumbar Puncture, 11/8/92, revealed: RBC 2, WBC 12 (12 lymphocytes), Glucose 57, Protein 51 (elevated), cytology and cultures were negative. HIV 1 titer was negative. Urine drug screen, negative. A stereotactic brain biopsy of the right parieto-occipital region was consistent with demyelinating disease. She was treated with Decadron 6mg IV qhours and Cytoxan 0.75gm/m2 (1.25gm). On 12/3/92, she has a focal motor seizure with rhythmic jerking of the LUE, loss of consciousness and rightward eye deviation. EEG revealed diffuse slowing with frequent right-sided sharp discharges. She was placed on Dilantin. She became depressed."
453,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: History of compartment syndrome, right lower extremity, status post 4 compartments fasciotomy, to do incision for compartment fasciotomy. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: History of compartment syndrome, right lower extremity, status post 4 compartments fasciotomy, to do incision for compartment fasciotomy. OPERATIONS: 1. Wound debridement x2, including skin, subcutaneous, and muscle. 2. Insertion of tissue expander to the medial wound. 3. Insertion of tissue expander to the lateral wound. COMPLICATIONS: None. TOURNIQUET: None. ANESTHESIA: General. INDICATIONS: This patient developed a compartment syndrome. She underwent 4 compartment fasciotomy with dual incision on medial and lateral aspect of the right lower leg. She was doing very well and was obviously improving. The swelling was reduced. A compartment pressure had obviously improved based on examination. She was therefore indicated for placement of tissue expander for ventral wound closure. The risks of procedure as well as alternatives of this procedure were discussed at length with the patient and he understood them well. Risks and benefits were all discussed, risk of bleeding, infection, damage to blood vessels, damage to nerve roots, need for further surgery, chronic pain with range of motion, risk of continued discomfort, risk of need for further reconstructive procedures, risk of blood clots, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, and risk of death were discussed. She understood them well. All questions were answered, and she signed the consent for the procedure as described. DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was placed on the operating table and general anesthesia was achieved. The medial wound was noted to be approximately 10.5 cm in length x 4 cm. The lateral wound was noted in approximately 14 cm in length x 5 x 5 cm in width. Both wounds were then thoroughly debrided. The debridement of both wounds included skin and subcutaneous tissue and nonviable muscle portion. This involve very small portion of muscle as well as skin edge and the subcutaneous tissue did require debridement on both sides. At this point adequate debridement was performed and healthy tissue did appear to be present. Initially on the medial wound I did place the DermaClose RC continuous external tissue expander. On the medial wound the 5 skin anchors were placed on each side of the wound and separated appropriately. I then did place the line loop from the tension controller in a lace like manner through the skin anchors and the tension controller was attached to the middle anchor. I then did place adequate tension on the sutures. Continued tension will be noted after engaging the tension controller. At this point I performed the similar procedure to the lateral wound. The skin anchors were placed separately and appropriately on either side of the skin margin. The line loop from the tension controller was placed in lace like manner through the skin anchors. The tension controller was then attached to the mid anchor and appropriate tension was applied. It must be noted I did undermine the skin edges both sides of flap from both incision site prior to placement of the skin anchor and adequate mobilization was obtained. Adequate tension was placed in this region. A non thick dressing was then applied to the open-wound region and sterile dressing was then applied. No complications were encountered throughout the procedure and the patient tolerated the procedure well. The patient was taken to recovery room in stable condition."
454,Orthopedic," EXAM:MRI LEFT FOOT CLINICAL: A 49-year-old female with ankle pain times one month, without a specific injury. Patient complains of moderate to severe pain, worse with standing or walking on hard surfaces, with tenderness to palpation at the plantar aspect of the foot and midfoot region and tenderness over the course of the posterior tibialis tendon. FINDINGS: Received for second opinion interpretations is an MRI examination performed on 05/27/2005. There is edema of the subcutis adipose space extending along the medial and lateral aspects of the ankle. There is edema of the subcutis adipose space posterior to the Achilles tendon. Findings suggest altered biomechanics with crural fascial strains. There is tendinosis of the posterior tibialis tendon as it rounds the tip of the medial malleolus with mild tendon thickening. There is possible partial surface tearing of the anterior aspect of the tendon immediately distal to the tip of the medial malleolus (axial inversion recovery image #16) which is a possible hypertrophic tear less than 50% in cross sectional diameter. The study has been performed with the foot in neutral position. Confirmation of this possible partial tendon tear would require additional imaging with the foot in a plantar flexed position with transaxial images of the posterior tibialis tendon as it rounds the tip of the medial malleolus oriented perpendicular to the course of the posterior tibialis tendon. There is minimal synovitis of the flexor digitorum longus and flexor hallucis longus tendon sheaths consistent with flexor splinting but intrinsically normal tendons. Normal peroneal tendons. There is tendinosis of the tibialis anterior tendon with thickening but no demonstrated tendon tear. Normal extensor hallucis longus and extensor digitorum tendons. Normal Achilles tendon. There is a low-lying soleus muscle that extends to within 2cm of the teno-osseous insertion of the Achilles tendon. Normal distal tibiofibular syndesmotic ligamentous complex. Normal lateral, subtalar and deltoid ligamentous complexes. There are no erosions of the inferior neck of the talus and there are no secondary findings of a midfoot pronating force. Normal plantar fascia. There is no plantar calcaneal spur. There is venous engorgement of the plantar veins of the foot extending along the medial and lateral plantar cutaneous nerves which may be acting as intermittent entrapping lesions upon the medial and lateral plantar cutaneous nerves. Normal tibiotalar, subtalar, talonavicular and calcaneocuboid articulations. The metatarsophalangeal joint of the hallux was partially excluded from the field-of-view of this examination. IMPRESSION: Tendinosis of the posterior tibialis tendon with tendon thickening and possible surface fraying / tearing of the tendon immediately distal to the tip of the medial malleolus, however, confirmation of this finding would require additional imaging. Minimal synovitis of the flexor digitorum longus and flexor hallucis longus tendon sheaths, consistent with flexor splinting. Edema of the subcutis adipose space along the medial and lateral aspects of the ankle suggesting altered biomechanics and crural fascial strain. Mild tendinosis of the tibialis anterior tendon with mild tendon thickening. Normal plantar fascia and no plantar fasciitis. Venous engorgement of the plantar veins of the foot which may be acting as entrapping lesions upon the medial and lateral plantar cutaneous nerves."
455,Orthopedic," DIAGNOSIS: Left knee osteoarthritis. HISTORY: The patient is a 58-year-old female, referred to therapy due to left knee osteoarthritis. The patient states that approximately 2 years ago, she fell to the ground and thereafter had blood clots in the knee area. The patient was transferred from the hospital to a nursing home and lived there for 1 year. Prior to this incident, the patient was ambulating independently with a pickup walker throughout her home. Since that time, the patient has only been performing transverse and has been unable to ambulate. The patient states that her primary concern is her left knee pain and they desire to walk short distances again in her home. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: High blood pressure, obesity, right patellar fracture with pin in 1990, and history of blood clots. MEDICATIONS: Naproxen, Plavix, and stool softener. MEDICAL DIAGNOSTICS: The patient states that she had an x-ray of the knee in 2007 and was diagnosed with osteoarthritis. SUBJECTIVE: The patient reports that when seated and at rest, her knee pain is 0/10. The patient states that with active motion of the left knee, the pain in the anterior portion increases to 5/10. PATIENT'S GOAL: To transfer better and walk 5 feet from her bed to the couch. INSPECTION: The right knee has a large 8-inch long and very wide tight scar with adhesions to the underlying connective tissue due to her patellar fracture and surgery following an MVA in 1990, bilateral knees are very large due to obesity. There are no scars, bruising or increased temperature noted in the left knee. RANGE OF MOTION: Active and passive range of motion of the right knee is 0 to 90 degrees and the left knee, 0 to 85 degrees. Pain is elicited during active range of motion of the left knee. PALPATION: Palpation to the left knee elicits pain around the patellar tendon and to each side of this area. FUNCTIONAL MOBILITY: The patient reports that she transfers with standby to contact-guard assist in the home from her bed to her wheelchair and return. The patient is able to stand modified independent from wheelchair level and tolerates at least 15 seconds of standing prior to needing to sit down due to the left knee pain. ASSESSMENT: The patient is a 58-year-old female with left knee osteoarthritis. Examination indicates deficits in pain, muscle endurance, and functional mobility. The patient would benefit from skilled physical therapy to address these impairments. TREATMENT PLAN: The patient will be seen two times per week for an initial 4 weeks with re-assessment at that time for an additional 4 weeks if needed. INTERVENTIONS INCLUDE: 1. Modalities including electrical stimulation, ultrasound, heat, and ice. 2. Therapeutic exercise. 3. Functional mobility training. 4. Gait training. LONG-TERM GOALS TO BE ACHIEVED IN 4 WEEKS: 1. The patient is to have increased endurance in bilateral lower extremities as demonstrated by being able to perform 20 repetitions of all lower extremity exercises in seated and supine positions with minimum 2-pound weight. 2. The patient is to perform standby assist transfer using a pickup walker. 3. The patient is to demonstrate 4 steps of ambulation using forward and backward using a pickup walker or front-wheeled walker. 4. The patient is to report maximum 3/10 pain with weightbearing of 2 minutes in the left knee. LONG-TERM GOALS TO BE ACHIEVED IN 8 WEEKS: 1. The patient is to be independent with the home exercise program. 2. The patient is to tolerate 20 reps of standing exercises with pain maximum of 3/10. 3. The patient is to ambulate 20 feet with the most appropriate assistive device. PROGNOSIS TO THE ABOVE-STATED GOALS: Fair to good. The above treatment plan has been discussed with the patient. She is in agreement."
456,Orthopedic," HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 44-year-old man who was seen for complaints of low back and right thigh pain. He attributes this to an incident in which he was injured in 1994. I do not have any paperwork authenticating his claim that there is an open claim. Most recently he was working at Taco Bell, when he had a recurrence of back pain, and he was seen in our clinic on 04/12/05. He rated pain of approximately 8/10 in severity. He took a Medrol Dosepak and states that his pain level has decreased to approximately 4-5/10. He still localizes it to a band between L4 and the sacrum. He initially had some right leg pain but states that this is minimal and intermittent at the present time. His back history is significant for two laminectomies and a discectomy performed from 1990 to 1994. The area of concern was L4-L5. The patient's MRI dated 10/18/04 showed multi-level degenerative changes, with facet involvement at L2-L3, L3-L4 and L5-S1. There was no neural impingement. He also had an MR myelogram, which showed severe stenosis at L3-L4, however it was qualified in that it may have been artifact, rather than a genuine finding. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Focal lower paralumbar pain, affecting both right and left sides, as well as intermittent right leg pain which appears to have improved significantly with the Medrol Dosepak. He denies any recent illness. He has no constitutional complaints such as fevers, chills or sweats. HEENT: The patient denies any cephalgia, ocular, nasopharyngeal symptoms. He has no dysphagia. Cardiovascular: He denies any palpitations, chest pain, syncope or near-syncope. Pulmonary: He denies any dyspnea or respiratory difficulties. GI: The patient has no abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting. GU: The patient denies any urinary frequency or dysuria. There is no gross hematuria. Dermatologic: The patient notes no new onset of rash or other dermatological abnormalities. Musculoskeletal: Denies any recent falls or near-falls. He denies any abnormalities of endocrine, immunologic, hematologic, organ systems. MEDICATIONS: Atenolol, Zestril, Vicodin. ALLERGIES: None. SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS: Lifting limitations of 5 pounds and limited stooping, bending and twisting. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital signs: Blood pressure 158/86, respiration 14, pulse 60, temperature 100.2. He is sitting upright, alert and oriented and in no acute distress. Skin is warm and dry. Gross neurologic examination is normal. ENT examination reveals normal oropharynx, nasopharynx, and tympanic membranes. Neck: Full range of motion with no adenopathy or thyromegaly. Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm. Lungs: Clear. On examination of the lumbar spine, he is minimally tender to palpation. There is no overt muscular spasm. His range of motion is estimated at 40 degrees of flexion and 15 degrees of extension. Straight leg raises do not elicit any leg complaints on today's visit. Lower extremity reflexes are symmetric. DIAGNOSIS: Low back pain with a history of right leg pain. The leg pain is no longer present. His pain level has improved. PLAN: 1. The patient will take another Medrol Dosepak. 2. He can continue with physical therapy. 3. He also continues with the same lifting restrictions. 4. Follow up is within one week."
457,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Hallux rigidus, left foot. 2. Elevated first metatarsal, left foot. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Hallux rigidus, left foot. 2. Elevated first metatarsal, left foot. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: 1. Austin/Youngswick bunionectomy with Biopro implant. 2. Screw fixation, left foot. HISTORY: This 51-year-old male presents to ABCD General Hospital with the above chief complaint. The patient states that he has had degenerative joint disease in his left first MPJ for many years that has been progressively getting worse and more painful over time. The patient desires surgical treatment. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: An IV was instituted by the Department of Anesthesia in the preoperative holding area. The patient was transported from the operating room and placed on the operating room table in the supine position with the safety belt across his lap. Copious amount of Webril was placed around the left ankle followed by a blood pressure cuff. After adequate sedation by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 7 cc of 0.5% Marcaine plain was injected in a Mayo-type block. The foot was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile orthopedic fashion. The foot was elevated from the operating table and exsanguinated with an Esmarch bandage. The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was then inflated to 250 mmHg. The foot was lowered to the operating table, the stockinet was reflected, and the foot was cleansed with wet and dry sponge. Attention was then directed to the left first metatarsophalangeal joint. Approximately a 6 cm dorsomedial incision was created over the first metatarsophalangeal joint, just medial to the extensor hallucis longus tendon. The incision was then deepened with a #15 blade. All vessels encountered were ligated for hemostasis. The skin and subcutaneous tissue was undermined medially, off of the joint capsule. A dorsal linear capsular incision was then made. Care was taken to identify and preserve the extensor hallucis longus tendon. The capsule and periosteum were then reflected off of the head of the first metatarsal as well as the base of the proximal phalanx. There was noted to be a significant degenerative joint disease. There was little to no remaining healthy articular cartilage left on the head of the first metatarsal. There was significant osteophytic formation medially, dorsally, and laterally in the first metatarsal head as well as at the base of the proximal phalanx. A sagittal saw was then used to resect the base of the proximal phalanx. Care was taken to ensure that the resection was parallel to the nail. After the bone was removed in toto, the area was inspected and the flexor tendon was noted to be intact. The sagittal saw was then used to resect the osteophytic formation medially, dorsally, and laterally on the first metatarsal. The first metatarsal was then re-modelled and smoothed in a more rounded position with a reciprocating rasp. The sizers were then inserted for the Biopro implant. A large was noted to be of the best size. There was noted to be some hypertrophic bone laterally in the base of the proximal phalanx. Following inspection, the sagittal saw was used to clean both the medial and lateral sides of the base. A small bar drill was then used to pre-drill for the Biopro sizer. The bone was noted to be significantly hardened. The sizer was placed and a large Biopro was deemed to be the correct size implant. The sizer was removed and bar drill was then again used to ream the medullary canal. The hand reamer with a Biopro set was then used to complete the process. The Biopro implant was then inserted and tamped with a hammer and rubber mallet to ensure tight fit. There was noted to be distally increased range of motion after insertion of the implant. Attention was then directed to the first metatarsal. A long dorsal arm Austin osteotomy was then created. A second osteotomy was then created just plantar and parallel to the first osteotomy site. The wedge was then removed in toto. The area was feathered to ensure high compression of the osteotomy site. The head was noted to be in a more plantar flexed position. The capital fragment was then temporarily fixated with two 0.45 K-wires. A 2.7 x 16 mm screw was then inserted in the standard AO fashion. A second more proximal 2.7 x 60 mm screw was also inserted in a standard AO fashion. With both screws, there was noted to be tight compression at the osteotomy sites. The K-wires were removed and the areas were then smoothed with reciprocating rash. A screw driver was then used to check and ensure screw tightness. The area was then flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline. Subchondral drilling was performed with a 1.5 drill bit. The area was then flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline. Closure consisted of capsular closure with #3-0 Vicryl followed by subcutaneous closure with #4-0 Vicryl, followed by running subcuticular stitch of #5-0 Vicryl. Dressings consisted of Steri-Strips, Owen silk, 4x4s, Kling, Kerlix, and Coban. A total of 10 cc of 1:1 mixture of 1% lidocaine plain and 0.5% Marcaine plain was injected intraoperatively for further anesthesia. The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted to all five digits of the left foot. The patient tolerated the above procedure and anesthesia well. The patient was transported to PACU with vital signs stable and vascular status intact to the right foot. The patient was given postoperative pain prescription for Vicodin ES and instructed to take 1 q. 4-6h. p.o. p.r.n. pain. The patient was instructed to ice and elevate his left lower extremity as much as possible to help decrease postoperative edema. The patient is to follow up with Dr. X in his office as directed."
458,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES 1. Herniated nucleus pulposus C2-C3. 2. Spinal stenosis C3-C4. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES 1. Herniated nucleus pulposus C2-C3. 2. Spinal stenosis C3-C4. PROCEDURES 1. Anterior cervical discectomy, C3-C4, C2-C3. 2. Anterior cervical fusion, C2-C3, C3-C4. 3. Removal of old instrumentation, C4-C5. 4. Fusion C3-C4 and C2-C3 with instrumentation using ABC plates. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was placed in the supine position. The neck was prepped and draped in the usual fashion for anterior cervical discectomy. A high incision was made to allow access to C2-C3. Skin and subcutaneous tissue and the platysma were divided sharply exposing the carotid sheath which was retracted laterally and the trachea and esophagus were retracted medially. This exposed the vertebral bodies of C2-C3 and C4-C5 which was bridged by a plate. We placed in self-retaining retractors. With the tooth beneath the blades, the longus colli muscles were dissected away from the vertebral bodies of C2, C3, C4, and C5. After having done this, we used the all-purpose instrumentation to remove the instrumentation at C4-C5, we could see that fusion at C4-C5 was solid. We next proceeded with the discectomy at C2-C3 and C3-C4 with disc removal. In a similar fashion using a curette to clean up the disc space and the space was fairly widened, as well as drilling up the vertebral joints using high-speed cutting followed by diamond drill bit. It was obvious that the C3-C4 neural foramina were almost totally obliterated due to the osteophytosis and foraminal stenosis. With the operating microscope; however, we had good visualization of these nerve roots, and we were able to ___________ both at C2-C3 and C3-C4. We then placed the ABC 55-mm plate from C2 down to C4. These were secured with 16-mm titanium screws after excellent purchase. We took an x-ray which showed excellent position of the plate, the screws, and the graft themselves. The next step was to irrigate the wound copiously with saline and bacitracin solution and s Jackson-Pratt drain was placed in the prevertebral space and brought out through a separate incision. The wound was closed with 2-0 Vicryl for subcutaneous tissues and Steri-Strips used to close the skin. Blood loss was about 50 mL. No complication of the surgery. Needle count, sponge count, cottonoid count was correct. The operating microscope was used for the entirety for both visualization and magnification and illumination which was quite superb. At the time of surgery, he had total collapse of the C2, C3, and C4 disc with osteophyte formation. At both levels, he has high-grade spinal stenosis at these levels, especially foramen stenosis causing the compression, neck pain, headaches, and arm and shoulder pain. He does have degenerative changes at C5-C6, C6-C7, C7-T1; however, they do not appear to be symptomatic, although x-rays show the disks to be partially collapsed at all levels with osteophyte formation beginning to form."
459,Orthopedic," CC: Paraplegia. HX: This 32 y/o RHF had been performing missionary work in Jos, Nigeria for several years and delivered her 4th child by vaginal delivery on 4/10/97. The delivery was induced with Pitocin, but was otherwise uncomplicated. For the first 4 days post-partum she noted clear liquid diarrhea without blood and minor abdominal discomfort. This spontaneous resolved without medical treatment. The second week post-partum she had 4-5 days of sinusitis, purulent nasal discharge and facial pain. She was otherwise well until 5/4/97 when stationed in a more rural area of Nigeria, she noted a dull ache in both knees (lateral to the patellae) and proximal tibia, bilaterally. The pain was not relieved by massage and seemed more bothersome when seated or supine. She had no sensory loss at the time. On 5/6/97, she awakened to pain radiating down her knees to her anterior tibia. Over the next few hours the pain radiated circumferentially around both calves, and involved the soles of her feet and posterior BLE to her buttocks. Rising from bed became a laborious task and she required assistance to walk to the bathroom. Ibuprofen provided minimal analgesia. By evening the sole of one foot was numb. She awoke the next morning, 5/9/97, with &quot;pins & needles&quot; sensation in BLE up to her buttocks. She was given Darvocet for analgesia and took an airplane back to the larger city she was based in. During the one hour flight her BLE weakness progressed to a non-weight bearing state (i.e. she could not stand). Local evaluation revealed 3/3 proximal and 4/4 distal BLE weakness. She had a sensory level to her waist on PP and LT testing. She also had mild lumbar back pain. Local laboratory evaluation: WBC 12.7, ESR 10. She was presumed to have Guillain-Barre syndrome and was placed on Solu-Cortef 1000mg qd and Sandimmune IV IgG 12.0 g. On 5/10/97, she was airlifted to Geneva, Switzerland. Upon arrival there she had total anesthesia from the feet up to the inguinal region, bilaterally. There was flaccid areflexic paralysis of BLE and she was unable to void or defecate. Straight catheterization of the bladder revealed a residual volume of 1000cc. On 5/12/ CSF analysis revealed: Protein 1.5g/l, Glucose 2.2mmol/l, WBC 92 (O PMNS, 100% Lymphocytes), RBC 70, Clear CSF, bacterial-fungal-AFB-cultures were negative. Broad spectrum antibiotics and Solu-Medrol 1g IV qd were started. MRI T-L-spine, 5/12/97 revealed an intradural T12-L1 lesion that enhanced minimally with gadolinium and was associated with spinal cord edema in the affected area. MRI Brain, 5/12/97, was unremarkable and showed no evidence of demyelinating disease. HIV, HTLV-1, HSV, Lyme, EBV, Malaria and CMV serological titers were negative. On 5/15/97 the Schistosomiasis Mekongi IFAT serological titer returned positive at 1:320 (normal&lt;1:80). 5/12/97 CSF Schistosomiasis Mekongi IFAT and ELISA were negative. She was then given a one day course of Praziquantel 3.6g total in 3 doses; and started on Prednisone 60 mg po qd; the broad spectrum antibiotics and Solu-Medrol were discontinued. On 5/22/97, a rectal biopsy was performed to evaluate parasite eradication. The result came back positive for ova and granulomata after she had left for UIHC. The organism was not speciated. 5/22/97 CSF schistosomiasis ELISA and IFAT titers were positive at 1.09 and 1:160, respectively. These titers were not known when she initially arrived at UIHC. Following administration of Praziquantel, she regained some sensation in BLE but the paraplegia, and urinary retention remained. MEDS: On 5/24/97 UIHC arrival: Prednisone 60mg qd, Zantac 50 IV qd, Propulsid 20mg tid, Enoxaparin 20mg qd. PMH: 1)G4P4. FHX: unremarkable. SHX: Missionary. Married. 4 children ( ages 7,5,3,6 weeks). EXAM: BP110/70, HR72, RR16, 35.6C MS: A&O to person, place and time. Speech fluent and without dysarthria. Lucid thought process. CN: unremarkable. Motor: 5/5 BUE strength. Lower extremities: 1/1 quads and hamstrings, 0/0 distally. Sensory: Decreased PP/LT/VIB from feet to inguinal regions, bilaterally. T12 sensory level to temperature (ice glove). Coord: normal FNF. Station/Gait: not done. Reflexes: 2/2 BUE. 0/0 BLE. No plantar responses, bilaterally. Rectal: decreased to no rectal tone. Guaiac negative. Other: No Lhermitte's sign. No paraspinal hypertonicity noted. No vertebral tenderness. Gen exam: Unremarkable. COURSE: MRI T-L-spine, 5/24/97, revealed a 6 x 8 x 25 soft tissue mass at the L1 level posterior to the tip of the conus medullaris and extending into the canal below that level. This appeared to be intradural. There was mild enhancement. There was more enhancement along the distal cord surface and cauda equina. The distal cord had sign of diffuse edema. She underwent exploratory and decompressive laminectomy on 5/27/97, and was retreated with a one day course of Praziquantel 40mg/kg/day. Praziquantel is reportedly only 80% effective at parasite eradication. She continued to reside on the Neurology/Neurosurgical service on 5/31/97 and remained paraplegic."

Risks and benefits of the procedure had been discussed in length including but not exclusive of infection, nerve or artery damage, stiffness, loss of range of motion, incomplete relief of pain, continued instability, recurrent instability, medical complications, surgical complications, and anesthesia complications. The patient understood and wishes to proceed. PREOP DIAGNOSIS: Anterior instability, left shoulder. POSTOP DIAGNOSES: 1. Anterior instability, left shoulder. 2. Grade 4 chondromalacia, 10% humeral head, chondral defect 1 cm squared, left shoulder. 3. Type 1 superior labrum anterior and posterior lesion, left shoulder. 4. Anteroinferior glenoid erosions 10% bony surface, left shoulder. 5. Bankart lesion, left shoulder. PROCEDURE: The patient was placed in a supine position and both shoulders examined systematically. She had full range of motion with no joint adhesions. She had equal range of motion bilaterally. She had Hawkins 2 anteriorly and posteriorly in both shoulders with a grade 1 sulcus sign in both shoulders. This was the same when the arm was in neutral or in external rotation. The patient was then turned to right lateral decubitus position, axillary roll was placed, and beanbag was inflated. Peroneal nerve was well protected. All bony prominences were well protected. The left upper extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. The patient was given antibiotics well before the start of the procedure to decrease the risk of infection. The arm was placed in a arm holder with 10 pounds of traction. A posterior portal was created in the usual manner by isolating gently with the spinal needle, it was insufflated with 30 cubic centimeters of saline. A small incision was made after infiltrating the skin with Marcaine and epinephrine. The scope was introduced into the shoulder with no difficulty. It was then examined systematically. The patient did have diffuse synovitis throughout her shoulder. Her posterior humeral head showed an enlarged bold spot with some other areas of chondromalacia on the posterior head. She also had an area 1 cm in diameter, which was on more central portion of the head and more inferiorly which appeared to be more of an impaction-type injury. This had some portions of fibrillated and loose cartilage, hanging from the edges. These were later debrided, but the dissection was proximally 10 to 15% of the humeral surface. The biceps tendon appeared to be normal. The supraspinatus, infraspinatus tendons were normal. The inferior pouch was normal with no capsular tearing and no HAGL lesions. The posteroinferior labrum was normal as well as the posterosuperior labrum. There was some fraying in the posterosuperior labrum, which was later debrided. It was found essentially to be a type 1 lesion anteriorly and superiorly. The anterosuperior labrum appeared to be detached, which appeared to be more consistent with a sublabral hole. The middle glenohumeral ligament was present as an entire sheath, but attach to the labrum. The labrum did appeared to be detached from the anterior glenoid from the 11 o'clock position all the way down to the 6 o'clock position. The biceps anchor itself was later probed and found to be stable and normal. The subscapularis tendon was normal. The anterior band of the glenohumeral ligament was present, but it was clearly avulsed off the glenoid. There was some suggestion of anteroinferior bony erosions, which was later substantiated when the shoulder was opened. The patient was missing about 10 to 15% of her anteroinferior glenoid rim. The patient had a positive drive-through sign. The arm was then moved to lateral and placed through range of motion. There was contact of the rotator cuff to the superior glenoid in flexion at 115 degrees, maximum flexion was 150 degrees. The arm abducted and externally rotated. There was contact to the rotator cuff with posterosuperior labrum. This occurred with the arm position of 90 degrees with abduction at 55 degrees of external rotation. It should be noted that the maximum abduction is 150 degrees and with the arm abducted 90 degrees, maximum external rotation was 95 degrees. The patient did have a positive relocation maneuver. The posterior labrum did appear to tilt-off, but did not appear to peel off. The arm was then placed back in the arm holder. Anterior portal was created with Wissinger rod. A blue cannula was inserted into the shoulder without difficulty. Shaver was introduced in the labrum. Also the area of chondromalacia as mentioned above was debrided. The labrum was found to be stable with only a type 1 SLAP lesion, and there was no evidence as there was really a type 2 SLAP lesion. The instruments were then removed along with excess fluid. The posterior portals were closed with single 4-0 nylon suture. The anterior portal was left open. The patient was then placed in a supine position, and the extremity was reprepped and draped in anticipation of performing open capsular shift. The patient's anterior incision made just lateral to the coracoid in the skin line. Mediolateral skin flaps were developed, and cephalic vein was identified and protected throughout the case. The interval was developed down the clavipectoral fascia. The conjoined tendon was retracted medially and the deltoid laterally. The patient's subscapularis was intact, and the subscapularis split was then made between the upper one half and lower one half in line with muscle fibers. The capsule could easily be detached from the muscle, and the interval developed very easily. A retractor was placed inferiorly to protect the axillary nerve. Then Gelpi retractor was used to hold the subscapularis split open. Next, an arthrotomy was made down at the 9 o'clock position. The labrum was identified and found to be attached all the way down to 6 o'clock position. The inferior flap was then created in a usual manner and tied with a 0 Vicryl suture. The patient's glenoid rim did have some erosion as mentioned above with some bone loss and flattening. This was debrided with the soft tissue. Three Mitek suture anchors were then placed into the glenoid rim right at the margin of articular cartilage to the scapular neck. These were absorbable anchors with nonabsorbable sutures. They had excellent fixation once they had been placed. Next, the capsular shift and Bankart repair were performed in the usual manner with the number 2 Ti-Cron sutures as an outside in and then inside out technique. This brought the capsule right up to the edge of the glenoid rim. With the arm in internal rotation and posterior pressure on the head, the capsule was then secured to the rim with no difficulty under direct visualization. The capsule did come right up into the joint as expected with this type of repair. The superior flap was then closed, the inferior flap over the superior anchor. The interval between two flaps was closed with multiple number 2 Ti-Cron sutures. Once this has been completed, there was no tension on the repair with the arm to side until 10 degrees of external rotation was reached. The arm abducted 90 degrees. There was tension on the repair until 20 degrees of external rotation reached. The wound was thoroughly irrigated throughout with antibiotic-impregnated irrigation. The subscapularis split was closed with interrupted 0 Vicryl sutures. The deep subcutaneous tissues were closed with interrupted 0 Vicryl sutures. The superficial subcutaneous tissues were closed with number 2-0 Vicryl sutures. The skin was closed with 4-0 subcuticular Prolene, reinforced with Steri-Strips. A sterile bandage was applied along with a cold therapy device and a shoulder immobilizer. The patient was sent to the recovery room in stable and satisfactory condition."
461,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Fractured right fifth metatarsal. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Fractured right fifth metatarsal. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: 1. Open reduction and internal screw fixation right fifth metatarsal. 2. Application of short leg splint. ANESTHESIA: TIVA/local. HISTORY: This 32-year-old female presents to Preoperative Holding Area after keeping herself n.p.o., since mid night for open reduction and internal fixation of a fractured right fifth metatarsal. The patient relates that approximately in mid-June that she was working as a machinist at Detroit Diesel and dropped a large set of tools on her right foot. She continued to walk on the foot and found nothing was wrong despite the pain. She was recently seen by Dr. X and was referred to Dr. Y for surgery. The risks versus benefits of the procedure had been explained to the patient in detail by Dr. Y. The consent is available on the chart for review. The urine beta was taken in the preoperative area and was negative. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: After IV was established by the Department of Anesthesia, the patient was taken to the operating room via cart and placed on the operating table in the supine position. A safety strap was placed across her waist for her protection. Copious amounts of Webril were applied about the right ankle and a pneumatic ankle tourniquet was applied. After adequate IV sedation was administered by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 10 cc of 0.5% Marcaine plain was used to perform an infiltrative type block to the right fifth metatarsal area of the right foot. Next, the foot was prepped and draped in the usual aseptic fashion. An Esmarch bandage was used to exsanguinate the foot and the pneumatic ankle tourniquet was elevated to 250 mmHg. The foot was lowered in the operative field and a sterile stocking was reflected. Attention was directed to the right fifth metatarsal base. The Xi-scan and fluoroscopic unit was used to visualize the fractured fifth metatarsal. An avulsion fracture of the right fifth metatarsal base was visualized. The fracture was linear in nature from distal lateral to proximal medial. There appeared to be a pseudoarthrosis on the lateral view. A skin scrub was used to carefully mark out all the landmarks including the peroneus longus and brevis tendons in the fifth metatarsal and the sural nerve. A linear incision was created with a #10 blade. A #15 blade was used to deepen the incision through the subcutaneous tissue. All small veins traversing the subcutaneous tissue were ligated with electrocautery. Next, using combination of sharp and blunt dissection, the deep fascia was reached. Next a linear capsuloperiosteal incision was made down to the bone using a #15 blade. Next, using a periosteal elevator and a #15 blade, the capsuloperiosteal tissues were stripped from the bone. The fracture site was not clearly visualized due to bony callus. A #25 gauge needle was introduced into the fracture site under fluoroscopy. The fracture site was easily found. An osteotome was used to separate the pseudoarthrosis. A curette was used to remove the hypertrophic excessive pseudoarthrotic bone. Next, a small ball burr was used to resect the remaining hypertrophic bone. Next, a #1.0 drill bit was used to drill the subchondral bone on either side of the fracture site and a good healthy bleeding bone. Next, a bone clamp was applied and the fracture was reduced. Next, a threaded K-wire was thrown from the proximal base of the fifth metatarsal across the fracture site distally. A #4-0 mm Synthes partially threaded, cannulated 50 mm screw was thrown using standard AO technique from the proximal fifth metatarsal base down the shaft and the fracture site was fixated rigidly. All this was done under fluoroscopy. Next, the wound was flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline. The fracture site was found to have rigid compression. The hypertrophic bone on the lateral aspect of the metatarsal was reduced with a ball burr and the wound was again flushed. Next, the capsuloperiosteal tissues were closed with #3-0 Vicryl in a simple interrupted fashion. A few fibers of the peroneus brevis tendon that were stripped from the base of the proximal phalanx were reattached carefully with Vicryl. Next, the subcutaneous layer was closed with #4-0 Vicryl in a simple interrupted suture technique. Next, the skin was closed with #5-0 Prolene in a horizontal mattress technique. A postoperative fluoroscopic x-ray was taken and the bony alignment was found to be intact and the screw placement had excellent appearance. A dressing consisting of Owen silk, 4x4s, fluff, and Kerlix were applied. A sterile stockinet was applied over the foot. Next, copious amounts of Webril were applied to pad all bony prominences. The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted to all digits. Next, 4-inch, pre-moulded, well-padded posterior splint was applied. The capillary refill time of the digits was less than three seconds. The patient tolerated the above anesthesia and procedure without complications. After anesthesia was reversed, she was transported via cart to the Postanesthesia Care Unit with vital signs stable and vascular status intact to the right foot. She was given Vicodin 5/500 mg #30 1-2 p.o. q.4-6h. p.r.n., pain, Naprosyn 500 mg p.o. b.i.d. p.c., Keflex 500 mg #30 one p.o. t.i.d., till gone. She was given standard postoperative instructions to be non-weightbearing and was dispensed with crutches. She will rest, ice, and elevate her right leg. She is to follow up in the clinic on 08/26/03 at 10:30 a.m.. She was given emergency contact numbers and will call or return if problems arise earlier."
462,Orthopedic," CHIEF COMPLAINT: Neck and lower back pain. VEHICULAR TRAUMA HISTORY: Date of incident: 1/15/2001. The patient was the driver of a small sports utility vehicle and was wearing a seatbelt. The patient�s vehicle was proceeding through an intersection and was struck by another vehicle from the left side and forced off the road into a utility pole. The other vehicle had reportedly been driven by a drunk driver and ran a traffic signal. Estimated impact speed was 80 m.p.h. The driver of the other vehicle was reportedly cited by police. The patient was transiently unconscious and came to the scene. There was immediate onset of headaches, neck and lower back pain. The patient was able to exit the vehicle and was subsequently transported by Rescue Squad to St. Thomas Memorial Hospital, evaluated in the emergency room and released. NECK AND LOWER BACK PAIN HISTORY: The patient relates the persistence of pain since the motor vehicle accident. Symptoms began immediately following the MVA. Because of persistent symptoms, the patient subsequently sought chiropractic treatment. Neck pain is described as severe. Neck pain remains localized and is non-radiating. There are no associated paresthesias. Back pain originates in the lumbar region and radiates down both lower extremities. Back pain is characterized as worse than the neck pain. There are no associated paresthesias. Stiffness is provoked by attempts at strenuous activity. The patient also reports difficulty sleeping, unable to find a comfortable position. The patient denies any previous back problems. During the day, the pain is exacerbated by strenuous activities. Pain may be eased by resting or recumbency and sitting. The patient�s activity level has been significantly restricted. Some improvement has been noted with chiropractic treatment. Since the onset of the problem, the pain has continued at more less the same level. The patient reports that, prior to the present problem described above, there had been no episodes of neck or lower back pain. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Negative. PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Hysterectomy (3/20/99). PERSONAL/SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is right-handed. She does not smoke and does not drink alcohol.

There is no indication for surgical intervention. Continued chiropractic treatment should be of benefit, with an emphasis on soft tissue techniques and mobilization. Physiatry consultation may be considered. TREATMENT RECOMMENDATIONS: The patient was advised to gradually and progressively increase activity levels, as tolerated, while continuing to avoid anything unduly strenuous."
463,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Cervical disk protrusions at C5-C6 and C6-C7, cervical radiculopathy, and cervical pain. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Cervical disk protrusions at C5-C6 and C6-C7, cervical radiculopathy, and cervical pain. PROCEDURES: C5-C6 and C6-C7 anterior cervical discectomy (two levels) C5-C6 and C6-C7 allograft fusions. A C5-C7 anterior cervical plate fixation (Sofamor Danek titanium window plate) intraoperative fluoroscopy used and intraoperative microscopy used. Intraoperative SSEP and EMG monitoring used. ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal. COMPLICATIONS: None. INDICATION FOR THE PROCEDURE: This lady presented with history of cervical pain associated with cervical radiculopathy with cervical and left arm pain, numbness, weakness, with MRI showing significant disk protrusions with the associate complexes at C5-C6 and C6-C7 with associated cervical radiculopathy. After failure of conservative treatment, this patient elected to undergo surgery. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the OR and after adequate general endotracheal anesthesia, she was placed supine on the OR table with the head of the bed about 10 degrees. A shoulder roll was placed and the head supported on a donut support. The cervical region was prepped and draped in the standard fashion. A transverse cervical incision was made from the midline, which was lateral to the medial edge of the sternocleidomastoid two fingerbreadths above the right clavicle. In a transverse fashion, the incision was taken down through the skin and subcutaneous tissue and through the platysmata and a subplatysmal dissection done. Then, the dissection continued medial to the sternocleidomastoid muscle and then medial to the carotid artery to the prevertebral fascia, which was gently dissected and released superiorly and inferiorly. Spinal needles were placed into the displaced C5-C6 and C6-C7 to confirm these disk levels using lateral fluoroscopy. Following this, monopolar coagulation was used to dissect the medial edge of the longus colli muscles off the adjacent vertebrae between C5-C7 and then the Trimline retractors were placed to retract the longus colli muscles laterally and blunt retractors were placed superiorly and inferiorly. A #15 scalpel was used to do a discectomy at C5-C6 from endplate-to-endplate and uncovertebral joint. On the uncovertebral joint, a pituitary rongeur was used to empty out any disk material ____________ to further remove the disk material down to the posterior aspect. This was done under the microscope. A high-speed drill under the microscope was used to drill down the endplates to the posterior aspect of the annulus. A blunt trocar was passed underneath the posterior longitudinal ligament and it was gently released using the #15 scalpel and then Kerrison punches 1-mm and then 2-mm were used to decompress further disk calcified material at the C5-C6 level. This was done bilaterally to allow good decompression of the thecal sac and adjacent neuroforamen. Then, at the C6-C7 level, in a similar fashion, #15 blade was used to do a discectomy from uncovertebral joint to uncovertebral joint and from endplate-to-endplate using a #15 scalpel to enter the disk space and then the curette was then used to remove the disk calcified material in the endplate, and then high-speed drill under the microscope was used to drill down the disk space down to the posterior aspect of the annulus where a blunt trocar was passed underneath the posterior longitudinal ligament which was gently released. Then using the Kerrison punches, we used 1-mm and 2-mm, to remove disk calcified material, which was extending more posteriorly to the left and the right. This was gently removed and decompressed to allow good decompression of the thecal sac and adjacent nerve roots. With this done, the wound was irrigated. Hemostasis was ensured with bipolar coagulation. Vertebral body distraction pins were then placed to the vertebral body of C5 and C7 for vertebral distraction and then a 6-mm allograft performed grafts were taken and packed in either aspect with demineralized bone matrix and this was tapped in flush with the vertebral bodies above and below C5-C6 and C6-C7 discectomy sites. Then, the vertebral body distraction pins were gently removed to allow for graft seating and compression and then the anterior cervical plate (Danek windows titanium plates) was then taken and sized and placed. A temporary pin was initially used to align the plate and then keeping the position and then two screw holes were drilled in the vertebral body of C5, two in the vertebral body of C6, and two in the vertebral body of C7. The holes were then drilled and after this self-tapping screws were placed into the vertebral body of C5, C6, and C7 across the plate to allow the plate to fit and stay flush with the vertebral body between C5, C6, and C7. With this done, operative fluoroscopy was used to check good alignment of the graft, screw, and plate, and then the wound was irrigated. Hemostasis was ensured with bipolar coagulation and then the locking screws were tightened down. A #10 round Jackson-Pratt drain was placed into the prevertebral space and brought out from a separate stab wound skin incision site. Then, the platysma was approximated using 2-0 Vicryl inverted interrupted stitches and the skin closed with 4-0 Vicryl running subcuticular stitch. Steri-Strips and sterile dressings were applied. The patient remained hemodynamically stable throughout the procedure. Throughout the procedure, the microscope had been used for the disk decompression and high-speed drilling. In addition, intraoperative SSEP, EMG monitoring, and motor-evoked potentials remained stable throughout the procedure. The patient remained stable throughout the procedure."
464,Orthopedic," ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS: Trauma/ATV accident resulting in left open humerus fracture. DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: Trauma/ATV accident resulting in left open humerus fracture. SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS: None. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: For complete details, please see dictated history and physical by Dr. X dated July 23, 2008. Briefly, the patient is a 10-year-old male who presented to the Hospital Emergency Department following an ATV accident. He was an unhelmeted passenger on ATV when the driver lost control and the ATV rolled over throwing the passenger and the driver approximately 5 to 10 meters. The patient denies any loss of consciousness. He was not amnestic to the event. He was taken by family members to the Iredell County Hospital, where he was initially evaluated. Due to the extent of his injuries, he was immediately transferred to Hospital Emergency Department for further evaluation. HOSPITAL COURSE: Upon arrival in the Hospital Emergency Department, he was noted to have an open left humerus fracture. No other apparent injuries. This was confirmed with radiographic imaging showing that the chest and pelvis x-rays were negative for any acute injury and that the cervical spine x-ray was negative for fracture malalignment. The left upper extremity x-ray did demonstrate an open left distal humerus fracture. The orthopedic surgery team was then consulted and upon their evaluation, the patient was taken emergently to the operating room for surgical repair of his left humerus fracture. In the operating room, the patient was prepared for an irrigation and debridement of what was determined to be an open type 3 subcondylar left distal humerus fracture. In the operating room, his upper extremity was evaluated for neurovascular status and great care was taken to preserve these structures. Throughout the duration of the procedure, the patient had a palpable distal radial pulse. The orthopedic team then completed an open reduction and internal fixation of the left supracondylar humerus fracture. A wound VAC was then placed over the wound at the conclusion of the procedure. The patient tolerated this procedure well and was returned to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit for postsurgical followup and monitoring. His diet was advanced and his pain was controlled with pain medication. The day following his surgery, the patient was evaluated for a potential for closed head injury given the nature of his accident and the fact that he was not wearing a helmet during his accident. A CT of the brain without contrast showed no acute intracranial abnormalities moreover his cervical spine was radiographically and clinically cleared and his C-collar was removed at that point. Once his C spine had been cleared and the absence of a closed head injury was confirmed. The patient was then transferred from the Intensive Care Unit to the General Floor bed. His clinical status continued to improve and on July 26, 2008, he was taken back to the operating room for removal of the wound VAC and closure of his left upper extremity wound. He again tolerated this procedure well on his return to the General Pediatrics Floor. Throughout his stay, there was concern for compartment syndrome due to the nature and extent of his injuries. However, frequent checks of his distal pulses indicated that he had strong peripheral pulses in the left upper extremity. Moreover, the patient had no complaints of paresthesia. There was no demonstration of pallor or pain on passive motion. There was good capillary refill to the digits of the left hand. By the date of the discharge, the patient was on a full pediatric select diet and was tolerating this well. He had no abdominal tenderness and there were no abdominal injuries on exam or radiographic studies. He was afebrile and his vital signs were stable and once cleared by Orthopedics, he was deemed appropriate for discharge. PROCEDURES DURING THIS HOSPITALIZATION: 1. Irrigation and debridement of open type 3 subcondylar left distal humerus fracture (July 23, 2008). 2. Open reduction and internal fixation of the left supracondylar humerus fracture (July 23, 2008). 3. Negative pressure wound dressing (July 23, 2008). 4. Irrigation and debridement of left elbow fracture (July 26, 2008). 5. CT of the brain without contrast (July 24, 2008). DISPOSITION: Home with parents. INVASIVE LINES: None. DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: The patient was instructed that he can return home with his regular diet and he was asked not to do any strenuous activities, move furniture, lift heavy objects, or use his left upper extremity. He was asked to followup with return appointment in one week to see Dr. Y in Orthopedics. Additionally, he was told to call his pediatrician, if he develops any fevers, pain, loss of sensation, loss of pulse, or discoloration of his fingers, or paleness to his hand."

466,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Severe neurologic or neurogenic scoliosis. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Severe neurologic or neurogenic scoliosis. PROCEDURES: 1. Anterior spine fusion from T11-L3. 2. Posterior spine fusion from T3-L5. 3. Posterior spine segmental instrumentation from T3-L5, placement of morcellized autograft and allograft. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 500 mL. FINDINGS: The patient was found to have a severe scoliosis. This was found to be moderately corrected. Hardware was found to be in good positions on AP and lateral projections using fluoroscopy. INDICATIONS: The patient has a history of severe neurogenic scoliosis. He was indicated for anterior and posterior spinal fusion to allow for correction of the curvature as well as prevention of further progression. Risks and benefits were discussed at length with the family over many visits. They wished to proceed. PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table in the supine position. General anesthesia was induced without incident. He was given a weight-adjusted dose of antibiotics. Appropriate lines were then placed. He had a neuromonitoring performed as well. He was then initially placed in the lateral decubitus position with his left side down and right side up. An oblique incision was then made over the flank overlying the 10th rib. Underlying soft tissues were incised down at the skin incision. The rib was then identified and subperiosteal dissection was performed. The rib was then removed and used for autograft placement later. The underlying pleura was then split longitudinally. This allowed for entry into the pleural space. The lung was then packed superiorly with wet lap. The diaphragm was then identified and this was split to allow for access to the thoracolumbar spine. Once the spine was achieved, subperiosteal dissection was performed over the visualized vertebral bodies. This required cauterization of the segmental vessels. Once the subperiosteal dissection was performed to the posterior and anterior extents possible, the diskectomies were performed. These were performed from T11-L3. This was over 5 levels. Disks and endplates were then removed. Once this was performed, morcellized rib autograft was placed into the spaces. The table had been previously bent to allow for easier access of the spine. This was then straightened to allow for compression and some correction of the curvature. The diaphragm was then repaired as was the pleura overlying the thoracic cavity. The ribs were held together with #1 Vicryl sutures. Muscle layers were then repaired using a running #2-0 PDS sutures and the skin was closed using running inverted #2-0 PDS suture as well. Skin was closed as needed with running #4-0 Monocryl. This was dressed with Xeroform dry sterile dressings and tape. The patient was then rotated into a prone position. The spine was prepped and draped in a standard fashion. Longitudinal incision was made from T2-L5. The underlying soft tissues were incised down at the skin incision. Electrocautery was then used to maintain hemostasis. The spinous processes were then identified and the overlying apophyses were split. This allowed for subperiosteal dissection over the spinous processes, lamina, facet joints, and transverse processes. Once this was completed, the C-arm was brought in, which allowed for easy placement of screws in the lumbar spine. These were placed at L4 and L5. The interspaces between the spinous processes were then cleared of soft tissue and ligamentum flavum. This was done using a rongeur as well as a Kerrison rongeur. Spinous processes were then harvested for morcellized autograft. Once all the interspaces were prepared, Songer wires were then passed. These were placed from L3-T3. Once the wires were placed, a unit rod was then positioned. This was secured initially at the screws distally on both the left and right side. The wires were then tightened in sequence from the superior extent to the inferior extent, first on the left-sided spine where I was operating and then on the right side spine. This allowed for excellent correction of the scoliotic curvature. Decortication was then performed and placement of a morcellized autograft and allograft was then performed after thoroughly irrigating the wound with 4 liters of normal saline mixed with bacitracin. This was done using pulsed lavage. The wound was then closed in layers. The deep fascia was closed using running #1 PDS suture, subcutaneous tissue was closed using running inverted #2-0 PDS suture, the skin was closed using #4-0 Monocryl as needed. The wound was then dressed with Steri-Strips, Xeroform dry sterile dressings, and tape. The patient was awakened from anesthesia and taken to the intensive care unit in stable condition. All instrument, sponge, and needle counts were correct at the end of the case. The patient will be managed in the ICU and then on the floor as indicated."
467,Orthopedic," CHIEF COMPLAINT: Left wrist pain. HISTORY OF PRESENT PROBLEM: The patient has a previous history of a left traumatic wrist injury, which has left him with a chronic scapholunate problem and possibly other problems in his wrist. However, he was doing relatively fine and tolerating the wrist soreness that he had, which is day to day, but it has not gotten much worse until this injury. Once he lifted the object out of the back of his car and it started to hurt, then he was significantly more affected than he was before, and now pain is more on the ulnar side of his wrist than on the radial side of his wrist. He is here now for evaluation. CLINICAL/PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Musculoskeletal: The patient has point tenderness to palpation along the ulnar styloid ECU ridge with some minor tenderness at the TFC region, as well as the lunotriquetral joint. There is some minor soreness, but not nearly as sore at the SL ligament with dorsiflexion 30&deg;, palmar flexion 30&deg;, radial deviation 5&deg; and ulnar deviation 0&deg;. Supination/pronation grossly intact without significant signs of instability. Negative piano key sign compared to the contralateral side. Skin: No skin breakdown or hyperhidrosis. Neurologic: Negative signs of compressive median nerve neuropathy. Vascular: Intact. RADIOLOGICAL/LABORATORY EXAM: X-rays, three views of the wrist of good penetrance and quality, reveal scapholunate widening of a slack wrist with a possible ulnar styloid nonunion, with a possible occult distal radius fracture fibrous union. MRI report reviewed. EVALUATION/TREATMENT PLAN: The MRI is consistent with edema and swelling in the ulnar styloid region, which is consistent with the injury pattern that he is claiming and where he is most sore. He has a chronic problem that needs to potentially be addressed. Sometimes with these acute on chronic problems, what was tolerated initially may no longer be tolerated by the patient, which we talked about. Our focus still should be on the initial injury which brought him in at this time. It is a three-week-old injury. Given the MRI, we probably have seen on radiographs a fibrous union between that ulnar styloid and the remaining portion of the ulna, which may have been torn or injured, especially consistent with the MRI. Therefore, I would cast him initially to get that to heal, and then reassess. All questions were answered, and we will make the treatment plans accordingly. He will followup in two weeks. We casted him."
468,Orthopedic," SUBJECTIVE: The patient comes back to see me today. She is a pleasant 77-year-old Caucasian female who had seen Dr. XYZ with right leg pain. She has a history of prior laminectomy for spinal stenosis. She has seen Dr. XYZ with low back pain and lumbar scoliosis post laminectomy syndrome, lumbar spinal stenosis, and clinical right L2 radiculopathy, which is symptomatic. Dr. XYZ had performed two right L2-L3 transforaminal epidural injections, last one in March 2005. She was subsequently seen and Dr. XYZ found most of her remaining symptoms are probably coming from her right hip. An x-ray of the hip showed marked degenerative changes with significant progression of disease compared to 08/04/2004 study. Dr. XYZ had performed right intraarticular hip injection on 04/07/2005. She was last seen on 04/15/2005. At that time, she had the hip injection that helped her briefly with her pain. She is not sure whether or not she wants to proceed with hip replacement. We recommend she start using a cane and had continued her on some pain medicines. The patient comes back to see me today. She continues to complain of significant pain in her right hip, especially with weightbearing or with movement. She said she had made an appointment to see an orthopedic surgeon in Newton as it is closer and more convenient for her. She is taking Ultracet or other the generic it sounds like, up to four times daily. She states she can take this much more frequently as she still has significant pain symptoms. She is using a cane to help her ambulate. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Essentially unchanged from her visit of 04/15/2005. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: General: Reveals a pleasant Caucasian female. Vital Signs: Height is 5 feet 4 inches. Weight is 149 pounds. She is afebrile. HEENT: Benign. Neck: Shows functional range of movements with a negative Spurling's. Musculoskeletal: Examination shows some mild degenerative joint disease of both knees with grade weakness of her right hip flexors and half-grade weakness of her right hip adductors and right quadriceps, as compared to the left. Straight leg raises are negative bilaterally. Posterior tibials are palpable bilaterally. Skin and Lymphatics: Examination of the skin does not reveal any additional scars, rashes, cafe au lait spots or ulcers. No significant lymphadenopathy noted. Spine: Examination shows lumbar scoliosis with surgical scar with no major tenderness. Spinal movements are limited but functional. Neurological: She is alert and oriented with appropriate mood and affect. She has normal tone and coordination. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical. Sensations are intact to pinprick. FUNCTIONAL EXAMINATION: Gait has a normal stance and swing phase with no antalgic component to it. IMPRESSION: 1. Degenerative disk disease of the right hip, symptomatic. 2. Low back syndrome, lumbar spinal stenosis, clinically right L2 radiculopathy, stable. 3. Low back pain with lumbar scoliosis post laminectomy syndrome, stable. 4. Facet and sacroiliac joint syndrome on the right, stable. 5. Post left hip arthroplasty. 6. Chronic pain syndrome. RECOMMENDATIONS: The patient is symptomatic primarily on her right hip and is planning on seeing an orthopedic surgeon for possible right hip replacement. In the interim, her Ultracet is not quite taking care of her pain. I have asked her to discontinue it and we will start her on Tylenol #3, up to four times a day. I have written a prescription for this for 120 tablets and two refills. The patient will call for the refills when she needs them. I will plan further follow up in six months, sooner if needed. She voiced understanding and is in agreement with this plan. Physical exam findings, history of present illness and recommendations were performed with and in agreement with Dr. Goel's findings."
469,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES 1. Post anterior cervical discectomy and fusion at C4-C5 and C5-C6 with possible pseudoarthrosis at C4-C5. 2. Cervical radiculopathy involving the left arm. 3. Disc degeneration at C3-C4 and C6-C7. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES 1. Post anterior cervical discectomy and fusion at C4-C5 and C5-C6 with possible pseudoarthrosis at C4-C5. 2. Cervical radiculopathy involving the left arm. 3. Disc degeneration at C3-C4 and C6-C7. OPERATIVE PROCEDURES 1. Decompressive left lumbar laminectomy C4-C5 and C5-C6 with neural foraminotomy. 2. Posterior cervical fusion C4-C5. 3. Songer wire. 4. Right iliac bone graft. TECHNIQUE: The patient was brought to the operating room. Preoperative evaluations included previous cervical spine surgery. The patient initially had some relief; however, his left arm pain did recur and gradually got worse. Repeat studies including myelogram and postspinal CTs revealed some blunting of the nerve root at C4-C5 and C5-C6. There was also noted to be some annular bulges at C3-C4, and C6-C7. The CT scan in March revealed that the fusion was not fully solid. X-rays were done in November including flexion and extension views, it appeared that the fusion was solid. The patient had been on pain medication. The patient had undergone several nonoperative treatments. He was given the option of surgical intervention. We discussed Botox, I discussed with the patient and posterior cervical decompression. I explained to the patient this will leave a larger scar on his neck, and that no guarantee would help, there would be more bleeding and more pain from the posterior surgery than it was from the anterior surgery. If at the time of surgery there was some motion of the C4-C5 level, I would recommend a fusion. The patient was a smoker and had been advised to quit smoking but has not quit smoking. I have therefore recommended that he use iliac bone graft. I explained to the patient that this would give him a scar over the back of the right pelvis and could be a source of chronic pain for the patient for the rest of his life. Even if this type of bone graft was used, there was no guarantee that it will fuse and he should stop smoking completely. The patient also was advised that if I did a fusion, I would also use post instrumentation, which was a wire. The wire would be left permanently. Even with all these procedures, there was no guarantee that his symptoms would improve. His numbness, tingling, and weakness could get worse rather than better, his neck pain and arm pain could persist. He still had some residual bursitis in his left shoulder and this would not be cured by this procedure. Other procedures may be necessary later. There is still with a danger of becoming quadriplegic or losing total control of bowel or bladder function. He could lose total control of his arms or legs and end up in the bed for the rest of his life. He could develop chronic regional pain syndromes. He could get difficulty swallowing or eating. He could have substantial weakness in the arm. He was advised that he should not undergo the surgery unless the pain is persistent, severe, and unremitting. He was also offered his records if he would like any other pain medications or seek other treatments, he was advised that Dr. X would continue to prescribe pain medication if he did not wish to proceed with surgery. He stated he understood all the risks. He did not wish to get any other treatments. He said the pain has reached the point that he wished to proceed with surgery. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: In the operating room, he was given general endotracheal anesthesia. I then carefully rolled the patient on thoracic rolls. His head was controlled by a horseshoe holder. The anesthesiologist checked the eye positions to make sure there was no pressure on the orbits and the anesthesiologist continued to check them every 15 minutes. The arms, the right hip, and the neck was then prepped and draped. Care was taken to position both arms and both legs. Pulses were checked. A midline incision was made through the skin and subcutaneous tissue on the cervical spine. A loupe magnification and headlamp illumination was used. Bleeding vessels were cauterized. Meticulous hemostasis was carried out throughout the procedure. Gradually and carefully I exposed the spinous process of the C6, C5, and C4. A lateral view was done after an instrument in place. This revealed the C6-C7 level. I therefore did a small laminotomy opening at C4-C5. I placed an instrument and x-rays confirmed C4-C5 level. I stripped the muscles from the lamina and then moved them laterally and held with a self-retaining retractor. Once I identified the level, I then used a bur to thin the lamina of C5. I used a 1-mm, followed by a 2-mm Kerrison rongeur to carefully remove the lamina off C5 on the left. I removed some of the superior lamina of C6 and some of the inferior lamina of C4. This allowed me to visualize the dura and the nerve roots and gradually do neural foraminotomies for both the C5 and C6 nerve roots. There was some bleeding from the epidural veins and a bipolar cautery was used. Absolutely no retractors were ever placed in the canal. There was no retraction. I was able to place a small probe underneath the nerve root and check the disc spaces to make sure there was no fragments of disc or herniation disc and none were found. At the end of the procedure, the neuroforamen were widely patent. The nerve roots had been fully decompressed. I then checked stability. There was micromotion at the C4-C5 level. I therefore elected to proceed with a fusion. I debrided the interspinous ligament between C4 and C5. I used a bur to roughen up the surface of the superior portion of the spinous process of C5 and the inferior portion of C4. Using a small drill, I opened the facet at C4-C5. I then used a very small curette to clean up the articular cartilage. I used a bur then to roughen up the lamina at C4-C5. Attention was turned to the right and left hip, which was also prepped. An incision made over the iliac crest. Bleeding vessels were cauterized. I exposed just the posterior aspect of the crest. I removed some of the bone and then used the curette to remove cancellous bone. I placed the Songer wire through the base of the spinous process of C4 and C5. Drill holes made with a clip. I then packed cancellous bone between the decorticated spinous process. I then tightened the Songer wire to the appropriate tension and then cut off the excess wire. Prior to tightening the wire, I also packed cancellous bone with facet at C4-C5. I then laid bone upon the decorticated lamina of C4 and C5. The hip wound was irrigated with bacitracin and Kantrex. Deep structures were closed with #1 Vicryl, subcutaneous suture and subcuticular tissue was closed. No drain was placed in the hip. A drain was left in the posterior cervical spine. The deep tissues were closed with 0 Vicryl, subcutaneous tissue and skin were then closed. The patient was taken to the recovery room in good condition."
470,Orthopedic," MM/DD/YYYY XYZ, D.C. Re: ABC Dear Dr. XYZ: I had the pleasure of seeing your patient, ABC, today MM/DD/YYYY in consultation. He is an unfortunate 19-year-old right-handed male who was injured in a motor vehicle accident on MM/DD/YYYY, where he was the driver of an automobile, which was struck on the front passenger's side. The patient sustained impact injuries to his neck and lower back. There was no apparent head injury or loss of consciousness and he denied any posttraumatic seizures. He was taken to Hospital, x-rays were taken, apparently which were negative and he was released. At the present time, he complains of neck and lower back pain radiating into his right arm and right leg with weakness, numbness, paraesthesia, and tingling in his right arm and right leg. He has had no difficulty with bowel or bladder function. He does experience intermittent headaches associated with his neck pain with no other associated symptoms. PAST HEALTH: He was injured in a prior motor vehicle accident on MM/DD/YYYY. At the time of his most recent injuries, he was completely symptom free and under no active therapy. There is no history of hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, neurological disorders, ulcers or tuberculosis. SOCIAL HISTORY: He denies tobacco or alcohol consumption. ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: None. FAMILY HISTORY: Otherwise noncontributory. FUNCTIONAL INQUIRY: Otherwise noncontributory. REVIEW OF DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES: Includes an MRI scan of the cervical spine dated MM/DD/YYYY which showed evidence for disc bulging at the C6-C7 level. MRI scan of the lumbar spine on MM/DD/YYYY, showed evidence of a disc herniation at the L1-L2 level as well as a disc protrusion at the L2-L3 level with disc herniations at the L3-L4 and L4-L5 level and disc protrusion at the L5-S1 level. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Reveals an alert and oriented male with normal language function. Vital Signs: Blood pressure was 105/68 in the left arm sitting. Heart rate was 70 and regular. Height was 5 feet 8 inches. Weight was 182 pounds. Cranial nerve evaluation was unremarkable. Pupils were equal and reactive. Funduscopic evaluation was clear. There was no evidence for nystagmus. There was decreased range of motion noted in both the cervical and lumbar regions to a significant degree, with tenderness and spasm in the paraspinal musculature. Straight leg raising was limited to 45 degrees on the right and 90 degrees on the left. Motor strength was 5/5 on the MRC scale. Reflexes were 2+ symmetrical and active. No pathological responses were noted. Sensory examination showed a diffuse decreased sensation to pinprick in the right upper extremity. Cerebellar function was normal. There was normal station and gait. Chest and cardiovascular evaluations were unremarkable. Heart sounds were normal. There were no extra sounds or murmurs. Palpable trigger points were noted in the right trapezius and right cervical and lumbar paraspinal musculature. CLINICAL IMPRESSION: Reveals a 19-year-old male suffering from a posttraumatic cervical and lumbar radiculopathy, secondary to traumatic injuries sustained in a motor vehicle accident on MM/DD/YYYY. In view of the persistent radicular complaints associated with the weakness, numbness, paraesthesia, and tingling as well as the objective sensory loss noted on today's evaluation as well as the non-specific nature of the radiculopathy, I have scheduled him for an EMG study on his right upper and right lower extremity in two week's time to rule out any nerve root irritation versus any peripheral nerve entrapment or plexopathy as the cause of his symptoms. Palpable trigger points were noted on today's evaluation. He is suffering from ongoing myofascitis. His treatment plan will consist of a series of trigger point injections to be initiated at his next follow up visit in two weeks' time. I have encouraged him to continue with his ongoing treatment program under your care and supervision. I will be following him in two weeks' time. Once again, thank you kindly for allowing me to participate in this patient's care and management. Yours sincerely,"
471,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right acute on chronic slipped capital femoral epiphysis. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right acute on chronic slipped capital femoral epiphysis. PROCEDURE: Revision and in situ pinning of the right hip. ANESTHESIA: Surgery performed under general anesthesia. COMPLICATIONS: There were no intraoperative complications. DRAINS: None. SPECIMENS: None. LOCAL: 10 mL of 0.50% Marcaine local anesthetic. HISTORY AND PHYSICAL: The patient is a 13-year-old girl who presented in November with an acute on chronic right slipped capital femoral epiphysis. She underwent in situ pinning. The patient on followup; however, noted to have intraarticular protrusion of her screw. This was not noted intraoperatively on previous fluoroscopic views. Given this finding, I explained to the father and especially the mother that this can cause further joint damage and that the screw would need to be exchanged for a shorter one. Risks and benefits of surgery were discussed. Risks of surgery include risk of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremity, failure to remove the screw, possible continued joint stiffness or damage. All questions were answered and parents agreed to above plan. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating table. General anesthesia was then administered. The patient received Ancef preoperatively. A small bump was placed underneath her right buttock. The right upper thigh was then prepped and draped in standard surgical fashion. The upper aspect of the incision was reincised. The dissection was carried down to the crew, which was easily found. A guidewire was placed inside the screw with subsequent removal of the previous screw. The previous screw measured 65 mm. A 60 mm screw was then placed under direct visualization with fluoroscopy. The hip was taken through full range of motion to check on the length of the screw, which demonstrated no intraarticular protrusion. The guidewire was removed. The wound was then irrigated and closed using 2-0 Vicryl in the fascial layer as well as the subcutaneous fat. The skin was closed with 4-0 Monocryl. The wound was cleaned and dried, dressed with Steri-Strips, Xeroform, 4 x 4s, and tape. The area was infiltrated with total 10 mL of 0.5% Marcaine local anesthetic. POSTOPERATIVE PLAN: The patient will be discharged on the day of surgery. She should continue toe touch weightbearing on her leg. The wound may be wet in approximately 5 days. The patient should follow up in clinic in about 10 days. The patient is given Vicodin for pain. Intraoperative findings were relayed to the mother."
472,Orthopedic," TITLE OF OPERATION: 1. Irrigation and debridement of postoperative wound infection (CPT code 10180). 2. Removal of foreign body, deep (CPT code 28192). 3. Placement of vacuum-assisted closure device, less than 50 centimeter squared (CPT code 97605). PREOP DIAGNOSIS: Postoperative wound infection, complicated (ICD-9 code 998.59). POSTOP DIAGNOSIS: Postoperative wound infection, complicated (ICD-9 code 998.59). PROCEDURE DETAIL: The patient is a 59-year-old gentleman who is status post open reduction and internal fixation of bilateral calcanei. He was admitted for a left wound breakdown with drainage. He underwent an irrigation and debridement with VAC placement 72 hours prior to this operative visit. It was decided to bring him back for a repeat irrigation and debridement and VAC change prior to Plastics doing a local flap. The risks of surgery were discussed in detail including, but not limited to infection, bleeding, injuries to nerves and vital structures, need for reoperation, pain or stiffness, arthritis, fracture, the risk of anesthesia. The patient understood these risks and wished to proceed. The patient was admitted, and the operative site was marked. The patient was brought to the operating room and given general anesthetic. He was placed in the right lateral decubitus, and all bony prominences were well padded. An axillary roll was placed. A well-padded thigh tourniquet was placed on the left leg. The patient then received antibiotics on the floor prior to coming down to the operating room which satisfied the preoperative requirement. Left leg was then prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion. The previous five antibiotic spacer beads were removed without difficulty. The wound was then rongeured and curetted, and all bone was cleaned down to healthy bleeding bone. The wound actually looked quite good with evidence of purulence or drainage. Skin edges appeared to be viable. Hardware all looked to be intact. At this point, the wound was irrigated with 9 liters of bibiotic solution. A VAC sponge was then placed over the wound, and the patient's leg was placed into a posterior splint. The patient was awakened and then taken to recovery in good condition. Dr. X was present for the timeouts and for all critical portions of the procedure. He was immediately available for any questions during the case. PLAN: 1. A CAM walker boots. 2. A VAC change on Sunday by the nurse. 3. A flap per Plastic Surgery."
473,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right carpal tunnel syndrome. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right carpal tunnel syndrome. PROCEDURE: Right carpal tunnel release. ANESTHESIA: Bier block to the right hand. TOTAL TOURNIQUET TIME: 20 minutes. COMPLICATIONS: None. DISPOSITION: Stable to PACU. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Less than 10 cc. GROSS OPERATIVE FINDINGS: We did find a compressed right median nerve upon entering the carpal tunnel, otherwise, the structures of the carpal canal are otherwise unremarkable. No evidence of tumor was found. BRIEF HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 54-year-old female who was complaining of right hand numbness and tingling of the median distribution and has elected to undergo carpal tunnel surgery secondary to failure of conservative management. PROCEDURE: The patient was taken to the operative room and placed in the supine position. The patient underwent a Bier block by the Department of Anesthesia on the upper extremity. The upper extremity was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion and left free. Attention was drawn then to the palm of the hand. We did identify area of incision that we would make, which was located over the carpal tunnel. Approximately, 1.5 cm incision was made using a #10 blade scalpel. Dissection was carried through the skin and fascia over the palm down to the carpal tunnel taking care during dissection to avoid any branches of nerves. Carpal tunnel was then entered and the rest of the transverse carpal ligament was incised sharply with a #10 scalpel. We inspected the median nerve and found that it was flat and compressed from the transverse carpal ligament. We found no evidence of tumor or space occupying lesion in the carpal tunnel. We then irrigated copiously. Tourniquet was taken down at that time and pressure was held. There was no evidence of obvious bleeders. We approximated the skin with nylon and placed a postoperative dressing with a volar splint. The patient tolerated the procedure well. She was placed back in the gurney and taken to PACU."
474,Orthopedic," EXAM:MRI LEFT KNEE WITHOUT CONTRAST CLINICAL:This is a 53-year-old female with left knee pain being evaluated for ACL tear. FINDINGS: This examination was performed on 10-14-05. Normal medial meniscus without intrasubstance degeneration, surface fraying or discrete meniscal tear. There is a discoid lateral meniscus and although there may be minimal superficial fraying along the inner edge of the body, there is no discrete tear (series #6 images #7-12). There is a near-complete or complete tear of the femoral attachment of the anterior cruciate ligament. The ligament has a balled-up appearance consistent with at least partial retraction of most of the fibers of the ligament. There may be a few fibers still intact (series #4 images #12-14; series #5 images #12-14). The tibial fibers are normal. Normal posterior cruciate ligament. There is a sprain of the medial collateral ligament, with mild separation of the deep and superficial fibers at the femoral attachment (series #7 images #6-12). There is no complete tear or discontinuity and there is no meniscocapsular separation. There is a sprain of the lateral ligament complex without focal tear or discontinuity of any of the intraarticular components. Normal iliotibial band. Normal quadriceps and patellar tendons. There is contusion within the posterolateral corner of the tibia. There is also contusion within the patella at the midline patellar ridge where there is an area of focal chondral flattening (series #8 images #10-13). The medial and lateral patellar facets are otherwise normal as is the femoral trochlea in the there is no patellar subluxation. There is a mild strain of the vastus medialis oblique muscle extending into the medial patellofemoral ligament and medial patellar retinaculum but there is no complete tear or discontinuity. Normal lateral patellar retinaculum. There is a joint effusion and plica.

Placement of anterior spinal instrumentation from C3 to C6 using a Synthes Small Stature Plate, using the operating microscope and microdissection technique. INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: This 62-year-old man has severe cervical spondylosis with myelopathy and cord compression at C5-C6. There was a herniated disk with cord compression and radiculopathy at C4-C5. C3-C4 was the source of neck pain as documented by facet injections. A detailed discussion ensued with the patient as to the pros and cons of the surgery by two levels versus three levels. Because of the severe component of the neck pain that has been relieved with facet injections, we elected to proceed ahead with anterior cervical discectomy and fusion at C3-C4, C4-C5, and C5-C6. I explained the nature of this procedure in great detail including all risks and alternatives. He clearly understands and has no further questions and requests that I proceed. PROCEDURE: The patient was placed on the operating room table and was intubated taking great care to keep the neck in a neutral position. The methylprednisolone spinal cord protocol was instituted with bolus and continuous infusion dosages. The left side of the neck was carefully prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner. A transverse incision was made in the neck crease. Dissection was carried down through the platysma musculature and the anterior spine was exposed. The medial borders of the longus colli muscle were dissected free from their attachments to the spine. Caspar self-retaining pins were placed into the bodies of C3, C4, C5, and C6 and x-ray localization was obtained. A needle was placed in what was revealed to be the disk space at C4-C5 and an x-ray confirmed proper localization. Self-retaining retractors were then placed in the wound, taking great care to keep the blades of the retractors underneath the longus colli muscles. First I removed the large amount of anterior overhanging osteophytes at C5-C6 and distracted the space. The high-speed cutting bur was used to drill back the osteophytes towards the posterior lips of the vertebral bodies. An incision was then made at C4-C5 and the annulus was incised and a discectomy was performed back to the posterior lips of the vertebral bodies. The retractors were then adjusted and again discectomy was performed at C3-C4 back to the posterior lips of the vertebral bodies. The operating microscope was then utilized. Working under magnification, I started at C3-C4 and began to work my way down to the posterior longitudinal ligament. The ligament was incised and the underlying dura was exposed. I worked out laterally towards the takeoff of the C4 nerve root and widely decompressed the nerve root edge of the foramen. There were a large number of veins overlying the nerve root which were oozing and rather than remove these and produce tremendous amount of bleeding, I left them intact. However, I could to palpate the nerve root along the pedicle into the foramen and widely decompressed it on the right. The microscope was angled to the left side where similar decompression was achieved. The retractors were readjusted and attention was turned to C4-C5. I worked down through bony osteophytes and identified the posterior longitudinal ligament. The ligament was incised; and as I worked to the right of the midline, I encountered herniated disk material which was removed in a number of large pieces. The C5 root was exposed and then widely decompressed until I was flush with the pedicle and into the foramen. The root had a somewhat high takeoff but I worked to expose the axilla and widely decompressed it. Again the microscope was angled to the left side where similar decompression was achieved. Central decompression was achieved here where there was a moderate amount of spinal cord compression. This was removed by undercutting with 1 and 2-mm Cloward punches. Attention was then turned to the C5-C6 space. Here there were large osteophytes projecting posteriorly against the cord. I slowly and carefully used the high-speed cutting diamond bur to drill these and then used 1 to 2-mm Cloward punches to widely decompress the spinal cord. This necessitated undercutting the bodies of both C5 and C6 extensively, but I was then able to achieve a good decompression of the cord. I exposed the C6 root and widely decompressed it until I was flush with the pedicle and into the foramen on the right. The microscope was angled to the left side where a similar decompression was achieved. Attention was then turned to creation of the arthrodesis. A high-speed Cornerstone bur was used to decorticate the bodies of C5-C6, C4-C5 and C3-C4 to create a posterior shelf to prevent backwards graft migration. Bone dust during the drilling was harvested for later use. Attention was turned to creation of the arthrodesis. Using the various Synthes sizers, I selected a 7-mm lordotic graft at C5-C6 and an 8-mm lordotic graft at C4-C5 and a 9-mm lordotic graft at C3-C4. Each graft was filled with autologous bone from the vertebral bodies and bone morphogenetic protein soaked sponge. I decided to use BMP in this case because there were three levels of fusion and because this patient has a very heavy history of smoking and having just recently discontinued for two weeks. The BMP sponge and the ____________ bone were then packed in the center of the allograft. Under distraction, the graft was placed at C3-C4, C4-C5, and C5-C6 as described. An x-ray was obtained which showed good graft placement with preservation of the cervical lordosis. Attention was turned to the placement of anterior spinal instrumentation. Various sizes of Synthes plates were selected until I decided that a 54-mm plate was appropriate. The plate had to be somewhat contoured and bent inferiorly and the vertebral bodies had to be drilled so that the plates would sit flush. The holes were drilled and the screws were placed. Eight screws were placed with two screws at C3, two screws at C4, two screws at C5, and two screws at C6. All eight screws had good purchase. The locking screws were tightly applied. An x-ray was obtained which showed good placement of the graft, plate, and screws. Attention was turned to closure. The wound was copiously irrigated with Bacitracin solution and meticulous hemostasis was obtained. A medium Hemovac drain was placed in the anterior vertebral body space and brought out through a separate stab incision in the skin. The wound was then carefully closed in layers. Sterile dressings were applied, and the operation was terminated. The patient tolerated the procedure well and left for the recovery room in excellent condition. The sponge and needle counts were reported as correct. There were no intraoperative complications. Specimens were sent to Pathology consisting of disk material and bone and soft tissue."

477,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Left elbow fracture dislocation with incarceration of the medial epicondyle with ulnar nerve paresthesias status post closed reduction, attempts 2, right radial shaft fracture with volar apex angulation. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Left elbow fracture dislocation with incarceration of the medial epicondyle with ulnar nerve paresthesias status post closed reduction, attempts 2, right radial shaft fracture with volar apex angulation. PROCEDURES: 1. Open reduction internal fixation of the left medial epicondyle fracture with placement in a long-arm posterior well-molded splint. 2. Closed reduction casting of the right forearm. ANESTHESIA: Surgery performed under general anesthesia. Local anesthetic was 10 mL of 0.5% Marcaine. TOURNIQUET TIME: On the left was 29 minutes. COMPLICATIONS: There were no intraoperative complications. DRAINS: None. SPECIMENS: None. HISTORY AND PHYSICAL: The patient is a 13-year-old right-hand dominant girl, who fell off a swing at school around 1:30 today. The patient was initially seen at an outside facility and brought here by her father, given findings on x-ray, a closed reduction was attempted on the left elbow. After the attempted reduction, the patient was noted to have an incarcerated medial epicondyle fracture as well as increasing ulnar paresthesias that were not present prior to the procedure. Given this finding, the patient needed urgent open reduction and internal fixation to relieve the pressure on the ulnar nerve. At that same time, the patient's mildly angulated radial shaft fracture will be reduced. This was explained to the father. The risks of surgery included the risk of anesthesia, infection, bleeding, changes in sensation and motion of the extremity, hardware failure, need for later hardware removal, and possible continuous nerve symptoms. All questions were answered. The father agreed to the above plan. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating room table. General anesthesia was then administered. The patient received Ancef preoperatively. The left upper extremity was then prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion. Attempts to remove the incarcerated medial epicondyle with supination, valgus stress, and with extension were unsuccessful. It was decided at this time that she would need open reduction. The arm was wrapped in Esmarch prior to inflation of the tourniquet to 250 mmHg. The Esmarch was then removed. An incision was then made. Care was taken to avoid any injury to the ulnar nerve. The medial epicondyle fracture was found incarcerated into the anterior aspect of the joint. This was easily removed. The ulnar nerve was also identified, and appeared to be intact. The medial epicondyle was then transfixed using a guidewire into its anatomic position with the outer cortex over drilled with a 3.2 drill bit, and subsequently a 44-mm 4.5 partially threaded cannulated screw was then placed with a washer to hold the medial epicondyle in place. After fixation of the fragment, the ulnar nerve was visualized as it traveled around the medial epicondyle fracture with no signs of impingement. The wound was then irrigated with normal saline and closed using 2-0 Vicryl and 4-0 Monocryl. The wound was clean and dry, dressed with Steri-Strips and Xeroform. The area was infiltrated with 0.5% Marcaine. The patient was then placed in a long-arm posterior well-molded splint with 90 degrees of flexion and neutral rotation. The tourniquet was released at 30 minutes prior to placement of the dressing, showed no significant bleeding. Attention was then turned to right side, the arm was then manipulated and a well-molded long-arm cast placed. The final position in the cast revealed a very small residual volar apex angulation, which is quite acceptable in this age. The patient tolerated the procedure well, was subsequently extubated and taken to recovery in a stable condition. POSTOPERATIVE PLAN: The patient will be hospitalized for pain control and neurovascular testing for the next 1 to 2 days. The father was made aware of the intraoperative findings. All questions answered."
478,Orthopedic," CHIEF COMPLAINT: Left shoulder injury. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 41-year-old male presenting for initial evaluation of his left shoulder. He works at ABC and two days ago was walking though an area, where there was some oil spilled on the floor. He fell and landed on bilateral outstretched arms and then further fell landing primarily on his left shoulder. He presents today reporting primarily posterior shoulder pain. The right shoulder was bothersome yesterday, but is now asymptomatic. He has no anterior shoulder pain. He denies any feelings of weakness. He reports some improvement over the last two days especially in his range of motion. He was able to get into the swimming pool last night with his children without difficulty. He has had no additional treatment other than over-the-counter Advil. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: The patient has no significant past medical history with the exception of previous hand fracture and tibia fracture. PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Vasectomy. ALLERGIES: No know medicine allergies. MEDICATIONS: No current medications. SOCIAL HISTORY: Works at ABC. Social alcohol and he does smoke. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: No fever. No chills. No shortness of breath or numbness or tingling. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: In general, the patient is an alert and cooperative male in no acute distress. He has full active and passive range of motion of the left shoulder, which is symmetric to the right. Forward elevation approximately 165 degrees with symmetric internal and external rotation. He has some posterior shoulder discomfort with resisted external rotation. He has no tenderness over the biceps tendon. No tenderness over the AC joint. No tenderness over the anterior or lateral acromion. His primary area of tenderness is over the infraspinatus and supraspinatus fossa of the scapula posteriorly. He has 4+/5 strength to the supraspinatus, which is somewhat limited by pain. He has 2+ pulses and sensation is intact over the deltoid as well as distally in the hand. X-RAYS: Two views of the left shoulder were taken in clinic and reviewed revealing no fractures and no glenohumeral degenerative disease. He does have some AC degeneration. ASSESSMENT: Left shoulder contusion. PLAN: At this time, the patient feels he is improving significantly since his injury. He was given a prescription for Mobic. We offered physical therapy; however, he feels he is improving rapidly and would like to do range of motion exercises on his own at home. These were demonstrated for him today. I also advised him to limit overhead use of his shoulder as much as possible at work; however, he feels he can return to full duty, so this was written for him. He will return in four weeks. If he feels 100% better at that time, he will call and cancel."
479,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 1. Right cubital tunnel syndrome. 2. Right carpal tunnel syndrome. 3. Right olecranon bursitis. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: 1. Right cubital tunnel syndrome. 2. Right carpal tunnel syndrome. 3. Right olecranon bursitis. PROCEDURES: 1. Right ulnar nerve transposition. 2. Right carpal tunnel release. 3. Right excision of olecranon bursa. ANESTHESIA: General. BLOOD LOSS: Minimal. COMPLICATIONS: None. FINDINGS: Thickened transverse carpal ligament and partially subluxed ulnar nerve. SUMMARY: After informed consent was obtained and verified, the patient was brought to the operating room and placed supine on the operating table. After uneventful general anesthesia was obtained, his right arm was sterilely prepped and draped in normal fashion. After elevation and exsanguination with an Esmarch, the tourniquet was inflated. The carpal tunnel was performed first with longitudinal incision in the palm carried down through the skin and subcutaneous tissues. The palmar fascia was divided exposing the transverse carpal ligament, which was incised longitudinally. A Freer was then inserted beneath the ligament, and dissection was carried out proximally and distally. After adequate release has been formed, the wound was irrigated and closed with nylon. The medial approach to the elbow was then performed and the skin was opened and subcutaneous tissues were dissected. A medial antebrachial cutaneous nerve was identified and protected throughout the case. The ulnar nerve was noted to be subluxing over the superior aspect of the medial epicondyle and flattened and inflamed. The ulnar nerve was freed proximally and distally. The medial intramuscular septum was excised and the flexor carpi ulnaris fascia was divided. The intraarticular branch and the first branch to the SCU were transected; and then the nerve was transposed, it did not appear to have any significant tension or sharp turns. The fascial sling was made from the medial epicondyle and sewn to the subcutaneous tissues and the nerve had good translation with flexion and extension of the elbow and not too tight. The wound was irrigated. The tourniquet was deflated and the wound had excellent hemostasis. The subcutaneous tissues were closed with #2-0 Vicryl and the skin was closed with staples. Prior to the tourniquet being deflated, the subcutaneous dissection was carried out over to the olecranon bursa, where the loose fragments were excised with a rongeurs as well as abrading the ulnar cortex and excision of hypertrophic bursa. A posterior splint was applied. Marcaine was injected into the incisions and the splint was reinforced with tape. He was awakened from the anesthesia and taken to recovery room in a stable condition. Final needle, instrument, and sponge counts were correct."
480,Orthopedic," ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS: Painful right knee status post total knee arthroplasty many years ago. The patient had gradual onset of worsening soreness and pain in this knee.

The patient is to follow up with Dr. ABC in two weeks."
481,Orthopedic," The patient is a 64-year-old sales woman who is referred to our office for severe chronic back pain, hip pain, and pain in her knees as well as her neck. She states that she cannot remember when it started and she has had back pain and knee pain for years but most recently it has gotten &quot;intolerable.&quot; She states that she has had many problems with her neck over the years, pictures taken in the late 1990s, but no treatment. She had headaches, which were treated with antidepressants and Fiorinal, which helped her quite a bit. She states that she was also married to a wife beater and suffered many episodes of severe beatings when she was younger. She complains of back pain that radiates around her right hip and into the anterior thigh as well as bilateral knee pain. She states that her pain is constant. On a 1 to 10 pain scale, she rates it between a 6 and a 10. She has tried Fiorinal, which helps with her headaches. Currently, she is doing physical therapy for her back. She has also seen several different chiropractors over the years. On the body image drawing, she draws posterior neck pain, head pain, and right shoulder pain. She also draws numbness and tingling in her right hand. She draws pain in her back going into the right hip and down the anterior aspect of the right leg and bilateral knee pain. She states that her back hurts her more than her legs. When it comes to her legs, her right is worse than left. Knee pain is worse on the left than on the right. She is unable to identify any alleviating factors. Walking, standing, sitting, lying down, coughing, sneezing, working, and light and heavy exercise exacerbate her pain.

FINDINGS: The patient brings in lumbar spine MRI dated November 20, 2007, which demonstrates degenerative disc disease throughout. At L4-L5, there is an annular disc bulge with fissuring with facet arthrosis and ligamentum flavum hypertrophy yielding moderate central stenosis and neuroforaminal narrowing but the nerves do not appear to be impinged. At L5-S1, in the right neuroforamina, there appears to be soft tissue density just lateral and posterior to the nerve root, which may cause some displacement, but it is unclear. This could represent a facet synovial cyst. This is lateral to the facet. She does not have x-rays for review. She has had hip and knee x-rays taken but does not bring them in with her. ASSESSMENT: Low back pain, lumbar radiculopathy, degenerative disc disease, lumbar spinal stenosis, history of anemia, high cholesterol, and hypothyroidism. PLAN: We discussed treatment options with this patient including: 1 Do nothing. 2. Conservative therapies. 3. Surgery. She seems to have some issues with her right hip, so I would like for her to fax us over the report of her hip and knee x-rays. We will also order some x-rays of her lumbar spine as well as lower extremity EMG. At this point, the patient has not exhausted conservative measures and would like to start with epidural steroid injections, so we will go ahead and send her out for that. After she has gotten her second epidural injection, she will return to the office for a followup visit to see how she is doing. All questions and concerns were addressed. If she should have any further questions, concerns, or complications, she will contact our office immediately. Otherwise, we will see her as scheduled. Case was reviewed and discussed with Dr. L."
482,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right hip osteoarthritis. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right hip osteoarthritis. PROCEDURES PERFORMED: Total hip replacement on the right side using the following components: 1. Zimmer trilogy acetabular system 10-degree elevated rim located at the 12 o'clock position. 2. Trabecular metal modular acetabular system 48 mm in diameter. 3. Femoral head 32 mm diameter +0 mm neck length. 4. Alloclassic SL offset stem uncemented for taper. ANESTHESIA: Spinal. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was brought into the operating room and was placed on the operative table in a lateral decubitus position with the right side up. After review of allergies, antibiotics were administered and time out was performed. The right lower extremity was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion. A 15 cm to 25 cm in length, an incision was made over the greater trochanter. This was angled posteriorly. Access to the tensor fascia lata was performed. This was incised with the use of scissors. Gluteus maximus was separated. The bursa around the hip was identified, and the bleeders were coagulated with the use of Bovie. Hemostasis was achieved. The piriformis fossa was identified, and the piriformis fossa tendon was elevated with the use of a Cobb. It was detached from the piriformis fossa and tagged with 2-0 Vicryl. Access to the capsule was performed. The capsule was excised from the posterior and superior aspects. It was released also in the front with the use of a Mayo scissors. The hip was then dislocated. With the use of an oscillating saw, the femoral neck cut was performed. The acetabulum was then visualized and debrided from soft tissues and osteophytes. Reaming was initiated and completed for a 48 mm diameter cap without complications. The trial component was put in place and was found to be stable in an anatomic position. The actual component was then impacted in the acetabulum. A 10-degree lip polyethylene was also placed in the acetabular cap. Our attention was then focused to the femur. With the use of a cookie cutter, the femoral canal was accessed. The broaching process was initiated for No.4 trial component. Trialing of the hip with the hip flexed at 90 degrees and internally rotated to 30 degrees did not demonstrate any obvious instability or dislocation. In addition, in full extension and external rotation, there was no dislocation. The actual component was inserted in place and hemostasis was achieved again. The wound was irrigated with normal saline. The wound was then closed in layers. Before performing that the medium-sized Hemovac drain was placed in the wound. The tensor fascia lata was closed with 0 PDS and the wound was closed with 2-0 Monocryl. Staples were used for the skin. The patient recovered from anesthesia without complications. EBL: 50 mL. IV FLUIDS: 2 liters. DRAINS: One medium-sized Hemovac. COMPLICATIONS: None. DISPOSITION: The patient was transferred to the PACU in stable condition. She will be weightbearing as tolerated to the right lower extremity with posterior hip precautions. We will start the DVT prophylaxis after the removal of the epidural catheter."
483,Orthopedic," REASON FOR VISIT: Followup cervical spinal stenosis. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. ABC returns today for followup regarding her cervical spinal stenosis. I have last seen her on 06/19/07. Her symptoms of right greater than left upper extremity pain, weakness, paresthesias had been worsening after an incident on 06/04/07, when she thought she had exacerbated her conditions while lifting several objects. I referred her to obtain a cervical spine MRI. She returns today stating that she continues to have right upper extremity pain, paresthesias, weakness, which she believes radiates from her neck. She had some physical therapy, which has been helping with the neck pain. The right hand weakness continues. She states she has a difficult time opening jars, and doors, and often drops items from her right greater than left upper extremity. She states she have several occasions when she is sleeping at night, she has had sharp shooting radicular pain and weakness down her left upper extremity and she feels that these symptoms somewhat scare her. She has been undergoing nonoperative management by Dr. X and feels this has been helping her neck pain, but not the upper extremity symptoms. She denies any bowel and bladder dysfunction. No lower back pain, no lower extremity pain, and no instability with ambulation. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Negative for fevers, chills, chest pain, and shortness of breath. FINDINGS: On examination, Ms. ABC is a very pleasant well-developed, well-nourished female in no apparent distress. Alert and oriented x3. Normocephalic and atraumatic. Afebrile to touch. She ambulates with a normal gait. Motor strength is 4 plus out of 5 in the bilateral deltoids, biceps, triceps muscle groups, 4 out of 5 in the bilateral hand intrinsic muscle groups, grip strength 4 out of 5, 4 plus out of 5 bilateral wrist extension and wrist flexion. Light touch sensation decreased in the right greater than left C6 distribution. Biceps and brachioradialis reflexes are 3 plus. Hoffman sign normal bilaterally. Lower extremity strength is 5 out of 5 in all muscle groups. Patellar reflex is 3 plus. No clonus. Cervical spine radiographs dated 06/21/07 are reviewed. They demonstrate evidence of spondylosis including degenerative disk disease and anterior and posterior osteophyte formation at C4-5, C5-6, C6-7, and C3-4 demonstrates only minimal if any degenerative disk disease. There is no significant instability seen on flexion-extension views. Updated cervical spine MRI dated 06/21/07 is reviewed. It demonstrates evidence of moderate stenosis at C4-5, C5-6. These stenosis is in the bilateral neural foramina and there is also significant disk herniation noted at the C6-7 level. Minimal degenerative disk disease is seen at the C6-7. This stenosis is greater than C5-6 and the next level is more significantly involved at C4-5. Effacement of the ventral and dorsal CSF space is seen at C4-5, C5-6. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Ms. ABC's history, physical examination, and radiographic findings are compatible with C4-5, C5-6 cervical spinal stenosis with associated right greater than left upper extremity radiculopathy including weakness. I spent a significant amount of time today with the patient discussing the diagnosis, prognosis, natural history, nonoperative, and operative treatment options. I laid out the options as continued nonoperative management with physical therapy, the same with the addition of cervical epidural steroid injections and surgical interventions. The patient states she would like to avoid injections and is somewhat afraid of having these done. I explained to her that they may help to improve her symptoms, although they may not help with the weakness. She feels that she is failing maximum nonoperative management and would like to consider surgical intervention. I described the procedure consisting of C4-5, C5-6 anterior cervical decompression and fusion to the patient in detail on a spine model. I explained the rationale for doing so including the decompression of the spinal cord and improvement of her upper extremity weakness and pain. She understands. I discussed the risks, benefits, and alternative of the procedure including material risks of bleeding, infection, neurovascular injury, dural tear, singular or multiple muscle weakness, paralysis, hoarseness of voice, difficulty swallowing, pseudoarthrosis, adjacent segment disease, and the risk of this given the patient's relatively young age. Of note, the patient does have a hoarse voice right now, given the fact that she feels she has allergies. I also discussed the option of disk arthroplasty. She understands. She would like to proceed with the surgery, relatively soon. She has her birthday coming up on 07/20/07 and would like to hold off, until after then. Our tentative date for the surgery is 08/01/07. She will go ahead and continue the preoperative testing process."
484,Orthopedic," HISTORY: We had the pleasure of seeing the patient today in our Pediatric Rheumatology Clinic. He was sent here with a chief complaint of joint pain in several joints for few months. This is a 7-year-old white male who has no history of systemic disease, who until 2 months ago, was doing well and 2 months ago, he started to complain of pain in his fingers, elbows, and neck. At this moment, this is better and is almost gone, but for several months, he was having pain to the point that he would cry at some point. He is not a complainer according to his mom and he is a very active kid. There is no history of previous illness to this or had gastrointestinal problems. He has problems with allergies, especially seasonal allergies and he takes Claritin for it. Other than that, he has not had any other problem. Denies any swelling except for that doctor mentioned swelling on his elbow. There is no history of rash, no stomach pain, no diarrhea, no fevers, no weight loss, no ulcers in his mouth except for canker sores. No lymphadenopathy, no eye problems, and no urinary problems.

485,Orthopedic," TITLE OF OPERATION: Lateral and plantar condylectomy, fifth left metatarsal. PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Prominent, lateral, and plantar condyle hypertrophy, fifth left metatarsal. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Prominent, lateral, and plantar condyle hypertrophy, fifth left metatarsal. ANESTHESIA: Monitored anesthesia care with 10 mL of 1:1 mixture of both 0.5% Marcaine and 1% lidocaine plain. HEMOSTASIS: 30 minutes, left ankle tourniquet set at 250 mmHg. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Less than 10 mL. MATERIALS USED: 3-0 Vicryl and 4-0 Vicryl. INJECTABLES: Ancef 1 g IV 30 minutes preoperatively. DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table in a supine position. After adequate sedation was achieved by the anesthesia team, the above-mentioned anesthetic mixture was infiltrated directly into the patient's left foot to anesthetize the future surgical sites. The left ankle was covered with cast padding and an 18-inch ankle tourniquet was placed around the left ankle and set at 250 mmHg. The left foot was then prepped, scrubbed, and draped in a normal sterile technique. The left ankle tourniquet was inflated. Attention was then directed on the dorsolateral aspect of the fifth left metatarsophalangeal joint where a 4-cm linear incision was placed over the fifth left metatarsophalangeal joint parallel and lateral to the course of the extensor digitorum longus to the fifth left toe. The incision was deepened through the subcutaneous tissues. All the bleeders were identified, cut, clamped, and cauterized. The incision was deepened to the level of the capsule and the periosteum of the fifth left metatarsophalangeal joint. All the tendinous and neurovascular structures were identified and retracted from the site to be preserved. Using sharp and dull dissection, the soft tissue attachments through the fifth left metatarsal head were mobilized. The lateral and plantar aspect of the fifth left metatarsal head were adequately exposed and using the sagittal saw a lateral and plantar condylectomy of the fifth left metatarsal head were then achieved. The bony prominences were removed and passed off the operating table to be sent to pathology for identification. The remaining sharp edges of the fifth left metatarsal head were then smoothened with the use of a dental rasp. The area was copiously flushed with saline. Then, 3-0 Vicryl and 4-0 Vicryl suture materials were used to approximate the periosteal, capsular, and subcutaneous tissues respectively. The incision was reinforced with Steri-Strips. Range of motion of the fifth left metatarsophalangeal joint was tested and was found to be excellent and uninhibited. The patient's left ankle tourniquet at this time was deflated. Immediate hyperemia was noted to the entire left lower extremity upon deflation of the cuff. The patient's incision was covered with Xeroform, copious amounts of fluff and Kling, stockinette, and Ace bandage and the patient's left foot was placed in a surgical shoe. The patient was then transferred to the recovery room under the care of the anesthesia team with her vital signs stable and her vascular status at appropriate levels. The patient was given pain medications and instructions on how to control her postoperative course. She was discharged from Hospital according to nursing protocol and was will follow up with Dr. X in one week's time for her first postoperative appointment."
486,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left distal radius fracture, metaphyseal extraarticular. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left distal radius fracture, metaphyseal extraarticular. PROCEDURE: Open reduction and internal fixation of left distal radius. IMPLANTS: Wright Medical Micronail size 2. ANESTHESIA: LMA. TOURNIQUET TIME: 49 minutes. BLOOD LOSS: Minimal. COMPLICATIONS: None. PATHOLOGY: None. TIME OUT: Time out was performed before the procedure started. INDICATIONS: The patient was a 42-year-old female who fell and sustained a displaced left metaphyseal distal radius fracture indicated for osteosynthesis. The patient was in early stage of gestation. Benefits and risks including radiation exposure were discussed with the patient and consulted her primary care doctor. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: Supine position, LMA anesthesia, well-padded arm, tourniquet, Hibiclens, alcohol prep, and sterile drape. Exsanguination achieved, tourniquet inflated to 250 mmHg. First, under fluoroscopy the fracture was reduced. A 0.045 K-wire was inserted from dorsal ulnar corner of the distal radius and crossing fracture line to maintain the reduction. A 2-cm radial incision, superficial radial nerve was exposed and protected. Dissecting between the first and second dorsal extensor retinaculum, the second dorsal extensor compartment was elevated off from the distal radius. The guidewire was inserted under fluoroscopy. A cannulated drill was used to drill antral hole. Antral awl was inserted. Then we reamed the canal to size 2. Size 2 Micronail was inserted to the medullary canal. Using distal locking guide, three locking screws were inserted distally. The second dorsal incision was made. The deep radial dorsal surface was exposed. Using locking guide, two proximal shaft screws were inserted and locked the nail to the radius. Fluoroscopic imaging was taken and showing restoration of the height, tilt, and inclination of the radius. At this point, tourniquet was deflated, hemostasis achieved, wounds irrigated and closed in layers. Sterile dressing applied. The patient then was extubated and transferred to the recovery room under stable condition. Postoperatively, the patient will see a therapist within five days. We will immobilize wrist for two weeks and then starting flexion-extension and prosupination exercises."
487,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Severe low back pain. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Severe low back pain. OPERATIONS PERFORMED: Anterior lumbar fusion, L4-L5, L5-S1, PEEK vertebral spacer, structural autograft from L5 vertebral body, BMP and anterior plate. ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Less than 50 mL. DRAINS: None. COMPLICATIONS: None. PATHOLOGICAL FINDINGS: Dr. X made the approach and once we were at the L5-S1 disk space, we removed the disk and we placed a 13-mm PEEK vertebral spacer filled with a core of bone taken from the L5 vertebral body. This was filled with a 15 x 20-mm Chronos VerteFill tricalcium phosphate plug. At L4-L5, we used a 13-mm PEEK vertebral spacer with structural autograft and BMP, and then we placed a two-level 87-mm Integra sacral plate with 28 x 6-mm screws, two each at L4 and L5 and 36 x 6-mm screws at S1. OPERATION IN DETAIL: The patient was placed under general endotracheal anesthesia. The abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual fashion. Dr. X made the approach, and once the L5-S1 disk space was identified, we incised this with a knife and then removed a large core of bone taking rotating cutters. I was able to remove additional disk space and score the vertebral bodies. The rest of the disk removal was done with the curette, scraping the endplates. I tried various sized spacers, and at this point, we exposed the L5 body and took a dowel from the body and filled the hole with a 15 x 20-mm Chronos VerteFill tricalcium phosphate plug. Half of this was used to fill the spacer at L5-S1, BMP was placed in the spacer as well and then it was tapped into place. We then moved the vessels over the opposite way approaching the L4-L5 disk space laterally, and the disk was removed in a similar fashion and we also used a 13-mm PEEK vertebral spacer, but this is the variety that we could put in from one side. This was filled with bone and BMP as well. Once this was done, we were able to place an 87-mm Integra sacral plate down over the three vertebral bodies and place these screws. Following this, bleeding points were controlled and Dr. X proceeded with the closure of the abdomen. SUMMARY: This is a 51-year-old man who reports 15-year history of low back pain and intermittent bilateral leg pain and achiness. He has tried multiple conservative treatments including physical therapy, epidural steroid injections, etc. MRI scan shows a very degenerated disk at L5-S1, less so at L3-L4 and L4-L5. A discogram was positive with the lower 3 levels, but he has pain, which starts below the iliac crest and I feel that the L3-L4 disk is probably that symptomatic. An anterior lumbar interbody fusion was suggested. Procedure, risks, and complications were explained."
488,Orthopedic," CC: Right shoulder pain. HX: This 46 y/o RHF presented with a 4 month history of right neck and shoulder stiffness and pain. The symptoms progressively worsened over the 4 month course. 2 weeks prior to presentation she began to develop numbness in the first and second fingers of her right hand and RUE pain. The later was described as a throbbing pain. She also experienced numbness in both lower extremities and pain in the coccygeal region. The pains worsened at night and impaired sleep. She denied any visual change, bowel or bladder difficulties and symptoms involving the LUE. She occasionally experienced an electric shock like sensation shooting down her spine when flexing her neck (Lhermitte's phenomena). She denied any history of neck/back/head trauma. She had been taking Naprosyn with little relief. PMH: 1) Catamenial Headaches. 2) Allergy to Macrodantin. SHX/FHX: Smokes 2ppd cigarettes. EXAM: Vital signs were unremarkable. CN: unremarkable. Motor: full strength throughout. Normal tone and muscle bulk. Sensory: No deficits on LT/PP/VIB/TEMP/PROP testing. Coord/Gait/Station: Unremarkable. Reflexes: 2/2 in BUE except 2+ at left biceps. 1+/1+BLE except an absent right ankle reflex. Plantar responses were flexor bilaterally. Rectal exam: normal tone. IMPRESSION: C-spine lesion. COURSE: MRI C-spine revealed a central C5-6 disk herniation with compression of the spinal cord at that level. EMG/NCV showed normal NCV, but 1+ sharps and fibrillations in the right biceps (C5-6), brachioradialis (C5-6), triceps (C7-8) and teres major; and 2+ sharps and fibrillations in the right pronator terres. There was increased insertional activity in all muscles tested on the right side. The findings were consistent with a C6-7 radiculopathy. The patient subsequently underwent C5-6 laminectomy and her symptoms resolved."
489,Orthopedic," This is a middle-aged female with an enlarging mass of the left parotid region. FINDINGS: There is a well demarcated mass lesion of the deep lobe of the left parotid gland measuring approximately 2.4 X 3.9 X 3.0cm (AP X transverse X craniocaudal) in size. The lesion is well demarcated. There is a solid peripheral rim with a mean attenuation coefficient of 56.3. There is a central cystic appearing area with a mean attenuation coefficient of 28.1 HU, suggesting an area of central necrosis. There is the suggestion of mild peripheral rim enhancement. This large lesion within the deep lobe of the parotid gland abuts and effaces the facial nerve. Primary consideration is of a benign mixed tumor (pleomorphic adenoma), however, other solid mass lesions cannot be excluded, for which histologic evaluation would be necessary for definitive diagnosis. The right parotid gland is normal. There is mild enlargement of the left jugulodigastric node, measuring 1.1cm in size, with normal morphology (image #33/68). There is mild enlargement of the right jugulodigastric node, measuring 1.2cm in size, with normal morphology (image #38/68). There are demonstrated bilateral deep lateral cervical nodes at the midlevel, measuring 0.6cm on the right side and 0.9cm on the left side (image #29/68). There is a second midlevel deep lateral cervical node demonstrated on the left side (image #20/68), measuring 0.7cm in size. There are small bilateral low level nodes involving the deep lateral cervical nodal chain (image #15/68) measuring 0.5cm in size. There is no demonstrated nodal enlargement of the spinal accessory or pretracheal nodal chains. The right parotid gland is normal and there is no right parotid gland mass lesion. Normal bilateral submandibular glands. Normal parapharyngeal, retropharyngeal and perivertebral spaces. Normal carotid spaces. IMPRESSION: Large, well demarcated mass lesion of the deep lobe of the left parotid gland, with probable involvement of the left facial nerve. See above for size, morphology and pattern enhancement. Primary consideration is of a benign mixed tumor (pleomorphic adenoma), however, other solid mass lesions cannot be excluded, for which histologic evaluation is necessary for specificity. Multiple visualized nodes of the bilateral deep lateral cervical nodal chain, within normal size and morphology, most compatible with mild hyperplasia."
490,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Herniated nucleus pulposus C5-C6. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Herniated nucleus pulposus C5-C6. PROCEDURE: Anterior cervical discectomy fusion C5-C6 followed by instrumentation C5-C6 with titanium dynamic plating system, Aesculap. Operating microscope was used for both illumination and magnification. FIRST ASSISTANT: Nurse practitioner. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was placed in supine position. The neck was prepped and draped in the usual fashion for anterior discectomy and fusion. An incision was made midline to the anterior body of the sternocleidomastoid at C5-C6 level. The skin, subcutaneous tissue, and platysma muscle was divided exposing the carotid sheath, which was retracted laterally. Trachea and esophagus were retracted medially. After placing the self-retaining retractors with the longus colli muscles having been dissected away from the vertebral bodies at C5 and C6 and confirming our position with intraoperative x-rays, we then proceeded with the discectomy. We then cleaned out the disc at C5-C6 after incising the annulus fibrosis. We cleaned out the disc with a combination of angled and straight pituitary rongeurs and curettes, and the next step was to clean out the disc space totally. With this having been done, we then turned our attention with the operating microscope to the osteophytes. We drilled off the vertebral osteophytes at C5-C6, as well as the uncovertebral osteophytes. This was removed along with the posterior longitudinal ligament. After we had done this, the dural sac was opposed very nicely and both C6 nerve roots were thoroughly decompressed. The next step after the decompression of the thecal sac and both C6 nerve roots was the fusion. We observed that there was a ____________ in the posterior longitudinal ligament. There was a free fragment disc, which had broken through the posterior longitudinal ligament just to the right of midline. The next step was to obtain the bone from the back bone, using cortical cancellous graft 10 mm in size after we had estimated the size. That was secured into place with distraction being applied on the vertebral bodies using vertebral body distractor. After we had tapped in the bone plug, we then removed the distraction and the bone plug was fitting nicely. We then use the Aesculap cervical titanium instrumentation with the 16-mm screws. After securing the C5-C6 disc with four screws and titanium plate, x-rays showed good alignment of the spine, good placement of the bone graft, and after x-rays showed excellent position of the bone graft and instrumentation, we then placed in a Jackson-Pratt drain in the prevertebral space brought out through a separate incision. The wound was closed with 2-0 Vicryl for subcutaneous tissues and skin was closed with Steri-Strips. Blood loss during the operation was less than 10 mL. No complications of the surgery. Needle count, sponge count, and cottonoid count were correct."
491,Orthopedic," PROCEDURE: Bilateral L5 dorsal ramus block and bilateral S1, S2, and S3 lateral branch block. INDICATION: Sacroiliac joint pain. INFORMED CONSENT: The risks, benefits and alternatives of the procedure were discussed with the patient. The patient was given opportunity to ask questions regarding the procedure, its indications and the associated risks. The risk of the procedure discussed include infection, bleeding, allergic reaction, dural puncture, headache, nerve injuries, spinal cord injury, and cardiovascular and CNS side effects with possible vascular entry of medications. I also informed the patient of potential side effects or reactions to the medications potentially used during the procedure including sedatives, narcotics, nonionic contrast agents, anesthetics, and corticosteroids. The patient was informed both verbally and in writing. The patient understood the informed consent and desired to have the procedure performed. PROCEDURE: Oxygen saturation and vital signs were monitored continuously throughout the procedure. The patient remained awake throughout the procedure in order to interact and give feedback. The X-ray technician was supervised and instructed to operate the fluoroscopy machine. The patient was placed in the prone position on the treatment table, pillow under the chest, and head rotated contralateral to the side being treated. The skin over and surrounding the treatment area was cleaned with Betadine. The area was covered with sterile drapes, leaving a small window opening for needle placement. Fluoroscopic pillar view was used to identify the bony landmarks of the sacrum and sacroiliac joint and the planned needle approach. The skin, subcutaneous tissue, and muscle within the planned approach were anesthetized with 1% Lidocaine. With fluoroscopy, a 25-gauge 3.5-inch spinal needle was gently guided into the groove between the SAP and sacrum through the dorsal ramus of the L5 and the lateral and superior border of the posterior sacral foramen with the lateral branches of S1, S2, and S3. Multiple fluoroscopic views were used to ensure proper needle placement. Approximately 0.25 mL of nonionic contrast agent was injected showing no concurrent vascular dye pattern. Finally, the treatment solution, consisting of 0.5% of bupivacaine was injected to each area. All injected medications were preservative free. Sterile technique was used throughout the procedure. ADDITIONAL DETAILS: This was then repeated on the left side. COMPLICATIONS: None. DISCUSSION: Postprocedure vital signs and oximetry were stable. The patient was discharged with instructions to ice the injection site as needed for 15-20 minutes as frequently as twice per hour for the next day and to avoid aggressive activities for 1 day. The patient was told to resume all medications. The patient was told to resume normal activities. The patient was instructed to seek immediate medical attention for shortness of breath, chest pain, fever, chills, increased pain, weakness, sensory or motor changes or changes in bowel or bladder function. Follow up appointment was made at the PM&R Spine Clinic in approximately 1 week."
492,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Partial rotator cuff tear with impingement syndrome. 2. Degenerative osteoarthritis of acromioclavicular joint, left shoulder, rule out slap lesion. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Partial rotator cuff tear with impingement syndrome. 2. Degenerative osteoarthritis of acromioclavicular joint, left shoulder. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: 1. Arthroscopy with arthroscopic rotator cuff debridement. 2. Anterior acromioplasty. 3. Mumford procedure left shoulder. SPECIFICATIONS: The entire operative procedure was done in Inpatient Operative Suite, Room #1 at ABCD General Hospital. This was done in a modified beach chair position with interscalene and subsequent general anesthetic. HISTORY AND GROSS FINDINGS: This is a 38-year-old morbidly obese white male suffering increasing pain in his left shoulder for a number of months prior to surgical intervention. He was refractory to conservative outpatient therapy. He had injection of his AC joint, which removed symptoms but was not long lasting. After discussing the alternatives of the care as well as advantages and disadvantages, risks, complications, and expectations, he elected to undergo the above-stated procedure on this date. Intraarticular viewing of the joint revealed a partial rotator cuff tear on the supraspinatus insertion on the joint side. All else was noted to be intact including the glenohumeral joint, the long head of the biceps, and the labrum. The remainder of the rotator cuff observed was noted to be intact. Subacromially, the patient was noted to have increased synovitis. Degenerative changes were noted upon observation of the distal clavicle. OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: The patient was laid supine upon the operative table. After receiving interscalene block anesthetic by Anesthesia Department, the patient was placed in modified beach chair position. He was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner. Portals were created posteriorly and anteriorly from outside to in. A full and complete diagnostic intraarticular arthroscopy was carried out. Debridement was carried out through a 3.5 meniscal shaver to the 4.2 meniscal shaver to the undersurface of the partial tear of the rotator cuff. Retrospectively it was approximately 25% of the generalized thickness. Attention was then turned to the subacromial region. The scope was directed subacromially. A portal was created laterally. Ultimately, the patient needed a general anesthetic once we were closer to the distal clavicle. Gross bursectomy was carried out with a 4.2 meniscal shaver. #18-gauge spinal needles have been placed to outline the anterior acromion prior to this. It was difficult to control the patient's blood pressure with systolics ranging anywhere from 165 or 170 up to 200. Because of this and difficulties with his anesthetic, it was elected to change to an open procedure. Thus, the patient was anesthetized safely and secured. An oblique incision was carried at the cross Langer's line across the outlet of the shoulder through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Hemostasis was controlled via electrocoagulation. Flaps were created. Anterior deltoid was reflected inferiorly. Anterior acromioplasty was carried out with a saw then a Micro-Aire and then a beaver-tail rasp. An excellent decompression was present. CA ligament had been previously resected. We then took the incision over the distal clavicle. The end of the distal clavicle approximately 12 mm to 14 mm was isolated and removed with the Micro-Aire saw. The beaver-tail rasp was utilized to smooth off the edges. Pain buster catheter was placed deep to closure of the AC capsule and then to the deltoid with interrupted #1 Vicryl. Transosseous sutures were placed across the acromion and the deltoid was elevated and closed with the same. A superficial running #2-0 Vicryl suture was utilized for deltoid closure distally. Interrupted #2-0 Vicryl was utilized to subcutaneous fat closure, running #4-0 subcuticular stitch for skin closure and Adaptic, 4x4s, ABDs, and Elastoplast tape placed for compression dressing. 0.25% Marcaine was flooded into the joint prior to the skin closure. Pain buster catheter was hooked up. The patient's arm was placed in arm sling. He was safely transferred to the PACU in apparent satisfactory condition. Expected surgical prognosis on this patient is fair."
493,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Degenerative arthritis of the left knee. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Degenerative arthritis of the left knee. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Total left knee replacement on 08/19/03. The patient also underwent a bilateral right total knee replacement in the same sitting and that will be dictated by Dr. X. TOURNIQUET TIME: 76 minutes. BLOOD LOSS: 150 cc. ANESTHESIA: General. IMPLANT USED FOR PROCEDURE: NexGen size F femur on the left with #8 size peg tibial tray, a #12 mm polyethylene insert and this a cruciate retaining component. The patella on the left was not resurfaced. GROSS INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS: Degenerative ware of three compartments of the trochlea, the medial, as well as the lateral femoral condyles as well was the plateau. The surface of the patella was with a minimal ware and minimal osteophytes and we decided not to resurface the patellar component. HISTORY: This is a 69-year-old male with complaints of bilateral knee pain for several years and increased intensity in the past several months where it has affected his activities of daily living. He attempted conservative treatment, which includes anti-inflammatory medications as well as cortisone and Synvisc. This has only provided him with temporary relief. It is for that reason, he is elected to undergo the above-named procedure. All risks as well as complications were discussed with the patient, which include, but are not limited to infection, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, need for further surgery, and further pain. He has agreed to undergo this procedure and a consent was obtained preoperatively. PROCEDURE: The patient was wheeled back to operating room #2 at ABCD General Hospital on 08/19/03 and was placed supine on the operating room table. At this time, a nonsterile tourniquet was placed on the left upper thigh, but not inflated. An Esmarch was then used to exsanguinate the extremity and the left extremity was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion for this procedure. The tourniquet was then inflated to 325 mmHg. At this time, a standard midline incision was made towards the total knee. We did discuss preoperatively for a possible unicompartmental knee replacement for this patient, but he did have radiographic evidence of chondrocalcinosis of the lateral meniscus. We did start off with a small midline skin incision in case we were going to do a unicompartmental. Once we exposed the medial parapatellar mini-arthrotomy and visualized the lateral femoral condyle, we decided that this patient would not be an optimal candidate for unicompartmental knee replacement. It is for this reason that we extended the incision and underwent with the total knee replacement. Once the full medial parapatellar arthrotomy was performed with the subperiosteal dissection of the proximal tibia in order to evert the patella. Once the patella was everted, we then used a drill to cannulate the distal femoral canal in order to place the intramedullary guide. A Charnley awl was then used to remove all the intramedullary contents and they were removed from the knee. At this time, a femoral sizer was then placed with reference to the posterior condyles and we measured a size F. Once this was performed, three degrees of external rotation was then drilled into the condyle in alignment with the epicondyles of the femur. At this time, the intramedullary guide was then inserted and placed in three degrees of external rotation. Our anterior cutting guide was then placed and an anterior cut was performed with careful protection of the soft tissues. Next, this was removed and the distal femoral cutting guide was then placed in five degrees of valgus. This was pinned to the distal femur and with careful protection of the collateral ligaments, a distal femoral cut was performed. At this time, the intramedullary guide was removed and a final cutting block was placed. This was placed in the center on the distal femur with 1 mm to 2 mm laterally translated for better patellar tracking. At this time, the block was pinned and screwed in place with spring pins with careful protection of the soft tissues. An oscillating saw was then used to resect the posterior and anterior cutting blocks with anterior and posterior chamfer as well as the notch cut. Peg holes were then drilled. The block was then removed and an osteotome was then used to remove all the bony cut pieces. At this time with a better exposure of the proximal tibia, we placed external tibial guide. This was placed with longitudinal axis of the tibia and carefully positioned in order to obtain an optimal cut for the proximal tibia. At this time with careful soft tissue retraction and protection, an oscillating saw was used to make a proximal tibial osteotomy. Prior to the osteotomy, the cut was checked with a depth gauge in order to assure appropriate bony resection. At this time, a _blunt Kocher and Bovie cautery were used to remove the proximal tibial cut, which had soft tissue attachments. Once this was removed, we then implanted our trial components of size F to the femur and a size 8 mm tibial tray with 12 mm plastic articulating surface. The knee was taken through range of motion and revealed excellent femorotibial articulation. The patella did tend to sublux somewhat laterally with extremes of flexion and it was for this reason, we performed a minimal small incision lateral retinacular release. Distal lateral patella was tracked more uniformly within the patellar groove of the prosthesis. At this time, an intraoperative x-ray was performed, which revealed excellent alignment with no varus angulation especially of the whole femur and tibial alignment and tibial cut. At this time, the prosthesis was removed. A McGill retractor was then reinserted and replaced peg tibial tray in order to peg the proximal tibia. Once the drill holes were performed, we then copiously irrigated the wound and then suctioned it dry to get ready and prepped for cementation of the drilled components. At this time, polymethyl methacrylate cement was then mixed. The cement was placed on the tibial surface as well as the underneath surface of the component. The component was then placed and impacted with excess cement removed. In a similar fashion, the femoral component was also placed. A 12 mm plastic tray was then placed and the leg held in full extension and compression in order to obtain adequate bony cement content. Once the cement was fully hardened, the knee was flexed and a small osteotome was used to remove any extruding cement from around the prosthesis of the bone. Once this was performed, copious irrigation was used to irrigate the wound and the wound was then suctioned dry. The knee was again taken through range of motion with a 12 mm plastic as well as #14. The #14 appeared to be a bit too tight especially in extremes of flexion. We decided to go with a #12 mm polyethylene tray. At this time, this was placed to the tibial articulation and then left in place. This was rechecked with careful attention to detail with checking no soft tissue interpositioned between the polyethylene tray and the metal tray of the tibia. The knee was again taken through range of motion and revealed excellent tracking of the patella with good femur and tibial contact. A drain was placed and cut to length. At this time, the knee was irrigated and copiously suction dried. #1-0 Ethibond suture was then used to approximate the medial parapatellar arthrotomy in figure-of-eight fashion. A tight capsular closure was performed. This was reinforced with a #1-0 running Vicryl suture. At this time, the knee was again taken through range of motion to assure tight capsular closure. At this time, copious irrigation was used to irrigate the superficial wound. #2-0 Vicryl was used to approximate the wound with figure-of-eight inverted suture. The skin was then approximated with staples. The leg was then cleansed. Sterile dressing consisting of Adaptic, 4x4, ABDs, and Kerlix roll were then applied. At this time, the patient was extubated and transferred to recovery in stable condition. Prognosis is good for this patient."

The patient was brought to the operating room and given preoperative antibiotics. Left leg was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. A midline incision was made in the center of the knee and was carried down sharply to the retinacular tissue. The starting guidewire was used to localize the correct starting point, which is on the medial aspect of the lateral tibial eminence. This was advanced and confirmed on the AP and lateral fluoroscopic images. The opening reamer was then used and the ball-tip guidewire was passed. The reduction was obtained over a large radiolucent triangle. After passing the guidewire and achieving appropriate reduction, the flexible reamers were then sequentially passed, starting at 9 mm up to 11.5 mm reamer. At this point, a 10 x 390 mm was passed without difficulty. The guide was used to the proximal locking screw and the appropriate circle technique was used to the distal locking screws. The final images were taken with fluoroscopy and a 15-mm end-cap was placed. The wounds were then irrigated and closed with 2-0 Vicryl followed by staples to the distal screws and 0 Vicryl followed 2-0 Vicryl and staples to the proximal incision. The patient was placed in a short leg, well-padded splint, was awakened and taken to recovery in good condition. The plan will be nonweightbearing left lower extremity. He will be placed in a short leg splint and should be transitioned to a short leg cast for the next 4 weeks."
495,Orthopedic," MM/DD/YYYY XYZ, D.C. 60 Evergreen Place Suite 902 East Orange, NJ 07018 Re: ABC Dear Dr. XYZ: ABC was evaluated today, MM/DD/YYYY, in follow up evaluation. He continues to suffer from neck and lower back pain radiating into both arms and both legs with numbness, paraesthesia, and tingling in both arms. He had moderate relief with his prior trigger point injections for approximately one month. His evaluation today continues to reveal restriction of range of motion of the cervical and lumbar region with tenderness and spasm in the paraspinal musculature. The exam otherwise was unchanged. Palpable trigger points were noted bilaterally in the lumbar paraspinal musculature. He continues to suffer from ongoing myofascitis and his treatment plan will consist of a series of trigger point injections, which were performed today. He tolerated the procedure well. He is to ice the region intermittently for 15 minutes off and on x 3 and he will be followed for repeat trigger point injections in two weeks' time if indicated. He is to continue with his treatment program under your care and supervision. Yours sincerely,"
496,Orthopedic," PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: After written consent was obtained from the patient, the patient was brought back into the operating room and identified. The patient was placed in the operating room table in supine position and given general anesthetic. Ancef 1 g was given for infectious prophylaxis. Once the patient was under general anesthesia, the knee was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion. Once the knee was fully prepped and draped, then we made 2 standard portals medial and lateral. Through the lateral portal, the camera was placed. Through the medial portal, tools were placed. We proceeded to examine scarring of the patellofemoral joint. Then we probed the patellofemoral joint. A chondroplasty was performed using a shaver. Then we moved down to the lateral gutter. Some loose bodies were found using a shaver and dissection. We moved down the medial gutter. No plica was found. We moved into the medial joint; we found that the medial meniscus was intact. We moved to the lateral joint and found that the lateral meniscus was intact. Pictures were taken. We drained the knee and washed out the knee with copious amounts of sterile saline solution. The instruments were removed. The 2 portals were closed using 3-0 nylon suture. Xeroform, 4 x 4s, Kerlix x2, and TED stocking were placed. The patient was successfully extubated and brought to the recovery room in stable condition. I then spoke with the family going over the case, postoperative instructions, and followup care."
497,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right wrist pain with an x-ray showing a scapholunate arthritic collapse pattern arthritis with osteophytic spurring of the radial styloid and a volar radial wrist mass suspected of being a volar radial ganglion. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right wrist pain with an x-ray showing a scapholunate arthritic collapse pattern arthritis with osteophytic spurring of the radial styloid and a volar radial wrist mass suspected of being a volar radial ganglion; finding of volar radial wrist mass of bulging inflammatory tenosynovitis from the volar radial wrist joint rather than a true ganglion cyst; synovitis was debrided and removed. PROCEDURE: Excision of volar radial wrist mass (inflammatory synovitis) and radial styloidectomy, right wrist. ANESTHESIA: Axillary block plus IV sedation. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Zero. SPECIMENS 1. Inflammatory synovitis from the volar radial wrist area. 2. Inflammatory synovitis from the dorsal wrist area. DRAINS: None. PROCEDURE DETAIL: Patient brought to the operating room. After induction of IV sedation a right upper extremity axillary block anesthetic was performed by anesthesia staff. Routine prep and drape was employed. Patient received 1 gm of IV Ancef preoperatively. Arm was exsanguinated by means of elevation of Esmarch elastic tourniquet. Tourniquet inflated to 250 mmHg pressure. Hand positioned palm up in a lead hand-holder. A longitudinal zigzag incision over the volar radial wrist mass was made. Skin was sharply incised. Careful blunt dissection was used in the subcutaneous tissue. Antebrachial fascia was bluntly dissected and incised to reveal the radial artery. Radial artery was mobilized preserving its dorsal and palmar branches. Small transverse concomitant vein branches were divided to facilitate mobilization of the radial artery. Wrist mass was exposed by blunt dissection. This appeared to be an inflammatory arthritic mass from the volar radial wrist capsule. This was debrided down to the wrist capsule with visualization of the joint through a small capsular window. After complete volar synovectomy the capsular window was closed with 4-0 Mersilene figure-of-eight suture. Subcutaneous tissue was closed with 4-0 PDS and the skin was closed with a running subcuticular 4-0 Prolene. Forearm was pronated and C-arm image intensifier was used to confirm localization of the radial styloid for marking of the skin incision. An oblique incision overlying the radial styloid centered on the second extensor compartment was made. Skin was sharply incised. Blunt dissection was used in the subcutaneous tissue. Care was taken to identify and protect the superficial radial nerve. Blunt dissection was carried out in the extensor retinaculum. This was incised longitudinally over the second extensor compartment. EPL tendon was identified, mobilized and released to facilitate retraction and prevent injury. The interval between the ECRL and the ECRB was developed down to bone. Dorsal capsulotomy was made and local synovitis was identified. This was debrided and sent as second pathologic specimen. Articular surface of the scaphoid was identified and seen to be completely devoid of articular cartilage with hard, eburnated subchondral bone consistent with a SLAC pattern arthritis. Radial styloid had extensive spurring and was exposed subperiosteally and osteotomized in a dorsal oblique fashion preserving the volar cortex as the attachment point of the deep volar carpal ligament layer. Dorsally the styloidectomy was beveled smooth and contoured with a rongeur. Final x-rays documenting the styloidectomy were obtained. Local synovitis beneath the joint capsule was debrided. Remnants of the scapholunate interosseous which was completely deteriorated were debrided. The joint capsule was closed anatomically with 4-0 PDS and extensor retinaculum was closed with 4-0 PDS. Subcutaneous tissues closed with 4-0 Vicryl. Skin was closed with running subcuticular 4-0 Prolene. Steri-Strips were applied to wound edge closure; 10 cc of 0.5% plain Marcaine was infiltrated into the areas of the surgical incisions and radial styloidectomy for postoperative analgesia. A bulky gently compressive wrist and forearm bandage incorporating an EBI cooling pad were applied. Tourniquet was deflated. Good vascular color and capillary refill were seen to return to the tips of all digits. Patient discharged to the ambulatory recovery area and from there discharged home. DISCHARGE PRESCRIPTIONS: 1. Keflex 500 mg tablets, #20, one PO q.6h. x 5 days. 2. Vicodin, 40 tablets, one to two PO q.4h. p.r.n. 3. Percocet, #20 tablets, one to two PO q.3-4h. p.r.n. severe pain."
498,Orthopedic," CHIEF COMPLAINT: Back pain and right leg pain. The patient has a three-year history of small cell lung cancer with metastases. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is on my schedule today to explore treatment of the above complaints. She has a two-year history of small cell lung cancer, which she says has spread to metastasis in both femurs, her lower lumbar spine, and her pelvis. She states she has had numerous chemotherapy and radiation treatments and told me that she has lost count. She says she has just finished a series of 10 radiation treatments for pain relief. She states she continues to have significant pain symptoms. Most of her pain seems to be in her low back on the right side, radiating down the back of her right leg to her knee. She has also some numbness in the bottom of her left foot, and some sharp pain in the left foot at times. She complains of some diffuse, mid back pain. She describes the pain as sharp, dull, and aching in nature. She rates her back pain as 10, her right leg pain as 10, with 0 being no pain and 10 being the worst possible pain. She states that it seems to be worse while sitting in the car with prolonged sitting, standing, or walking. She is on significant doses of narcotics. She has had multiple CT scans looking for metastasis. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Significant for cancer as above. She also has a depression. PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Significant for a chest port placement. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Consist of Duragesic patch 250 mcg total, Celebrex 200 mg once daily, iron 240 mg twice daily, Paxil 20 mg daily, and Percocet. She does not know of what strength up to eight daily. She also is on warfarin 1 mg daily, which she states is just to keep her chest port patent. She is on Neurontin 300 mg three times daily. HABITS: She smokes one pack a day for last 30 years. She drinks beer approximately twice daily. She denies use of recreational drugs. SOCIAL HISTORY: She is married. She lives with her spouse. FAMILY HISTORY: Significant for two brothers and father who have cancer. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Significant mainly for her pain complaints. For other review of systems the patient seems stable. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: General: Reveals a pleasant somewhat emaciated Caucasian female. Vital Signs: Height is 5 feet 2 inches. Weight is 130 pounds. She is afebrile. HEENT: Benign. Neck: Shows functional range of movements with a negative Spurling's. Chest: Clear to auscultation. Heart: Regular rate and rhythm. Abdomen: Soft, regular bowel sounds. Musculoskeletal: Examination shows functional range of joint movements. No focal muscle weakness. She is deconditioned. Neurologic: She is alert and oriented with appropriate mood and affect. The patient has normal tone and coordination. Reflexes are 2+ in both knees and absent at both ankles. Sensations are decreased distally in the left foot, otherwise intact to pinprick. Spine: Examination of her lumbar spine shows normal lumbar lordosis with fairly functional range of movement. The patient had significant tenderness at her lower lumbar facet and sacroiliac joints, which seems to reproduce a lot of her low back and right leg complaints. FUNCTIONAL EXAMINATION: Gait has a normal stance and swing phase with no antalgic component to it. INVESTIGATION: She has had again multiple scans including a whole body bone scan, which showed abnormal uptake involving the femurs bilaterally. She has had increased uptake in the sacroiliac joint regions bilaterally. CT of the chest showed no evidence of recurrent metastatic disease. CT of the abdomen showed no evidence of metastatic disease. MRI of the lower hip joints showed heterogenous bone marrow signal in both proximal femurs. CT of the pelvis showed a trabecular pattern with healed metastases. CT of the orbits showed small amount of fluid in the mastoid air cells on the right, otherwise normal CT scan. MR of the brain showed no acute intracranial abnormalities and no significant interval changes. IMPRESSION: 1. Small cell lung cancer with metastasis at the lower lumbar spine, pelvis, and both femurs. 2. Symptomatic facet and sacroiliac joint syndrome on the right. 3. Chronic pain syndrome. RECOMMENDATIONS: Dr. XYZ and I discussed with the patient her pathology. Dr. XYZ explained her although she does have lung cancer metastasis, she seems to be symptomatic with primarily pain at her lower lumbar facet and sacroiliac joints on the right. Secondary to the patient's significant pain complaints today, Dr. XYZ will plan on injecting her right sacroiliac and facet joints under fluoroscopy today. I explained the rationale for the procedure, possible complications, and she voiced understanding and wished to proceed. She understands that she is on warfarin therapy and that we generally do not perform injections while they are on this. We have asked for stat protime today. She is on a very small dose, she states she has had previous biopsies while on this before, and did not have any complications. She is on significant dose of narcotics already, however, she continues to have pain symptoms. Dr. XYZ advised that if she continues to have pain, even after this injection, she could put on an extra 50 mcg patch and take a couple of extra Percocet if needed. I will plan on evaluating her in the Clinic on Tuesday. I have also asked that she stop her Paxil, and we plan on starting her on Cymbalta instead. She voiced understanding and is in agreement with this plan. I have also asked her to get an x-ray of the lumbar spine for further evaluation. Physical exam, findings, history of present illness, and recommendations were performed with and in agreement with Dr. G's findings. Peripheral neuropathy of her left foot is most likely secondary to her chemo and radiation treatments."
499,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Patellar tendon retinaculum ruptures, right knee. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Patellar tendon retinaculum ruptures, right knee. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Patellar tendon and medial and lateral retinaculum repair, right knee. SPECIFICATIONS: Intraoperative procedure done at Inpatient Operative Suite, room #2 of ABCD Hospital. This was done under subarachnoid block anesthetic in supine position. HISTORY AND GROSS FINDINGS: The patient is a 45-year-old African-American male who suffered acute rupture of his patellar tendon diagnosed both by exam as well as x-ray the evening before surgical intervention. He did this while playing basketball. He had a massive deficit at the inferior pole of his patella on exam. Once opened, he had complete rupture of this patellar tendon as well as a complete rupture of his medial lateral retinaculum. Minimal cartilaginous pieces were at the patellar tendon. He had grade II changes to his femoral sulcus as well as grade I-II changes to the undersurface of the patella. OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: The patient was laid supine on the operative table receiving a subarachnoid block anesthetic by Anesthesia Department. A thigh high tourniquet was placed. He is prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner. Limb was elevated, exsanguinated and tourniquet placed at 325 mmHg for approximately 30 to 40 minutes. Straight incision is carried down through skin and subcutaneous tissue anteriorly. Hemostasis was controlled via electrocoagulation. Patellar tendon was isolated along with the patella itself. A 6 mm Dacron tape x2 was placed with a modified Kessler tendon stitch with a single limb both medially and laterally and a central limb with subsequent shared tape. The inferior pole was freshened up. Drill bit was utilized to make holes x3 longitudinally across the patella and the limbs strutted up through the patella with a suture passer. This was tied over the bony bridge superiorly. There was excellent reduction of the tendon to the patella. Interrupted running #1-Vicryl suture was utilized for over silk. A running #2-0 Vicryl for synovial closure medial and laterally as well as #1-Vicryl medial and lateral retinaculum. There was excellent repair. Copious irrigation was carried out. Tourniquet was dropped and hemostasis controlled via electrocoagulation. Interrupted #2-0 Vicryl was utilized for subcutaneous fat closure and skin staples were placed through the skin. Adaptic, 4 x 4s, ABDs, and sterile Webril were placed for compression dressing. Digits were warm and no brawny pulses present at the end of the case. The patient's leg was placed in a Don-Joy brace 0 to 20 degrees of flexion. He will leave this until seen in the office. Expected surgical prognosis on this patient is fair."
500,Orthopedic," DIAGNOSIS: Synovitis/anterior cruciate ligament tear of the left knee. HISTORY: The patient is a 52-year-old male, who was referred to Physical Therapy, secondary to left knee pain. The patient states that on 10/02/08, the patient fell in a grocery store. He reports slipping on a grape that was on the floor. The patient states he went to the emergency room and then followed up with his primary care physician. The patient was then ultimately referred to Physical Therapy. After receiving a knee brace, history and information was received through a translator as the patient is Spanish speaking only. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Past medical history is unremarkable. MEDICAL IMAGING: Medical imaging is significant for x-rays and MRIs. The report was available at the time of the evaluation. The patient reports abnormal posterior horn of medial meniscus consistent with knee degenerative change and possibly tears. MEDICATIONS: 1. Tramadol. 2. Diclofenac. 3. Advil. 4. Tylenol. SUBJECTIVE: The patient rates his pain at 6/10 on the Pain Analog Scale, primarily with ambulation. The patient does deny pain at night. The patient does present with his knee brace on the exterior of his __________ leg and appears to be on backboard. FUNCTIONAL ACTIVITIES AND HOBBIES: Functional activities and hobbies that are currently limited include any work as the patient is currently unemployed and is looking for a job; however, his primary skills are of a laborer and a street broker for new homes. OBJECTIVE: Upon observation, the patient is ambulating with a significant antalgic gait pattern. However, he is not using any assistive device. The knee brace was corrected and the patient and his wife demonstrated understanding and knowledge of how to place the knee brace on correctly.

Gait training and work specific training. I have explained the findings and the plan of care with the patient and his wife. They state understanding and in agreement to treatment plan indicated above."
501,Orthopedic," PROCEDURE: Carpal tunnel release with transverse carpal ligament reconstruction. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: After administering appropriate antibiotics and MAC anesthesia, the upper extremity was prepped and draped in the usual standard fashion. The arm was exsanguinated with Esmarch, and the tourniquet inflated to 250 mmHg. A longitudinal incision was made in line with the fourth ray, from Kaplan's cardinal line proximally to 1 cm distal to the volar wrist crease. The dissection was carried down to the superficial aponeurosis. The subcutaneous fat was dissected radially for 2-3 mm, and the superficial aponeurosis cut on this side to leave a longer ulnar leaf. The ulnar leaf of the cut superficial aponeurosis was dissected ulnarly, and the distal edge of the transverse carpal ligament was identified with a hemostat. The hemostat was gently placed under the transverse carpal ligament to protect the contents of the carpal tunnel, and the ligament was cut on its ulnar side with a knife directly onto the hemostat. The antebrachial fascia was cut proximally under direct vision with a scissor. After irrigating the wound with copious amounts of normal saline, the radial leaf of the cut transverse carpal ligament was repaired to the ulnar leaf of the cut superficial aponeurosis with 4-0 Vicryl. Care was taken to avoid entrapping the motor branch of the median nerve in the suture. A hemostat was placed under the repair to ensure that the median nerve was not compressed. The skin was repaired with 5-0 nylon interrupted stitches. Marcaine with epinephrine was injected into the wound, which was then dressed and splinted. The patient was sent to the recovery room in good condition, having tolerated the procedure well."
502,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Carpal tunnel syndrome. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Carpal tunnel syndrome. PROCEDURE: Endoscopic release of left transverse carpal ligament. ANESTHESIA: Monitored anesthesia care with regional anesthesia provided by surgeon. TOURNIQUET TIME: 12 minutes. OPERATIVE PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: With the patient under adequate monitored anesthesia, the left upper extremity was prepped and draped in a sterile manner. The arm was exsanguinated. The tourniquet was elevated at 290 mmHg. Construction lines were made on the left palm to identify the ring ray. A transverse incision was made in the palm between FCR and FCU, one finger breadth proximal to the interval between the glabrous skin of the palm and normal forearm skin. Blunt dissection exposed the antebrachial fascia. Hemostasis was obtained with bipolar cautery. A distal based window in the antebrachial fascia was then fashioned. Care was taken to protect the underlying contents. A synovial elevator was used to palpate the undersurface of the transverse carpal ligament, and synovium was elevated off this undersurface. Hamate sounds were then used to palpate the Hood of Hamate. The Agee Inside Job was then inserted into the proximal incision. The transverse carpal ligament was easily visualized through the portal. Using palmar pressure, transverse carpal ligament was held against the portal as the instrument was inserted down the transverse carpal ligament to the distal end. The distal end of the transverse carpal ligament was then identified in the window. The blade was then elevated, and the Agee Inside Job was withdrawn, dividing transverse carpal ligament under direct vision. After complete division of transverse carpal ligament, the Agee Inside Job was reinserted. Radial and ulnar edges of the transverse carpal ligament were identified and complete release was accomplished. One cc of Celestone was then introduced into the carpal tunnel and irrigated free. The wound was then closed with a running 3-0 Prolene subcuticular stitch. Steri-strips were applied and a sterile dressing was applied over the Steri-strips. The tourniquet was deflated. The patient was awakened from anesthesia and returned to the recovery room in satisfactory condition having tolerated the procedure well."
503,Orthopedic," EXAM: CT cervical spine (C-spine) for trauma. FINDINGS: CT examination of the cervical spine was performed without contrast. Coronal and sagittal reformats were obtained for better anatomical localization. Cervical vertebral body height, alignment and interspacing are maintained. There is no evidence of fractures or destructive osseous lesions. There are no significant degenerative endplate or facet changes. No significant osseous central canal or foraminal narrowing is present. IMPRESSION: Negative cervical spine."
504,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Metatarsus primus varus with bunion deformity, right foot. 2. Hallux abductovalgus with angulation deformity, right foot. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Metatarsus primus varus with bunion deformity, right foot. 2. Hallux abductovalgus with angulation deformity, right foot. PROCEDURES: 1. Distal metaphyseal osteotomy and bunionectomy with internal screw fixation, right foot. 2. Reposition osteotomy with internal screw fixation to correct angulation deformity of proximal phalanx, right foot. ANESTHESIA: Local infiltrate with IV sedation. INDICATION FOR SURGERY: The patient has had a longstanding history of foot problems. The foot problem has been progressive in nature and has not been responsive to conservative treatment. The preoperative discussion with the patient included the alternative treatment options. The procedure was explained in detail and risk factors such as infection, swelling, scarred tissue; numbness, continued pain, recurrence, and postoperative management were explained in detail. The patient has been advised, although no guaranty for success could be given, most patients have improved function and less pain. All questions were thoroughly answered. The patient requested surgical repair since the problem has reached a point that interferes with her normal daily activities. The purpose of the surgery is to alleviate the pain and discomfort. DETAILS OF PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the operating room and placed in a supine position. No tourniquet was utilized. IV sedation was administered and during that time local anesthetic consisting of approximately 10 mL total in a 1:1 mixture of 0.25% Marcaine and 1% lidocaine with epinephrine was locally infiltrated proximal to the operative site. The lower extremity was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner. Balanced anesthesia was obtained. PROCEDURE #1: Distal metaphyseal osteotomy with internal screw fixation with bunionectomy, right foot. A dorsal curvilinear incision medial to the extensor hallucis longus tendon was made, extending from the distal third of the shaft of the first metatarsal to a point midway on the shaft of the proximal phalanx. Care was taken to identify and retract the vital structures and when necessary, vessels were ligated via electrocautery. Sharp and blunt dissection was carried down through the subcutaneous tissue, superficial fascia, and then down to the capsular and periosteal layer, which was visualized. A linear periosteal capsular incision was made in line with the skin incision. The capsular tissue and periosteal layer were underscored, free from its underlying osseous attachments, and they refracted to expose the osseous surface. Inspection revealed increased first intermetatarsal angle and hypertrophic changes to the first metatarsal head. The head of the first metatarsal was dissected free from its attachment medially and dorsally, delivered dorsally and may be into the wound. Inspection revealed the first metatarsophalangeal joint surface appeared to be in satisfactory condition. The sesamoid was in satisfactory condition. An oscillating saw was utilized to resect the hypertrophic portion of the first metatarsal head to remove the normal and functional configuration. Care was taken to preserve the sagittal groove. The rough edges were then smoothed with a rasp. Attention was then focused on the medial mid portion of the first metatarsal head where a K-wire access guide was positioned to define the apex and direction of displacement for the capital fragment. The access guide was noted to be in good position. A horizontally placed, through-and-through osteotomy with the apex distal and the base proximal was completed. The short plantar arm was from the access guide to proximal plantar and the long dorsal arm was from the access guide to proximal dorsal. The capital fragment was distracted off the first metatarsal, moved laterally to decrease the intermetatarsal angle to create a more anatomical and functional position of the first metatarsal head. The capital fragment was impacted upon the metatarsal. Inspection revealed satisfactory reduction of the intermetatarsal angle and good alignment of the capital fragment. It was then fixated with 1 screw. A guide pin was directed from the dorsal aspect of the capital fragment to the plantar aspect of the shaft and first metatarsal in a distal dorsal to proximal plantar direction. The length was measured, __________ mm cannulated cortical screw was placed over the guide pin and secured in position. Compression and fixation were noted to be satisfactory. Inspection revealed good fixation and alignment at the operative site. Attention was then directed to the medial portion of the distal third of the shaft of the first metatarsal where an oscillating saw was used to resect the small portion of the bone that was created by shifting the capital fragment laterally. All rough edges were rasped smooth. Examination revealed there was still lateral deviation of the hallux. A second procedure, the reposition osteotomy of the proximal phalanx with internal screw fixation to correct angulation deformity was indicated. PROCEDURE #2: Reposition osteotomy with internal screw fixation to correct angulation deformity, proximal phalanx, right hallux. The original skin incision was extended from the point just distal to the interphalangeal joint. All vital structures were identified and retracted. Sharp and blunt dissection was carried down through the subcutaneous tissue, superficial fascia, and down to the periosteal layer, which was underscored, free from its underlying osseous attachments and reflected to expose the osseous surface. The focus of the deformity was noted to be more distal on the hallux. Utilizing an oscillating saw, a more distal, wedge-shaped transverse oblique osteotomy was made with the apex being proximal and lateral and the base medial distal was affected. The proximal phalanx was then placed in appropriate alignment and stabilized with a guide pin, which was then measured, __________ 14 mm cannulated cortical screw was placed over the guide pin and secured into position. Inspection revealed good fixation and alignment at the osteotomy site. The alignment and contour of the first way was now satisfactorily improved. The entire surgical wound was flushed with copious amounts of sterile normal saline irrigation. The periosteal and capsular layer was closed with running sutures of #3-0 Vicryl. The subcutaneous tissue was closed with #4-0 Vicryl and the skin edges coapted well with #4-0 nylon with running simples, reinforced with Steri-Strips. Approximately 6 mL total in a 1:1 mixture of 0.25% Marcaine and 1% lidocaine plain was locally infiltrated proximal to the operative site for postoperative anesthesia. A dressing consisting of Adaptic and 4 x 4 was applied to the wound making sure the hallux was carefully splinted, followed by confirming bandages and an ACE wrap to provide mild compression. The patient tolerated the procedure and anesthesia well and left the operating room to recovery room in good postoperative condition with vital signs stable and arterial perfusion intact as evident by the normal capillary fill time. A walker boot was dispensed and applied. The patient should wear it when walking or standing. The next office visit will be in 4 days. The patient was given prescriptions for Percocet 5 mg #40 one p.o. q.4-6h. p.r.n. pain, along with written and oral home instructions. The patient was discharged home with vital signs stable in no acute distress."
505,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Closed displaced probable pathological fracture, basicervical femoral neck, left hip. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Closed displaced probable pathological fracture, basicervical femoral neck, left hip. PROCEDURES PERFORMED: 1. Left hip cemented hemiarthroplasty. 2. Biopsy of the tissue from the fracture site and resected femoral head sent to the pathology for further assessment. IMPLANTS USED: 1. DePuy Ultima calcar stem, size 3 x 45. 2. Bipolar head 28 x 43. 3. Head with +0 neck length. 4. Distal centralizer and cement restrictor. 5. SmartSet antibiotic cement x2. ANESTHESIA: General. NEEDLE AND SPONGE COUNT: Correct. COMPLICATIONS: None. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 300 mL. SPECIMEN: Resected femoral head and tissue from the fracture site as well as the marrow from the canal. FINDINGS: On exposure, the fracture was noted to be basicervical pattern with no presence of calcar about the lesser trochanter. The lesser trochanter was intact. The fracture site was noted to show abnormal pathological tissue with grayish discoloration. The quality of the bone was also pathologically abnormal with soft trabecular bone. The abnormal pathological tissues were sent along with the femoral head to pathology for assessment. Articular cartilage of the acetabulum was intact and well preserved. INDICATION: The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of malignant melanoma, who apparently had severe pain in her left lower extremity and was noted to have a basicervical femoral neck fracture. She denied any history of fall or trauma. The presentation was consistent with pathological fracture pending tissue assessment. Indication, risks, and benefits were discussed. Treatment options were reviewed. No guarantees have been made or implied. PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the operating room and once an adequate general anesthesia was achieved, she was positioned on a pegboard with the left side up. The left lower extremity was prepped and draped in a standard sterile fashion. Time-out procedure was called. Antibiotics were infused. A standard posterolateral approach was made. Subcutaneous dissection was performed and the dissection was carried down to expose the fascia of the gluteus maximus. This was then incised along the line of the incision. Hemostasis was achieved. Charnley retractor was positioned. The trochanter was intact. The gluteus medius was well protected with retractor. The piriformis and minimus junction was identified. The minimus was also reflected along with the medius. Using Bovie and knife, the piriformis and external rotators were detached from its trochanteric insertion. Similarly, L-shaped capsulotomy was performed. A #5 Ethibond was utilized to tag the piriformis and the capsule for late repair. Fracture site was exposed. The femoral neck fracture was noted to be very low-lying basicervical type. Femoral head was retrieved without any difficulty with the help of a corkscrew. The head size was measured to be 43 mm. Bony fragments were removed. The acetabular socket was thoroughly irrigated. A 43-mm bipolar trial head was inserted and this was noted to give a satisfactory fit with good stability. The specimens submitted to pathology included the resected femoral head and the tissue at the fracture site, which was abnormal with grayish discoloration. This was sent to the pathology. The fracture was noted to be basicervical and preoperatively, decision was made to consider cemented calcar stem. An L-shaped osteotomy was performed in order to accept the calcar prosthesis. The basicervical fracture was noted to be just at the level of superior border of the lesser trochanter. There was no calcar superior to the lesser trochanter. The L-shaped osteotomy was performed to refine the bony edges and accept the calcar prosthesis. Hemostasis was achieved. Now, the medullary canal was entered with a canal finder. The fracture site was well exposed. Satisfactory lateralization was performed. Attention was for the reaming process. Using a size 1 reamer, the medullary canal was entered and reamed up to size 3, which gave us a satisfactory fit into the canal. At this point, a trial prosthesis size 3 with 45 mm calcar body was inserted. Appropriate anteversion was positioned. The anteversion was marked with a Bovie to identify subsequent anteversion during implantation. The bony edges were trimmed. The calcar implant with 45 mm neck length was fit in the host femur very well. There was no evidence of any subsidence. At this point, trial reduction was performed using a bipolar trial head with 0 neck length. The relationship between the central femoral head and the greater trochanter was satisfactory. The hip was well reduced without any difficulty. The stability and range of motion in extension and external rotation as well as flexion-adduction, internal rotation was satisfactory. The shuck was less than 1 mm. Leg length was satisfactory in reference to the contralateral leg. Stability was satisfactory at 90 degrees of flexion and hip at 75-80 degrees of internal rotation. Similarly, keeping the leg completely adducted, I was able to internally rotate the hip to 45 degrees. After verifying the stability and range of motion in all direction, trial components were removed. The canal was thoroughly irrigated and dry sponge was inserted and canal was dried completely. At this point, 2 batches of SmartSet cement with antibiotics were mixed. The definitive Ultima calcar stem size 3 with 45 mm calcar body was selected. Centralizer was positioned. The cement restrictor was inserted. Retrograde cementing technique was applied once the canal was dried. Using cement gun, retrograde cementing was performed. The stem was then inserted into cemented canal with appropriate anteversion, which was maintained until the cement was set hard and cured. The excess cement was removed with the help of a curette and Freer elevator. All the cement debris was removed. Attention was now placed for the insertion of the trial femoral head. Once again, 0 neck length trial bipolar head was inserted over the trunnion. It was reduced and range of motion and stability was satisfactory. I also attempted with a -3 trial head, but the 0 gave us a satisfactory stability, range of motion, as well as the length and the shuck was also minimal. The hip was raised to 90 degrees of flexion and 95 degrees of internal rotation. There was no evidence of any impingement on extension and external rotation as well as flexion-adduction, internal rotation. I also tested the hip at 90 degrees of flexion with 10 degrees adduction and internal rotation and further progressive flexion of the hip beyond 90 degrees, which was noted to be very stable. At this point, a definitive component using +0 neck length and bipolar 43 head were placed over the trunnion and the hip was reduced. Range of motion and stability was as above. Now, the attention was placed for the repair of the capsule and the external rotators and the piriformis. This was repaired to the trochanteric insertion using #5 Ethibond and suture plaster. Satisfactory reinforcement was achieved with the #5 Ethibond. The wound was thoroughly irrigated. Hemostasis was achieved. The fascia was closed with #1 Vicryl followed by subcutaneous closure using 2-0 Vicryl. The wound was thoroughly washed and a local injection with mixture of morphine and Toradol was infiltrated including the capsule and the pericapsular structures. Skin was approximated with staples. Sterile dressings were placed. Abduction pillow was positioned and the patient was then extubated and transferred to the recovery room in a stable condition. There were no intraoperative complications noted."
506,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Cervical spondylosis, status post complex anterior cervical discectomy, corpectomy, decompression and fusion. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Cervical spondylosis, status post complex anterior cervical discectomy, corpectomy, decompression and fusion, and potentially unstable cervical spine. OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: Application of PMT large halo crown and vest. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: None. ANESTHESIA: Local, conscious sedation with Morphine and Versed. COMPLICATIONS: None. Post-fixation x-rays, nonalignment, no new changes. Post-fixation neurologic examination normal. CLINICAL HISTORY: The patient is a 41-year-old female who presented to me with severe cervical spondylosis and myelopathy. She was referred to me by Dr. X. The patient underwent a complicated anterior cervical discectomy, 2-level corpectomy, spinal cord decompression and fusion with fibular strut and machine allograft in the large cervical plate. Surgery had gone well, and the patient has done well in the last 2 days. She is neurologically improved and is moving all four extremities. No airway issues. It was felt that the patient was now a candidate for a halo vest placement given that chance of going to the OR were much smaller. She was consented for the procedure, and I sought the help of ABC and felt that a PMT halo would be preferable to a Bremer halo vest. The patient had this procedure done at the bedside, in the SICU room #1. I used a combination of some morphine 1 mg and Versed 2 mg for this procedure. I also used local anesthetic, with 1% Xylocaine and epinephrine a total of 15 to 20 cc. PROCEDURE DETAILS: The patient's head was positioned on some towels, the retroauricular region was shaved, and the forehead and the posterolateral periauricular regions were prepped with Betadine. A large PMT crown was brought in and fixed to the skull with pins under local anesthetic. Excellent fixation achieved. It was lateral to the supraorbital nerves and 1 fingerbreadth above the brows and the ear pinnae. I then put the vest on, by sitting the patient up, stabilizing her neck. The vest was brought in from the front as well and connected. Head was tilted appropriately, slightly extended, and in the midline. All connections were secured and pins were torqued and tightened. During the procedure, the patient did fine with no significant pain. Post-procedure, she is neurologically intact and she remained intact throughout. X-rays of the cervical spine AP, lateral, and swimmer views showed excellent alignment of the hardware construct in the graft with no new changes. The patient will be subjected to a CT scan to further define the alignment, and barring any problems, she will be ambulating with the halo on. The patient will undergo pin site care as per protocol, and likely she will go in the next 2 to 3 days. Her prognosis indeed is excellent, and she is already about 90% or so better from her surgery. She is also on a short course of Decadron, which we will wean off in due course. The matter was discussed with the patient and the patient's family."
507,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Right lumbosacral radiculopathy secondary to lumbar spondylolysis. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Right lumbosacral radiculopathy secondary to lumbar spondylolysis. OPERATION PERFORMED: 1. Right L4 and L5 transpedicular decompression of distal right L4 and L5 nerve roots. 2. Right L4-L5 and right L5-S1 laminotomies, medial facetectomies, and foraminotomies, decompression of right L5 and S1 nerve roots. 3. Right L4-S1 posterolateral fusion with local bone graft. 4. Left L4 through S1 segmental pedicle screw instrumentation. 5. Preparation harvesting of local bone graft. ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal. PREPARATION: Povidone-iodine. INDICATION: This is a gentleman with right-sided lumbosacral radiculopathy, MRI disclosed and lateral recess stenosis at the L4-5, L5-S1 foraminal narrowing in L4 and L5 roots. The patient was felt to be a candidate for decompression stabilization pulling distraction between the screws to relieve radicular pain. The patient understood major risks and complications such as death and paralysis seemingly rare, main concern is a 10 to 15% of failure rate to respond to surgery for which further surgery may or may not be indicated, small risk of wound infection, spinal fluid leak. The patient is understanding and agreed to proceed and signed the consent. PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the operating room, peripheral venous lines were placed. General anesthesia was induced. The patient was intubated. Foley catheter was in place. The patient laid prone onto the OSI table using 6-post, pressure points were carefully padded; the back was shaved, sterilely prepped and draped. A previous incision was infiltrated with local and incised with a scalpel. The posterior spine on the right side was exposed in routine fashion along with transverse processes in L4-L5 in the sacral ala. Laminotomies were then performed at L4-L5 and L5-S1 in a similar fashion using Midas Rex drill with AM8 bit, inferior portion of lamina below and superior portion of lamina above, and the medial facet was drilled down to the thin shelf of bone. The thin shelf of bone along the ligamentum flavum moved in a piecemeal fashion with 2 and 3 mm Kerrison, bone was harvested throughout to be used for bone grafting. The L5 and S1 roots were completely unroofed in the lateral recess working lateral to the markedly hypertrophied facet joints. Transpedicular approaches were carried out for both L4 and L5 roots working lateral to medial and medial to lateral with foraminotomies, L4-L5 roots were extensively decompressed. Pars interarticularis were maintained. Using angled 2-mm Kerrisons hypertrophied ligamentum flavum, the superior facet of S1 and L5 was resected increasing the dimensions for the foramen passed lateral to medial and medial to lateral without further compromise. Pedicle screws were placed L4-L5 and S1 on the right side. Initial hole began with Midas Rex drill, deepened with a gear shift and with 4.5 mm tap, palpating with pedicle probe. It showed no penetration outside the pedicle vertebral body. At L4-L5 5.5 x 45 mm screws were placed and at S1 5.5 x 40 mm screw was placed. Good bone purchase was obtained. Gelfoam was placed over the roots laterally, corticated transverse processes lateral facet joints were prepared, small infuse sponge was placed posterolaterally on the right side, then the local bone graft from L4 to S1. Traction was applied between the L4-L5, L5-S1 screws locking notes were tightened out, heads were rotated fractured off about 2-3 mm traction were applied at each side, further opening the foramen for the exiting roots. Prior to placement of BMP, the wound was irrigated with antibiotic irrigation. Medium Hemovac drain was placed in the depth of wound, brought out through a separate stab incision. Deep fascia was closed with #1 Vicryl, subcutaneous fascia with #1 Vicryl, and subcuticular with 2-0 Vicryl. Skin was stapled. The drain was sutured in place with 2-0 Vicryl and connected to closed drain system. The patient was laid supine on the bed, extubated, and taken to recovery room in satisfactory condition. The patient tolerated the procedure well without apparent complication. Final sponge and needle counts are correct. Estimated blood loss 600 mL. The patient received 200 mL of cell saver blood back."
508,Orthopedic," Chief Complaint: Back and hip pain. History of Present Illness: The patient is a 73 year old Caucasian male with a history of hypertension, end-stage renal disease secondary to reflux nephropathy / restriction of bladder neck requiring hemodialysis and eventual cadaveric renal transplant now on chronic immunosuppression, peripheral vascular disease with non-healing ulcer of right great toe, and peripheral neuropathy who initially presented to his primary care physician in May 2001 with complaints of low back pain and bilateral hip pain. The pain was described as a constant pain in the middle to lower back and hips. The pain was exacerbated by climbing stairs and in the morning after sleeping. He reported occasional radiation of pain from back into buttocks (greatest on the right side). He has history of chronic feet and leg numbness and paraesthesias related to his neuropathy, but he denied any recent changes in these symptoms in relation to the back pain. He denied any history of trauma. He was treated symptomatically with Acetaminophen with only some relief. He continued to complain intermittently of pain in his back and hips, and occasionally even in his elbows during the next 8 months. In January 2002, plain pelvic films showed no fracture or dislocation of the hips. Elbow films also showed no acute injury, but there were some erosions along the posterior aspect of the olecranon. An MRI was performed of his lumbar spine which showed degenerative disk disease, spondylosis, and annular bulging/herniation at L4-L5 with resultant encroachment on the neural foramen. He was evaluated by neurosurgery, who felt he should not have surgery at this time. His pain continued and progressively worsened, becoming unresponsive to medical therapy including narcotics In May 2002, as part of a vascular work-up for the patient�s non-healing right toe, an MRA showed extensive vascular disease in the vessels of both legs below the knees and evidence of bilateral trochanteric bursitis. It also revealed an abnormal enhancing lesion in the left proximal femur, the left iliac bone, the right iliac bone, and possibly the right tibia.

Spondylosis at L2-3 with marked narrowing of the disk space, grade I/IV degenerative retrolisthesis, and moderately severe central spinal canal and bilateral foraminal stenosis. 2. Degenerative disk disease at L4-5 with diffuse annular bulging and a broad based right lateral foraminal and extra-foraminal far lateral herniation which results in significant encroachment on the right lateral recess and neural foramen, and this deserves clinical correlation for right L4 and L5 radiculopathy. Degenerative facet joint changes and ligamentum flavum thickening are noted bilaterally at this level, but the central canal is adequate. 3. Spondylosis with annular bulging and facet joint degenerative disease at L5-S1, L3-L4, and L1-L2 to a mild degree without significant stenosis. 4. Note is made of probable cyst of the upper pole of the right kidney which measures 1.8cm in diameter. There is decrease in size of the right kidney which may be due to chronic renal disease. 1/02 Left Elbow Films (2 views): Rather extensive vascular calcification in the soft tissues. There is no evidence of an acute injury. There is, however, what appears to be some erosion along the posterior aspect of the olecranon. 1/02 Pelvis films: There is no fracture or dislocation of the hip identified. Extensive vascular calcification noted. 5/02 MRA Lower Extremity with and without contrast: 1. Minimal atherosclerotic narrowing of the bilateral superficial femoral arteries. Severe atherosclerotic disease of bilateral popliteal, anterior tibial, peroneal, and posterior tibial arteries (right greater than left). 2. Abnormal enhancing lesion in the left proximal femur, the left iliac bone, and the right iliac bone. There may be a similar lesion in the right tibia. 3. Abnormal enhancement in the trochanteric bursa of both femurs consistent with bursitis. 4. The vertebral bodies demonstrate abnormal enhancement adjacent to the end-plates likely due to degenerative disk disease. There are questionable abnormal enhancing lesions in the vertebral bodies. 6/02 Chest X-ray There are no compression fractures identified. The lungs are adequately expanded. Two densities in right hemithorax that appear to represent healing rib fractures. The one involving the right 7th rib posteriorly could be a pathologic fracture. No lung nodules or lymphadenopathy. 6/02 Whole Body Bone Scan: Areas of increased tracer activity are noted in the right proximal humerus, the left scapula at the region of the glenoid, the anterior aspect of the right third rib, the posterior aspect of the sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth ribs, the left lateral aspect of the T10 vertebra, the L3 vertebra, the right lateral aspect of the L5 vertebra, the left iliac crest, both SI joints, the right ischial bone, the left proximal and mid femur, the right distal femur and the left proximal tibia. Irregular tracer activity is noted in the cervical and thoracic spine consistent with degenerative changes. Tracer in the left lower quadrant of the abdomen consistent with a kidney transplant. A diagnostic procedure was performed as an outpatient on 7/10/02."
509,Orthopedic," TITLE OF OPERATION: Revision laminectomy L5-S1, discectomy L5-S1, right medial facetectomy, preparation of disk space and arthrodesis with interbody graft with BMP. INDICATIONS FOR SURGERY: Please refer to medical record, but in short, the patient is a 43-year-old male known to me, status post previous lumbar surgery for herniated disk with severe recurrence of axial back pain, failed conservative therapy. Risks and benefits of surgery were explained in detail including risk of bleeding, infection, stroke, heart attack, paralysis, need for further surgery, hardware failure, persistent symptoms, and death. This list was inclusive, but not exclusive. An informed consent was obtained after all patient's questions were answered. PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Severe lumbar spondylosis L5-S1, collapsed disk space, hypermobility, and herniated disk posteriorly. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Severe lumbar spondylosis L5-S1, collapsed disk space, hypermobility, and herniated disk posteriorly. ANESTHESIA: General anesthesia and endotracheal tube intubation. DISPOSITION: The patient to PACU with stable vital signs. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was taken to the operating room. After adequate general anesthesia with endotracheal tube intubation was obtained, the patient was placed prone on the Jackson table. Lumbar spine was shaved, prepped, and draped in the usual sterile fashion. An incision was carried out from L4 to S1. Hemostasis was obtained with bipolar and Bovie cauterization. A Weitlaner was placed in the wound and a subperiosteal dissection was carried out identifying the lamina of L4, L5, and sacrum. At this time, laminectomy was carried out of L5-S1. Thecal sac was retracted rightward and the foramen was opened and unilateral medial facetectomy was carried out in the disk space. At this time, the disk was entered with a #15 blade and bipolar. The disk was entered with straight up and down-biting pituitaries, curettes, and the high speed drill and we were able to takedown calcified herniated disk. We were able to reestablish the disk space, it was very difficult, required meticulous dissection and then drilling with a diamond bur in the disk space underneath the spinal canal, very carefully holding the spinal canal out of harm's way as well as the exiting nerve root. Once this was done, we used rasps to remove more disk material anteriorly and under the midline to the left side and then we put in interbody graft of BMP 8 mm graft from Medtronic. At this time, Dr. X will dictate the posterolateral fusion, pedicle screw fixation to L4 to S1 with compression and will dictate the closure of the wound. There were no complications."
510,Orthopedic," PREOP DIAGNOSES: 1. Left pilon fracture. 2. Left great toe proximal phalanx fracture. POSTOP DIAGNOSES: 1. Left pilon fracture. 2. Left great toe proximal phalanx fracture. OPERATION PERFORMED: 1. External fixation of left pilon fracture. 2. Closed reduction of left great toe, T1 fracture. ANESTHESIA: General. BLOOD LOSS: Less than 10 mL. Needle, instrument, and sponge counts were done and correct. DRAINS AND TUBES: None. SPECIMENS: None. INDICATION FOR OPERATION: The patient is a 58-year-old female who was involved in an auto versus a tree accident on 6/15/2009. The patient suffered a fracture of a distal tibia and fibula as well as her great toe on the left side at that time. The patient was evaluated by the emergency room and did undergo further evaluation due to loss of consciousness. She underwent a provisional reduction and splinting in the emergency room followed by further evaluation for her heart and brain by the Medicine Service following this and she was appropriate for surgical intervention. Due to the comminuted nature of her tibia fracture as well as soft tissue swelling, the patient is in need of a staged surgery with the 1st stage external fixation followed by open treatment and definitive plate and screw fixation. The patient had swollen lower extremities, however, compartments were soft and she had no sign of compartment syndrome. Risks and benefits of procedure were discussed in detail with the patient and her husband. All questions were answered, and consent was obtained. The risks including damage to blood vessels and nerves with painful neuroma or numbness, limb altered function, loss of range of motion, need for further surgery, infection, complex regional pain syndrome and deep vein thrombosis were all discussed as potential risks of the surgery. FINDINGS: 1. There was a comminuted distal tibia fracture with a fibular shaft fracture. Following traction, there was adequate coronal and sagittal alignment of the fracture fragments and based on the length of the fibula, the fracture fragments were out to length. 2. The base of her proximal phalanx fracture was assessed and reduced with essentially no articular step-off and approximately 1-mm displacement. As the reduction was stable with buddy taping, no pinning was performed. 3. Her compartments were full, but not firm nor did she have any sign of compartment syndrome and no compartment releases were performed. OPERATIVE REPORT IN DETAIL: The patient was identified in the preoperative holding area. The left leg was identified and marked at the surgical site of the patient. She was then taken to the operating room where she was transferred to the operating room in the supine position, placed under general anesthesia by the anesthesiology team. She received Ancef for antibiotic prophylaxis. A time-out was then undertaken verifying the correct patient, extremity, visibility of preoperative markings, availability of equipment, and administration of preoperative antibiotics. When all was verified by the surgeon, anesthesia and circulating personnel left lower extremity was prepped and draped in the usual fashion. At this point, intraoperative fluoroscopy was used to identify the fracture site as well as the appropriate starting point both in the calcaneus for a transcalcaneal cross stent and in the proximal tibia with care taken to leave enough room for later plate fixation without contaminating the future operative site. A single centrally threaded calcaneal cross tunnel was then placed across the calcaneus parallel to the joint surface followed by placement of 2 Schantz pins in the tibia and a frame type external fixator was then applied in traction with attempts to get the fracture fragments out to length, but not overly distract the fracture and restore coronal and sagittal alignment as much as able. When this was adequate, the fixator apparatus was locked in place, and x-ray images were taken verifying correct placement of the hardware and adequate alignment of the fracture. Attention was then turned to the left great toe, where a reduction of the proximal phalanx fracture was performed and buddy taping as this provided good stability and was least invasive. X-rays were taken showing good reduction of the base of the proximal phalanx of the great toe fracture. At this point, the pins were cut short and capped to protect the sharp ends. The stab wounds for the Schantz pin and cross pin were covered with gauze with Betadine followed by dry gauze, and the patient was then awakened from anesthesia and transferred to the progressive care unit in stable condition. Please note there was no break in sterile technique throughout the case. PLAN: The patient will require definitive surgical treatment in approximately 2 weeks when the soft tissues are amenable to plate and screw fixation with decreased risk of wound complication. She will maintain her buddy taping in regards to her great toe fracture."

512,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left carpal tunnel syndrome. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left carpal tunnel syndrome. OPERATIVE PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Left carpal tunnel release. FINDINGS: Showed severe compression of the median nerve on the left at the wrist. SPECIMENS: None. FLUIDS: 500 mL of crystalloids. URINE OUTPUT: No Foley catheter. COMPLICATIONS: None. ANESTHESIA: General through a laryngeal mask. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: None. CONDITION: Resuscitated with stable vital signs. INDICATION FOR THE OPERATION: This is a case of a very pleasant 65-year-old forensic pathologist who I previously had performed initially a discectomy and removal of infection at 6-7, followed by anterior cervical discectomy with anterior interbody fusion at C5-6 and C6-7 with spinal instrumentation. At the time of initial consultation, the patient was also found to have bilateral carpal tunnel and for which we are addressing the left side now. Operation, expected outcome, risks, and benefits were discussed with him for most of the risk would be that of infection because of the patient's diabetes and a previous history of infection in the form of pneumonia. There is also the possibility of bleeding as well as the possibility of injury to the median nerve on dissection. He understood this risk and agreed to have the procedure performed. DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the operating room, awake, alert, not in any form of distress. After smooth induction of anesthesia and placement of a laryngeal mask, he remained supine on the operating table. The left upper extremity was then prepped with Betadine soap and antiseptic solution. After sterile drapes were laid out, an incision was made following inflation of blood pressure cuff to 250 mmHg. Clamp time approximately 30 minutes. An incision was then made right in the mid palm area between the thenar and hypothenar eminence. Meticulous hemostasis of any bleeders were done. The fat was identified. The palmar aponeurosis was identified and cut and this was traced down to the wrist. There was severe compression of the median nerve. Additional removal of the aponeurosis was performed to allow for further decompression. After this was all completed, the area was irrigated with saline and bacitracin solution and closed as a single layer using Prolene 4-0 as interrupted vertical mattress stitches. Dressing was applied. The patient was brought to the recovery."
513,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Open calcaneus fracture on the right. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Open calcaneus fracture on the right. PROCEDURES: 1. Irrigation and debridement of skin, subcutaneous tissue, fascia and bone associated with an open fracture. 2. Placement of antibiotic-impregnated beads. ANESTHESIA: General. BLOOD LOSS: Minimal. COMPLICATIONS: None. FINDINGS: Healing skin with no gross purulence identified, some fibrinous material around the beads. SUMMARY: After informed consent was obtained and verified, the patient was brought to the operating room and placed supine on the operating table. After uneventful general anesthesia was obtained, her right leg was sterilely prepped and draped in a normal fashion. The tourniquet was inflated and the previous wound was opened. Dr. X came in to look at the wound and the beads were removed, all 25 beads were extracted, and pulsatile lavage, and curette, etc., were used to debride the wound. The wound margins were healthy with the exception of very central triangular incision area. The edges were debrided and then 19 antibiotic-impregnated beads with gentamicin and tobramycin were inserted and the wound was further closed today. The skin edges were approximated under minimal tension. The soft dressing was placed. An Ace was placed. She was awakened from the anesthesia and taken to recovery room in a stable condition. Final needle, instrument, and sponge counts were correct."
514,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left little finger extensor tendon laceration. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left little finger extensor tendon laceration. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Repair of left little extensor tendon. COMPLICATIONS: None. BLOOD LOSS: Minimal. ANESTHESIA: Bier block. INDICATIONS: The patient is a 14-year-old right-hand dominant male who cut the back of his left little finger and had a small cut to his extensor tendon. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was taken to the operative room, laid supine, administered intervenous sedation with Bier block and prepped and draped in a sterile fashion. The old laceration was opened and the extensor tendon was identified and there was a small longitudinal laceration in the tendon, which is essentially in line with the tendon fibers. This was just proximal to the PIP joint and on complete flexion of the PIP joint, I did separate just a little bit that was not thought to be significantly dynamically unstable. It was sutured with a single 4-0 Prolene interrupted figure-of-eight suture and on dynamic motion it did not separate at all. The wound was irrigated and closed with 5-0 nylon interrupted sutures. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to the PCU in good condition."
515,Orthopedic," EXAM: Two views of the pelvis. HISTORY: This is a patient post-surgery, 2-1/2 months. The patient has a history of slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE) bilaterally. TECHNIQUE: Frontal and lateral views of the hip and pelvis were evaluated and correlated with the prior film dated MM/DD/YYYY. Lateral view of the right hip was evaluated. FINDINGS: Frontal view of the pelvis and a lateral view of the right hip were evaluated and correlated with the patient's most recent priors dated MM/DD/YYYY. Current films reveal stable appearing post-surgical changes. Again demonstrated is a single intramedullary screw across the left femoral neck and head. There are 2 intramedullary screws through the greater trochanter of the right femur. There is a lucency along the previous screw track extending into the right femoral head and neck. There has been interval removal of cutaneous staples and/or surgical clips. These were previously seen along the lateral aspect of the right hip joint. Deformity related to the previously described slipped capital femoral epiphysis is again seen. IMPRESSION: 1. Stable-appearing right hip joint status-post pinning. 2. Interval removal of skin staples as described above."
516,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right hallux abductovalgus deformity. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right hallux abductovalgus deformity. PROCEDURES PERFORMED: 1. Right McBride bunionectomy. 2. Right basilar wedge osteotomy with OrthoPro screw fixation. ANESTHESIA: Local with IV sedation. HEMOSTASIS: With pneumatic ankle cuff. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the operating room and placed in a supine position. The right foot was prepared and draped in usual sterile manner. Anesthesia was achieved utilizing a 50:50 mixture of 2% lidocaine plain with 0.5 Marcaine plain infiltrated just proximal to the first metatarsocuneiform joint. Hemostasis was achieved utilizing a pneumatic ankle Tourniquet placed above the right ankle and inflated to a pressure of 225 mmHg. At this time, attention was directed to the dorsal aspect of the right first metatarsophalangeal joint where dorsal linear incision approximately 3 cm in length was made. The incision was deepened within the same plain taking care of the Bovie and retracted all superficial nerves and vessels as necessary. The incision was then carried down to the underlying capsular structure once again taking care of the Bovie and retracted all superficial nerves and vessels as necessary. The capsular incision following the same outline as the skin incision was made and carried down to the underlying bony structure. The capsule was then freed from the underling bony structure utilizing sharp and blunt dissection. Using a microsagittal saw, the medial and dorsal very prominent bony eminence were removed and the area was inspected for any remaining bony prominences following resection of bone and those noted were removed using a hand rasp. At this time, attention was directed to the first inner space using sharp and blunt dissection. Dissection was carried down to the underling level of the adductor hallucis tendon, which was isolated and freed from its phalangeal, sesamoidal, and metatarsal attachments. The tendon was noted to lap the length and integrity for transfer and at this time was tenotomized taking out resection of approximately 0.5 cm to help prevent any re-fibrous attachment. At this time, the lateral release was stressed and was found to be complete. The extensor hallucis brevis tendon was then isolated using blunt dissection and was tenotomized as well taking out approximately 0.5-cm resection. The entire area was copiously flushed 3 times using a sterile saline solution and was inspected for any bony prominences remaining and it was noted that the base of the proximal phalanx on the medial side due to the removal of the extensive buildup of the metatarsal head was going to be very prominent in nature and at this time was removed using a microsagittal saw. The area was again copiously flushed and inspected for any abnormalities and/or prominences and none were noted. At this time, attention was directed to the base of the first metatarsal where a second incision was made approximately 4 cm in length. The incision was deepened within the same plain taking care of Bovie and retracted all superficial nerves and vessels as necessary. The incision was then carried down to the level of the metatarsal and using sharp and blunt dissection periosteal capsule structures were freed from the base of the metatarsal and taking care to retract the long extensive tendon and any neurovascular structures to avoid any disruption. At this time, there was a measurement made of 1 cm just distal to the metatarsocuneiform joint on the medial side and 2 cm distal to the metatarsocuneiform joint from the lateral aspect of the joint. At this time, 0.5 cm was measured distal to that lateral measurement and using microsagittal saw, a wedge osteotomy was taken from the base with the apex of the osteotomy being medial, taking care to keep the medial cortex intact as a hinge. The osteotomy site was feathered down until the osteotomy site could be closed with little tension on it and at this time using an OrthoPro screw 3.0 x 22 mm. The screw was placed following proper technique. The osteotomy site was found to be fixated with absolutely no movement and good stability upon manual testing. A very tiny gap on the lateral aspect of the osteotomy site was found and this was filled in packing it with the cancellous bone that was left over from the wedge osteotomy. The packing of the cancellous bone was held in place with bone wax. The entire area was copiously flushed 3 times using a sterile saline solution and was inspected and tested again for any movement of the osteotomy site or any gapping and then removed. At this time, a deep closure was achieved utilizing #2-0 Vicryl suture, subcuticular closure was achieved using #4-0 Vicryl suture, and skin repair was achieved at both surgical sites with #5-0 nylon suture in a running interlocking fashion. The hallux was found to have excellent movement upon completion of the osteotomy and the second procedure of the McBride bunionectomy and the metatarsal was found to stay in excellent alignment with good stability at the proximal osteotomy site. At this time, the surgical site was postoperatively injected with 0.5 Marcaine plain as well as dexamethasone 4 mg primarily. The surgical sites were then dressed with sterile Xeroform, sterile 4x4s, cascading, and Kling with a final protective layer of fiberglass in a nonweightbearing cast fashion. The tourniquet was dropped and color and temperature of all digits returned to normal. The patient tolerated the anesthesia and the procedure well and left the operating room in stable condition. The patient has been given written and verbal postoperative instructions and has been instructed to call if she has any questions, problems, or concerns at any time with the numbers provided. The patient has also been warned a number of times the importance of elevation and no weightbearing on the surgical foot."
517,Orthopedic," The patient was evaluated today in follow up evaluation. She continues to suffer from ongoing neck and lower back pain with no recent radicular complaints. Her evaluation today reveals restriction in the range of motion of the cervical and lumbar region with tenderness and spasms of the paraspinal musculature. Motor strength was 5/5 on the MRC scale. Reflexes were 2+ and symmetrical. Palpable trigger points were noted bilaterally in the trapezius and lumbar paraspinal musculature bilaterally. Palpable trigger points were noted on today's evaluation. She is suffering from ongoing myofascitis. Her treatment plan will consist of a series of trigger point injections, which were performed today. She tolerated the procedure well. I have asked her to ice the region intermittently for 15 minutes off and on x 3. She will be followed in four weeks' time for repeat trigger point injections if indicated."

The differential diagnosis included Amyotrophy, Polymyositis, Epidural hematoma, Disc Herniation and Guillain-Barre syndrome. An MRI of the lumbar spine was obtained, 12/13/95. This revealed an L3-4 disc herniation extending inferiorly and behind the L4 vertebral body. This disc was located more on the right than on the left , compromised the right neural foramen, and narrowed the spinal canal. The patient underwent a L3-4 laminectomy and diskectomy and subsequently improved. He was never seen in follow-up at UIHC."
519,Orthopedic," REASON FOR VISIT: Kyphosis. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 13-year-old new patient is here for evaluation of thoracic kyphosis. The patient has a family history in a maternal aunt and grandfather of kyphosis. She was noted by her parents to have round back posture. They have previously seen another orthopedist who recommended observation at this time. She is here for a second opinion in regards to kyphosis. The patient denies any pain in her back or any numbness, tingling, or weakness in her upper or lower extremities. No problems with her bowels or bladder. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: None. PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Bilateral pinning of her ears. SOCIAL HISTORY: She is currently an eighth grader at Middle School and is interested in basketball. She lives with both of her parents and has a 9-year-old brother. She had menarche beginning in September. FAMILY HISTORY: Of kyphosis in great grandmother and second cousin. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: She is in her usual state of health and is negative except otherwise as mentioned in the history of present illness. MEDICATIONS: She is currently on Zyrtec, Flonase, and Ceftin for an ear infection. ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies. FINDINGS: On physical exam, she is alert, oriented, and in no acute distress standing 63 inches tall. In regards to her back, her skin is intact with no rashes, lesions, and/or no dimpling or hair spots. No cafe au lait spots. She is not tender to palpation from her occiput to her sacrum. There is no evidence of paraspinal muscle spasm. On forward bending, there is a mild kyphosis. She is not able to touch her toes indicating her hamstring tightness. She has a full 5 out of 5 in all muscle groups. Her lower extremities including iliopsoas, quadriceps, gastroc-soleus, tibialis anterior, and extensor hallucis longus. Her sensation intact to light touch in L1 through L2 dermatomal distributions. She has symmetric limb lengths as well bilaterally from both the coronal and sagittal planes. X-rays today included PA and lateral sclerosis series. She has approximately 46 degree kyphosis. ASSESSMENT: Kyphosis. PLANS: The patient's kyphosis is quite mild. While this is likely in the upper limits of normal or just it is normal for an adolescent and still within normal range as would be expected return at home. At this time, three options were discussed with the parents including observation, physical therapy, and bracing. At this juncture, given that she has continued to grow, they are Risser 0. She may benefit from continued observation with physical therapy, bracing would be a more aggressive option certainly that thing would be lost with following at this time. As such, she was given a prescription for physical therapy for extension based strengthening exercises, flexibility range of motion exercises, postural training with no forward bending. We will see her back in 3 months' time for repeat radiographs at that time including PA and lateral standing of scoliosis series. Should she show evidence of continued progression of her kyphotic deformity, discussions of bracing would be held at time. We will see her back in 3 months' time for repeat evaluation."
520,Orthopedic," OPERATION PERFORMED: Ligament reconstruction and tendon interposition arthroplasty of right wrist. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: With the patient under adequate anesthesia, the right upper extremity was prepped and draped in a sterile manner. Attention was turned to the base of the thumb where a longitudinal incision was made over the anatomic snuffbox and extended out onto the carpometacarpal joint. Using blunt dissection radial sensory nerve was dissected and retracted out of the operative field. Further blunt dissection exposed the radial artery, which was dissected and retracted off the trapezium. An incision was then made across the scaphotrapezial joint distally onto the trapezium and out onto the carpometacarpal joint. Sharp dissection exposed the trapezium, which was then morselized and removed in toto with care taken to protect the underlying flexor carpi radialis tendon. The radial beak of the trapezoid was then osteotomized off the head of the scaphoid. The proximal metacarpal was then fenestrated with a 4.5-mm drill bit. Four fingers proximal to the flexion crease of the wrist a small incision was made over the FCR tendon and blunt dissection delivered the FCR tendon into this incision. The FCR tendon was divided and this incision was closed with 4-0 nylon sutures. Attention was returned to the trapezial wound where longitudinal traction on the FCR tendon delivered the FCR tendon into the wound. The FCR tendon was then threaded through the fenestration in the metacarpal. A bone anchor was then placed distal to the metacarpal fenestration. The FCR tendon was then pulled distally and the metacarpal reduced to an anatomic position. The FCR tendon was then sutured to the metacarpal using the previously placed bone anchor. Remaining FCR tendon was then anchovied and placed into the scaphotrapezoidal and trapezial defect. The MP joint was brought into extension and the capsule closed using interrupted 3-0 Tycron sutures. Attention was turned to the MCP joint where the MP joint was brought in to 15 degrees of flexion and pinned with a single 0.035 Kirschner wire. The pin was cut at the level of the skin. All incisions were closed with running 3-0 Prolene subcuticular stitch. Sterile dressings were then applied. The tourniquet was deflated. The patient was awakened from anesthesia and returned to the recovery room in satisfactory condition having tolerated the procedure well."
521,Orthopedic," PRE AND POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left cervical radiculopathy at C5, C6 OPERATION: Left C5-6 hemilaminotomy and foraminotomy with medial facetectomy for microscopic decompression of nerve root. After informed consent was obtained from the patient, he was taken to the OR. After general anesthesia had been induced, Ted hose stockings and pneumatic compression stockings were placed on the patient and a Foley catheter was also inserted. At this point, the patient's was placed in three point fixation with a Mayfield head holder and then the patient was placed on the operating table in a prone position. The patient's posterior cervical area was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. At this time the patient's incision site was infiltrated with 1 percent Lidocaine with epinephrine. A scalpel was used to make an approximate 3 cm skin incision cephalad to the prominent C7 spinous processes, which could be palpated. After dissection down to a spinous process using Bovie cautery, a clamp was placed on this spinous processes and cross table lateral x-ray was taken. This showed the spinous process to be at the C4 level. Therefore, further soft tissue dissection was carried out caudally to this level after the next spinous processes presumed to be C5 was identified. After the muscle was dissected off the lamina laterally on the left side, self retaining retractors were placed and after hemostasis was achieved, a Penfield probe was placed in the interspace presumed to be C5-6 and another cross table lateral x-ray of the C spine was taken. This film confirmed our position at C5-6 and therefore the operating microscope was brought onto the field at this time. At the time the Kerrison rongeur was used to perform a hemilaminotomy by starting with the inferior margin of the superior lamina. The superior margin of the inferior lamina of C6 was also taken with the Kerrison rongeur after the ligaments had been freed by using a Woodson probe. This was then extended laterally to perform a medial facetectomy also using the Kerrison rongeur. However, progress was limited because of thickness of the bone. Therefore at this time the Midas-Rex drill, the AM8 bit was brought onto the field and this was used to thin out the bone around our laminotomy and medial facetectomy area. After the bone had been thinned out, further bone was removed using the Kerrison rongeur. At this point the nerve root was visually inspected and observed to be decompressed. However, there was a layer of fibrous tissue overlying the exiting nerve root which was removed by placing a Woodson resector in a plane between the fibrous sheath and the nerve root and incising it with a 15 blade. Hemostasis was then achieved by using Gelfoam as well as bipolar electrocautery. After hemostasis was achieved, the surgical site was copiously irrigated with Bacitracin. Closure was initiated by closing the muscle layer and the fascial layer with 0 Vicryl stitches. The subcutaneous layer was then reapproximated using 000 Dexon. The skin was reapproximated using a running 000 nylon. Sterile dressings were applied. The patient was then extubated in the OR and transferred to the Recovery room in stable condition. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: minimal."
522,Orthopedic," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: T12 compression fracture with cauda equina syndrome and spinal cord compression. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: T12 compression fracture with cauda equina syndrome and spinal cord compression. OPERATION PERFORMED: Decompressive laminectomy at T12 with bilateral facetectomies, decompression of T11 and T12 nerve roots bilaterally with posterolateral fusion supplemented with allograft bone chips and pedicle screws and rods with crosslink Synthes Click'X System using 6.5 mm diameter x 40 mm length T11 screws and L1 screws, 7 mm diameter x 45 mm length. ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 400 mL, replaced 2 units of packed cells. Preoperative hemoglobin was less than 10. DRAINS: None. COMPLICATIONS: None. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: With the patient prepped and draped in a routine fashion in the prone position on laminae support, an x-ray was taken and demonstrated a needle at the T12-L1 interspace. An incision was made over the posterior spinous process of T10, T11, T12, L1, and L2. A Weitlaner retractor was placed and cutting Bovie current was used to incise the fascia overlying the dorsal spinous process of T10, T11, T12, L1, and L2. An additional muscular ligamentous attachment was dissected free bilaterally with cutting Bovie current osteotome and Cobb elevator. The cerebellar retractors were placed in the wound and obvious deformation of the lamina particularly on the left side at T12 was apparent. Initially, on the patient's left side, pedicle screws were placed in T11 and L1. The inferior articular facet was removed at T11 and an awl placed at the proximal location of the pedicle. Placement confirmed with biplanar coaxial fluoroscopy. The awl was in appropriate location and using a pedicle finder under fluoroscopic control, the pedicle was probed to the mid portion of the body of T11. A 40-mm Click'X screw, 6.5 mm diameter with rod holder was then threaded into the T11 vertebral body. Attention was next turned to the L1 level on the left side and the junction of the transverse processes with the superior articular facet and intra-articular process was located using an AM-8 dissecting tool, AM attachment to the Midas Rex instrumentation. The area was decorticated, an awl was placed, and under fluoroscopic biplanar imaging noted to be at the pedicle in L1. Using a pedicle probe, the pedicle was then probed to the mid body of L1 and a 7-mm diameter 45-mm in length Click'X Synthes screw with rod holder was placed in the L1 vertebral body. At this point, an elongated rod was placed on the left side for purposes of distraction should it be felt necessary in view of the MRI findings of significant compression on the patient's ventral canal on the right side. Attention was next turned to the right side and it should be noted that the dissection above was carried out with operating room microscope and at this point, the intraspinous process ligament superior to the posterior spinous process at T12 was noted be completely disrupted on a traumatic basis. The anteroposterior spinous process ligament superior to the T12 was incised with cutting Bovie current and the posterior spinous process at T12 removed with a Leksell rongeur. It was necessary to remove portion of the posterior spinous process at T11 for a full visualization of the involved laminar fractures at T12. At this point, a laminectomy was performed using 45-degree Kerrison rongeur, both 2 mm and 4 mm, and Leksell rongeur. There was an epidural hematoma encountered to the midline and left side at the mid portion of the T12 laminectomy and this was extending superiorly to the T11-T12 interlaminar space. Additionally, there was marked instability of the facets bilaterally at T12 and L1. These facets were removed with 45-degree Kerrison rongeur and Leksell rongeur. Bony compression both superiorly and laterally from fractured bony elements was removed with 45-degree Kerrison rongeur until the thecal sac was completely decompressed. The exiting nerve roots at T11 and T12 were visualized and followed with Frazier dissectors, and these nerve roots were noted to be completely free. Hemostasis was controlled with bipolar coagulation. At this point, a Frazier dissector could be passed superiorly, inferiorly, medially, and laterally to the T11-T12 nerve roots bilaterally, and the thecal sac was noted to be decompressed both superiorly and inferiorly, and noted to be quite pulsatile. A #4 Penfield was then used to probe the floor of the spinal canal, and no significant ventral compression remained on the thecal sac. Copious antibiotic irrigation was used and at this point on the patient's right side, pedicle screws were placed at T11 and L1 using the technique described for a left-sided pedicle screw placement. The anatomic landmarks being the transverse process at T11, the inferior articulating facet, and the lateral aspect of the superior articular facet for T11 and at L1, the transverse process, the junction of the intra-articular process and the facet joint. With the screws placed on the left side, the elongated rod was removed from the patient's right side along with the locking caps, which had been placed. It was felt that distraction was not necessary. A 75-mm rod could be placed on the patient's left side with reattachment of the locking screw heads with the rod cap locker in place; however, it was necessary to cut a longer rod for the patient's right side with the screws slightly greater distance apart ultimately settling on a 90-mm rod. The locking caps were placed on the right side and after all 4 locking caps were placed, the locking cap screws were tied to the cold weld. Fluoroscopic examination demonstrated no evidence of asymmetry at the intervertebral space at T11-T12 or T12-L1 with excellent positioning of the rods and screws. A crosslink approximately 60 mm in width was then placed between the right and left rods, and all 4 screws were tightened. It should be noted that prior to the placement of the rods, the patient's autologous bone, which had been removed during laminectomy portion of the procedure and cleansed off soft tissue and morcellated was packed in the posterolateral space after decortication had been effected on the transverse processes at T11, T12, and L1 with AM-8 dissecting tool, AM attachment as well as the lateral aspects of the facet joints. This was done bilaterally prior to placement of the rods. Following placement of the rods as noted above, allograft bone chips were packed in addition on top of the patient's own allograft in these posterolateral gutters. Gelfoam was used to cover the thecal sac and at this point, the wound was closed by approximating the deep muscle with 0 Vicryl suture. The fascia was closed with interrupted 0 Vicryl suture, subcutaneous layer was closed with 2-0 Vicryl suture, subcuticular layer was closed with 2-0 inverted interrupted Vicryl suture, and the skin approximated with staples. The patient appeared to tolerate the procedure well without complications."
523,Urology," PROCEDURE: Elective male sterilization via bilateral vasectomy. PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Fertile male with completed family. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Fertile male with completed family. MEDICATIONS: Anesthesia is local with conscious sedation. COMPLICATIONS: None. BLOOD LOSS: Minimal. INDICATIONS: This 34-year-old gentleman has come to the office requesting sterilization via bilateral vasectomy. I discussed the indications and the need for procedure with the patient in detail, and he has given consent to proceed. He has been given prophylactic antibiotics. PROCEDURE NOTE: Once satisfactory sedation have been obtained, the patient was placed in the supine position on the operating table. Genitalia was shaved and then prepped with Betadine scrub and paint solution and were draped sterilely. The procedure itself was started by grasping the right vas deferens in the scrotum, and bringing it up to the level of the skin. The skin was infiltrated with 2% Xylocaine and punctured with a sharp hemostat to identify the vas beneath. The vas was brought out of the incision carefully. A 2-inch segment was isolated, and 1-inch segment was removed. The free ends were cauterized and were tied with 2-0 silk sutures in such a fashion that the ends double back on themselves. After securing hemostasis with a cautery, the ends were allowed to drop back into the incision, which was also cauterized. Attention was now turned to the left side. The vas was grasped and brought up to the level of the skin. The skin was infiltrated with 2% Xylocaine and punctured with a sharp hemostat to identify the vas beneath. The vas was brought out of the incision carefully. A 2-inch segment was isolated, and 1-inch segment was removed. The free ends were cauterized and tied with 2-0 silk sutures in such a fashion that the ends double back on themselves. After securing hemostasis with the cautery, the ends were allowed to drop back into the incision, which was also cauterized. Bacitracin ointment was applied as well as dry sterile dressing. The patient was awakened and was returned to Recovery in satisfactory condition."
524,Urology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Voluntary sterility. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Voluntary sterility. OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: Bilateral vasectomy. ANESTHESIA: Local. INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: A gentleman who is here today requesting voluntary sterility. Options were discussed for voluntary sterility and he has elected to proceed with a bilateral vasectomy. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the operating room, and after appropriately identifying the patient, the patient was prepped and draped in the standard surgical fashion and placed in a supine position on the OR table. Then, 0.25% Marcaine without epinephrine was used to anesthetize the scrotal skin. A small incision was made in the right hemiscrotum. The vas deferens was grasped with a vas clamp. Next, the vas deferens was skeletonized. It was clipped proximally and distally twice. The cut edges were fulgurated. Meticulous hemostasis was maintained. Then, 4-0 chromic was used to close the scrotal skin on the right hemiscrotum. Next, the attention was turned to the left hemiscrotum, and after the left hemiscrotum was anesthetized appropriately, a small incision was made in the left hemiscrotum. The vas deferens was isolated. It was skeletonized. It was clipped proximally and distally twice. The cut edges were fulgurated. Meticulous hemostasis was maintained. Then, 4-0 chromic was used to close the scrotal skin. A jockstrap and sterile dressing were applied at the end of the case. Sponge, needle, and instruments counts were correct."

VITAL SIGNS: Temperature 98, blood pressure 129/72, pulse 96, and weight 175.4 pounds. LUNGS: Clear to auscultation bilaterally. CARDIOVASCULAR: Regular rate and rhythm with a 3/6 systolic murmur. ABDOMEN: Right lower quadrant incision site scar well healed. Nontender to palpation. Liver and spleen not enlarged. No hernias appreciated. PENIS: Normal male genitalia. No lesions appreciated on the penis. Previous DRE showed the prostate of approximately 40 grams and no nodules. Foley in place and draining clear urine. The patient underwent fill and pull study, in which his bladder tolerated 120 ml of sterile water passively filling his bladder. He spontaneously voided without the Foley 110 mL. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: This is a 66-year-old male with signs and symptoms of benign prostatic hypertrophy, who has had recurrent urinary retention since the kidney transplant in 12/07. He passed his fill and pull study and was thought to self-catheterize in the event that he does incur urinary retention again. We discussed with Mr. Barker that he has a urologist closer to his home and he lives approximately 3 hours away; however, he desires to continue follow up with the urology clinic at MCG and has been set up for followup in 6 weeks. He was also given a prescription for 6 months of Flomax and Proscar. He did not have a PSA drawn today as he had a catheter in place, therefore his PSA could be falsely elevated. He will have PSA level drawn either just before his visit for followup."
526,Urology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left inguinal hernia. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left direct and indirect inguinal hernia. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Repair of left inguinal hernia with Prolene mesh. ANESTHESIA: IV sedation with local. COMPLICATIONS: None. DISPOSITION: The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to Recovery in stable condition. SPECIMEN: Hernia sac, as well as turbid fluid with gram stain, which came back with no organisms from the hernia sac. BRIEF HISTORY: This is a 53-year-old male who presented to Dr. Y's office with a bulge in the left groin and was found to have a left inguinal hernia increasing over the past several months. The patient has a history of multiple abdominal surgeries and opted for an open left inguinal hernial repair with Prolene mesh. INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS: The patient was found to have a direct as well as an indirect component to the left inguinal hernia with a large sac. The patient was also found to have some turbid fluid within the hernia sac, which was sent down for gram stain and turned out to be negative with no organisms. PROCEDURE: After informed consent, risks and benefits of the procedure were explained to the patient, the patient was brought to the operative suite, prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion. The left inguinal ligament was identified from the pubic tubercle to the ASIS. Two fingerbreadths above the pubic tubercle, a transverse incision was made. First, the skin was anesthetized with 1% lidocaine and then an incision was made with a #15 blade scalpel, approximately 6 cm in length. Dissection was then carried down with electro Bovie cautery through Scarpa's fascia maintaining hemostasis. Once the external oblique was identified, external oblique was incised in the length of its fibers with a #15 blade scalpel. Metzenbaum scissors were then used to extend the incision in both directions opening up the external oblique down to the external ring. Next, the external oblique was grasped with Ochsner on both sides. The cord, cord structures as well as hernia sac were freed up circumferentially and a Penrose drain was placed around it. Next, the hernia sac was identified and the anteromedial portion of the hernia sac was stripped down, grasped with two hemostats. A Metzenbaum scissor was then used to open the hernia sac and the hernia sac was explored. There was some turbid fluid within the hernia sac, which was sent down for cultures. Gram stain was negative for organisms. Next, the hernia sac was to be ligated at its base and transected. A peon was used at the base. Metzenbaum scissor was used to cut the hernia sac and sending it off as a specimen. An #0 Vicryl stick suture was used with #0 Vicryl loop suture to suture ligate the hernia sac at its base. Next, attention was made to placing a Prolene mesh to cover the floor. The mesh was sutured to the pubic tubercle medially along the ilioinguinal ligament inferiorly and along the conjoint tendon superiorly making a slit for the cord and cord structures. Attention was made to salvaging the ilioinguinal nerve, which was left above the repair of the mesh and below the external oblique once closed and appeared to be intact. Attention was next made after suturing the mesh with the #2-0 Polydek suture. The external oblique was then closed over the roof with a running #0 Vicryl suture, taking care not to strangulate the cord and to recreate the external ring. After injecting the external oblique and cord structures with Marcaine for anesthetic, the Scarpa's fascia was approximated with interrupted #3-0 Vicryl sutures. The skin was closed with a running subcuticular #4-0 undyed Vicryl suture. Steri-Strip with sterile dressings were applied. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to Recovery in stable condition."
527,Urology," CHIEF COMPLAINT: The patient comes for bladder instillation for chronic interstitial cystitis. SUBJECTIVE: The patient is crying today when she arrives in the office saying that she has a lot of discomfort. These bladder instillations do not seem to be helping her. She feels anxious and worried. She does not think she can take any more pain. She is debating whether or not to go back to Dr. XYZ and ask for the nerve block or some treatment modality to stop the pain because she just cannot function on a daily basis and care for her children unless she gets something done about this, and she fears these bladder instillations because they do not seem to help. They seem to be intensifying her pain. She has the extra burden of each time she comes needing to have pain medication one way or another, thus then we would not allow her to drive under the influence of the pain medicine. So, she has to have somebody come with her and that is kind of troublesome to her. We discussed this at length. I did suggest that it was completely appropriate for her to decide. She will terminate these if they are that uncomfortable and do not seem to be giving her any relief, although I did tell her that occasionally people do have discomfort with them and then after the completion of the instillations, they do better and we have also had some people who have had to terminate the instillations because they were too uncomfortable and they could not stand it and they went on to have some other treatment modality. She had Hysterectomy in the past. MEDICATIONS: Premarin 1.25 mg daily, Elmiron 100 mg t.i.d., Elavil 50 mg at bedtime, OxyContin 10 mg three tablets three times a day, Toprol XL 25 mg daily. ALLERGIES: Compazine and Allegra. OBJECTIVE: Vital Signs: Weight: 140 pounds. Blood pressure: 132/90. Pulse: 102. Respirations: 18. Age: 27. PLAN: We discussed going for another evaluation by Dr. XYZ and seeking his opinion. She said that she called him on the phone the other day and told him how miserable she was and he told her that he really thought she needed to complete. The instillations give that a full trial and then he would be willing to see her back. As we discussed these options and she was encouraged to think it over and decide what she would like to do for I could not makeup her mind for her. She said she thought that it was unreasonable to quit now when she only had two or three more treatments to go, but she did indicate that the holiday weekend coming made her fearful and if she was uncomfortable after today�s instillation which she did choose to take then she would choose to cancel Friday�s appointment, also that she would not feel too badly over the holiday weekend. I thought that was reasonable and agreed that that would work out. PROCEDURE:: She was then given 10 mg of morphine subcutaneously because she did not feel she could tolerate the discomfort in the instillation without pain medicine. We waited about 20 minutes. The bladder was then instilled and the urethra was instilled with lidocaine gel which she tolerated and then after a 10-minute wait, the bladder was instilled with DMSO, Kenalog, heparin, and sodium bicarbonate, and the catheter was removed. The patient retained the solution for one hour, changing position every 15 minutes and then voided to empty the bladder. She seemed to tolerate it moderately well. She is to call and let me know what she wishes to do about the Friday scheduled bladder instillation if she tolerated this then she is going to consider trying it. If not, she will cancel and will start over next week or she will see Dr. Friesen."
528,Urology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Recurrent bladder tumors. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Recurrent bladder tumors. OPERATION: Cystoscopy, TUR, and electrofulguration of recurrent bladder tumors. ANESTHESIA: General. INDICATIONS: A 79-year-old woman with recurrent bladder tumors of the bladder neck. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the operating room, prepped and draped in lithotomy position under satisfactory general anesthesia. A #21-French cystourethroscope was inserted into the bladder. Examination of the bladder showed approximately a 3-cm area of erythema and recurrent papillomatosis just above and lateral to the left ureteral orifice. No other lesions were noted. Using a cold punch biopsy forceps, a random biopsy was obtained. The entire area was electrofulgurated using the Bugbee electrode. The patient tolerated the procedure well and left the operating room in satisfactory condition."
529,Urology," CYSTOSCOPY & VISUAL URETHROTOMY OPERATIVE NOTE: The patient was placed in the dorsal lithotomy position and prepped and draped in the usual manner under satisfactory general anesthesia. A Storz urethrotome sheath was inserted into the urethra under direct vision. Visualization revealed a stricture in the bulbous urethra. This was intubated with a 0.038 Teflon-coated guidewire, and using the straight cold urethrotomy knife, it was incised to 12:00 to allow free passage of the scope into the bladder. Visualization revealed no other lesions in the bulbous or membranous urethra. Prostatic urethra was normal for age. No foreign bodies, tumors or stones were seen within the bladder. Over the guidewire, a #16-French Foley catheter with a hole cut in the tip with a Cook cutter was threaded over the guidewire and inserted into the bladder and inflated with 10 mL of sterile water. He was sent to the recovery room in stable condition."
530,Urology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Gross hematuria. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Gross hematuria. OPERATIONS: Cystopyelogram, clot evacuation, transurethral resection of the bladder tumor x2 on the dome and on the left wall of the bladder. ANESTHESIA: Spinal. FINDINGS: Significant amount of bladder clots measuring about 150 to 200 mL, two cupful of clots were removed. There was papillary tumor on the left wall right at the bladder neck and one on the right dome near the bladder neck on the right side. The right ureteral opening was difficult to visualize, the left one was normal. BRIEF HISTORY: The patient is a 78-year-old male with history of gross hematuria and recurrent UTIs. The patient had hematuria. Cystoscopy revealed atypical biopsy. The patient came in again with gross hematuria. The first biopsy was done about a month ago. The patient was to come back and have repeat biopsies done, but before that came into the hospital with gross hematuria. The options of watchful waiting, removal of the clots and biopsies were discussed. Risk of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, MI, DVT and PE were discussed. Morbidity and mortality of the procedure were discussed. Consent was obtained from the daughter-in-law who has the power of attorney in Florida. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the OR. Anesthesia was applied. The patient was placed in the dorsal lithotomy position. The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. The patient had been off of the Coumadin for about 4 days and INR had been reversed. The patient has significant amount of clot upon entering the bladder. There was a tight bladder neck contracture. The prostate was not enlarged. Using ACMI 24-French sheath, using Ellick irrigation about 2 cupful of clots were removed. It took about half an hour to just remove the clots. After removing the clots, using 24-French cutting loop resectoscope, tumor on the left upper wall near the dome or near the 2 o'clock position was resected. This was lateral to the left ureteral opening. The base was coagulated for hemostasis. Same thing was done at 10 o'clock on the right side where there was some tumor that was visualized. The back wall and the rest of the bladder appeared normal. Using 8-French cone-tip catheter, left-sided pyelogram was normal. The right-sided pyelogram was very difficult to obtain and there was some mucosal irritation from the clots. The contrast did go up to what appeared to be the right ureteral opening, but the mucosa seemed to be very much irritated and it was very difficult to actually visualize the opening. A little bit of contrast went out, but the force was not made just to avoid any secondary stricture formation. The patient did have CT with contrast, which showed that the kidneys were normal. At this time, a #24 three-way irrigation was started. The patient was brought to Recovery room in stable condition."
531,Urology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right spermatocele. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right spermatocele. OPERATIONS PERFORMED: 1. Right spermatocelectomy. 2. Right orchidopexy. ANESTHESIA: Local MAC. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal. FLUIDS: Crystalloid. BRIEF HISTORY OF THE PATIENT: The patient is a 77-year-old male who comes to the office with a large right spermatocele. The patient says it does bother him on and off, has occasional pain and discomfort with it, has difficulty with putting clothes on etc. and wanted to remove. Options such as watchful waiting, removal of the spermatocele or needle drainage were discussed. Risk of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, MI, DVT, PE, risk of infection, scrotal pain, and testicular pain were discussed. The patient was told that his scrotum may enlarge in the postoperative period for about a month and it will settle down. The patient was told about the risk of recurrence of spermatocele. The patient understood all the risks, benefits, and options and wanted to proceed with removal. DETAILS OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the OR. Anesthesia was applied. The patient's scrotal area was shaved, prepped, and draped in the usual sterile fashion. A midline scrotal incision was made measuring about 2 cm in size. The incision was carried through the dartos through the scrotal sac and the spermatocele was identified. All the layers of the spermatocele were removed. Clear layer was visualized, was taken all the way up to the base, the base was tied. Entire spermatocele sac was removed. After removing the entire spermatocele sac, hemostasis was obtained. The testicle was not in normal orientation. The testis and epididymis was removed, which is a small appendage on the superior aspect of the testicle. The testicle was placed in a normal orientation. Careful attention was drawn not to twist the cord. Orchidopexy was done to allow the testes to stay stable in the postoperative period using 4-0 Vicryl and was tied at 3 different locations. Absorbable sutures were used, so that the patient does not feel the sutures in the postoperative period. The dartos was closed using 2-0 Vicryl in running locking fashion. There was excellent hemostasis. The skin was closed using 4-0 Monocryl. Dermabond was applied. The patient tolerated the procedure well. The patient was brought to the recovery room in stable condition."

534,Urology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left inguinal hernia. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left indirect inguinal hernia. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Repair of left inguinal hernia indirect. ANESTHESIA: Spinal with local. COMPLICATIONS: None. DISPOSITION: The patient tolerated the procedure well, was transferred to recovery in stable condition. SPECIMEN: Hernia sac. BRIEF HISTORY: The patient is a 60-year-old female that presented to Dr. X's office with complaints of a bulge in the left groin. The patient states that she noticed there this bulge and pain for approximately six days prior to arrival. Upon examination in the office, the patient was found to have a left inguinal hernia consistent with tear, which was scheduled as an outpatient surgery. INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS: The patient was found to have a left indirect inguinal hernia. PROCEDURE: After informed consent was obtained, risks and benefits of the procedure were explained to the patient. The patient was brought to the operating suite. After spinal anesthesia and sedation given, the patient was prepped and draped in normal sterile fashion. In the area of the left inguinal region just superior to the left inguinal ligament tract, the skin was anesthetized with 0.25% Marcaine. Next, a skin incision was made with a #10 blade scalpel. Using Bovie electrocautery, dissection was carried down to Scarpa's fascia until the external oblique was noted. Along the side of the external oblique in the direction of the external ring, incision was made on both sides of the external oblique and then grasped with a hemostat. Next, the hernia and hernia sac was circumferentially grasped and elevated along with the round ligament. Attention was next made to ligating the hernia sac at its base for removal. The hernia sac was opened prior grasping with hemostats. It was a sliding indirect hernia. The bowel contents were returned to abdomen using a #0 Vicryl stick tie pursestring suture at its base. The hernia sac was ligated and then cut above with the Metzenbaum scissors returning it to the abdomen. This was then sutured at the apex of the repair down to the conjoint tendon. Next, attention was made to completely removing the round ligament hernia sac which was again ligated at its base with an #0 Vicryl suture and removed as specimen. Attention was next made to reapproximate it at floor with a modified ______ repair. Using a #2-0 Ethibond suture in simple interrupted fashion, the conjoint tendon was approximated to the ilioinguinal ligament capturing a little bit of the floor of the transversalis fascia. Once this was done, the external oblique was closed over, reapproximated again with a #2-0 Ethibond suture catching each hump in between each repair from the prior floor repair. This was done in simple interrupted fashion as well. Next Scarpa's fascia was reapproximated with #3-0 Vicryl suture. The skin was closed with running subcuticular #4-0 undyed Vicryl suture. Steri-Strips and sterile dressings were applied. The patient tolerated the procedure very well and he was transferred to Recovery in stable condition. The patient had an abnormal chest x-ray in preop and is going for a CT of the chest in Recovery."
535,Urology," PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: This 71-year-old man went to his primary care physician for a routine physical. His only complaints were nocturia times two and a gradual &quot;slowing down&quot; feeling. The physical examination on 1/29 was within normal limits except for the digital rectal exam which revealed an asymmetric prostate gland with nodularity, R&gt;L. PSA was elevated. The differential diagnosis for the visit was abnormal prostate, suggestive of CA. IMAGING: CT pelvis: Irregular indentation of bladder. Seminal vesicles enlarged. Streaky densities in periprostatic fat consistent with transcapular spread to periprostatic plexus. Impression: prostatic malignancy with extracapsular extension and probable regional node metastasis. Bone scan: Negative for distant metastasis. LABORATORY: PSA 32.1 PROCEDURES: Transrectal needle biopsy of prostate. Pelvic lymphadenectomy and radical prostatectomy. PATHOLOGY: Prostate biopsy: Moderate to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma in the right lobe and poorly differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma in the left lobe of prostate. Lymphadenectomy and prostatectomy: Frozen section of removed pelvic lymph nodes demonstrated metastatic adenocarcinoma in one lymph node in the right obturator fossa. Therefore, the radical prostatectomy was canceled. Final pathology diagnosis: Pelvic lymphadenectomy; left obturator fossa, single negative lymph node. Right obturator fossa; metastatic adenocarcinoma in 1/5 lymph nodes. Largest involved node 1.5 cm. TREATMENT: Patient began external beam radiation therapy to the pelvis."
536,Urology," PROSTATE BRACHYTHERAPY - PROSTATE I-125 IMPLANTATION This patient will be treated to the prostate with ultrasound-guided I-125 seed implantation. The original consultation and treatment planning will be separately performed. At the time of the implantation, special coordination will be required. Stepping ultrasound will be performed and utilized in the pre-planning process. Some discrepancies are frequently identified, based on the positioning, edema, and/or change in the tumor since the pre-planning process. Re-assessment is required at the time of surgery, evaluating the pre-plan and comparing to the stepping ultrasound. Modifications will be made in real time to add or subtract needles and seeds as required. This may be integrated with the loading of the seeds performed by the brachytherapist, as well as coordinated with the urologist, dosimetrist or physicist. The brachytherapy must be customized to fit the individual's tumor and prostate. Attention is given both preoperatively and intraoperatively to avoid overdosage of rectum and bladder."
537,Urology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Recurrent bladder tumor. 2. History of bladder carcinoma. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right lateral wall bladder tumor of 1.5 cm in size. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: 1. Cystourethroscopy. 2. Bilateral retrograde pyelogram. 3. Transurethral resection of bladder tumor of 1.5 cm in size. ANESTHESIA: IV general. SPECIMEN: UA for culture and cytology as well as the resecting bladder tumor specimen. INDICATIONS: This is a 52-year-old white female with a history of transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder with previous transurethral resection of the bladder, low grade. The patient had on serial cystoscopy evidence of recurrent bladder tumor at the right posterior wall. CT and IVP were performed and there was some question at the distal ureters. Risks, benefits, and alternatives were discussed with the patient. The informed consent was on the chart at the time of procedure. PROCEDURE DETAILS: The patient did receive Levaquin antibiotics prior to the procedure. She was then wheeled to the Operative Suite and general anesthetic was administered. She was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion and placed in a dorsal lithotomy position. Next, with a #21 French cystoscope, cystourethroscopy was performed. Upon entering the bladder, the urethra was noted to be free of any stones, strictures, diverticulum, or calculi. The bladder was then surveyed. The trigone appeared normal. The ureteral orifices were in normal location and noted efflux of clear yellow urine. The reminder of the bladder was then surveyed. There were some areas of blanched scar tissue from previous resection. Of note, there was a exophytic bladder tumor on the right posterior wall approximately 1.5 cm in diameter. There was no other evidence of recurrent disease, strictures, or calculi. Next, with a #6 French open-ended ureteral catheter, right retrograde pyelogram was performed. The right ureter was noted to uptake contrast freely and there was no evidence of stone, stricture, diverticulum, calculi or filling defects along the entire course of the ureter including the pelvicaliceal system. The catheter was removed and inserted into the left ureteral orifice and once again this appeared to be entirely normal left collecting system with no evidence of stone, stricture, diverticulum, filling defect or other tumor. The bladder was drained and irrigant was switched to glycine and then using the #26 French resectoscope this was assembled and passed into the bladder via the visual obturator. After entering the bladder, the EndoSheath equipped with a _______ resection loop was inserted. The power settings were set at 100 cut and 40 coag and the bladder tumor of the right posterior wall was then resected in its entirety and the entire tumor bed and lateral margins were then fulgurated with cautery. There was no evidence of tumor at the end of the resection. The specimens were collected and then passed off for pathological evaluation. The bladder was then drained and the procedure was terminated. The plan would be for the patient to be discharged home with Levaquin, Urised, and Vicodin. She is to follow up with Dr. X on 09/12/03 at 02:30 p.m. where we will review the pathology and possibly discuss BCG rather intravesical agent being the recurrent nature of this disease."
538,Urology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Radiation cystitis. 2. Refractory voiding dysfunction. 3. Status post radical retropubic prostatectomy and subsequent salvage radiation therapy. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Radiation cystitis. 2. Refractory voiding dysfunction. 3. Status post radical retropubic prostatectomy and subsequent salvage radiation therapy. TITLE OF OPERATION: Salvage cystectomy (very difficult due to postradical prostatectomy and postradiation therapy to the pelvis), Indiana pouch continent cutaneous diversion, and omental pedicle flap to the pelvis. ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal with epidural. INDICATIONS: This patient is a 65-year-old white male who in 1998 had a radical prostatectomy. He was initially dry without pads and then underwent salvage radiation therapy for rising PSA. After that he began with episodes of incontinence as well as urinary retention requiring catheterization. One year ago, he was unable to catheterize and was taken to the operative room and had cystoscopy. He had retained staple removed and a diverticulum identified. There were also bladder stones that were lasered and removed, and he had been incontinent ever since that time. He wears 8 to 10 pads per day, and this has affected his quality of life significantly. I took him to the operating room on January 16, 2008, and found diffuse radiation changes with a small capacity bladder and wide-open bladder neck. We both felt that his lower urinary tract was not rehabilitatable and that a continent cutaneous diversion would solve the number of problems facing him. I felt like if we could remove the bladder safely, then this would also provide a benefit. FINDINGS: At exploration, there were no gross lesions of the smaller or large bowel. The bladder was predictably sucked into the pelvic sidewall both inferiorly and laterally. The opened bladder, which we were able to remove completely, had a wide-open capacious diverticulum in its very distal segment. Because of the previous radiation therapy and a dissection down to the pelvis, I elected to place an omental pedicle flap to provide additional blood supply for healing as well in the pelvis and also under the pubic bone which was exposed inferiorly due to previous surgery and treatment. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was brought to the operative suite and after adequate general endotracheal and epidural anesthesia obtained, placed in the supine position, flexed over the anterosuperior iliac spine, and his abdomen and genitalia were sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion. A nasogastric tube was placed as well as radial arterial line. He was given intravenous antibiotics for prophylaxis. A generous midline skin incision was made from the midepigastrium down to the symphysis pubis, deep into the rectus fascia, the rectus muscle separated in the midline, and exploration carried out with the findings described. Moist wound towels and a Bookwalter retractor were placed for exposure. We began by retracting the bowels by mobilizing the cecum and ascending colon and hepatic flexure and elevating the terminal ileum up to the second and third portion of the duodenum. The ureter was identified as a crisis over the iliac vessels and dissected deep into pelvis and subsequently divided between clips. An identical procedure was performed in the left side with similar findings and the bowels were packed cephalad. We began then dissecting the bladder away from the pelvic side walls staying medial to both epigastric arteries. This was quite challenging because of the previous radiation therapy and radical prostatectomy. We essentially carved the bladder off of the pelvic sidewall inferiorly as best we could and then we were able to have enough freedom to identify the lateral pedicles, and these were taken between double clips approximately and clipped distally. We then approached things posteriorly and carefully dissected between the __________ and posterior bladder. There was some remnant seminal vesicle on the right as well as both remnant ejaculatory duct and we used this to dissect the longus safe plane anterior to the rectum. We then entered the bladder anteriorly as distal as we could and remove the bladder and what we thought was a bladder neck and this appeared to end in a diverticulum. We then peeled it off the remaining rectum and passed the specimen off the operative field. Bladder was irrigated with warm sterile water and a meticulous inspection was made for hemostasis. We then completely mobilized the omentum off of the proximal transverse colon. This allowed a generous flap to be able to be laid into the pelvis without tension. We then turned our attention to forming the Indiana pouch. I completed the dissection of the right hepatic flexure and the proximal transverse colon and mobilized the omentum off of this portion of the colon. The colon was divided proximal to the middle colic using a GIA-80 stapler. I then divided the avascular plane of Treves along the terminal ileum and selected a point approximately 15 cm proximal to the ileocecal valve to divide the ileum. The mesentery was then sealed with a LigaSure device and divided, and the bowel was divided with a GIA-60 stapler. We then performed a side-to-side ileo-transverse colostomy using a GIA-80 stapler, closing the open end with a TA 60. The angles were reinforced with silk sutures and the mesenteric closed with interrupted silk sutures. We then removed the staple line along the terminal ileum, passed a 12-French Robinson catheter into the cecal segment, and plicated the ileum with 3 firings of the GIA-60 stapler. The ileocecal valve was then reinforced with interrupted 3-0 silk sutures as described by Rowland, et al, and following this, passage of an 18-French Robinson catheter was associated with the characteristic &quot;pop,&quot; indicating that we had adequately plicated the ileocecal valve. As the patient had had a previous appendectomy, we made an opening in the cecum in the area of the previous appendectomy. We then removed the distal staple line along the transverse colon and aligned the cecal end and the distal middle colic end with two 3-0 Vicryl sutures. The bowel segment was then folded over on itself and the reservoir formed with 3 successive applications of the SGIA Polysorb-75. Between the staple lines, Vicryl sutures were placed and the defects closed with 3-0 Vicryl suture ligatures. We then turned our attention to forming the ileocolonic anastomosis. The left ureter was mobilized and brought underneath the sigmoid mesentery and brought through the mesentery of the terminal ileum and an end-to-side anastomosis performed with an open technique using interrupted 4-0 Vicryl sutures, and this was stented with a Cook 8.4-French ureteral stent, and this was secured to the bowel lumen with a 5-0 chromic suture. The right ureter was brought underneath the pouch and placed in a stented fashion with an identical anastomosis. We then brought the stents out through a separate incision cephalad in the pouch and they were secured with a 2-0 chromic suture. A 24-French Malecot catheter was placed through the cecum and secured with a chromic suture. The staple lines were then buried with a running 3-0 Vicryl two-layer suture and the open end of the pouch closed with a TA 60 Polysorb suture. The pouch was filled to 240 cc and noted to be watertight, and the ureteral anastomoses were intact. We then made a final inspection for hemostasis. The cecostomy tube was then brought out to the right lower quadrant and secured to the skin with silk sutures. We then matured our stoma through the umbilicus. We removed the plug of skin through the umbilicus and delivered the ileal segment through this. A portion of the ileum was removed and healthy, well-vascularized tissue was matured with interrupted 3-0 chromic sutures. We left an 18-French Robinson through the stomag and secured this to the skin with silk sutures. The Malecot and stents were also secured in a similar fashion. We matured the stoma to the umbilicus with interrupted chromic stitches. The stitch was brought out to the right upper quadrant and the Malecot to the left lower quadrant. A Large JP drain was placed in the pelvis dependent to the omentum pedicle flap as well as the Indiana pouch. The rectus fascia was closed with a buried #2 Prolene running stitch, tying a new figure-of-eight proximally and distally and meeting in the middle and tying it underneath the fascia. Subcutaneous tissue was irrigated with saline and skin was closed with surgical clips. The estimated blood loss was 450 mL, and the patient received no packed red blood cells. The final sponge and needle count were reported to be correct. The patient was awakened and extubated, and taken on stretcher to the recovery room in satisfactory condition."
539,Urology, OPERATIVE NOTE: The patient was taken to the operating room and was placed in the supine position on the operating room table. A general inhalation anesthetic was administered. The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. The urethral meatus was calibrated with a small mosquito hemostat and was gently dilated. Next a midline ventral type incision was made opening the meatus. This was done after clamping the tissue to control bleeding. The meatus was opened for about 3 mm. Next the meatus was calibrated and easily calibrated from 8 to 12 French with bougie sounds. Next the mucosal edges were everted and reapproximated to the glans skin edges with approximately five interrupted 6-0 Vicryl sutures. The meatus still calibrated between 10 and 12 French. Antibiotic ointment was applied. The procedure was terminated. The patient was awakened and returned to the recovery room in stable condition.
540,Urology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Prostate cancer. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Prostate cancer. OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: Radical retropubic prostatectomy with pelvic lymph node dissection. ANESTHESIA: General epidural ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 800 cc. COMPLICATIONS: None. INDICATIONS FOR SURGERY: This is a 64-year-old man with adenocarcinoma of the prostate confirmed by needle biopsies. He has elected to undergo radical retropubic prostatectomy with pelvic lymph node dissection. Potential complications include, but are not limited to: 1. Infection. 2. Bleeding. 3. Incontinence. 4. Impotence. 5. Deep venous thrombosis. 6. Recurrence of the cancer. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: Epidural anesthesia was administered by the anesthesiologist in the holding area. Preoperative antibiotic was also given in the preoperative holding area. The patient was then taken into the operating room after which general LMA anesthesia was administered. The patient was shaved and then prepped using Betadine solution. A sterile 16-French Foley catheter was inserted into the bladder with clear urine drain. A midline infraumbilical incision was performed. The rectus fascia was opened sharply. The perivesical space and the retropubic space were developed bluntly. Bookwalter retractor was then placed. Bilateral obturator pelvic lymphadenectomy was performed. The obturator nerve was identified and was untouched. The margin for the resection of the lymph node bilaterally were the Cooper's ligament, the medial edge of the external iliac artery, the bifurcation of the common iliac vein, the obturator nerve, and the bladder. Both hemostasis and lymphostasis was achieved by using silk ties and Hemo clips. The lymph nodes were palpably normal and were set for permanent section. The Bookwalter retractor was then repositioned and the endopelvic fascia was opened bilaterally using Metzenbaum scissors. The puboprostatic ligament was taken down sharply. The superficial dorsal vein complex over the prostate was bunched up by using the Allis clamp and then tied by using 2-0 silk sutures. The deep dorsal vein complex was then bunched up by using the Allis over the membranous urethral area. The dorsal vein complex was ligated by using 0 Vicryl suture on a CT-1 needle. The Allis clamp was removed and the dorsal vein complex was transected by using Metzenbaum scissors. The urethra was then identified and was dissected out. The urethral opening was made just distal to the apex of the prostate by using Metzenbaum scissors. This was extended circumferentially until the Foley catheter could be seen clearly. 2-0 Monocryl sutures were then placed on the urethral stump evenly spaced out for the anastomosis to be performed later. The Foley catheter was removed and the posteriormost aspect of urethra and rectourethralis muscle was transected. The lateral pelvic fascia was opened bilaterally to sweep the neurovascular bundles laterally on both sides. The plane between Denonvilliers' fascia and the perirectal fat was developed sharply. No tension was placed on the neurovascular bundle at any point in time. The prostate dissected off the rectal wall easily. Once the seminal vesicles were identified, the fascia covering over them were opened transversely. The seminal vesicles were dissected out and the small bleeding vessels leading to them were clipped by using medium clips and then transected. The bladder neck was then dissected out carefully to spare most of the bladder neck muscles. Once all of the prostate had been dissected off the bladder neck circumferentially the mucosa lining the bladder neck was transected releasing the entire specimen. The specimen was inspected and appeared to be completely intact. It was sent for permanent section. The bladder neck mucosa was then everted by using 4-0 chromic sutures. Inspection at the prostatic bed revealed no bleeding vessels. The sutures, which were placed previously onto the urethral stump, were then placed onto the bladder neck. Once the posterior sutures had been placed, the Foley was placed into the urethra and into the bladder neck. A 20-French Foley Catheter was used. The anterior sutures were then placed. The Foley was then inflated. The bed was straightened and the sutures were tied down sequentially from anteriorly to posteriorly. Mild traction of the Foley catheter was placed to assure the anastomosis was tight. Two #19-French Blake drains were placed in the perivesical spaces. These were anchored to the skin by using 2-0 silk sutures. The instrument counts, lab counts, and sponge counts were verified to be correct, the patient was closed. The fascia was closed in running fashion using #1 PDS. Subcutaneous tissue was closed by using 2-0 Vicryl suture. Skin was approximated by using metallic clips. The patient tolerated the operation well."

COMPLICATIONS: None. CONDITION: Stable. PROCEDURE: The patient was placed in the supine position and sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion. After 2% lidocaine was instilled, the anterior urethra is normal. The prostatic urethra reveals mild lateral lobe obstruction. There are no bladder tumors noted. IMPRESSION: The patient has some mild benign prostatic hyperplasia. At this point in time, we will continue with conservative observation. PLAN: The patient will follow up as needed."
542,Urology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Stress urinary incontinence, intrinsic sphincter deficiency. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Stress urinary incontinence, intrinsic sphincter deficiency. OPERATIONS: Cystoscopy, cystocele repair, BioArc midurethral sling. ANESTHESIA: Spinal. EBL: Minimal. FLUIDS: Crystalloid. BRIEF HISTORY: The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of hysterectomy, complained of urgency, frequency, and stress urinary incontinence. The patient had urodynamics done and a cystoscopy, which revealed intrinsic sphincter deficiency. Options such as watchful waiting, Kegel exercises, broad-based sling to help with ISD versus Coaptite bulking agents were discussed. Risks and benefits of all the procedures were discussed. The patient understood and wanted to proceed with BioArc. Risk of failure of the procedure, recurrence of incontinence due to urgency, mesh erosion, exposure, etc., were discussed. Risk of MI, DVT, PE, and bleeding etc., were discussed. The patient understood the risk of infection and wanted to proceed with the procedure. The patient was told that due to the intrinsic sphincter deficiency, we will try to make the sling little bit tighter to allow better urethral closure, which may put her a high risk of retention versus if we make it too loose, then she may leak afterwards. The patient understood and wanted to proceed with the procedure. DETAILS OF THE OPERATION: The patient was brought to the OR and anesthesia was applied. The patient was placed in dorsal lithotomy position. The patient was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion. A Foley catheter was placed. Bladder was emptied. Two Allis clamps were placed on the anterior vaginal mucosa. Lidocaine 1% with epinephrine was applied, and hydrodissection was done. Incision was made. A bladder was lifted off of the vaginal mucosa. The bladder cystocele was reduced. Two stab incisions were placed on the lateral thigh over the medial aspect of the obturator canal. Using BioArc needle, the needles were passed through under direct palpation through the vaginal incision from the lateral thigh to the vaginal incision. The mesh arms were attached and arms were pulled back the outer plastic sheath and the excess mesh was removed. The mesh was right at the bladder neck to the mid-urethra, completely covering over the entire urethra. The sling was kept little tight, even though the right angle was easily placed between the urethra and the BioArc material. The urethra was coapted very nicely. At the end of the procedure, cystoscopy was done and there was no injury to the bladder. There was good efflux of urine with indigo carmine coming through from both the ureteral openings. The urethra was normal, seemed to have closed up very nicely with the repair. The vaginal mucosa was closed using 0 Vicryl in interrupted fashion. The lateral thigh incisions were closed using Dermabond. Please note that the irrigation with antibiotic solution was done prior to the BioArc mesh placement. The mesh was placed in antibiotic solution prior to the placement in the body. The patient tolerated the procedure well. After closure, Premarin cream was applied. The patient was told to use Premarin cream postop. The patient was brought to Recovery in stable condition. The patient was told not to do any heavy lifting, pushing, pulling, and no tub bath, etc., for at least 2 months. The patient understood. The patient was to follow up as an outpatient."
543,Urology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES 1. Adrenal mass, right sided. 2. Umbilical hernia. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES 1. Adrenal mass, right sided. 2. Umbilical hernia. OPERATION PERFORMED: Laparoscopic hand-assisted left adrenalectomy and umbilical hernia repair. ANESTHESIA: General. CLINICAL NOTE: This is a 52-year-old inmate with a 5.5 cm diameter nonfunctioning mass in his right adrenal. Procedure was explained including risks of infection, bleeding, possibility of transfusion, possibility of further treatments being required. Alternative of fully laparoscopic are open surgery or watching the lesion. DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: In the right flank-up position, table was flexed. He had a Foley catheter in place. Incision was made from just above the umbilicus, about 5.5 cm in diameter. The umbilical hernia was taken down. An 11 mm trocar was placed in the midline, superior to the GelPort and a 5 mm trocar placed in the midaxillary line below the costal margin. A liver retractor was placed to this. The colon was reflected medially by incising the white line of Toldt. The liver attachments to the adrenal kidney were divided and the liver was reflected superiorly. The vena cava was identified. The main renal vein was identified. Coming superior to the main renal vein, staying right on the vena cava, all small vessels were clipped and then divided. Coming along the superior pole of the kidney, the tumor was dissected free from top of the kidney with clips and Bovie. The harmonic scalpel was utilized superiorly and laterally. Posterior attachments were divided between clips and once the whole adrenal was mobilized, the adrenal vein and one large adrenal artery were noted, doubly clipped, and divided. Specimen was placed in a collection bag, removed intact. Hemostasis was excellent. The umbilical hernia had been completely taken down. The edges were freshened up. Vicryl #1 was utilized to close the incision and 2-0 Vicryl was used to close the fascia of the trocar. Skin closed with clips. He tolerated the procedure well. All sponge and instrument counts were correct. Estimated blood loss less than 100 mL. The patient was awakened, extubated, and returned to recovery room in satisfactory condition."
544,Urology," PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Inguinal herniorrhaphy. PROCEDURE: After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the operative suite and placed supine on the operating table. General endotracheal anesthesia was induced without incident. The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner. A standard inguinal incision was made and dissection was carried down to the external oblique aponeurosis using a combination of Metzenbaum scissors and Bovie electrocautery. The external oblique aponeurosis was cleared of overlying adherent tissue, and the external ring was delineated. The external oblique was then incised with a scalpel, and this incision was carried out to the external ring using Metzenbaum scissors. Having exposed the inguinal canal, the cord structures were separated from the canal using blunt dissection, and a Penrose drain was placed around the cord structures at the level of the pubic tubercle. This Penrose drain was then used to retract the cord structures as needed. Adherent cremasteric muscle was dissected free from the cord using Bovie electrocautery. The cord was then explored using a combination of sharp and blunt dissection, and the sac was found anteromedially to the cord structures. The sac was dissected free from the cord structures using a combination of blunt dissection and Bovie electrocautery. Once preperitoneal fat was encountered, the dissection stopped and the sac was suture ligated at the level of the preperitoneal fat using a 2-0 silk suture ligature. The sac was excised and went to Pathology. The ends of the suture were then cut and the stump retracted back into the abdomen. The Penrose drain was removed. The wound was then irrigated using sterile saline, and hemostasis was obtained using Bovie electrocautery. The incision in the external oblique was approximated using a 3-0 Vicryl in a running fashion, thus reforming the external ring. The skin incision was approximated with 4-0 Vicryl in a subcuticular fashion. The skin was prepped and draped with benzoin, and Steri-Strips were applied. A dressing consisting of a 2 x 2 and OpSite was then applied. All surgical counts were reported as correct. Having tolerated the procedure well, the patient was subsequently extubated and taken to the recovery room in good and stable condition."

546,Urology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Recurrent right inguinal hernia, as well as phimosis. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Recurrent right inguinal hernia, as well as phimosis. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Laparoscopic right inguinal herniorrhaphy with mesh, as well as a circumcision. ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal. COMPLICATIONS: None. DISPOSITION: The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to recovery room in stable condition. SPECIMEN: Foreskin. BRIEF HISTORY: This patient is a 66-year-old African-American male who presented to Dr. Y's office with recurrent right inguinal hernia for the second time requesting hernia repair. The procedure was discussed with the patient and the patient opted for laparoscopic repair due to multiple attempts at the open inguinal repair on the right. The patient also is requesting circumcision with phimosis at the same operating time setting. INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS: The patient was found to have a right inguinal hernia with omentum and bowel within the hernia, which was easily reduced. The patient was also found to have a phimosis, which was easily removed. PROCEDURE: After informed consent, the risks and benefits of the procedure were explained to the patient. The patient was brought to operating suite, after general endotracheal intubation, prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion. An infraumbilical incision was made with a #15 Bard-Parker scalpel. The umbilical skin was elevated with a towel clip and the Veress needle was inserted without difficulty. Saline drop test proved entrance into the abdominal cavity and then the abdomen was insufflated to sufficient pressure of 15 mmHg. Next, the Veress was removed and #10 bladed trocar was inserted without difficulty. The 30-degree camera laparoscope was then inserted and the abdomen was explored. There was evidence of a large right inguinal hernia, which had omentum as well as bowel within it, easily reducible. Attention was next made to placing a #12 port in the right upper quadrant, four fingerbreadths from the umbilicus. Again, a skin was made with a #15 blade scalpel and the #12 port was inserted under direct visualization. A #5 port was inserted in the left upper quadrant in similar fashion without difficulty under direct visualization. Next, a grasper with blunt dissector was used to reduce the hernia and withdraw the sac and using an Endoshears, the peritoneum was scored towards the midline and towards the medial umbilical ligament and lateral. The peritoneum was then spread using the blunt dissector, opening up and identifying the iliopubic tract, which was identified without difficulty. Dissection was carried out, freeing up the hernia sac from the peritoneum. This was done without difficulty reducing the hernia in its entirety. Attention was next made to placing a piece of Prolene mesh, it was placed through the #12 port and placed into the desired position, stapled into place in its medial aspect via the 4 mm staples along the iliopubic tract. The 4.8 mm staples were then used to staple the superior edge of the mesh just below the peritoneum and then the patient was re-peritonealized, re-approximating edge of the perineum with the 4.8 mm staples. This was done without difficulty. All three ports were removed under direct visualization. No evidence of bleeding and the #10 and #12 mm ports were closed with #0-Vicryl and UR6 needle. Skin was closed with running subcuticular #4-0 undyed Vicryl. Steri-Strips and sterile dressings were applied. Attention was next made to carrying out the circumcision. The foreskin was retracted back over the penis head. The desired amount of removing foreskin was marked out with a skin marker. The foreskin was then put on tension using a clamp to protect the penis head. A #15 blade scalpel was used to remove the foreskin and sending off as specimen. This was done without difficulty. Next, the remaining edges were retracted, hemostasis was obtained with Bovie electrocautery and the skin edges were re-approximated with #2-0 plain gut in simple interrupted fashion and circumferentially. This was done without difficulty maintaining hemostasis. A petroleum jelly was applied with a Coban dressing. The patient tolerated this procedure well and was well and was transferred to recovery after extubation in stable condition."

Activity of 0.439, 30 seeds in the periphery with 10 needles and total of 8 seeds at the anterior of the fold, 4 needles. Please note that the total needles placed on the top were actually 38 seeds and 22 seeds were returned back. BRIEF HISTORY: This is a 72-year-old male who presented to us with elevated PSA and prostate biopsy with Gleason 6 cancer on the right apex. Options such as watchful waiting, brachytherapy, radical prostatectomy, cryotherapy, and external beam radiation were discussed. Risk of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, MI, DVT, PE, incontinence, erectile dysfunction, urethral stricture, dysuria, burning pain, hematuria, future procedures, and failure of the procedure were all discussed. The patient understood all the risks, benefits, and options and wanted to proceed with the procedure. The patient wanted to wait until he came back from his summer vacations, so a one dose of Zoladex was given. Prostate size measured about 15 g in the OR and about 22 g about two months ago. Consent was obtained. DETAILS OF THE OPERATION: The patient was brought to the OR and anesthesia was applied. The patient was placed in dorsal lithotomy position. The patient had a Foley catheter placed sterilely. The scrotum was taped up using Ioban. Transrectal ultrasound was done. The prostate was measured 15 g. Multiple images were taken. A volume study was done. This was given to the physicist, Dr. X was present who is radiation oncologist who helped with implanting of the seeds. Total of 38 seeds were placed in the patient with 10 peripheral needles and then 4 internal needles. Total of 30 seeds were placed in the periphery and total of 8 seeds were placed in the inside. They were done directly under transrectal ultrasound vision. The seeds were placed directly under ultrasound guidance. There was a nice distribution of the seeds. A couple of more seeds were placed on the right side due to the location of the prostate cancer. Subsequently at the end of the procedure, fluoroscopy was done. Couple of images were obtained. Cystoscopy was done at the end of the procedure where a seed was visualized right in the urethra, which was grasped and pulled out using grasper, which was difficult to get the seed off of the spacers, which was actually pulled out. There were no further seeds visualized in the bladder. The bladder appeared normal. At the end of the procedure, a Foley catheter was kept in place of 18 French and the patient was brought to recovery in stable condition."

550,Urology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Phimosis. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Phimosis. OPERATIONS: Circumcision. ANESTHESIA: LMA. EBL: Minimal. FLUIDS: Crystalloid. BRIEF HISTORY: This is a 3-year-old male, who was referred to us from Dr. X's office with phimosis. The patient had spraying of urine and ballooning of the foreskin with voiding. The urine seemed to have collected underneath the foreskin and then would slowly drip out. Options such as dorsal slit, circumcision, watchful waiting by gently pulling the foreskin back were discussed. Risk of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, scarring, and expected complications were discussed. The patient's family understood all the complications and wanted to proceed with the procedure. Consent was obtained using interpreter. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the OR and anesthesia was applied. The patient was placed in supine position. The patient was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion. All the penile adhesions were released prior to the prepping. The extra foreskin was marked off, 1 x 3 Gamco clamp was used. Hemostasis was obtained after removing the extra foreskin using the Gamco clamp. Using 5-0 Monocryl, 4 quadrant stitches were placed and horizontal mattress suturing was done. There was excellent hemostasis. Dermabond was applied. The patient was brought to recovery at the end of the procedure in stable condition."
551,Urology," The patient was placed in the supine position, prepped and draped in the usual manner. Circumferential proximal incisions were made on the foreskin and dissected down to the underlying tissue. Hemostasis was obtained with a needlepoint Bovie. The foreskin was dissected sharply off of the shaft of the penis. Hemostasis controlled. The proximal and distal penile coronal skin was reanastomosed using 4-0 chromic catgut in interrupted fashion. 0.25% Marcaine was used around the base of the penis for a pain block postoperatively and Vaseline soaked gauze wrapped around the penis loosely as a dressing. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was sent to the Recovery Room in stable condition."
552,Urology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Bilateral inguinal hernia. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Bilateral inguinal hernia. PROCEDURE: Bilateral direct inguinal hernia repair utilizing PHS system and placement of On-Q pain pump. ANESTHESIA: General with endotracheal intubation. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating room table. General anesthesia was administered with endotracheal intubation and the abdomen and groins were prepped and draped in standard, sterile surgical fashion. I did an ilioinguinal nerve block on both sides, injecting Marcaine 1 fingerbreadth anterior and 1 fingerbreadth superior to the anterior superior iliac spine on both sides. I began on the right side by making an incision in a skin crease 1 fingerbreadth above the pubic tubercle. I dissected down through the skin and subcutaneous tissue and through Scarpa's fascia. I identified the external ring and divided the external oblique up toward the anterior superior iliac spine. I located the ilioinguinal nerve and isolated it out of the wound. I encircled the cord structures and, dissecting out the cord structures, I did not visualize any sac. The floor of the inguinal canal was very loose and there was an obvious direct hernia. I cut open the floor and dissected out the preperitoneal space so I created a preperitoneal space. I took a PHS mesh system and took the posterior portion of the PHS mesh system and put it in through the hole in the floor of the inguinal canal. I made sure that it sat flat completely covering the myopectineal orifice. I then tacked the anterior part of the PHS mesh system to the pubic tubercle, superiorly to the internal oblique, inferiorly to the shelving edge of the inguinal ligament. I cut a hole in the mesh and recreated the internal ring and sewed it closed, making sure it was not too tight on the cord structures. I tucked the extended portion of the mesh underneath the external oblique between the external oblique and the internal oblique, thereby completing the hernia repair. I placed the ilioinguinal nerve back in its anatomical position. I then closed the external obliques with a running 3-0 Vicryl. I placed on On-Q pain pump through a separate stab incision utilizing a tear-away sheath catheter. I then closed Scarpa's fascia, the subcutaneous tissue and skin with a running Monocryl. I did the exact same procedure on the opposite side. On the left side, I cut a skin incision in the skin crease above the pubic tubercle. I dissected down through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. I opened up Scarpa's fascia and identified the external ring. I opened up the external ring towards the anterior superior iliac spine. I isolated the ilioinguinal nerve so it was not damaged. I dissected out the cord and inspected the cord carefully. I did not see any sac there, but there was a weak direct floor with an obvious direct inguinal hernia. I opened the floor over this direct inguinal hernia. I cleared out the preperitoneal space and then placed the posterior portion of the PHS mesh system in place and made it lay out flat in order to cover the myopectineal orifice. I took the anterior portion of the mesh and tacked it to the pubic tubercle. I tacked the superior portion to the internal oblique, inferior portion to the shelving edge of the inguinal ligament. I cut a hole in order to incorporate the cord structures and sewed it back together. I made sure this was not too tight. I then tucked the extended portion of the mesh underneath the external oblique between the external oblique and the internal oblique. I returned the ilioinguinal nerve to its original position. I closed the external oblique with a running 3-0 Vicryl. I placed an On-Q pain pump through a separate stab incision and had the catheter thread right into the wound cavity. I then closed the Scarpa's fascia with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl suture. I closed the subcutaneous tissue with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl suture and closed the skin with running Monocryl. Sponge, instrument and needle counts were correct at the end of the case. The patient tolerated the procedure well without any complications."
553,Urology," ADMITTING DIAGNOSES: 1. Hematuria. 2. Benign prostatic hyperplasia. 3. Osteoarthritis. DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: 1. Hematuria, resolved. 2. Benign prostatic hyperplasia. 3. Complex renal cyst versus renal cell carcinoma or other tumor. 4. Osteoarthritis. HOSPITAL COURSE: This is a 77-year-old African-American male who was previously well until he began having gross hematuria and clots passing through his urethra on the day of admission. He stated that he never had blood in his urine before, however, he does have a past history of BPH and he had a transurethral resection of prostate more than 10 years ago. He was admitted to a regular bed. Dr. G of Urology was consulted for evaluation of his hematuria. During the workup for this, he had a CT of the abdomen and pelvis with and without contrast with early and late-phase imaging for evaluation of the kidneys and collecting system. At that time, he was shown to have multiple bilateral renal cysts with one that did not meet classification as a simple cyst and ultrasound was recommended. He had an ultrasound done of the cyst which showed a 2.1 x 2.7 cm mass arising from the right kidney which, again, did not fit ultrasound criteria for a simple cyst and they recommended further evaluation by an MRI as this could be a hemorrhagic cyst or a solid mass or tumor, so an MRI was scheduled on the day of discharge for further evaluation of this. The report was not back at discharge. The patient had a cystoscopy and transurethral resection of prostate as well with entire resection of the prostate gland. Pathology on this specimen showed multiple portions of prostatic tissue which was primarily fibromuscular, and he was diagnosed with nonprostatic hyperplasia. His urine slowly cleared. He tolerated a regular diet with no difficulties in his activities of daily living, and his Foley was removed on the day of discharge. He was started on ciprofloxacin, Colace, and Lasix after the transurethral resection and continued these for a short course. He is asked to continue the Colace as an outpatient for stool softening for comfort. DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Colace 100 mg 1 b.i.d. DISCHARGE FOLLOWUP PLANNING: The patient is to follow up with his primary care physician at ABCD, Dr. B or Dr. J, the patient is unsure of which, in the next couple weeks. He is to follow up with Dr. G of Urology in the next week by phone in regards to the patient's MRI and plans for a laparoscopic partial renal resection biopsy. This is scheduled for the week after discharge potentially by Dr. G, and the patient will discuss the exact time later this week. The patient is to return to the emergency room or to our clinic if he has worsening hematuria again or no urine output."
554,Urology," PROCEDURES: 1. Release of ventral chordee. 2. Circumcision. 3. Repair of partial duplication of urethral meatus. INDICATIONS: The patient is an 11-month-old baby boy who presented for evaluation of a duplicated urethral meatus as well as ventral chordee and dorsal prepuce hooding. He is here electively for surgical correction. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was brought back into operating room 35. After successful induction of general endotracheal anesthetic, giving the patient, preoperative antibiotics and after completing a preoperative time out, the patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. A holding stitch was placed in the glans penis. At this point, we probed both urethral meatus. Using the Crede maneuver, we could see urine clearly coming out of the lower, the more ventral meatus. At this point, we cannulated this with a 6-French hypospadias catheter. We attempted to cannulate the dorsal opening, however, we were unsuccessful. We then attempted to place lacrimal probes and were also unsuccessful indicating this was incomplete duplication. At this point, we identified the band connecting both the urethral meatus and incised it with tenotomy scissors. We sutured both meatus together such that there was one meatus at the normal position at the tip of the glans. At this point, we made a circumcising incision around the penis and degloved the penis in its entirety relieving all chordee. Once all the chordee had been adequately released, we turned our attention to the circumcision. Excessive dorsal foreskin was removed from the skin and glans. Mucosal cuts were reapproximated with interrupted 5-0 chromic suture. Dermabond was placed over this and bacitracin was placed on this once dry. This ended the procedure. DRAINS: None. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal. URINE OUTPUT: Unrecorded. COMPLICATIONS: None apparent. DISPOSITION: The patient will now go under the care of Dr. XYZ, Plastic Surgery, for excision of scalp hemangioma."

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT TESTING: CBC was done, which had a hemoglobin of 7.7 and hematocrit of 22.6. Neutrophils were 81%. The RDW was 18.5, and the rest of the values were all within normal limits and unremarkable. Chemistry had a sodium of 134, a glucose of 132, calcium is 8.2, and rest of the values are unremarkable. Alkaline phosphatase was 770 and albumin was 2.4. Rest of the values all are within normal limits of the LFTs. Urinalysis was grossly bloody with a large amount of blood and greater than 50 rbc's. The patient also had greater than 300 of the protein reading, moderate leukocytes, 30-50 white blood cells, but no bacteria were seen. Coagulation profile study had a PT of 15.9, PTT of 43 and INR of 1.3. EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE: The patient was given normal saline 2 liters over 1 hour without any adverse effect. The patient was given multiple doses of morphine to maintain his comfort while here in the emergency room without any adverse effect. The patient was given Levaquin 500 mg by mouth as well as 2 doses of Phenergan over the course of his stay here in the emergency department. The patient did not have an adverse reaction to these medicines either. Phenergan resolved his nausea and morphine did relieve his pain and make him pain free. I spoke with Dr. X, the patient's urologist, about most appropriate step for the patient, and Dr. X said he would be happy to care for the patient in the hospital and do urologic scopes if necessary and surgery if necessary and blood transfusion. It was all a matter of what the patient wished to do given the advanced stage of his cancer. Dr. X was willing to assist in any way the patient wished him to. I spoke with the patient and his son about what he would like to do and what the options were from doing nothing from keeping him comfortable with pain medicines to admitting him to the hospital with the possibility of scopes and even surgery being done as well as the blood transfusion. The patient decided to choose a middle ground in which he would be transfused with 2 units of blood here in the emergency room and go home tonight. The patient's son felt comfortable with his father's choice. This was done. The patient was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells after appropriately typed and match. The patient did not have any adverse reaction at any point with his transfusion. There was no fever, no shortness of breath, and at the time of disposition, the patient stated he felt a little better and felt like he had a little more strength. Over the course of the patient's several-hour stay in the emergency room, the patient did end up developing enough problems with clotted blood in his bladder that he had a urinary obstruction. Foley catheter was placed, which produced bloody urine and relieved the developing discomfort of a full bladder. The patient was given a leg bag and the Foley catheter was left in place. DIAGNOSES 1. HEMATURIA. 2. PROSTATE CANCER WITH BONE AND BLADDER METASTATIC DISEASE. 3. SIGNIFICANT ANEMIA. 4. URINARY OBSTRUCTION. CONDITION ON DISPOSITION: Fair, but improved. DISPOSITION: To home with his son. PLAN: We will have the patient follow up with Dr. X in his office in 2 days for reevaluation. The patient was given a prescription for Levaquin and Phenergan tablets to take home with him tonight. The patient was encouraged to drink extra water. The patient was given discharge instructions on hematuria and asked to return to the emergency room should he have any worsening of his condition or develop any other problems or symptoms of concern."
556,Urology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right lower pole renal stone and possibly infected stent. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right lower pole renal stone and possibly infected stent. OPERATION: Cysto stent removal. ANESTHESIA: Local MAC. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal. FLUIDS: Crystalloid. MEDICATIONS: The patient was on vancomycin and Levaquin was given x1 dose. The patient was on vancomycin for the last 5 days. BRIEF HISTORY: The patient is a 53-year-old female who presented with Enterococcus urosepsis. CT scan showed a lower pole stone with a stent in place. The stent was placed about 2 months ago, but when patient came in with a possibly UPJ stone with fevers of unknown etiology. The patient had a stent placed at that time due to the fevers, thinking that this was an urospetic stone. There was some pus that came out. The patient was cultured; actually it was negative at that time. The patient subsequently was found to have lower extremity DVT and then was started on Coumadin. The patient cannot be taken off Coumadin for the next 6 months due to the significant swelling and high risk for PE. The repeat films were taken which showed the stone had migrated into the pole. The stent was intact. The patient subsequently developed recurrent UTIs and Enterococcus in the urine with fevers. The patient was admitted for IV antibiotics since the patient could not really tolerate penicillin due to allergy and due to patient being on Coumadin, Cipro, and Levaquin where treatment was little bit more complicated. Due to drug interaction, the patient was admitted for IV antibiotic treatment. The thinking was that either the stone or the stent is infected, since the stone is pretty small in size, the stent is very likely possibility that it could have been infected and now it needs to be removed. Since the stone is not obstructing, there is no reason to replace the stent at this time. We are unable to do the ureteroscopy or the shock-wave lithotripsy when the patient is fully anticoagulated. So, the best option at this time is to probably wait and perform the ureteroscopic laser lithotripsy when the patient is allowed to off her Coumadin, which would be probably about 4 months down the road. Plan is to get rid of the stent and improve patient's urinary symptoms and to get rid of the infection and we will worry about the stone at later point. DETAILS OF THE OR: Consent had been obtained from the patient. Risks, benefits, and options were discussed. Risk of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, MI, DVT, and PE were discussed. The patient understood all the risks and benefits of removing the stent and wanted to proceed. The patient was brought to the OR. The patient was placed in dorsal lithotomy position. The patient was given some IV pain meds. The patient had received vancomycin and Levaquin preop. Cystoscopy was performed using graspers. The stent was removed without difficulty. Plan was for repeat cultures and continuation of the IV antibiotics."
557,Urology," PROCEDURE: Circumcision. Signed informed consent was obtained and the procedure explained. The child was placed in a Circumstraint board and restrained in the usual fashion. The area of the penis and scrotum were prepared with povidone iodine solution. The area was draped with sterile drapes, and the remainder of the procedure was done with sterile procedure. A dorsal penile block was done using 2 injections of 0.3 cc each, 1% plain lidocaine. A dorsal slit was made, and the prepuce was dissected away from the glans penis. A ** Gomco clamp was properly placed for 5 minutes. During this time, the foreskin was sharply excised using a #10 blade. With removal of the clamp, there was a good cosmetic outcome and no bleeding. The child appeared to tolerate the procedure well. Care instructions were given to the parents."
558,Urology," PROCEDURES: 1. Robotic-assisted pyeloplasty. 2. Anterograde right ureteral stent placement. 3. Transposition of anterior crossing vessels on the right. 4. Nephrolithotomy. DIAGNOSIS: Right ureteropelvic junction obstruction. DRAINS: 1. Jackson-Pratt drain times one from the right flank. 2. Foley catheter times one. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Less than 30 cc. COMPLICATIONS: None. SPECIMENS: 1. Renal pelvis. 2. Kidney stones. INDICATIONS: The patient is a 30-year-old Caucasian gentleman with history of hematuria subsequently found to have right renal stones and patulous right collecting system with notable two right crossing renal arteries. Up on consideration of various modalities and therapy, the patient decided to undergo surgical therapy. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was verified by armband and the procedure being robotic-assisted right pyeloplasty with nephrolithotomy was verified, and the procedure was carried out. After institution of general endotracheal anesthesia and intravenous preoperative antibiotics, the patient was positioned into the right flank position with his right flank elevated. Great care was taken to pad all pressure points and a right arm hanger was used. The patient was flexed slightly, and a kidney rest was used. Sequential compression devices were also placed. Next, the patient was prepped and draped in normal sterile fashion with povidone-iodine. Pneumoperitoneum was obtained by placing a Veress needle in the area of the umbilicus after it passed the water test. A low pressure, high flow pneumoperitoneum was adequately obtained using CO2 gas. Next, a 12-mm camera port was placed near the umbilicus. The camera was inserted, and no bowel injury was seen. Next, under direct vision flanking 8 mm camera ports, a 12 mm assist port, a 5 mm liver retraction port, and 5 mm assist port were placed. The robot was docked and the instruments passed through respective checks. Initial attention was directed to mobilizing the right colon from the abdominal wall totally medially. Next, the right lateral duodenum was cauterized for further access to the right retroperitoneum. At this point, the right kidney was in clear view, and the fascia was entered. Initial attention was directed at careful dissection of the renal pelvis and proximal ureter which was done with a combination of electrocautery and blunt dissection. It became readily apparent that there were two crossing vessels one in the medial inferior region of the kidney and another one in the most inferior portion of the lower pole. These arteries were dissected carefully and vessel loops were applied. Next, a small hole was then made in the renal pelvis using electrocautery and the contents of the renal pelvis were suctioned out. The pyelotomy was extended so that the renal collecting system could be directly inspected. Sequentially, each major calyx was inspected under direct vision and irrigated. A total of four round kidney stones were extracted to be sent for analysis to being satisfied for the patient. At this point, we directed our attention at the proximal right ureter which was dismembered from the remaining renal pelvis. The proximal ureter was spatulated using cold scissors. Next, redundant renal pelvis was excised using cold scissors and sent for permanent section. We then identified the most inferior/dependent portion of the renal pelvis and placed a heel stitch at this for ureteral-renal pelvis anastomosis in a semi running fashion. 3-0 Monocryl sutures were used to re-anastomose the newly spatulated right ureter to the inferior portion of the renal pelvis. Next, remainder of the pyelotomy was closed to itself also using 2-0 Monocryl sutures. Before final stitches were placed, a 6x28 ureteral stent was placed anterograde. This was accomplished by placing the stents over a guidewire, placing the guidewire under direct vision anterograde through the ureter. This was done until the proximal end was in the renal pelvis, the guidewire was removed, and good proximal curl was verified by direct vision. Then, the pyelotomy was completely closed again with 2-0 Monocryl sutures. Next, attention was directed at transposition of the crossing renal artery by fixing it with Vicryl suture that would impinge less upon the renal pelvis. Good pulsation was verified by direct vision proximal and distal to these pexy sutures. Next, Gerota's fascia was reapproximated and closed with Vicryl sutures as was the right peritoneum. Hemostasis appeared excellent at this point. There was no obvious urine extravasation. At this time, the procedure was terminated. The robot was undocked. Under direct visualization all 8 and 12 mm ports were closed at the level of the fascia with 0 Vicryl sutures in an interrupted fashion. Then, all skin port sites were closed with 4-0 Monocryl in a subcuticular fashion and Dermabond and band-aids were applied over this. Also, notably a Jackson-Pratt drain was placed in the area of the right kidney and additional right flank stab incision. The patient tolerated the procedure well and no immediate perioperative complication was noted. DISPOSITION: The patient was discharged to Post Anesthesia Care Unit and subsequently to genitourinary floor to begin his recovery."
559,Urology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Prostate cancer, Gleason score 4+3 with 85% burden and 8/12 cores positive. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Prostate cancer, Gleason score 4+3 with 85% burden and 8/12 cores positive. PROCEDURE DONE: Open radical retropubic prostatectomy with bilateral lymph node dissection. INDICATIONS: This is a 66-year-old gentleman who had an elevated PSA of 5. His previous PSAs were in the 1 range. TRUS biopsy revealed 4+3 Gleason score prostate cancer with a large tumor burden. After extensive counseling, the patient elected for retropubic radical prostatectomy. Given his disease burden, it was advised that an open prostatectomy is probably the standard of care to ensure entire excision. The patient consented and agreed to proceed forward. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the operating room here. Time out was taken to properly identify the patient and procedure going to be done. General anesthesia was induced. The patient was placed in the supine position. The bed was flexed distant to the pubic area. The patient's lower abdominal area, pubic area, and penile and scrotal area were clipped, and then scrubbed with Hibiclens soap for three minutes. The patient was then prepped and draped in normal sterile fashion. Foley catheter was inserted sterilely in the field. Preoperative antibiotics were given within 30 minutes of skin incision. A 10 cm lower abdominal incision was made from the symphysis pubis towards the umbilicus. Dissection was taken down through Scarpa's fascia to the level of the anterior rectus sheath. The rectus sheath was then incised and the muscle was split in the middle. Space of rectus sheath was then entered. The Bookwalter ring was then applied to the belly, and the bladder was then retracted to the right side, thus exposing the left obturator area. The lymph node packet on the left side was then dissected. This was done in a split and roll fashion with the flimsy tissue, and the left external iliac vein was incised, and the tissues were then rolled over the left external iliac vein. Dissection was carried down from the left external iliac vein to the obturator nerve and up to the level of the pelvic sidewall. The proximal extent of dissection was the left hypogastric artery to the level of the node of Cloquet distally. Care was taken to avoid injury to the nerves. An accessory obturator vein was noted and was ligated. The same procedure was done on the right side with dissection of the right obturator lymph node packet, which was sent for pathologic evaluation. The bladder subsequently was retracted cephalad. The prostate was then defatted up to the level of the endopelvic fascia. The endopelvic fascia was then incised bilaterally, and the incision was then taken to the level of the puboprostatic ligaments. Vicryl stitch was then applied at the level of the bladder neck in order to control the bladder back bleeders. A Babcock was then applied around the dorsal venous complex over the urethra and the K-wire was then passed between the dorsal vein complex and the urethra by passing by the aid of a right angle. A 0-Vicryl stitch was then applied over the dorsal venous complex, which was then tied down and cinched to the symphysis pubis. Using a knife on a long handle, the dorsal venous complex was then incised using the K-wire as a guide. Following the incision of the dorsal venous complex, the anterior urethra was then incised, thus exposing the Foley catheter. The 3-0 Monocryl sutures were then applied going outside in on the anterior aspect of the urethra. The lateral edges of the urethra were also then incised, and two lateral stitches were also applied going outside end. The catheter was then drawn back at the level of membranous urethra, and a final posterior stitch was applied going outside end. The urethra was subsequently divided in its entirety. A Foley catheter was then taken out and was inserted directly into the bladder through the prostatic apex. The prostate was then entered cephalad, and the prostatic pedicles were then systematically taken down with the right angle clips and cut. Please note that throughout the case, the patient was noted to have significant oozing and bleeding partially from the dorsal venous complex, pelvic veins, and extensive vascularity that was noted in the patient's pelvic fatty tissue. Throughout the case, the bleeding was controlled with the aid of a clips, Vicryl sutures, silk sutures, and ties, direct pressure packing, and FloSeal. Following the excision of the prostatic pedicles, the posterior dissection at this point was almost complete. Please note that the dissection was relatively technically challenging due to extensive adhesions between the prostate and Denonvilliers' fascia. The seminal vesicle on the left side was dissected in its entirety; however, the seminal vesicle on the right side was adherently stuck to the Denonvilliers' fascia, which prompted the excision of most of the right seminal vesicle with the exception of the tip. Care was taken throughout the posterior dissection to preserve the integrity of the ureters. The anterior bladder neck was then cut anteriorly, and the bladder neck was separated from the prostate. Following the dissection, the 5-French feeding tubes were inserted bilaterally into the ureters thus insuring their integrity. Following the dissection of the bladder from the prostate, the prostate at this point was mobile and was sent for pathological evaluation. The bladder neck was then repaired using Vicryl in a tennis racquet fashion. The rest of the mucosa was then everted. The ureteral orifices and ureters were protected throughout the procedure. At this point, the initial sutures that were applied into the urethra were then applied into the corresponding position on the bladder neck, and the bladder neck was then cinched down and tied down after a new Foley catheter was inserted through the penile meatus and into the bladder pulling the bladder in position. Hemostasis was then adequately obtained. FloSeal was applied to the pelvis. The bladder was then irrigated. It was draining pink urine. The wound was copiously irrigated. The fascia was then closed using a #1 looped PDS. The skin wound was then irrigated, and the skin was closed with a 4-0 Monocryl in subcuticular fashion. At this point, the procedure was terminated with no complications. The patient was then extubated in the operating room and taken in stable condition to the PACU. Please note that during the case about 3600 mL of blood was noted. This was due to the persistent continuous oozing from vascular fatty tissue and pelvic veins as previously noted in the dictation."
560,Urology," REASON FOR VISIT: Elevated PSA with nocturia and occasional daytime frequency. HISTORY: A 68-year-old male with a history of frequency and some outlet obstructive issues along with irritative issues. The patient has had history of an elevated PSA and PSA in 2004 was 5.5. In 2003, he had undergone a biopsy by Dr. X, which was negative for adenocarcinoma of the prostate. The patient has had PSAs as high as noted above. His PSAs have been as low as 1.6, but those were on Proscar. He otherwise appears to be doing reasonably well, off the Proscar, otherwise does have some irritative symptoms. This has been ongoing for greater than five years. No other associated symptoms or modifying factors. Severity is moderate. PSA relatively stable over time. IMPRESSION: Stable PSA over time, although he does have some irritative symptoms. After our discussion, it does appear that if he is not drinking close to going to bed, he notes that his nocturia has significantly decreased. At this juncture what I would like to do is to start with behavior modification. There were no other associated symptoms or modifying factors. PLAN: The patient will discontinue all caffeinated and carbonated beverages and any fluids three hours prior to going to bed. He already knows that this does decrease his nocturia. He will do this without medications to see how well he does and hopefully he may need no other additional medications other than may be changing his alpha-blocker to something of more efficacious."
561,Urology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Prostate cancer. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Prostate cancer. OPERATION PERFORMED: Radical retropubic nerve-sparing prostatectomy without lymph node dissection. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 450 mL. REPLACEMENT: 250 mL of Cell Saver and crystalloid. COMPLICATIONS: None. INDICATIONS OF SURGERY: This is a 67-year-old man with needle biopsy proven to be Gleason 6 adenocarcinoma in one solitary place on the right side of the prostate. Due to him being healthy with no comorbid conditions, he has elected to undergo surgical treatment with radical retropubic prostatectomy. Potential complications include, but are not limited to: 1. Infection. 2. Bleeding. 3. Incontinence. 4. Impotence. 5. Injury to the adjacent viscera. 6. Deep venous thrombosis. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: Prophylactic antibiotic was given in the preoperative holding area, after which the patient was transferred to the operating room. Epidural anesthesia and general endotracheal anesthesia were administered by Dr. A without any difficulty. The patient was shaved, prepped, and draped using the usual sterile technique. A sterile 16-French Foley catheter was then placed with clear urine drained. A midline infraumbilical incision was performed by using a #10 scalpel blade. The rectus fascia and the subcutaneous space were opened by using the Bovie. Transversalis fascia was opened in the midline and the retropubic space and the paravesical space were developed bluntly. A Bookwalter retractor was then placed. The area of the obturator lymph nodes were carefully inspected and no suspicious adenopathy was detected. Given this patient's low Gleason score and low PSA with a solitary core biopsy positive, the decision was made to not perform bilateral lymphadenectomy. The endopelvic fascia was opened bilaterally by using the Metzenbaum scissors. Opening was enlarged by using sharp dissection. Small perforating veins from the prostate into the lateral pelvic wall were controlled by using bipolar coagulation device. The dorsal aspect of the prostate was bunched up by using 2-0 silk sutures. The deep dorsal vein complex was bunched up by using Allis also and ligated by using 0 Vicryl suture in a figure-of-eight fashion. With the prostate retracted cephalad, the deep dorsal vein complex was transected superficially using the Bovie. Deeper near the urethra, the dorsal vein complex was transected by using Metzenbaum scissors. The urethra could then be easily identified. Nearly two-third of the urethra from anteriorly to posteriorly was opened by using Metzenbaum scissors. This exposed the blue Foley catheter. Anastomotic sutures were then placed on to the urethral stump using 2-0 Monocryl suture. Six of these were placed evenly spaced out anteriorly to posteriorly. The Foley catheter was then removed. This allowed for better traction of the prostate laterally. Lateral pelvic fascia was opened bilaterally. This effectively released the neurovascular bundle from the apex to the base of the prostate. Continued dissection from the lateral pelvic fascia deeply opened up the plane into the perirectal fat. The prostate was then dissected from laterally to medially from this opening in the perirectal fat. The floor of the urethra posteriorly and the rectourethralis muscle was then transected just distal to the prostate. Maximal length of ureteral stump was preserved. The prostate was carefully lifted cephalad by using gentle traction with fine forceps. The prostate was easily dissected off the perirectal fat using sharp dissection only. Absolutely, no traction to the neurovascular bundle was evident at any point in time. The dissection was carried out easily until the seminal vesicles could be visualized. The prostate pedicles were controlled easily by using multiple medium clips in 4 to 5 separate small bundles on each side. The bladder neck was then dissected out by using a bladder neck dissection method. Unfortunately, most of the bladder neck fiber could not be preserved due to the patient's anatomy. Once the prostate had been separated from the bladder in the area with the bladder neck, dissection was carried out posteriorly to develop a plane between the bladder and the seminal vesicles. This was developed without any difficulty. Both vas deferens were identified, hemoclipped and transected. The seminal vesicles on both sides were quite large and a decision was made to not completely dissect the tip off, as it extended quite deeply into the pelvis. About two-thirds of the seminal vesicles were able to be removed. The tip was left behind. Using the bipolar Gyrus coagulation device, the seminal vesicles were clamped at the tip sealed by cautery and then transected. This was performed on the left side and then the right side. This completely freed the prostate. The prostate was sent for permanent section. The opening in the bladder neck was reduced by using two separate 2-0 Vicryl sutures. The mucosa of the bladder neck was everted by using 4-0 chromic sutures. Small amount of bleeding around the area of the posterior bladder wall was controlled by using suture ligature. The ureteral orifice could be seen easily from the bladder neck opening and was completely away from the everting sutures. The previously placed anastomotic suture on the urethral stump was then placed on the corresponding position on the bladder neck. This was performed by using a French ***** needle. A 20-French Foley catheter was then inserted and the sutures were sequentially tied down. A 15 mL of sterile water was inflated to balloon. The bladder anastomosis to the urethra was performed without any difficulty. A 19-French Blake Drain was placed in the left pelvis exiting the right inguinal region. All instrument counts, lap counts, and latex were verified twice prior to the closure. The rectus fascia was closed in running fashion using #1 PDS. Subcutaneous space was closed by using 2-0 Vicryl sutures. The skin was reapproximated by using metallic clips. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition."
562,Urology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Prostate cancer. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Prostate cancer. OPERATIONS: Brachytherapy, iodine-125 seed implantation, and cystoscopy. ANESTHESIA: LMA. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal. Total number of seeds placed, 63. Needles, 24. BRIEF HISTORY OF THE PATIENT: This is a 57-year-old male who was seen by us for elevated PSA. The patient had a prostate biopsy with T2b disease, Gleason 6. Options such as watchful waiting, robotic prostatectomy, seed implantation with and without radiation were discussed. Risks of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, MI, DVT, PE, incontinence, rectal dysfunction, voiding issues, burning pain, unexpected complications such as fistula, rectal injury, urgency, frequency, bladder issues, need for chronic Foley for six months, etc., were discussed. The patient understood all the risks, benefits, and options, and wanted to proceed with the procedure. The patient was told that there could be other unexpected complications. The patient has history of urethral stricture. The patient was told about the risk of worsening of the stricture with radiation. Consent was obtained. DETAILS OF THE OPERATION: The patient was brought to the OR. Anesthesia was applied. The patient was placed in the dorsal lithotomy position. The patient had SCDs on. The patient was given preop antibiotics. The patient had done bowel prep the day before. Transrectal ultrasound was performed. The prostate was measured at about 32 gm. The images were transmitted to the computer system for radiation oncologist to determine the dosing etc. Based on the computer analysis, the grid was placed. Careful attention was drawn to keep the grid away from the patient. There was a centimeter distance between the skin and the grid. Under ultrasound guidance, the needles were placed, first in the periphery of the prostate, a total of 63 seeds were placed throughout the prostate. A total of 24 needles was used. Careful attention was drawn to stay away from the urethra. Under longitudinal ultrasound guidance, all the seeds were placed. There were no seeds visualized in the bladder under ultrasound. There was only one needle where the seeds kind of dragged as the needle was coming out on the left side and were dropped out of position. Other than that, all the seeds were very well distributed throughout the prostate under fluoroscopy. Please note that the Foley catheter was in place throughout the procedure. Prior to the seed placement, the Foley was attempted to be placed, but we had to do it using a Glidewire to get the Foley in and we used a Councill-tip catheter. The patient has had history of bulbar urethral stricture. Pictures were taken of the strictures in the pre-seed placement cysto time frame. We needed to do the cystoscopy and Glidewire to be able to get the Foley catheter in. At the end of the procedure, again cystoscopy was done, the entire bladder was visualized. The stricture was wide open. The prostate was slightly enlarged. The bladder appeared normal. There was no sheath inside the urethra or in the bladder. The cysto was done using 30-degree and 70-degree lens. At the end of the procedure, a Glidewire was placed, and 18 Councill-tip catheter was placed. The plan was for Foley to be left in place overnight since the patient has history of urethral strictures. The patient is to follow up tomorrow to have the Foley removed. The patient could also be shown to have it removed at home. The patient was brought to Recovery in stable condition at the end of the procedure. The patient tolerated the procedure well."
563,Urology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left hydrocele. OPERATION: Left hydrocelectomy. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left hydrocele. ANESTHESIA: General INDICATIONS AND STUDIES: This is a 67-year-old male with pain, left scrotum. He has had an elevated PSA and also has erectile dysfunction. He comes in now for a left hydrocelectomy. Physical exam confirmed obvious hydrocele, left scrotum, approximately 8 cm. Laboratory data included a hematocrit of 43.5, hemoglobin of 15.0, and white count 4700. Creatinine 1.3, sodium 141, and potassium 4.0. Calcium 8.6. Chest x-ray was unremarkable. EKG was normal. PROCEDURE: The patient was satisfactorily given general anesthesia, prepped and draped in supine position, and left scrotal incision was made, carried down to the tunica vaginalis forming the hydrocele. This was dissected free from the scrotal wall back to the base of the testicle and then excised back to the spermatic cord. In the fashion, the hydrocele was excised and fluid drained. Cord was infiltrated with 5 mL of 0.25% Marcaine. The edges of the tunica vaginalis adjacent to the spermatic cord were oversewn with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl sutures for hemostasis. The left testicle was replaced into the left scrotal compartment and affixed to the overlying Dartos fascia with a 3-0 Vicryl suture through the edge of the tunica vaginalis and the overlying Dartos fascia. The left scrotal incision was closed, first closing the Dartos fascia with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl sutures. Skin was closed with an interrupted running 4-0 chromic suture. A sterile dressing was applied. The patient was sent to the recovery room in good condition, upon awakening from general anesthesia. Plan is to discharge the patient and see him back in the office in a week or 2 in followup. Further plans will depend upon how he does."

The hernia sac was verified and dissected at the level of the internal ring and a high ligation performed. The distal remnant was taken to its end and excised. The testicle and cord structures were placed back in their native positions. The aponeurosis of the external oblique was reapproximated with 3-0 Vicryl as well as the Scarpa's, the skin closed with 5-0 Monocryl and dressed with Steri-Strips. The patient was extubated in the operating room and taken back to the recovery room. The patient tolerated the procedure well."
565,Urology, CIRCUMCISION After informed consent was obtained the baby was placed on the circumcision tray. He was prepped in a sterile fashion times 3 with Betadine and then draped in a sterile fashion. Then 0.2 mL of 1% lidocaine was injected at 10 and 2 o'clock. A ring block was also done using another 0.3 mL of lidocaine. Glucose water is also used for anesthesia. After several minutes the curved clamp was attached at 9 o'clock with care being taken to avoid the meatus. The blunt probe was then introduced again with care taken to avoid the meatus. After initial adhesions were taken down the straight clamp was introduced to break down further adhesions. Care was taken to avoid the frenulum. The clamps where then repositioned at 12 and 6 o'clock. The Mogen clamp was then applied with a dorsal tilt. After the clamp was applied for 1 minute the foreskin was trimmed. After an additional minute the clamp was removed and the final adhesions were taken down. Patient tolerated the procedure well with minimal bleeding noted. Patient to remain for 20 minutes after procedure to insure no further bleeding is noted. Routine care discussed with the family. Need to clean the area with just water initially and later with soap and water or diaper wipes once healed.

568,Urology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right inguinal hernia. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Direct right inguinal hernia. TITLE OF PROCEDURE: Marlex repair of right inguinal hernia. ANESTHESIA: Spinal. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was taken to the operative suite, placed on the table in the supine position, and given a spinal anesthetic. The right inguinal region was shaved and prepped and draped in a routine sterile fashion. The patient received 1 gm of Ancef IV push. Transverse incision was made in the intraabdominal crease and carried through skin and subcutaneous tissue. The external oblique fascia was exposed and incised down to and through the external inguinal ring. The spermatic cord and hernia sac were dissected bluntly off the undersurface of the external oblique fascia exposing the attenuated floor of the inguinal canal. The cord was surrounded with a Penrose drain. The hernia sac was separated from the cord structures. The floor of the inguinal canal, which consisted of attenuated transversalis fascia, was imbricated upon itself with a running locked suture of 2-0 Prolene. Marlex patch 1 x 4 in dimension was trimmed to an appropriate shape with a defect to accommodate the cord. It was placed around the cord and sutured to itself with 2-0 Prolene. The patch was then sutured medially to the pubic tubercle, inferiorly to Cooper's ligament and inguinal ligaments, and superiorly to conjoined tendon using 2-0 Prolene. The area was irrigated with saline solution, and 0.5% Marcaine with epinephrine was injected to provide prolonged postoperative pain relief. The cord was returned to its position. External oblique fascia was closed with a running 2-0 PDS, subcu with 2-0 Vicryl, and skin with running subdermal 4-0 Vicryl and Steri-Strips. Sponge and needle counts were correct. Sterile dressing was applied."
569,Urology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Ectopic left testis. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Ectopic left testis. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Left orchiopexy. ANESTHESIA: General. The patient did receive Ancef. INDICATIONS AND CONSENT: This is a 16-year-old African-American male who had an ectopic left testis that severed approximately one-and-a-half years ago. The patient did have an MRI, which confirmed ectopic testis located near the pubic tubercle. The risks, benefits, and alternatives of the proposed procedure were discussed with the patient. Informed consent was on the chart at the time of procedure. PROCEDURE DETAILS: The patient did receive Ancef antibiotics prior to the procedure. He was then wheeled to the operative suite where a general anesthetic was administered. He was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion and shaved in the area of the intended procedure. Next, with a #15 blade scalpel, an oblique skin incision was made over the spermatic cord region. The fascia was then dissected down both bluntly and sharply and hemostasis was maintained with Bovie electrocautery. The fascia of the external oblique, creating the external ring was then encountered and that was grasped in two areas with hemostats and sized with Metzenbaum scissors. This was then continued to open the external ring and was then carried cephalad to further open the external ring, exposing the spermatic cord. With this accomplished, the testis was then identified. It was located over the left pubic tubercle region and soft tissue was then meticulously dissected and cared to avoid all vascular and testicular structures. The cord length was then achieved by applying some tension to the testis and further dissecting any of the fascial adhesions along the spermatic cord. Once again, meticulous care was maintained not to involve any neurovascular or contents of the testis or vas deferens. Weitlaner retractor was placed to provide further exposure. There was a small vein encountered posterior to the testis and this was then hemostated into place and cut with Metzenbaum scissors and doubly ligated with #3-0 Vicryl. Again hemostasis was maintained with ligation and Bovie electrocautery with adequate mobilization of the spermatic cord and testis. Next, bluntly a tunnel was created through the subcutaneous tissue into the left empty scrotal compartment. This was taken down to approximately the two-thirds length of the left scrotal compartment. Once this tunnel has been created, a #15 blade scalpel was then used to make transverse incision. A skin incision through the scrotal skin and once again the skin edges were grasped with Allis forceps and the dartos was then entered with the Bovie electrocautery exposing the scrotal compartment. Once this was achieved, the apices of the dartos were then grasped with hemostats and supra-dartos pouch was then created using the Iris scissors. A dartos pouch was created between the skin and the supra-dartos, both cephalad and caudad to the level of the scrotal incision. A hemostat was then placed from inferior to superior through the created tunnel and the testis was pulled through the created supra-dartos pouch ensuring that anatomic position was in place, maintaining the epididymis posterolateral without any rotation of the cord. With this accomplished, #3-0 Prolene was then used to tack both the medial and lateral aspects of the testis to the remaining dartos into the tunica vaginalis. The sutures were then tied creating the orchiopexy. The remaining body of the testicle was then tucked into the supra-dartos pouch and the skin was then approximated with #4-0 undyed Monocryl in a horizontal mattress fashion interrupted sutures. Once again hemostasis was maintained with Bovie electrocautery. Finally the attention was made towards the inguinal incision and this was then copiously irrigated and any remaining bleeders were then fulgurated with Bovie electrocautery to make sure to avoid any neurovascular spermatic structures. External ring was then recreated and grasped on each side with hemostats and approximated with #3-0 Vicryl in a running fashion cephalad to caudad. Once this was created, the created ring was inspected and there was adequate room for the cord. There appeared to be no evidence of compression. Finally, subcutaneous layer with sutures of #4-0 interrupted chromic was placed and then the skin was then closed with #4-0 undyed Vicryl in a running subcuticular fashion. The patient had been injected with bupivacaine prior to closing the skin. Finally, the patient was cleansed. The scrotal support was placed and plan will the for the patient to take Keflex one tablet q.i.d. x7 days as well as Tylenol #3 for severe pain and Motrin for moderate pain as well as applying ice packs to scrotum. He will follow up with Dr. X in 10 to 14 days. Appointment will be made."

PROCEDURE PERFORMED: 1. Cystourethroscopy. 2. Urethral dilation. 3. Bladder biopsy and fulguration. ANESTHESIA: General. SPECIMEN: Urine culture sensitivity and cytology and bladder biopsy x1. DISPOSITION: To PACU in stable condition. INDICATIONS AND FINDINGS: This is a 76-year-old female with history of weak stream and history of intermittent catheterization secondary to hypotonic bladder in the past, last cystoscopy approximately two years ago. FINDINGS AT TIME OF SURGERY: Cystourethroscopy revealed some mild narrowing of the urethra, which was easily dilated to #23 French. A midureteral polyp was noted. Cystoscopy revealed multiple cellules and mild trabeculation of the bladder. Posterior wall revealed some mild erythema with some distorted architecture of the bladder mucosa. No obvious raised bladder tumor was noted. No foreign bodies were noted. The ureteral orifices were noted on the trigone just proximal to the bladder neck. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: After informed consent was obtained, the patient was moved to the operating room, general anesthesia was induced by the Department of Anesthesia. The patient was prepped and draped in normal sterile fashion and urethral sounds used to dilate the urethra to accommodate #23 French cystoscope. Cystoscopy was performed in its entirety with the above findings. The small area of erythema on the posterior wall was biopsied using a flexible biopsy forceps and Bovie cautery was used to cauterize and fulgurate this area. The bladder was drained, cystoscope was removed, scope was reinserted and bladder was again reexamined. No evidence of active bleeding noted. The bladder was drained, cystoscope was removed, and the patient was cleaned and sent to recovery room in stable condition to followup with Dr. X in two weeks. She is given prescription for Levaquin and Pyridium and given discharge instructions."
572,Urology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left distal ureteral stone. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left distal ureteral stone. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Cystopyelogram, left ureteroscopy, laser lithotripsy, stone basket extraction, stent exchange with a string attached. ANESTHESIA: LMA. EBL: Minimal. FLUIDS: Crystalloid. The patient was given antibiotics, 1 g of Ancef and the patient was on oral antibiotics at home. BRIEF HISTORY: The patient is a 61-year-old female with history of recurrent uroseptic stones. The patient had stones x2, 1 was already removed, second one came down, had recurrent episode of sepsis, stent was placed. Options were given such as watchful waiting, laser lithotripsy, shockwave lithotripsy etc. Risks of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, need for stent, and removal of the stent were discussed. The patient understood and wanted to proceed with the procedure. DETAILS OF THE PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the OR. Anesthesia was applied. The patient was placed in dorsal lithotomy position. The patient was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion. A 0.035 glidewire was placed in the left system. Using graspers, left-sided stent was removed. A semirigid ureteroscopy was done. A stone was visualized in the mid to upper ureter. Using laser, the stone was broken into 5 to 6 small pieces. Using basket extraction, all the pieces were removed. Ureteroscopy all the way up to the UPJ was done, which was negative. There were no further stones. Using pyelograms, the rest of the system appeared normal. The entire ureter on the left side was open and patent. There were no further stones. Due to the edema and the surgery, plan was to leave the stent attached to the string and the patient was to pull the string in about 24 hours. Over the 0.035 glidewire, a 26 double-J stent was placed. There was a nice curl in the kidney and one in the bladder. The patient tolerated the procedure well. Please note that the string was kept in place and the patient was to remove the stent the next day. The patient's family was instructed how to do so. The patient had antibiotics and pain medications at home. The patient was brought to recovery room in a stable condition."

574,Urology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Benign prostatic hyperplasia. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Benign prostatic hyperplasia. OPERATION PERFORMED: Transurethral electrosurgical resection of the prostate. ANESTHESIA: General. COMPLICATIONS: None. INDICATIONS FOR THE SURGERY: This is a 77-year-old man with severe benign prostatic hyperplasia. He has had problem with urinary retention and bladder stones in the past. He will need to have transurethral resection of prostate to alleviate the above-mentioned problems. Potential complications include, but are not limited to: 1. Infection. 2. Bleeding. 3. Incontinence. 4. Impotence. 5. Formation of urethral strictures. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was identified, after which he was taken into the operating room. General LMA anesthesia was then administered. The patient was given prophylactic antibiotic in the preoperative holding area. The patient was then positioned, prepped and draped. Cystoscopy was then performed by using a #26-French continuous flow resectoscopic sheath and a visual obturator. The prostatic urethra appeared to be moderately hypertrophied due to the lateral lobes and a large median lobe. The anterior urethra was normal without strictures or lesions. The bladder was severely trabeculated with multiple bladder diverticula. There is a very bladder diverticula located in the right posterior bladder wall just proximal to the trigone. Using the ***** resection apparatus and a right angle resection loop, the prostate was resected initially at the area of the median lobe. Once the median lobe has completely resected, the left lateral lobe and then the right lateral lobes were taken down. Once an adequate channel had been achieved, the prostatic specimen was retrieved from the bladder by using an Ellik evacuator. A 3-mm bar electrode was then introduced into the prostate to achieve perfect hemostasis. The sheath was then removed under direct vision and a #24-French Foley catheter was then inserted atraumatically with pinkish irrigation fluid obtained. The patient tolerated the operation well."
575,Urology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Left spermatocele. 2. Family planning. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Left spermatocele. 2. Family planning. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: 1. Left spermatocelectomy/epididymectomy. 2. Bilateral partial vasectomy. ANESTHESIA: General. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal. SPECIMEN: Left-sided spermatocele, epididymis, and bilateral partial vasectomy. DISPOSITION: To PACU in stable condition. INDICATIONS AND FINDINGS: This is a 48-year-old male with a history of a large left-sided spermatocele with significant discomfort. The patient also has family status complete and desired infertility. The patient was scheduled for elective left spermatocelectomy and bilateral partial vasectomy. FINDINGS: At this time of the surgery, significant left-sided spermatocele was noted encompassing almost the entirety of the left epididymis with only minimal amount of normal appearing epididymis remaining. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: After informed consent was obtained, the patient was moved to the operating room. A general anesthesia was induced by the Department of Anesthesia. The patient was prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion for a scrotal approach. A #15 blade was used to make a transverse incision on the left hemiscrotum. Electrocautery was used to carry the incision down into the tunica vaginalis and the testicle was delivered into the field. The left testicle was examined. A large spermatocele was noted. Metzenbaum scissors were used to dissect the tissue around the left spermatocele. Once the spermatocele was identified, as stated above, significant size was noted encompassing the entire left epididymis. Metzenbaum scissors as well as electrocautery was used to dissect free the spermatocele from its testicular attachments and spermatocelectomy and left epididymectomy was completed with electrocautery. Electrocautery was used to confirm excellent hemostasis. Attention was then turned to the more proximal aspect of the cord. The vas deferens was palpated and dissected free with Metzenbaum scissors. Hemostats were placed on the two aspects of the cord, approximately 1 cm segment of cord was removed with Metzenbaum scissors and electrocautery was used to cauterize the lumen of the both ends of vas deferens and silk ties used to ligate the cut ends. Testicle was placed back in the scrotum in appropriate anatomic position. The dartos tissue was closed with running #3-0 Vicryl and the skin was closed in a horizontal interrupted mattress fashion with #4-0 chromic. Attention was then turned to the right side. The vas was palpated in the scrotum. A small skin incision was made with a #15 blade and the vas was grasped with a small Allis clamp and brought into the surgical field. A scalpel was used to excise the vas sheath and vas was freed from its attachments and grasped again with a hemostat. Two ends were hemostated with hemostats and divided with Metzenbaum scissors. Lumen was coagulated with electrocautery. Silk ties used to ligate both cut ends of the vas deferens and placed back into the scrotum. A #4-0 chromic suture was used in simple fashion to reapproximate the skin incision. Scrotum was cleaned and bacitracin ointment, sterile dressing, fluffs, and supportive briefs applied. The patient was sent to Recovery in stable condition. He was given prescriptions for doxycycline 100 mg b.i.d., for five days and Vicodin ES 1 p.o. q.4h. p.r.n., pain, #30 for pain. The patient is to followup with Dr. X in seven days."

He is a diabetic with obesity. LABORATORY DATA: Includes urinalysis showing white cells too much to count, 3-5 red cells, occasional bacteria. He had a serum creatinine of 1.2, sodium 138, potassium 4.6, glucose 190, calcium 9.1. Hematocrit 40.5, hemoglobin 13.8, white count 7,900. PROCEDURE: The patient was satisfactorily given general anesthesia. Prepped and draped in the dorsal lithotomy position. A 27-French Olympus rectoscope was passed via the urethra into the bladder. The bladder, prostate, and urethra were inspected. He had an obstructing prostate. He had marked catheter reaction in his bladder. He had a lot of villous changes, impossible to tell from frank tumor. He had a huge bladder calculus. It was white and round. I used the holmium laser with the largest fiber through the continuous flow resectoscope and sheath, and broke up the stone, breaking up approximately 40 grams of stone. There was still stone left at the end of the procedure. Most of the chips that could be irrigated out of the bladder were irrigated out using Ellik. Then the scope was removed and a 24-French 3-way Foley catheter was passed via the urethra into the bladder. The plan is to probably discharge the patient in the morning and then we will get a KUB. We will probably bring him back for a second stage cystolithotripsy, and ultimately do a TURP. We broke up the stone for over an hour, and my judgment continuing with litholapaxy transurethrally over an hour begins to markedly increase the risk to the patient."
578,Urology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Urinary retention. 2. Benign prostate hypertrophy. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Urinary retention. 2. Benign prostate hypertrophy. PROCEDURES PERFORMED: 1. Cystourethroscopy. 2. Transurethral resection of prostate (TURP). ANESTHESIA: Spinal. RESECTION TIME: Less than one hour. INDICATION FOR PROCEDURE: This is a 62-year-old male with a history of urinary retention and progressive obstructive voiding symptoms and enlarged prostate 60 g on ultrasound, office cystoscopy confirmed this. PROCEDURE: PROCEDURE: Informed written consent was obtained. The patient was taken to the operative suite, administered spinal anesthetic and placed in dorsal lithotomy position. She was sterilely prepped and draped in normal fashion. A #27-French resectoscope was inserted utilizing the visual obturator blanching the bladder. The bladder was visualized in all quadrants, no bladder tumors or stones were noted. Ureteral orifices were visualized and did appear to be near the enlarged median lobe. Prostate showed trilobar prostatic enlargement. There were some cellules and tuberculations noted. The visual obturator was removed. The resectoscope was then inserted utilizing the #26 French resectoscope loop. Resection was performed initiating at the bladder neck and at the median lobe. This was taken down to the circular capsular fibers. Attention was then turned to the left lateral lobe and this was resected from 12 o'clock to 3 o'clock down to the capsular fibers maintaining hemostasis along the way and taking care not to resect beyond the level of the verumontanum. Ureteral orifices were kept out of harm's way throughout the case. Resection was then performed from the 3 o'clock position to the 6 o'clock position in similar fashion. Attention was then turned to the right lateral lobe and this was resected again in a similar fashion maintaining hemostasis along the way. The resectoscope was then moved to the level of the proximal external sphincter and trimming of the apex was performed. Open prostatic fossa was noted. All chips were evacuated via Ellik evacuator and #24 French three-way Foley catheter was inserted and irrigated. Clear return was noted. The patient was then hooked up to better irrigation. The patient was cleaned, reversed for anesthetic, and transferred to recovery room in stable condition. PLAN: We will admit with antibiotics, pain control, and bladder irrigation possible void trial in the morning."
579,Urology," PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Patient is a 46-year-old white male seen for annual physical exam and had an incidental PSA elevation of 4.0. All other systems were normal. PROCEDURES: Sextant biopsy of the prostate. Radical prostatectomy: Excised prostate including capsule, pelvic lymph nodes, seminal vesicles, and small portion of bladder neck. PATHOLOGY: Prostate biopsy: Right lobe, negative. Left lobe, small focus of adenocarcinoma, Gleason's 3 + 3 in approximately 5% of the tissue. Radical prostatectomy: Negative lymph nodes. Prostate gland showing moderately differentiated infiltrating adenocarcinoma, Gleason 3 + 2 extending to the apex involving both lobes of the prostate, mainly right. Tumor overall involved less than 5% of the tissue. Surgical margin was reported and involved at the apex. The capsule and seminal vesicles were free. DISCHARGE NOTE: Patient has made good post-op recovery other than mild urgency incontinence. His post-op PSA is 0.1 mg/ml."
580,Urology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Desire for sterility. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Desire for sterility. OPERATIVE PROCEDURES: Vasectomy. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the suite, where after oral sedation, the scrotum was prepped and draped. Then, 1% lidocaine was used for anesthesia. The vas was identified, skin was incised, and no scalpel instruments were used to dissect out the vas. A segment about 3 cm in length was dissected out. It was clipped proximally and distally, and then the ends were cauterized after excising the segment. Minimal bleeding was encountered and the scrotal skin was closed with 3-0 chromic. The identical procedure was performed on the contralateral side. He tolerated it well. He was discharged from the surgical center in good condition with Tylenol with Codeine for pain. He will use other forms of birth control until he has confirmed azoospermia with two consecutive semen analyses in the month ahead. Call if there are questions or problems prior to that time."
581,Urology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right inguinal hernia. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right direct inguinal hernia. PROCEDURE: Right direct inguinal hernia repair with PHS mesh system. ANESTHESIA: General with endotracheal intubation. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating table. General anesthesia was administered with endotracheal intubation. The Right groin and abdomen were prepped and draped in the standard sterile surgical fashion. An incision was made approximately 1 fingerbreadth above the pubic tubercle and in a skin crease. Dissection was taken down through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Scarpa's fascia was divided, and the external ring was located. The external oblique was divided from the external ring up towards the anterior superior iliac spine. The cord structures were then encircled. Careful inspection of the cord structures did not reveal any indirect sac along the cord structures. I did, however, feel a direct sac with a direct defect. I opened the floor of the inguinal canal and dissected out the preperitoneal space at the direct sac and cut out the direct sac. Once I cleared out the preperitoneal space, I placed a PHS mesh system with a posterior mesh into the preperitoneal space, and I made sure that it laid flat along Cooper's ligament and covered the myopectineal orifice. I then tucked the extended portion of the anterior mesh underneath the external oblique between the external oblique and the internal oblique, and I then tacked the medial portion of the mesh to the pubic tubercle with a 0 Ethibond suture. I tacked the superior portion of the mesh to the internal oblique and the inferior portion of the mesh to the shelving edge of the inguinal ligament. I cut a hole in the mesh in order to incorporate the cord structures and recreated the internal ring, making sure that it was not too tight so that it did not strangulate the cord structures. I then closed the external oblique with a running 3-0 Vicryl. I closed the Scarpa's with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl, and I closed the skin with a running Monocril. Sponge, instrument and needle counts were correct at the end of the case. The patient tolerated the procedure well and without any complications."
582,Urology," REASON FOR CONSULTATION: Hematuria and urinary retention. BRIEF HISTORY: The patient is an 82-year-old, who was admitted with the history of diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, presented with urinary retention and pneumonia. The patient had hematuria, and unable to void. The patient had a Foley catheter, which was not in the urethra, possibly inflated in the prostatic urethra, which was removed. Foley catheter was repositioned 18 Coude was used. About over a liter of fluids of urine was obtained with light pink urine, which was irrigated. The bladder and the suprapubic area returned to normal after the Foley placement. The patient had some evidence of clots upon irrigation. The patient has had a chest CT, which showed possible atelectasis versus pneumonia. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary artery disease, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, Parkinson's, and CHF. FAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory. SOCIAL HISTORY: Married and lives with wife. HABITS: No smoking or drinking. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Denies any chest pain, denies any seizure disorder, denies any nausea, vomiting. Does have suprapubic tenderness and difficulty voiding. The patient denies any prior history of hematuria, dysuria, burning, or pain. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: The patient is afebrile. Vitals are stable. GENERAL: The patient is a thin gentleman GENITOURINARY: Suprapubic area was distended and bladder was palpated very easily. Prostate was 1+. Testes are normal. LABORATORY DATA: The patient's white counts are 20,000. Creatinine is normal. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 1. Pneumonia. 2. Dehydration. 3. Retention. 4. BPH. 5. Diabetes. 6. Hyperlipidemia. 7. Parkinson's. 8. Congestive heart failure. About 30 minutes were spent during the procedure and the Foley catheter was placed, Foley was irrigated and significant amount of clots were obtained. Plan is for urine culture, antibiotics. Plan is for renal ultrasound to rule out any pathology. The patient will need cystoscopy and evaluation of the prostate. Apparently, the patient's PSA is 0.45, so the patient is at low to no risk of prostate cancer at this time. Continued Foley catheter at this point. We will think about starting the patient on alpha-blockers once the patient's over all medical condition is improved and stable."

584,Urology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Coronal hypospadias with chordee and asthma. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Coronal hypospadias with chordee and asthma. PROCEDURE: Hypospadias repair (TIP) with tissue flap relocation and chordee release (Nesbit tuck). ANESTHETIC: General inhalational anesthetic with a caudal block. FLUIDS RECEIVED: 300 mL of crystalloid. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 20 mL. TUBES/DRAINS: An 8-French Zaontz catheter. INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION: The patient is a 17-month-old boy with hypospadias abnormality. The plan is for repair. DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: The patient was taken to the operating room, where surgical consent, operative site, and patient identification were verified. Once he was anesthetized, a caudal block was placed. IV antibiotics were given. He was then placed in the supine position. The foreskin was retracted and cleansed. He was then sterilely prepped and draped. A stay stitch of 4-0 Prolene was then placed on the glans. The urethra was calibrated with the lacrimal duct probes to an 8-French. We then marked out the coronal cuff, the penile shaft skin as well as the glanular plate for future surgery with a marking pen. We then used a 15-blade knife to circumscribe the penis around the coronal cuff. We then degloved the penis using the curved tenotomy scissors, and electrocautery was used for hemostasis. The patient had some splaying of the spongiosum tissue, which was also incised laterally and rotated to make a secondary flap. Once the penis was degloved, and the excessive chordee tissue was released, we then placed a vessel loop tourniquet around the base of the penis and using IV grade saline injected the penis for an artifical erection. He was still noted to have chordee, so a midline incision through the Buck fascia was made with a 15-blade knife and Heineke-Mikulicz closure using 5-0 Prolene was then used for the chordee Nesbit tuck. We repeated the artificial erection and the penis was straight. We then incised the urethral plate with an ophthalmic blade in the midline, and then elevated the glanular wings using a 15-blade knife to elevate and then incise them. Using the curved iris scissors, we then also further mobilized the glanular wings. The 8-French Zaontz was then placed while the tourniquet was still in place into the urethral plate. The upper aspect of the distal meatus was then closed with an interrupted suture of 7-0 Vicryl, and then using a running subcuticular closure, we closed the urethral plates over the Zaontz catheter. We then mobilized subcutaneous tissue from the penile shaft skin, and the inner perpetual skin on the dorsum, and then buttonholed the flap, placed it over the head of the penis, and then, used it to cover of the hypospadias repair with tacking sutures of 7-0 Vicryl. We then rolled the spongiosum flap to cover the distal urethra that was also somewhat dysplastic; 7-0 Vicryl was used for that as well. 5-0 Vicryl was used to roll the glans with 2 deep sutures, and then, horizontal mattress sutures of 7-0 Vicryl were used to reconstitute the glans. Interrupted sutures of 7-0 Vicryl were used to approximate the urethral meatus to the glans. Once this was done, we then excised the excessive penile shaft skin, and used the interrupted sutures of 6-0 chromic to attach the penile shaft skin to the coronal cuff. On the ventrum itself, we used horizontal mattress sutures to close the defect. At the end of the procedure, the Zaontz catheter was sutured into place with a 4-0 Prolene suture, Dermabond tissue adhesive, and Surgicel was used as a dressing and a second layer of Telfa and clear eye tape was then used to tape it into place. IV Toradol was given at the procedure. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was in a stable condition upon transfer to the recovery room."
585,Urology," REASON FOR VISIT: Follow up consultation, second opinion, foreskin. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: A 2-week-old who at this point has otherwise been doing well. He has a relatively unremarkable foreskin. At this point in time, he otherwise seems to be doing reasonably well. The question is about the foreskin. He otherwise has no other significant issues. Severity low, ongoing since birth two weeks. Thank you for allowing me to see this patient in consultation. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Male exam. Normal and under the penis, report normal uncircumcised 2-week-old. He has a slightly insertion on the penile shaft from the median raphe of the scrotum. IMPRESSION: Slightly high insertion of the median raphe. I see no reason he cannot be circumcised as long as they are careful and do a very complete Gomco circumcision. This kid should otherwise do reasonably well. PLAN: Follow up as needed. But my other recommendation is that this kid as I went over with the mother may actually do somewhat better if he simply has a formal circumcision at one year of age, but may do well with a person who is very accomplished doing a Gomco circumcision."
586,Urology," CHIEF COMPLAINT: Left flank pain and unable to urinate. HISTORY: The patient is a 46-year-old female who presented to the emergency room with left flank pain and difficulty urinating. Details are in the history and physical. She does have a vague history of a bruised left kidney in a motor vehicle accident. She feels much better today. I was consulted by Dr. X. MEDICATIONS: Ritalin 50 a day. ALLERGIES: To penicillin. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: ADHD. SOCIAL HISTORY: No smoking, alcohol, or drug abuse. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She is awake, alert, and quite comfortable. Abdomen is benign. She points to her left flank, where she was feeling the pain. DIAGNOSTIC DATA: Her CAT scan showed a focal ileus in left upper quadrant, but no thickening, no obstruction, no free air, normal appendix, and no kidney stones. LABORATORY WORK: Showed white count 6200, hematocrit 44.7. Liver function tests and amylase were normal. Urinalysis 3+ bacteria. IMPRESSION: 1. Left flank pain, question etiology. 2. No evidence of surgical pathology. 3. Rule out urinary tract infection. PLAN: 1. No further intervention from my point of view. 2. Agree with discharge and followup as an outpatient. Further intervention will depend on how she does clinically. She fully understood and agreed."
587,Urology," HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 62-year old male with a Gleason score 8 adenocarcinoma of the prostate involving the left and right lobes. He has a PSA of 3.1, with a prostate gland size of 41 grams. This was initially found on rectal examination with a nodule on the right side of the prostate, showing enlargement relative to the left. He has undergone evaluation with a bone scan that showed a right parietal lesion uptake and was seen by Dr. XXX and ultimately underwent an open biopsy that was not malignant. Prior to this, he has also had a ProstaScint scan that was negative for any metastatic disease. Again, he is being admitted to undergo a radical prostatectomy, the risks, benefits, and alternatives of which have been discussed, including that of bleeding, and a blood transfusion. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Coronary stenting. History of high blood pressure, as well. He has erectile dysfunction and has been treated with Viagra. MEDICATIONS: Lisinopril, Aspirin, Zocor, and Prilosec. ALLERGIES: Penicillin. SOCIAL HISTORY: He is not a smoker. He does drink six beers a day. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Remarkable for his high blood pressure and drug allergies, but otherwise unremarkable, except for some obstructive urinary symptoms, with an AUA score of 19. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: HEENT: Examination unremarkable. Breasts: Examination deferred. Chest: Clear to auscultation. Cardiac: Regular rate and rhythm. Abdomen: Soft and nontender. He has no hernias. Genitourinary: There is a normal-appearing phallus, prominence of the right side of prostate. Extremities: Examination unremarkable. Neurologic: Examination nonfocal. IMPRESSION: 1. Adenocarcinoma of the prostate. 2. Erectile dysfunction. PLAN: The patient will undergo a bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy and radical retropubic prostatectomy. The risks, benefits, and alternatives of this have been discussed. He understands and asks that I proceed ahead. We also discussed bleeding and blood transfusions, and the risks, benefits and alternatives thereof."
588,Urology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left inguinal hernia. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left inguinal hernia, direct. PROCEDURE: Left inguinal herniorrhaphy, modified Bassini. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was electively taken to the operating room. In same day surgery, Dr. X applied a magnet to the pacemaker defibrillator that the patient has to change it into a fixed mode and to protect the device from the action of the cautery. Informed consent was obtained, and the patient was transferred to the operating room where a time-out process was followed and the patient under general endotracheal anesthesia was prepped and draped in the usual fashion. Local anesthesia was used as a field block and then an incision was made in the left inguinal area and carried down to the external oblique aponeurosis, which was opened. The cord was isolated and protected. It was dissected out. The lipoma of the cord was removed and the sac was high ligated. The main hernia was a direct hernia due to weakness of the floor. A Bassini repair was performed. We used a number of interrupted sutures of 2-0 Tevdek __________ in the conjoint tendon and the ilioinguinal ligament. The external oblique muscle was approximated same as the soft tissue with Vicryl and then the skin was closed with subcuticular suture of Monocryl. The dressing was applied and the patient tolerated the procedure well, estimated blood loss was minimal, was transferred to recovery room in satisfactory condition."
589,Urology," BILATERAL SCROTAL ORCHECTOMY PROCEDURE:: The patient is placed in the supine position, prepped and draped in the usual manner. Under satisfactory general anesthesia, the scrotum was approached and through a transverse mid scrotal incision, the right testicle was delivered through the incision. Hemostasis was obtained with the Bovie and the spermatic cord was identified. It was clamped, suture ligated with 0 chromic catgut and the cord above was infiltrated with 0.25% Marcaine for postoperative pain relief. The left testicle was delivered through the same incision. The spermatic cord was identified, clamped, suture ligated and that cord was also injected with 0.25% percent Marcaine. The incision was injected with the same material and then closed in two layers using 4-0 chromic catgut continuous for the dartos and interrupted for the skin. A dry sterile dressing fluff and scrotal support applied over that. The patient was sent to the Recovery Room in stable condition."
590,Urology," PROCEDURE: Newborn circumcision. INDICATIONS: Parental preference. ANESTHESIA: Dorsal penile nerve block. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The baby was prepared and draped in a sterile manner. Lidocaine 1% 4 mL without epinephrine was instilled into the base of the penis at 2 o'clock and 10 o'clock. The penile foreskin was removed using a XXX Gomco. Hemostasis was achieved with minimal blood loss. There was no sign of infection. The baby tolerated the procedure well. Vaseline was applied to the penis, and the baby was diapered by nursing staff."
591,Urology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left testicular torsion. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Left testicular torsion. 2. Left testicular abscess. 3. Necrotic testes. SURGERY: Left orchiectomy, scrotal exploration, right orchidopexy. DRAINS: Penrose drain on the left hemiscrotum. The patient was given vancomycin, Zosyn, and Levaquin preop. BRIEF HISTORY: The patient is a 49-year-old male who came into the emergency room with 2-week history of left testicular pain, scrotal swelling, elevated white count of 39,000. The patient had significant scrotal swelling and pain. Ultrasound revealed necrotic testicle. Options such as watchful waiting and removal of the testicle were discussed. Due to elevated white count, the patient was told that he must have the testicle removed due to the infection and possible early signs of urosepsis. The risks of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, MI, DVT, PE, scrotal issues, other complications were discussed. The patient was told about the morbidity and mortality of the procedure and wanted to proceed. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was brought to the OR. Anesthesia was applied. The patient was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion. A midline scrotal incision was made. There was very, very thick scrotal skin. There was no necrotic skin. As soon as the left hemiscrotum was entered, significant amount of pus poured out of the left hemiscrotum. The testicle was completely filled with pus and had completely disintegrated with pus. The pus just poured out of the left testicle. The left testicle was completely removed. Debridement was done of the scrotal wall to remove any necrotic tissue. Over 2 L of antibiotic irrigation solution was used to irrigate the left hemiscrotum. There was good tissue left after all the irrigation and debridement. A Penrose drain was placed in the bottom of the left hemiscrotum. I worried about the patient may have torsed and then the testicle became necrotic, so the plan was to pex the right testicle, plus the right side also appeared very abnormal. So, the right hemiscrotum was opened. The testicle had significant amount of swelling and scrotal wall was very thick. The testicle appeared normal. There was no pus coming out of the right hemiscrotum. At this time, a decision was made to place 4-0 Prolene nonabsorbable stitches in 3 different quadrants to prevent it from torsion. The hemiscrotum was closed using 2-0 Vicryl in interrupted stitches and the skin was closed using 2-0 PDS in horizontal mattress. There was very minimal pus left behind and the skin was very healthy. Decision was made to close it to help the patient heal better in the long run. The patient was brought to the recovery in stable condition."
592,Urology," REASON FOR ADMISSION: Penile injury and continuous bleeding from a penile laceration. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is an 18-year-old detainee who was brought by police officers because of a penile injury and bleeding. He is otherwise healthy. He tried to insert a marble in his penis four days ago. He told me that he grabbed the skin on the top of the penis and moved it away from the penis shaft and then using a toothbrush that he made in to a knife object he pierced the skin through from both sides and then kept moving the toothbrush to dilate and make a way for the marble. Then he inserted a heart-shaped marble in one of the puncture wounds and inserted it under the skin and kept it there. He was not significantly bleeding and essentially the bleeding stopped from both puncture wounds that he has. Then today four days after that procedure, he was taking a bath today and he thinks because of the weight he felt a gush in his pants and he looked and he saw the bleeding come out. He was bleeding so much that he started dripping to the sides of his legs. So, he was brought to the hospital. Actually after being seen by two nurses at the facility where he was at the detention center where he was at and they actually did the dressing twice and it was twice soaked with blood. He came here and was continuously bleeding from that area that we had to change the dressing twice and he is actually still bleeding especially from one of the laceration, the one on the right side of the penis. The marble also still can be felt underneath the skin. There is no urethral bleeding. He did urinate today without difficulty, without hematuria or dysuria. There is pain in the lacerations. No erythema in the skin or swelling in the penis and no other injuries. He did this procedure for sexual pleasure as he said. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Unremarkable. PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Tonsillectomy. MEDICATION: He took only ibuprofen. No regular medication. ALLERGIES: None. SOCIAL HISTORY: He has been in detention for two months for immigration problems. No drugs. No alcohol. No smoking. He used to work in fast food chain. FAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory to this illness. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Aside from the pain in the penis and continuous bleeding, he is basically asymptomatic and review of systems is unremarkable. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: GENERAL: The patient is a young Hispanic male, lying in bed, appear comfortable in no apparent distress. VITAL SIGNS: Temperature 97.8, heart rate 99, respiratory rate 20, blood pressure 142/100, and saturation is 98% on room air. ENT: Sclerae nonicteric. Pupils reactive to light. Nostrils are normal. Oral cavity is clear. NECK: Supple. Trachea midline. No JVD. LUNGS: Clear to auscultation bilaterally. HEART: Normal S1 and S2. No murmurs or gallops. ABDOMEN: Soft, nontender, and nondistended. Positive bowel sounds. EXTREMITIES: Pulses strong bilaterally. No edema. GENITAL: Testicles appear normal. The penis shaft has two lacerations on both sides, one of them is bleeding. They measure about 5 to 6 mm on the right side, about 3 or 4 mm on the left side. The one on the right side is bleeding much more than the other one. There is a marble that can be felt and it is freely mobile underneath the skin of the dorsum of the penis. There is no bleeding from the meatus or discharge and no other injuries were seen by inspection. LABORATORY DATA: White count 11.1, hemoglobin 14.5, hematocrit 43.5, and platelets 303,000. Coags unremarkable. Glucose 106, creatinine 0.8, sodium 141, potassium 4, and calcium 9.7. Urinalysis unremarkable. IMPRESSION: The patient with a penile laceration that is continuously bleeding from inserting a marble four days ago, which is still underneath the skin of the shaft of the penis. No other injuries that can be seen and no other evidence of secondary bacterial infection at this time. The patient is currently refusing removal of the marble and insisting on just repairing the laceration and he is having discussion with Dr. X. PLAN: 1. The patient will be admitted to the hospital and will follow Dr. X's recommendation. 2. The patient was offered a repair of those lacerations, to stop the bleeding as well as the removal of the marble and he is currently considering that and discussing that with Dr. X. 3. Prophylactic antibiotics to prevent infection. 4. He has mild hypertension, which is likely due to stress and pain and also the leukocytosis probably can be explained by that. This will be monitored. 5. Monitor H&H to determine if he needs any transfusion at this time. He does not need that. 6. IV fluid for hydration and volume resuscitation at this time. 7. Pain management. 8. Topical care for the wound VAC after repair. Time spent in evaluation and management of this patient including discussions about this procedure and the harm that can happen if he chooses to keep the penis including permanent damage and infection to the penis was 65 minutes. I had clearly explained to the patient in detail about the possibility of permanent penile damage that could affect erection and future sexual functioning as well as significant infection if a foreign object was retained in the penis under the skin and he verbalized understanding of this."
593,Urology," CHIEF COMPLAINT: Testicular pain. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 4-year-old boy with a history of abrupt onset of left testicular pain at 11:30 this morning. He was unable to walk and would not stand upright, and had fairly significant discomfort, so the parents checked his panel because of it. Because of this, they took him to Emergency Department, at which time, he had no swelling noted initially, but very painful. He had no voiding or stooling problems. No nausea, vomiting or fever. Family denies trauma or dysuria. At that time, he was going to get an ultrasound done, but the mother said that all of sudden the patient stated the pain had resolved. He has had hot chocolate this morning at 10:30 in the morning and water around 2:30 in the morning. He has not had any pain since but states that he has had pain in the past, not as long and states there was a twisting sensation. He has no recent cold or flu, although he had rhinorrhea about 3 weeks ago. He is on no medications and he is here for evaluation. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: The patient has no known allergies. He is term delivery via spontaneous vaginal delivery. He has had no problems or hospitalizations with circumcision. PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: He has had no previous surgeries. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: All 14-point review of systems were negative except for the above left testicular pain and the history of possible upper respiratory infection about 2 to 3 weeks ago. IMMUNIZATIONS: Up-to-date. FAMILY HISTORY: The patient lives at home with both parents who are Spanish speaking. He is not in school. MEDICATIONS: He is on no medications. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: On physical exam, weight is 15.9 kg. GENERAL: The patient is a cooperative little boy. HEENT: Normal head and neck exam. No oral or nasal discharge. NECK: Without masses. CHEST: Without masses. LUNGS: Clear. CARDIAC: Without murmurs or gallops. ABDOMEN: Soft. No masses or tenderness. His scrotum did not have any swelling at the present time. There was only minimal discomfort with palpation at the left inguinal area, but no masses were noted. No palpable nodules such as appendix testis and no swelling was noted and he had mild epididymal swelling only. His left testis was slightly harder than the right, but this was not very significant. EXTREMITIES: He had full range of motion in all 4 extremities. SKIN: Warm, pink, and dry. NEUROLOGIC: Grossly intact. LABORATORY DATA: Ultrasound was obtained today showing no blood flow or poor blood flow on the left except for increased blood flow to the epididymis on the study done at about 1330 hours, and second one done around 1630 hours was normal flow, possible increased flow on the left. This is personally reviewed by me. The right was normal. No masses were appreciated. There was some mild change in echotexture on the left on the initial study, which had apparently resolved on the second, but may be due to the technical aspects of the study. ASSESSMENT/PLAN: The patient has a possibly torsion detorsion versus other acute testicular problem. If the patient has indeed testicular torsion, there is an increased possibility that it may reoccur again, actually within the first 24 to 36 hours and as such is recommended doing a left scrotal exploration with possible detorsion of left testis, possible orchiectomy if the testis is markedly abnormal or nonviable, which probably is not the case, and bilateral testes fixation if the torsion is found. I discussed the pre and postsurgical care with the parents. Procedure itself with potential complications, risks, benefits, and alternatives of surgery including that the torsion could occur again, although it is less likely after the surgical fixation procedure. The parents understand and wished to proceed. We will schedule this later today emergently."
594,Urology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Bilateral inguinal hernia, bilateral hydroceles. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Bilateral inguinal hernia, bilateral hydroceles. PROCEDURES: Bilateral inguinal hernia and bilateral hydrocele repair with an ilioinguinal nerve block bilaterally by surgeon 20 mL given. ANESTHESIA: General inhalational anesthetic. ABNORMAL FINDINGS: Same as above. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Less than 5 mL. FLUIDS RECEIVED: 400 mL of Crystalloid. DRAINS: No tubes or drains were used. COUNT: Sponge and needle counts were correct x2. INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: The patient is a 7-year-old boy with the history of fairly sizeable right inguinal hernia and hydrocele, was found to have a second smaller one on evaluation with ultrasound and physical exam. Plan is for repair of both. DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: The patient was taken to the operating room, where surgical consent, operative site and the patient's identification was verified. Once he was anesthetized, he was then placed in a supine position and sterilely prepped and draped. A right inguinal incision was then made with 15 blade knife and further extended with electrocautery down to the subcutaneous tissue and electrocautery was also used for hemostasis. The external oblique fascia was then visualized and incised with 15 blade knife and further extended with curved tenotomy scissors. Using a curved mosquito clamp, we gently dissected into the inguinal canal until we got the hernia sac and dissected it out of the canal. The cord structures were then dissected off the sac and then the sac itself was divided in the midline, twisted upon itself and suture ligated up at the peritoneal reflection with 3-0 Vicryl suture. This was done twice. The distal end where a large hydrocele noted, was gently milked into the lower aspect of the incision. The hydrocele sac was then opened and drained and then the testis was delivered into the field. The sac was then opened completely around the testis. The appendix testis was cauterized. We wrapped the sac around the back of the testis and tacked into place using the Lord maneuver using 4-0 Vicryl as a figure-of-eight suture. Once this was done, the testis was then placed back into the scrotum in the proper orientation. Ilioinguinal nerve block and wound instillation was then done with 10 mL of 0.25% Marcaine. A similar procedure was done on the left side, also finding a small hernia, which was divided and ligated with the 3-0 Vicryl as on the right side and distally the hydrocele sac was also wrapped around the back of the testis in a Lord maneuver after opening the sac completely. Again both testes were placed into the scrotum after the hydroceles were treated and then the external oblique fascia was closed on both sides with a running suture of 3-0 Vicryl ensuring that the ilioinguinal nerve and the cord structures not involved in the closure. Scarpa fascia was closed with 4-0 chromic suture on each side and the skin was closed with 4-0 Rapide subcuticular closure. Dermabond tissue adhesive was placed on both incisions. IV Toradol was given at the end of the procedure and both testes were well descended within the scrotum at the end of the procedure. The patient tolerated the procedure and was in stable condition upon transfer to the recovery room."
595,Urology," INDICATION: Prostate Cancer. TECHNIQUE: 3.5 hours following the intravenous administration of 26.5 mCi of Technetium 99m MDP, the skeleton was imaged in the anterior and posterior projections. FINDINGS: There is a focus of abnormal increased tracer activity overlying the right parietal region of the skull. The uptake in the remainder of the skeleton is within normal limits. The kidneys image normally. There is increased activity in the urinary bladder suggesting possible urinary retention. CONCLUSION: 1. Focus of abnormal increased tracer activity overlying the right parietal region of the skull. CT scanning of magnetic resonance imaging of the skull and brain could be done for further assessment if it is clinically indicated. 2. There is probably some degree of urinary retention."
596,Urology," OPERATIVE NOTE: The patient was taken to the operating room and placed in the supine position on the operating room table. The patient was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion. An incision was made in the groin crease overlying the internal ring. This incision was about 1.5 cm in length. The incision was carried down through the Scarpa's layer to the level of the external oblique. This was opened along the direction of its fibers and carried down along the external spermatic fascia. The cremasteric fascia was then incised and the internal spermatic fascia was grasped and pulled free. A hernia sac was identified and the testicle was located. Next the internal spermatic fascia was incised and the hernia sac was dissected free inside the internal ring. This was performed by incising the transversalis fascia circumferentially. The hernia sac was ligated with a 3-0 silk suture high and divided and was noted to retract into the abdominal cavity. Care was taken not to injure the testicular vessels. Next the abnormal attachments of the testicle were dissected free distally with care not to injure any long loop vas and these were divided beneath the testicle for a fair distance. The lateral attachments tethering the cord vessels were freed from the sidewalls in the retroperitoneum high. This gave excellent length and very adequate length to bring the testicle down into the anterior superior hemiscrotum. The testicle was viable. This was wrapped in a moist sponge. Next a hemostat was passed down through the inguinal canal down into the scrotum. A small 1 cm incision was made in the anterior superior scrotal wall. Dissection was carried down through the dartos layer. A subdartos pouch was formed with blunt dissection. The hemostat was then pushed against the tissues and this tissue was divided. The hemostat was then passed through the incision. A Crile hemostat was passed back up into the inguinal canal. The distal attachments of the sac were grasped and pulled down without twisting these structures through the incision. The neck was then closed with a 4-0 Vicryl suture that was not too tight, but tight enough to prevent retraction of the testicle. The testicle was then tucked down in its proper orientation into the subdartos pouch and the subcuticular tissue was closed with a running 4-0 chromic and the skin was closed with a running 6-0 subcuticular chromic suture. Benzoin and a Steri-Strip were placed. Next the transversus abdominis arch was reapproximated to the iliopubic tract over the top of the cord vessels to tighten up the ring slightly. This was done with 2 to 3 interrupted 3-0 silk sutures. The external oblique was then closed with interrupted 3-0 silk suture. The Scarpa's layer was closed with a running 4-0 chromic and the skin was then closed with a running 4-0 Vicryl intracuticular stitch. Benzoin and Steri-Strip were applied. The testicle was in good position in the dependent portion of the hemiscrotum and the patient had a caudal block, was awakened, and was returned to the recovery room in stable condition."
597,Urology," HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 77-year-old male, who presents with gross hematuria that started this morning. The patient is a difficult historian, does have a speech impediment, slow to answer questions, but daughter was able to answer lot of questions too. He is complaining of no other pain. He denies any abdominal pain. Denies any bleeding anywhere else. Denies any bruising. He had an episode similar to this a year ago where it began the same with hematuria. He was discharged after a workup in the hospital, in the emergency room, with Levaquin. Three days later, he returned with a very large hematoma to his left neck and a coagulopathy with significant bleeding. His H and H was down in the 6 level. He received blood transfusions. He was diagnosed with a malignancy, coagulopathy, and sounds like was in critical condition. Family actually states that they were told that he was unlikely to live through that event, but he did. Since then, he has had no bleeding. The patient has had no fever. No cough. No chest pain or shortness of breath. No bleeding gums. No blurred vision. No headache. No recent falls or trauma. He has had no nausea or vomiting. No diarrhea. No blood in the stool or melena. No leg or calf pain. No joint pain. No rashes. No swollen glands. He has no numbness, weakness or tingling to his extremities. No acute anxiety or depression. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Has prostate cancer. MEDICATION: He is receiving Lupron injection by Dr. Y. The only other medication that he takes is Tramadol. SOCIAL HISTORY: He does not smoke or drink. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital Signs: Are all reviewed on triage. General: He is alert. Answers slowly with a speech impediment, but answers appropriately. HEENT: Pupils equal, round, and reactive to light. Normal extraocular muscles. Nonicteric sclerae. Conjunctivae are not pale. His oropharynx is clear. His mucous membranes are moist. Heart: Regular rate and rhythm, with no murmurs. Lungs: Clear. Abdomen: Soft, nontender, nondistended. Normal bowel sounds. No organomegaly or mass. Extremities: No calf tenderness, erythema or warmth. He has no bruises noted. Neurological: Cranial nerves II through XII are intact. He has 5/5 strength throughout. GU: Normal. LABORATORY DATA: The patient did on urinalysis have few red blood cells. His urine was also grossly red, although no blood clots or gross blood was noted. It was more of a red fluid. He had a mild decrease in H and H at 12.1 and 34.6. His white count was normal at 7.2. His PT was elevated at 15.9. PTT elevated at 36.4. INR is 1.4. His comprehensive metabolic profile is normal except for BUN of 19. CONDITION: The patient is stable at this time, although because of the history of the same happening and the patient beginning in the same fashion his history of coagulopathy, the patient is discussed with Dr. X and he is admitted for orders. Also we will consult Dr. Y, see orders for further."
598,Urology," DIAGNOSIS: Desires vasectomy. NAME OF OPERATION: Vasectomy. ANESTHESIA: General. HISTORY: Patient, 37, desires a vasectomy. PROCEDURE: Through a midline scrotal incision, the right vas was identified and separated from the surrounding tissues, clamped, transected, and tied off with a 4-0 chromic. No bleeding was identified. Through the same incision the left side was identified, transected, tied off, and dropped back into the wound. Again no bleeding was noted. The wound was closed with 4-0 Vicryl times two. He tolerated the procedure well. A sterile dressing was applied. He was awakened and transferred to the recovery room in stable condition."
599,Urology," EXAM: Ultrasound examination of the scrotum. REASON FOR EXAM: Scrotal pain. FINDINGS: Duplex and color flow imaging as well as real time gray-scale imaging of the scrotum and testicles was performed. The left testicle measures 5.1 x 2.8 x 3.0 cm. There is no evidence of intratesticular masses. There is normal Doppler blood flow. The left epididymis has an unremarkable appearance. There is a trace hydrocele. The right testicle measures 5.3 x 2.4 x 3.2 cm. The epididymis has normal appearance. There is a trace hydrocele. No intratesticular masses or torsion is identified. There is no significant scrotal wall thickening. IMPRESSION: Trace bilateral hydroceles, which are nonspecific, otherwise unremarkable examination."
600,Urology," PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Bassini inguinal herniorrhaphy. ANESTHESIA: Local with MAC anesthesia. PROCEDURE: After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the operative suite and placed supine on the operating table. The patient was sedated and an adequate local anesthetic was administered using 1% lidocaine without epinephrine. The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner. A standard inguinal incision was made, and dissection was carried down to the external oblique aponeurosis using a combination of Metzenbaum scissors and Bovie electrocautery. The external oblique aponeurosis was cleared of overlying adherent tissue, and the external ring was delineated. The external oblique was then incised with a scalpel and this incision was carried out to the external ring using Metzenbaum scissors. Care was taken not to injure the ilioinguinal nerve. Having exposed the inguinal canal, the cord structures were separated from the canal using blunt dissection, and a Penrose drain was then used to retract the cord structures as needed. Adherent cremasteric muscle was dissected free from the cord using Bovie electrocautery. The cord was then explored using a combination of sharp and blunt dissection, and the sac was found anteromedially to the cord structures. The sac was dissected free from the cord structures using a combination of blunt dissection and Bovie electrocautery. Once preperitoneal fat was encountered, the dissection stopped and the sac was suture ligated at the level of the preperitoneal fat using a 2-0 silk suture ligature. The sac was excised and sent to Pathology. The stump was examined and no bleeding was noted. The ends of the suture were then cut, and the stump retracted back into the abdomen. The floor of the inguinal canal was then strengthened by suturing the shelving edge of Poupart's ligament to the conjoined tendon using a 2-0 Prolene, starting at the pubic tubercle and running towards the internal ring. In this manner, an internal ring was created that admitted just the tip of my smallest finger. The Penrose drain was removed. The wound was then irrigated using sterile saline, and hemostasis was obtained using Bovie electrocautery. The incision in the external oblique was approximated using a 2-0 Vicryl in a running fashion, thus reforming the external ring. Marcaine 0.5% was injected 1 fingerbreadth anterior to the anterior and superior iliac spine and around the wound for postanesthetic pain control. The skin incision was approximated with skin staples. A dressing was then applied. All surgical counts were reported as correct. Having tolerated the procedure well, the patient was subsequently taken to the recovery room in good and stable condition."
601,Urology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left communicating hydrocele. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Left communicating hydrocele. ANESTHESIA: General. PROCEDURE: Left inguinal hernia and hydrocele repair. INDICATIONS: The patient is a 5-year-old young man with fluid collection in the tunica vaginalis and peritesticular space on the left side consistent with a communicating hydrocele. The fluid size tends to fluctuate with time but has been relatively persistent for the past year. I met with the patient's mom and also spoke with his father by phone in the past couple of months and explained the diagnosis of patent processus vaginalis for communicating hydrocele and talked to them about the surgical treatment and options. All their questions have been answered and the patient is fit for operation today. OPERATIVE FINDINGS: The patient had a very thin patent processus vaginalis leading to a rather sizeable hydrocele sac in the left hemiscrotum. We probably drained around 10 to 15 mL of fluid from the hydrocele sac. The processus vaginalis was clearly seen back to the peritoneal reflection where a high ligation was successfully performed. There were no other abnormalities noted in the inguinal scrotal region. DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: The patient came to the operating room and had an uneventful induction of inhalation anesthetic. A peripheral IV was placed, and we conducted a surgical time-out to reiterate all of The patient's important identifying information and to confirm that we were indeed going to perform a left inguinal hernia and hydrocele repair. After preparation and draping was done with chlorhexidine based prep solution, a local infiltration block as well as an ilioinguinal and iliohypogastric nerve block was performed with 0.25% Marcaine with dilute epinephrine. A curvilinear incision was made low in the left inguinal area along one of prominent skin folds. Soft tissue dissection was carried down through Scarpa's layer to the external oblique fascia, which was then opened to expose the underlying spermatic cord structures. The processus vaginalis was dissected free from the spermatic cord structures, and the distal hydrocele sac was widely opened and drained of its fluid contents. The processus vaginalis was cleared back to peritoneal reflection at the deep inguinal ring and a high ligation was performed there using both the transfixing and a mass ligature of 3-0 Vicryl. After the excess hydrocele and processus vaginalis tissue was excised, the spermatic cord structures were replaced and the external oblique and Scarpa's layers were closed with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl sutures. Subcuticular 5-0 Monocryl and Steri-Strips were used for the final skin closure. The patient tolerated the operation well. He was awakened and taken to the recovery room in good condition. Blood loss was minimal. No specimen was submitted."
602,Urology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Carcinoma of the prostate, clinical stage T1C. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Carcinoma of the prostate, clinical stage T1C. TITLE OF OPERATION: Cystoscopy, cryosurgical ablation of the prostate. FINDINGS: After measurement of the prostate, we decided to place 5 rows of needles--row #1 had 3 needles, row #2 at the level of the mid-prostate had 4 needles, row #3 had 2 needles in the right lateral peripheral zone, row #4 was a single needle directly the urethra, and in row #5 were 2 needles placed in the left lateral peripheral zone. Because of the length of the prostate, a pull-back was performed, pulling row #2 approximately 3 mm and rows #3, #4 and #5 approximately 1 cm back before refreezing. OPERATION IN DETAIL: The patient was brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position. After adequate general endotracheal anesthesia was obtained, the patient was positioned in the dorsal lithotomy position. Full bowel prep had been obtained prior to the procedure. After performing flexible cystoscopy, a Foley catheter was placed per urethra into the bladder. Next, the ultrasound probe was placed into the stabilizer and advanced into the rectum. An excellent ultrasound image was visualized of the entire prostate, which was re-measured. Next, the probe template was positioned over the perineum and the template guide brought up on the ultrasound screen in order to guide needle placement. Then 17-gauge needles were serially placed into the prostate, from an anterior to posterior direction into the prostate. Ultrasound guidance demonstrated that these needles, numbering approximately 14 to 15 needles, were well placed and spaced throughout the prostate to obtain excellent freezing of the entire gland while sparing the urethra. Repeat cystoscopy demonstrated a single needle passing through the urethra; and due to the high anterior location of this needle, it was removed. The CMS urethral warmer was then passed per urethra into the bladder, and flow instituted. After placing these 17-gauge needles, the prostate was then frozen down to minus 150 degrees for 10 minutes in sequential fashion from anterior to posterior. The ice ball was monitored and was seen to extend through the capsule of the prostate toward the rectum but not through the rectal wall itself. Active warming was then performed before refreezing the prostate again and then passively warming it back to room temperature. The urethral warmer was left on after the needles were removed and the patient brought to the recovery room. The patient tolerated the procedure well and left the operating room in stable condition."
603,Urology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Penile skin bridges after circumcision. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Penile skin bridges after circumcision. PROCEDURE: Excision of penile skin bridges about 2 cm in size. ABNORMAL FINDINGS: Same as above. ANESTHESIA: General inhalation anesthetic with caudal block. FLUIDS RECEIVED: 300 mL of crystalloids. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Less than 5 mL. SPECIMENS: No tissue sent to Pathology. TUBES AND DRAINS: No tubes or drains were used. COUNT: Sponge and needle counts were correct x2. INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION: The patient is a 2-1/2-year-old boy with a history of newborn circumcision who developed multiple skin bridges after circumcision causing curvature with erection. Plan is for repair. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient is taken to the operating room, where surgical consent, operative site, and the patient's identification was verified. Once he was anesthetized, the caudal block was placed and IV antibiotics were given. He was then placed in a supine position and sterilely prepped and draped. Once he was prepped and draped, we used a straight mosquito clamp and went under the bridges and crushed them, and then excised them with a curved iris and curved tenotomy scissors. We removed the excessive skin on the shaft skin and on the glans itself. We then on the ventrum excised the bridge and did a Heinecke-Mikulicz closure with interrupted figure-of-eight and interrupted suture of 5-0 chromic. Electrocautery was used for hemostasis. Once this was done, we then used Dermabond tissue adhesive and Surgicel to prevent the bridges from returning again. IV Toradol was given at the end of procedure. The patient tolerated the procedure well, was in stable condition upon transfer to the recovery room."
604,Urology," PROCEDURE: Circumcision. ANESTHESIA: EMLA. FINDINGS: Normal penis. The foreskin was normal in appearance and measured 1.6 cm. There was no bleeding at the circumcision site. PROCEDURE: Patient was placed on the circumcision restraint board. EMLA had been applied approximately 90 minutes before. A time-out was completed satisfactorily per protocol. The area was prepped with Betadine. The foreskin was grasped with sterile clamps and was dissected away from the corona and the glans penis with blunt dissection. A Mogen clamp was applied to the cervix. The excess foreskin was excised with the scalpel. The clamp was removed. At this point, the procedure was terminated. Sterile Vaseline and gauze was applied to the glans penis. There were no complications. There was minimal blood loss."
605,Urology," REASON FOR VISIT: Followup circumcision. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient had his circumcision performed on 09/16/2007 here at Children's Hospital. The patient had a pretty significant phimosis and his operative course was smooth. He did have a little bit of bleeding when he woke in recovery room, which required placement of some additional sutures, but after that, his recovery has been complete. His mom did note that she had to him a couple of days of oral analgesics, but he seems to be back to normal and pain free now. He is having no difficulty urinating, and his bowel function remains normal. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Today, The patient looks healthy and happy. We examined his circumcision site. His Monocryl sutures are still in place. The healing is excellent, and there is only a mild amount of residual postoperative swelling. There was one area where he had some recurrent adhesions at the coronal sulcus, and I gently lysed this today and applied antibiotic ointment showing this to mom had to especially lubricate this area until the healing is completed. IMPRESSION: Satisfactory course after circumcision for severe phimosis with no perioperative complications. PLAN: The patient came in followup for his routine care with Dr. X, but should not need any further routine surgical followup unless he develops any type of difficulty with this surgical wound. If that does occur, we will be happy to see him back at any time."
606,Urology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Nonpalpable right undescended testis. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Nonpalpable right undescended testis with atrophic right testis. PROCEDURES: Examination under anesthesia, diagnostic laparoscopy, right orchiectomy, and left testis fixation. ANESTHESIA: General inhalation anesthetic with caudal block. FLUID RECEIVED: 250 mL of crystalloids. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Less than 5 mL. SPECIMEN: The tissue sent to Pathology was right testicular remnant. ABNORMAL FINDINGS: Closed ring on right with atrophic vessels going into the ring and there was obstruction at the shoulder of the ring. Left had open appearing ring but the scrotum was not filled and vas and vessels going into the ring. INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION: The patient is a 2-year-old boy with a right nonpalpable undescended testis. The plan is for evaluation and repair. DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: The patient was taken to the operating room, where surgical consent, operative site, and patient identification were verified. Once he was anesthetized, a caudal block was placed. The patient was placed in supine position and examined. The left testis well within scrotum. The right was again not palpable despite the patient being asleep with multiple attempts to check. The patient was then sterilely prepped and draped. An 8-French feeding tube was then placed within his bladder through the urethra and attached to the drainage. We then incised the infraumbilical area once he was sterilely prepped and draped, with 15 blade knife, then using Hasson technique with stay stitches in the anterior and posterior rectus fascia sheath of 3-0 Monocryl. We entered the peritoneum with the 5-mm one-step system. We then used the short 0-degree lens for laparoscopy. We then insufflated with carbon dioxide insufflation to pressure of 12 mmHg. There was no bleeding noted upon evaluation of the abdomen and again the findings were as mentioned with closed ring with vas and vessels going to the left and vessels and absent vas on the right where the closed ring was found. Because there was no testis found in the abdomen, we then evacuated the gas and closed the fascial sheath with the 3-0 Monocryl tacking sutures. Then skin was closed with subcutaneous closure of 4-0 Rapide. A curvilinear upper scrotal incision was made on the right with 15 blade knife and carried down through the subcutaneous tissue with electrocautery. Electrocautery was used for hemostasis. A curved tenotomy scissor was used to open the sac. The tunica vaginalis was visualized and grasped and then dissected up towards external ring. There was no apparent testicular tissue. We did remove it, however, tying off the cord structure with a 4-0 Vicryl suture and putting a tagging suture at the base of the tissue sent. We then closed the subdartos area with the subcutaneous closure of 4-0 chromic. We then did a similar curvilinear incision on the left side for testicular fixation. Delivered the testis into the field, which had a type III epididymal attachment and was indeed about 3 to 4 mL in size, which was larger than expected for the patient's age. We then closed the upper aspect of the subdartos pouch with the 4-0 chromic pursestring suture and placed testis back into the scrotum in the proper orientation and closed the dartos, skin, and subcutaneous closure with 4-0 chromic on left hemiscrotum. At the end of the procedure, the patient received IV Toradol and had Dermabond tissue adhesive placed on both incisions and left testis was well descended in the scrotum at the end of the procedure. The patient tolerated procedure well, and was in stable condition upon transfer to the recovery room."

All questions answered."
610,Urology," DESCRIPTION: The patient was placed in the supine position and was prepped and draped in the usual manner. The left vas was grasped in between the fingers. The skin and vas were anesthetized with local anesthesia. The vas was grasped with an Allis clamp. Skin was incised and the vas deferens was regrasped with another Allis clamp. The sheath was incised with a scalpel and elevated using the iris scissors and clamps were used to ligate the vas deferens. The portion in between the clamps was excised and the ends of the vas were clamped using hemoclips, two in the testicular side and one on the proximal side. The incision was then inspected for hemostasis and closed with 3-0 chromic catgut interrupted fashion. A similar procedure was carried out on the right side. Dry sterile dressings were applied and the patient put on a scrotal supporter. The procedure was then terminated."
611,Urology," A survey film of the abdomen shows no soft tissue abnormalities and no pathologic calcifications overlying the renal contours or bladder. Following intravenous infusion of appropriate contrast material, there is prompt symmetrical concentration as noted by nephrograms. No filling defects of the collecting systems are noted on the linear tomograms. There is normal and symmetrical filling of the caliceal system. Subsequent films demonstrate that the kidneys are of normal size and contour bilaterally. The caliceal system and ureters are in their usual position and show no signs of obstruction or intraluminal defects. The postvoid films demonstrate normal emptying of the collecting system, including the urinary bladder. IMPRESSION: Negative intravenous urogram."
612,Urology," CHIEF COMPLAINT: Bladder cancer. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 68-year-old Caucasian male with a history of gross hematuria. The patient presented to the emergency room near his hometown on 12/24/2007 for evaluation of this gross hematuria. CT scan was performed, which demonstrated no hydronephrosis or upper tract process; however, there was significant thickening of the left and posterior bladder wall. Urology referral was initiated and the patient was sent to be evaluated by Dr. X. He eventually underwent a bladder biopsy on 01/18/08, which demonstrated high-grade transitional cell carcinoma without any muscularis propria in the specimen. Additionally, the patient underwent workup for a right adrenal lesion, which was noted on the initial CT scan. This workup involved serum cortisol analysis as well as potassium and aldosterone and ACTH level measurement. All of this workup was found to be grossly negative. Secondary to the absence of muscle in the specimen, the patient was taken back to the operating room on 02/27/08 by Dr. X and the tumor was noted to be very large with significant tumor burden as well as possible involvement of the bladder neck. At that time, the referring urologist determined the tumor to be too large and risky for local resection, and the patient was referred to ABCD Urology for management and diagnosis. The patient presents today for evaluation by Dr. Y. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Includes condyloma, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, undiagnosed COPD, peripheral vascular disease, and claudication. The patient denies coronary artery disease. PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Includes bladder biopsy on 01/18/08 without muscularis propria in the high-grade TCC specimen and a gun shot wound in 1984 followed by exploratory laparotomy x2. The patient denies any bowel resection or GU injury at that time; however, he is unsure. CURRENT MEDICATIONS: 1. Metoprolol 100 mg b.i.d. 2. Diltiazem 120 mg daily. 3. Hydrocodone 10/500 mg p.r.n. 4.

The patient states he has one uncle who died of lung cancer. He denies any other family history. SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient smokes approximately 2 packs per day times greater than 40 years. He does drink occasional alcohol approximately 5 to 6 alcoholic drinks per month. He denies any drug use. He is a retired liquor store owner. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: GENERAL: He is a well-developed, well-nourished Caucasian male, who appears slightly older than stated age. VITAL SIGNS: Temperature is 96.7, blood pressure is 108/57, pulse is 75, and weight of 193.8 pounds. HEAD AND NECK: Normocephalic atraumatic. LUNGS: Demonstrate decreased breath sounds globally with small rhonchi in the inferior right lung, which is clear somewhat with cough. HEART: Regular rate and rhythm. ABDOMEN: Soft and nontender. The liver and spleen are not palpably enlarged. There is a large midline defect covered by skin, of which the fascia has numerous holes poking through. These small hernias are of approximately 2 cm in diameter at the largest and are nontender. GU: The penis is circumcised and there are no lesions, plaques, masses or deformities. There is some tenderness to palpation near the meatus where 20-French Foley catheter is in place. Testes are bilaterally descended and there are no masses or tenderness. There is bilateral mild atrophy. Epididymidis are grossly within normal limits bilaterally. Spermatic cords are grossly within normal limits. There are no palpable inguinal hernias. RECTAL: The prostate is mildly enlarged with a small focal firm area in the midline near the apex. There is however no other focal nodules. The prostate is grossly approximately 35 to 40 g and is globally firm. Rectal sphincter tone is grossly within normal limits and there is stool in the rectal vault. EXTREMITIES: Demonstrate no cyanosis, clubbing or edema. There is dark red urine in the Foley bag collection. LABORATORY EXAM: Review of laboratory from outside facility demonstrates creatinine of 2.38 with BUN of 42. Additionally, laboratory exam demonstrates a grossly normal serum cortisol, ACTH, potassium, aldosterone level during lesion workup. CT scan was reviewed from outside facility, report states there is left kidney atrophy without hydro or stones and there is thickened left bladder wall and posterior margins with a balloon inflated in the prostate at the time of the exam. There is a 3.1 cm right heterogeneous adrenal nodule and there are no upper tract lesions or stones noted. IMPRESSION: Bladder cancer. PLAN: The patient will undergo a completion TURBT on 03/20/08 with bilateral retrograde pyelograms at the time of surgery. Preoperative workup and laboratory as well as paper work were performed in clinic today with Dr. Y. The patient will be scheduled for anesthesia preop. The patient will have urine culture redrawn from his Foley or penis at the time of preoperative evaluation with anesthesia. The patient was counseled extensively approximately 45 minutes on the nature of his disease and basic prognostic indicators and need for additional workup and staging. The patient understands these instructions and also agrees to quit smoking prior to his next visit. This patient was seen in evaluation with Dr. Y who agrees with the impression and plan."
613,Urology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right ureteral calculus. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right ureteropelvic junction calculus. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: 1. Cystourethroscopy. 2. Right retrograde pyelogram. 3. Right double-J stent placement 22 x 4.5 mm. FIRST SECOND ANESTHESIA: General. SPECIMEN: Urine for culture and sensitivity. DRAINS: 22 x 4.5 mm right double-J ureteral stent. PROCEDURE: After consent was obtained, the patient was brought to operating room and placed in the supine position. She was given general anesthesia and then placed in the dorsal lithotomy position. A #21 French cystoscope was then passed through the urethra into the bladder. There was noted to be some tightness of the urethra on passage. On visualization of the bladder, there were no stones or any other debris within the bladder. There were no abnormalities seen. No masses, diverticuli, or other abnormal findings. Attention was then turned to the right ureteral orifice and attempts to pass to a cone tip catheter, however, the ureteral orifice was noted to be also tight and we were unable to pass the cone tip catheter. The cone tip catheter was removed and a glidewire was then passed without difficulty up into the renal pelvis. An open-end ureteral catheter was then passed ________ into the distal right ureter. Retrograde pyelogram was then performed. There was noted to be an UPJ calculus with no noted hydronephrosis. The wire was then passed back through the ureteral catheter. The catheter was removed and a 22 x 4.5 mm double-J ureteral stent was then passed over the glidewire under fluoroscopic and cystoscopic guidance. The stent was clear within the kidney as well as within the bladder. The bladder was drained and the cystoscope was removed. The patient tolerated the procedure well. She will be discharged home. She is to follow up with Dr. X for ESWL procedure. She will be given prescription for Darvocet and will be asked to have a KUB x-ray done prior to her followup and to bring them with her to her appointment."

IMPRESSION: 1. Adenocarcinoma of the prostate. 2. Atrial fibrillation. PLAN: The patient's wife and I have discussed his treatment options, which include primarily radiation and surgery. He has _________ surviving prostate cancer by Dr. Y. He is aware of incontinency, both total and partial. We discussed erectile dysfunction. We have discussed bleeding, infection, injury to the rectum, injury to vessels and nerves, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolus, MI, stroke, and death. He had no questions at the conclusion of the conversation and he does know that in his age group, though a nerve-sparing procedure will be performed, preserving any erectile function is highly unlikely. He had no questions at the conclusion of our last conversation."
615,Urology," CIRCUMCISION - OLDER PERSON OPERATIVE NOTE: The patient was taken to the operating room and placed in the supine position on the operating table. General endotracheal anesthesia was administered. The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. A 4-0 silk suture is used as a stay-stitch of the glans penis. Next, incision line was marked circumferentially on the outer skin 3 mm below the corona. The incision was then carried through the skin and subcutaneous tissues down to within a layer of * fascia. Next, the foreskin was retracted. Another circumferential incision was made 3 mm proximal to the corona. The intervening foreskin was excised. Meticulous hemostasis was obtained with electrocautery. Next, the skin was reapproximated at the frenulum with a U stitch of 5-0 chromic followed by stitches at 12, 3, and 9 o'clock. The stitches were placed equal distance among these to reapproximate all the skin edges. Next, good cosmetic result was noted with no bleeding at the end of the procedure. Vaseline gauze, Telfa, and Elastoplast dressing was applied. The stay-stitch was removed and pressure held until bleeding stopped. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was returned to the recovery room in stable condition."
616,Urology," PROCEDURES: Cystourethroscopy and transurethral resection of prostate. COMPLICATIONS: None. ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS: Difficulty voiding. HISTORY: This 67-year old Hispanic male patient was admitted because of enlarged prostate and symptoms of bladder neck obstruction. Physical examination revealed normal heart and lungs. Abdomen was negative for abnormal findings. LABORATORY DATA: BUN 19 and creatinine 1.1. Blood group was A, Rh positive, Hemoglobin 13, Hematocrit 32.1, Prothrombin time 12.6 seconds, PTT 37.1. Discharge hemoglobin 11.4, and hematocrit 33.3. Chest x-ray calcified old granulomatous disease, otherwise normal. EKG was normal. COURSE IN THE HOSPITAL: The patient had a cysto and TUR of the prostate. Postoperative course was uncomplicated. The pathology report is pending at the time of dictation. He is being discharged in satisfactory condition with a good urinary stream, minimal hematuria, and on Bactrim DS one a day for ten days with a standard postprostatic surgery instruction sheet. DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: Enlarged prostate with benign bladder neck obstruction. To be followed in my office in one week and by Dr. ABC next available as an outpatient."
617,Urology," EPIDIDYMECTOMY OPERATIVE NOTE: The patient was placed in the supine position and prepped and draped in the usual manner. A transverse scrotal incision was made and carried down to the tunica vaginalis, which was opened. A small amount of clear fluid was expressed. The tunica vaginalis was opened and the testicle was brought out through this incision. The epididymis was separated off the surface of the testicle using a scalpel. With blunt and sharp dissection, the epididymis was dissected off the testicle. Bovie was used for hemostasis. The vessels going to the testicle were preserved without any obvious injury, and a nice viable testicle was present after the epididymis was removed from this. The blood supply to the epididymis was cauterized using a Bovie and the vas was divided with cautery also. There was no obvious bleeding. The cord was infiltrated with 0.25% Marcaine, as was the dartos tissue in the scrotum. The testicle was replaced in the scrotum. Skin was closed in two layers using 3-0 chromic catgut for the dartos and a subcuticular closure with the same material. A dry sterile dressing and compression were applied, and he was sent to the recovery room in stable condition."
618,Urology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Inguinal hernia. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Direct inguinal hernia. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Rutkow direct inguinal herniorrhaphy. ANESTHESIA: General endotracheal. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the operative suite and placed supine on the operating table. General endotracheal anesthesia was induced without incident. Preoperative antibiotics were given for prophylaxis against surgical infection. The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. A standard inguinal incision was made, and dissection was carried down to the external oblique aponeurosis using a combination of Metzenbaum scissors and Bovie electrocautery. The external oblique aponeurosis was cleared of overlying adherent tissue, and the external ring was delineated. The external oblique was then incised with a scalpel and this incision was carried out to the external ring using Metzenbaum scissors. Having exposed the inguinal canal, the cord structures were separated from the canal using blunt dissection, and a Penrose drain was placed around the cord structures at the level of the pubic tubercle. This Penrose drain was then used to retract the cord structures as needed. Adherent cremasteric muscle was dissected free from the cord using Bovie electrocautery. The cord was then explored using a combination of sharp and blunt dissection, and no sac was found. The hernia was found coming from the floor of the inguinal canal medial to the inferior epigastric vessels. This was dissected back to the hernia opening. The hernia was inverted back into the abdominal cavity and a large PerFix plug inserted into the ring. The plug was secured to the ring by interrupted 2-0 Prolene sutures. The PerFix onlay patch was then placed on the floor of the inguinal canal and secured in place using interrupted 2-0 Prolene sutures. By reinforcing the floor with the onlay patch, a new internal ring was thus formed. The Penrose drain was removed. The wound was then irrigated using sterile saline, and hemostasis was obtained using Bovie electrocautery. The incision in the external oblique was approximated using a 2-0 Vicryl in a running fashion, thus reforming the external ring. The skin incision was approximated with 4-0 Monocryl in a subcuticular fashion. The skin was prepped with benzoin, and Steri-Strips were applied. All surgical counts were reported as correct. Having tolerated the procedure well, the patient was subsequently taken to the recovery room in good and stable condition."
619,Urology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Bladder laceration. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Bladder laceration. NAME OF OPERATION: Closure of bladder laceration. FINDINGS: The patient was undergoing a cesarean section for twins. During the course of the procedure, a bladder laceration was notices and urology was consulted. Findings were a laceration on the dome of the bladder. PROCEDURE: Initially there as a mucosal layer of suture already placed. This was done with 3-0 chromic catgut. The bladder was distended and, while the bladder was distended with physiologic saline, a second layer of 3-0 chromic catgut created a watertight closure. The second layer included the mucosa an dinner layer of the detrusor muscle. A third layer of 2-0 Dexon was used. Each of these were placed in a continuous running-locked suture technique. There was complete watertight closure of the bladder. Hemostasis was assured and a Jackson-Pratt drain was brought out through a separate stab wound. The remaining portion of the operation, both the cesarean section and the wound closure, will be dictated by Dr. Redmond."
620,Urology," CHIEF COMPLAINT: Penile cellulitis status post circumcision. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 16-month-old boy, who had a circumcision performed approximately 4 days before he developed penile swelling and fever and discharge. The child initially had a newborn circumcision at about 1 week of life and then developed a concealed or buried penis with extra skin and tightness of the skin. He underwent a second circumcision with a general anesthetic approximately 8 to 9 days ago. The mother states that on Thursday, he developed fairly significant swelling, scrotum was also swollen, the suprapubic region was swollen, and he was having a purulent discharge and a fairly significant fever to 102 to 103. He was seen at Hospital, transferred to Children's Hospital for further care. Since being hospitalized, his cultures apparently have grown Staph but is unknown yet whether it is methicillin-resistant. He has been placed on clindamycin, and he is now currently afebrile and with marked improvement according to the mother. I was requested a consultation by Dr. X because of the appearance of penis. The patient has been voiding without difficulty throughout. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: The patient has no known allergies. He was a term delivery via vaginal delivery. Surgeries; he has had 2 circumcisions. No other hospitalizations. He has had no heart murmurs, seizures, asthma, or bronchitis. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: A 14-point review of systems was negative with the exception of the penile and scrotal cellulitis and the surgeries as mentioned. He also had an ear infection about 1 to 2 weeks before his circumcision. SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives with both parents and no siblings. There are smokers at home. MEDICATIONS: Clindamycin and bacitracin ointment. Also Bactrim. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Weight is 14.9 kg. GENERAL: The patient was sleepy but easily arousable. HEAD AND NECK: Grossly normal. His neck and chest are without masses. NARES: He had some crusted nares; otherwise, no other discharge. LUNGS: Clear. CARDIAC: Without murmurs or gallops. ABDOMEN: Soft without masses or tenderness. GU: He has a fairly prominent suprapubic fat pad, and he is quite a large child in any event; however, there were no signs of erythema. There was some induration around the penis; however, there were no signs of active infection. He has a buried appearance of the penis after recent circumcision with a normal appearing glans. The tissue itself, however, was quite dull and is soft or readily retractable at this time. The scrotum was normal, and there was no erythema, there was no tenderness. Both testes were descended without hydroceles. EXTREMITIES: He has full range of motion of all 4 extremities. SKIN: Warm, pink, and dry. NEUROLOGIC: Grossly intact. BACK: Normal. IMPRESSION/PLAN: The patient had a recent circumcision with a fairly prominent suprapubic fat pad but also has a penile and suprapubic cellulitis. This is being treated, but it is most likely Staph and pending sensitivities. I talked to the mother and told her that at this point the swelling that is present is a mixture of the resolving cellulitis from a suprapubic fat pad. I recommended that he be treated most likely with Bactrim for a 10-day course at home, bacitracin, or some antibiotics ointment to the penis with each diaper change for the next 2 to 3 weeks with sitz bath once or twice a day. I told the mother that initially the tissues are going to be quite dull because of the infection and the recent surgery, but she ultimately will have to gently retract the skin to keep it from adhering again because of the prominent suprapubic fat pad, which makes it more likely. Otherwise, it is a fairly healthy-appearing tissue at the present time and she knows the reasons that he cannot be discharged once the hospitalist service believes that it is appropriate to do so. He has a scheduled followup appointment with his urologist and he should keep that appointment or followup sooner if there is any other problem arising."
621,Urology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right inguinal hernia. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right inguinal hernia. ANESTHESIA: General. PROCEDURE: Right inguinal hernia repair. INDICATIONS: The patient is a 4-year-old boy with a right inguinal bulge, which comes and goes with Valsalva standing and some increased physical activity. He had an inguinal hernia on physical exam in the Pediatric Surgery Clinic and is here now for elective repair. We met with his parents and explained the surgical technique, risks, and talked to them about trying to perform a diagnostic laparoscopic look at the contralateral side to rule out an occult hernia. All their questions have been answered and they agreed with the plan. OPERATIVE FINDINGS: The patient had a well developed, but rather thin walled hernia sac on the right. The thinness of hernia sac made it difficult to safely cannulate through the sac for the laparoscopy. Therefore, high ligation was performed, and we aborted the plan for laparoscopic view of the left side. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient came to operating room and had an uneventful induction of general anesthesia. Surgical time-out was conducted while we were preparing and draping his abdomen with chlorhexidine based prep solution. During our time-out, we reiterated the patient's name, medical record number, weight, allergies status, and planned operative procedure. I then infiltrated 0.25% Marcaine with dilute epinephrine in the soft tissues around the inguinal crease in the right lower abdomen chosen for hernia incision. An additional aliquot of Marcaine was injected deep to the external oblique fascia performing the ilioinguinal and iliohypogastric nerve block. A curvilinear incision was made with a scalpel and a combination of electrocautery and some blunt dissection and scissor dissection was used to clear the tissue layers through Scarpa fascia and expose the external oblique. After the oblique layers were opened, the cord structure were identified and elevated. The hernia sac was carefully separated from the spermatic cord structures and control of the sac was obtained. Dissection of the hernia sac back to the peritoneal reflection at the level of deep inguinal ring was performed. I attempted to gently pass a 3-mm trocar through the hernia sac, but it was rather difficult and I became fearful that the sac would be torn in proximal control and mass ligation would be less effective. I aborted the laparoscopic approach and performed a high ligation using transfixing and a simple mass ligature of 3-0 Vicryl. The excess sac was trimmed and the spermatic cord structures were replaced. The external oblique fascia and Scarpa layers were closed with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl and skin was closed with subcuticular 5-0 Monocryl and Steri-Strips. The patient tolerated the operation well. Blood loss was less than 5 mL. The hernia sac was submitted for specimen, and he was then taken to the recovery room in good condition."
622,Urology," PREOPERATIVE DX: Stress urinary incontinence. POSTOPERATIVE DX: Stress urinary incontinence. OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: SPARC suburethral sling. ANESTHESIA: General. FINDINGS & INDICATIONS: Outpatient evaluation was consistent with urethral hypermobility, stress urinary incontinence. Intraoperatively, the bladder appeared normal with the exception of some minor trabeculations. The ureteral orifices were normal bilaterally. DESCRIPTION OF OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: This patient was brought to the operating room, a general anesthetic was administered. She was placed in dorsal lithotomy position. Her vulva, vagina, and perineum were prepped with Betadine scrubbed in solution. She was draped in usual sterile fashion. A Sims retractor was placed into the vagina and Foley catheter was inserted into the bladder. Two Allis clamps were placed over the mid urethra. This area was injected with 0.50% lidocaine containing 1:200,000 epinephrine solution. Two areas suprapubically on either side of midline were injected with the same anesthetic solution. The stab wound incisions were made in these locations and a sagittal incision was made over the mid urethra. Metzenbaum scissors were used to dissect bilaterally to the level of the ischial pubic ramus. The SPARC needles were then placed through the suprapubic incisions and then directed through the vaginal incision bilaterally. The Foley catheter was removed. A cystoscopy was performed using a 70-degree cystoscope. There was noted to be no violation of the bladder. The SPARC mesh was then snapped onto the needles, which were withdrawn through the stab wound incisions. The mesh was snugged up against a Mayo scissor held under the mid urethra. The overlying plastic sheaths were removed. The mesh was cut below the surface of the skin. The skin was closed with 4-0 Plain suture. The vaginal vault was closed with a running 2-0 Vicryl stitch. The blood loss was minimal. The patient was awoken and she was brought to recovery in stable condition."
623,Urology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Nonfunctioning inflatable penile prosthesis. 2. Peyronie's disease. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Nonfunctioning inflatable penile prosthesis. 2. Peyronie's disease. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Ex-plantation of inflatable penile prosthesis and then placement of second inflatable penile prosthesis AMS700. ANESTHESIA: General LMA. SPECIMEN: Old triple component inflatable penile prosthesis. PROCEDURE: This is a 64-year-old male with prior history of Peyronie's disease and prior placement of a triple component inflatable penile prosthesis, which had worked for years for him, but has stopped working and subsequently has opted for ex-plantation and replacement of inflatable penile prosthesis. OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: After informed consent, the patient was brought to the operative suite and placed in the supine position. General endotracheal intubation was performed by the Anesthesia Department and the perineum, scrotum, penis, and lower abdomen from the umbilicus down was prepped and draped in the sterile fashion in a 15-minute prep including iodine solution in the urethra. The bladder was subsequently drained with a red Robinson catheter. At that point, the patient was then draped in a sterile fashion and an infraumbilical midline incision was made and taken down through the subcutaneous space. Care was maintained to avoid all bleeding as possible secondary to the fact that we could not use Bovie cautery secondary to the patient's pacemaker and monopolar was only source of hemostasis besides suture. At that point, we got down to the fascia and the dorsal venous complex was easily identified as were both corporal bodies. Attention was taken then to the tubing, going up to the reservoir in the right lower quadrant. This was dissected out bluntly and sharply with Metzenbaum scissors and monopolar used for hemostasis. At this point, as we tracked this proximally to the area of the rectus muscle, we found that the tubing was violated and this was likely the source of his malfunctioned inflatable penile prosthesis. As we tried to remove the tubing and get to the reservoir, the tubing in fact completely broke as due to wire inside the tubing and the reservoir was left in its place secondary to risk of going after it and bleeding without the use of cautery. At that point, this tubing was then tracked down to the pump, which was fairly easily removed from the dartos pouch in the right scrotum. This was brought up into _________ incision and the two tubings going towards the two cylinders were subsequently tracked, first starting on the right side where a corporotomy incision was made at the placement of two #3-0 Prolene stay ties, staying lateral and anterior on the corporal body. The corporal body was opened up and the cylinder was removed from the right side without difficulty. However, we did have significant difficulty separating the tube connecting the pump to the right cylinder since this was surrounded by dense connective tissue and without the use of Bovie cautery, this was very difficult and was very time consuming, but we were able to do this and attention was then taken to the left side where the left proximal corporotomy was made after placement of two stick tie stay sutures. This was done anterior and lateral staying away from the neurovascular bundle in the midline and this was done proximally on the corporal body. The left cylinder was then subsequently explanted and this was very difficult as well trying to tract the tubing from the left cylinder across the midline back to the right pump since this was also densely scarred in and _________ a small amount of bleeding, which was controlled with monopolar and cautery was used on three different occasions, but just simple small burst under the guidance of anesthesia and there was no ectopy noted. After removal of half of the pump, all the tubing, and both cylinders, these were passed off the table as specimen. Both corporal bodies were then dilated with the Pratt dilators. These were already fairly well dilated secondary to explantation of our cylinders and antibiotic irrigation was copiously used at this point and irrigated out both of our corporal spaces. At this point, using the Farlow device, corporal bodies were measured first proximally then distally and they both measured out to be 9 cm proximally and 12 cm distally. He had an 18 cm with rear tips in place, which were removed. We decided to go ahead to and use another 18 cm inflatable penile prosthesis. Confident with our size, we then placed rear tips, originally 3 cm rear tips, however, we had difficulty placing the rear tips into the left crest. We felt that this was just a little bit too long and replaced both rear tips and down sized from 2 cm to 1 cm. At this point, we went ahead and placed the right cylinder using the Farlow device and the Keith needle, which was brought out through the glans penis and hemostated and the posterior rear tip was subsequently placed proximally, entered the crest without difficulty. Attention was then taken to the left side with the same thing was carried out, however, we did happen to dilate on two separate occasions both proximally and distally secondary to a very snug fit as well as buckling of the cylinders. This then forced us to down size to the 1 cm rear tips, which slipping very easily with the Farlow device through the glans penis. There was no crossover and no violation of the tunica albuginea. The rear tips were then placed without difficulty and our corporotomies were closed with #2-0 PDS in a running fashion. ________ starting on the patient's right side and then on the left side without difficulty and care was maintained to avoid damage or needle injury to the implants. At that point, the wound was copiously irrigated and the device was inflated multiple times. There was a very good fit and we had a very good result. At that point, the pump was subsequently placed in the dartos pouch, which already has been created and was copiously irrigated with antibiotic solution. This was held in place with a Babcock as well not to migrate proximally and attention was then taken to our connection from the reservoir to the pump. Please also note that before placement of our pump, attention was then taken up to the left lower quadrant where an incision was then made in external oblique aponeurosis, approximately 3 cm dissection down underneath the rectus space was developed for our reservoir device, which was subsequently placed without difficulty and three simple interrupted sutures of #2-0 Vicryl used to close the defect in the rectus and at that point after placement of our pump, the connection was made between the pump and the reservoir without difficulty. The entire system pump and corporal bodies were subsequently flushed and all air bubbles were evacuated. After completion of the connection using a straight connector, the prosthesis was inflated and we had very good results with air inflation with good erection in both cylinders with a very slight deviation to the left, but this was able to be ________ with good cosmetic result. At that point, after irrigation again of the space, the area was simply dry and hemostatic. The soft tissue was reapproximated to separate the cylinder so as not to lie in rope against one another and the wound was closed in multiple layers. The soft tissue and the skin was then reapproximated with staples. Please also note that prior to the skin closure, a Jackson-Pratt drain was subsequently placed through the left skin and left lower quadrant and subsequently placed just over tubings, would be left in place for approximately 12 to 20 hours. This was also sutured in place with nylon. Sterile dressing was applied. Light gauze was wrapped around the penis and/or sutures that begin at the tip of the glans penis were subsequently cut and removed in entirety bilaterally. Coban was used then to wrap the penis and at the end of the case the patient was straight catheted, approximately 400 cc of amber-yellow urine. No Foley catheter was used or placed. The patient was awoken in the operative suite, extubated, and transferred to recovery room in stable condition. He will be admitted overnight to the service of Dr. McDevitt. Cardiology will be asked to consult with Dr. Stomel for a pacer placement and he will be placed on the Telemetry floor and kept on IV antibiotics."
624,Urology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Right hydronephrosis. 2. Right flank pain. 3. Atypical/dysplastic urine cytology. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Right hydronephrosis. 2. Right flank pain. 3. Atypical/dysplastic urine cytology. 4. Extrarenal pelvis on the right. 5. No evidence of obstruction or ureteral/bladder lesions. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: 1. Cystoscopy. 2. Bilateral retrograde ureteropyelograms. 3. Right ureteral barbotage for urine cytology. 4. Right ureterorenoscopy, diagnostic. ANESTHESIA: Spinal. SPECIMEN TO PATHOLOGY: Urine and saline wash barbotage from right ureter through the ureteral catheter. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal. INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE: This is a 70-year-old female who reports progressive intermittent right flank pain associated with significant discomfort and disability. She presented to the emergency room where she was found to have significant hydronephrosis on the right without evidence of a stone. She has some ureteral thickening in her distal right ureter. She has persistent microscopic hematuria and her urine cytology and cytomolecular diagnosis significant for urothelial dysplasia with neoplasia-associated karyotypic profile. She was brought to the operating room for further evaluation and treatment. DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: After preoperative counseling, the patient was taken to the operating room and administered a spinal anesthesia. She was placed in the lithotomy position, prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. The 21-French cystoscope was inserted per urethra into the bladder. The bladder was inspected and found to be without evidence of intravesical tumors, stones or mucosal abnormalities. The right ureteral orifice was visualized and cannulated with an open-ended ureteral catheter. This was gently advanced to the mid ureter. Urine was collected for cytology. Retrograde injection of saline through the ureteral catheter was then also used to enhance collection of the specimen. This too was collected and sent for a pooled urine cytology as specimen from the right renal pelvis and ureter. An 0.038 guidewire was then passed up through the open-ended ureteral catheter. The open-ended ureteral catheter and cystoscope were removed, and over the guidewire the flexible ureteroscope was passed up to the level of the renal pelvis. Using direct vision and fluoroscopy to confirm location, the entire renal pelvis and calyces were inspected. The renal pelvis demonstrated an extrarenal pelvis, but no evidence of obstruction at the renal UPJ level. There were no intrapelvic or calyceal stones. The ureter demonstrated no significant mucosal abnormalities, no visible tumors, and no areas of apparent constriction on multiple passes of the ureteroscope through the ureter to evaluate. The ureteroscope was then removed. The cystoscope was reinserted. Once again, retrograde injection of contrast through an open-ended ureteral catheter was undertaken in the right ureter and collecting system. No evidence of extravasation or significant change in anatomy was visualized. The left ureteral orifice was then visualized and cannulated with an open-ended ureteral catheter, and retrograde injection of contrast demonstrated a normal left ureter and collecting system. The cystoscope was removed. Foley catheter was inserted. The patient was placed in the supine position and transferred to the recovery room in satisfactory condition."
625,Urology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right undescended testis (ectopic position). POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Right undescended testis (ectopic position), right inguinal hernia. PROCEDURES: Right orchiopexy and right inguinal hernia repair. ANESTHESIA: General inhalational anesthetic with caudal block. FLUIDS RECEIVED: 100 mL of crystalloids. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Less than 5 mL. SPECIMENS: No tissues sent to pathology. TUBES AND DRAINS: No tubes or drains were used. INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION: The patient is an almost 4-year-old boy with an undescended testis on the right; plan is for repair. DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: The patient was taken to the operating room; surgical consent, operative site, and patient identification were verified. Once he was anesthetized, a caudal block was placed. He was then placed in the supine position and sterilely prepped and draped. Since the testis was in the ectopic position, we did an upper curvilinear scrotal incision with a 15-blade knife and further extended it with electrocautery. Electrocautery was also used for hemostasis. A subdartos pouch was then created with a curved tenotomy scissors. The tunica vaginalis was grasped with a curved mosquito clamp and then dissected from its gubernacular attachments. As we were dissecting it, we then found the testis itself into the sac, and we opened the sac, and it was found to be slightly atrophic about 12 mm in length and had a type III epididymal attachment, not being attached to the top. We then dissected the hernia sac off of the testis __________ some traction using the straight Joseph scissors and straight and curved mosquito clamps. Once this was dissected off, we then twisted it upon itself, and then dissected it down towards the external ring, but on traction. We then twisted it upon itself, suture ligated it with 3-0 Vicryl and released it, allowing it to spring back into the canal. Once this was done, we then had adequate length of the testis into the scrotal sac. Using a curved mosquito clamp, we grasped the base of the scrotum internally, and using the subcutaneous tissue, we tacked it to the base of the testis using a 4-0 chromic suture. The testis was then placed into the scrotum in the proper orientation. The upper aspect of the pouch was closed with a pursestring suture of 4-0 chromic. The scrotal skin and dartos were then closed with subcutaneous closure of 4-0 chromic, and Dermabond tissue adhesive was used on the incision. IV Toradol was given. Both testes were well descended in the scrotum at the end of the procedure."
626,Urology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Penoscrotal abscess. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Penoscrotal abscess. OPERATION: Incision and drainage of the penoscrotal abscess, packing, penile biopsy, cystoscopy, and urethral dilation. BRIEF HISTORY: The patient is a 75-year-old male presented with penoscrotal abscess. Options such as watchful waiting, drainage, and antibiotics were discussed. Risks of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, MI, DVT, PE, completely the infection turning into necrotizing fascitis, Fournier's gangrene were discussed. The patient already had significant phimotic changes and disfigurement of the penis. For further debridement the patient was told that his penis is not going to be viable, he may need a total or partial penectomy now or in the future. Risks of decreased penile sensation, pain, Foley, other unexpected issues were discussed. The patient understood all the complications and wanted to proceed with the procedure. DETAIL OF THE OPERATION: The patient was brought to the OR. The patient was placed in dorsal lithotomy position. The patient was prepped and draped in the usual fashion. Pictures were taken prior to starting the procedure for documentation. The patient had an open sore on the right side of the penis measuring about 1 cm in size with pouring pus out using blunt dissection. The penile area was opened up distally to allow the pus to come out. The dissection around the proximal scrotum was done to make sure there are no other pus pockets. The corporal body was intact, but the distal part of the corpora was completely eroded and had a fungating mass, which was biopsied and sent for permanent pathology analysis. Urethra was identified at the distal tip, which was dilated and using 23-French cystoscope cystoscopy was done, which showed some urethral narrowing in the distal part of the urethra. The rest of the bladder appeared normal. The prostatic urethra was slightly enlarged. There are no stones or tumors inside the bladder. There were moderate trabeculations inside the bladder. Otherwise, the bladder and the urethra appeared normal. There was a significantly fungating mass involving the distal part of the urethra almost possibility to have including the fungating wart or fungating squamous cell carcinoma. Again biopsies were sent for pathology analysis. Prior to urine irrigation anaerobic aerobic cultures were sent, irrigation with over 2 L of fluid was performed. After irrigation, packing was done with Kerlix. The patient was brought to recovery in a stable condition. Please note that 18-French Foley was kept in place. Electrocautery was used at the end of the procedure to obtain hemostasis as much as possible, but there was fungating mass with slight bleeding packing was done and tight scrotal Kling was applied. The patient was brought to Recovery in a stable condition after applying 0.5% Marcaine about 20 mL were injected around for local anesthesia."
627,Urology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Right renal mass. 2. Hematuria. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: 1. Right renal mass. 2. Right ureteropelvic junction obstruction. PROCEDURES PERFORMED: 1. Cystourethroscopy. 2. Right retrograde pyelogram. 3. Right ureteral pyeloscopy. 4. Right renal biopsy. 5. Right double-J 4.5 x 26 mm ureteral stent placement. ANESTHESIA: Sedation. SPECIMEN: Urine for cytology and culture sensitivity, right renal pelvis urine for cytology, and right upper pole biopsies. INDICATION: The patient is a 74-year-old male who was initially seen in the office with hematuria. He was then brought to the hospital for other medical problems and found to still have hematuria. He has a CAT scan with abnormal appearing right kidney and it was felt that he will benefit from cystoscope evaluation. PROCEDURE: After consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position. He was given IV sedation and placed in dorsal lithotomy position. He was then prepped and draped in the standard fashion. A #21 French cystoscope was then passed through his ureter on which patient was noted to have a hypospadias and passed through across the ends of the bladder. The patient was noted to have mildly enlarged prostate, however, it was non-obstructing. Upon visualization of the bladder, the patient was noted to have some tuberculation to the bladder. There were no masses or any other abnormalities noted other than the tuberculation. Attention was then turned to the right ureteral orifice and an open-end of the catheter was then passed into the right ureteral orifice. A retrograde pyelogram was performed. Upon visualization, there was no visualization of the upper collecting system on the right side. At this point, a guidewire was then passed through the open-end of the ureteral catheter and the catheter was removed. The bladder was drained and the cystoscope was removed. The rigid ureteroscope was then passed into the bladder and into the right ureteral orifice with the assistance of a second glidewire. The ureteroscope was taken all the way through the proximal ureter just below the UPJ and there were noted to be no gross abnormalities. The ureteroscope was removed and an Amplatz wire then passed through the scope up into the collecting system along the side of the previous wire. The ureteroscope was removed and a ureteral dilating sheath was passed over the Amplatz wire into the right ureter under fluoroscopic guidance. The Amplatz wire was then removed and the flexible ureteroscope was passed through the sheath into the ureter. The ureteroscope was passed up to the UPJ at which point there was noted to be difficulty entering the ureter due to UPJ obstruction. The wire was then again passed through the flexible scope and the flexible scope was removed. A balloon dilator was then passed over the wire and the UPJ was dilated with balloon dilation. The dilator was then removed and again the cystoscope was passed back up into the right ureter and was able to enter the collecting system. Upon visualization of the collecting system of the upper portion, there was noted to be papillary mass within the collecting system. The ________ biopsy forceps were then passed through the scope and two biopsies were taken of the papillary mass. Once this was done, the wire was left in place and the ureteroscope was removed. The cystoscope was then placed back into the bladder and a 26 x 4.5 mm ureteral stent was passed over the wire under fluoroscopic and cystoscopic guidance into the right renal pelvis. The stent was noted to be clear within the right renal pelvis as well as in the bladder. The bladder was drained and the cystoscope was removed. The patient tolerated the procedure well. He will be transferred to the recovery room and back to his room. It has been discussed with his primary physician that the patient will likely need a nephrectomy. He will be scheduled for an echocardiogram tomorrow and then decision will be made where the patient will be stable for possible nephrectomy on Wednesday."
628,Urology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Refractory urgency and frequency. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Refractory urgency and frequency. OPERATION: Stage I and II neuromodulator. ANESTHESIA: Local MAC. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal. FLUIDS: Crystalloid. The patient was given Ancef preop antibiotic. Ancef irrigation was used throughout the procedure. BRIEF HISTORY: The patient is a 63-year-old female who presented to us with urgency and frequency on physical exam. There was no evidence of cystocele or rectocele. On urodyanamcis, the patient has significant overactivity of the bladder. The patient was tried on over three to four different anticholinergic agents such as Detrol, Ditropan, Sanctura, and VESIcare for at least one month each. The patient had pretty much failure from each of the procedure. The patient had less than 20% improvement with anticholinergics. Options such as continuously trying anticholinergics, continuation of the Kegel exercises, and trial of InterStim were discussed. The patient was interested in the trial. The patient had percutaneous InterStim trial in the office with over 70% to 80% improvement in her urgency, frequency, and urge incontinence. The patient was significantly satisfied with the results and wanted to proceed with stage I and II neuromodulator. Risks of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, MI, DVT, and PE were discussed. Risk of failure of the procedure in the future was discussed. Risk of lead migration that the treatment may or may not work in the long-term basis and data on the long term were not clear were discussed with the patient. The patient understood and wanted to proceed with stage I and II neuromodulator. Consent was obtained. DETAILS OF THE OPERATION: The patient was brought to the OR. The patient was placed in prone position. A pillow was placed underneath her pelvis area to slightly lift the pelvis up. The patient was awake, was given some MAC anesthesia through the IV, but the patient was talking and understanding and was able to verbalize issues. The patient's back was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. Lidocaine 1% was applied on the right side near the S3 foramen. Under fluoroscopy, the needle placement was confirmed. The patient felt stimulation in the vaginal area, which was tapping in nature. The patient also had a pressure feeling in the vaginal area. The patient had no back sensation or superficial sensation. There was no sensation down the leg. The patient did have __________, which turned in slide bellows response indicating the proper positioning of the needle. A wire was placed. The tract was dilated and lead was placed. The patient felt tapping in the vaginal area, which is an indication that the lead is in its proper position. Most of the leads had very low amplitude and stimulation. Lead was tunneled under the skin and was brought out through an incision on the left upper buttocks. Please note that the lidocaine was injected prior to the tunneling. A pouch was created about 1 cm beneath the subcutaneous tissue over the muscle where the actual unit was connected to the lead. Screws were turned and they were dropped. Attention was made to ensure that the lead was all the way in into the InterStim. Irrigation was performed after placing the main unit in the pouch. Impedance was checked. Irrigation was again performed with antibiotic irrigation solution. The needle site was closed using 4-0 Monocryl. The pouch was closed using 4-0 Vicryl and the subcutaneous tissue with 4-0 Monocryl. Dermabond was applied. The patient was brought to recovery in a stable condition."
629,Urology," HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient presents today as a consultation from Dr. ABC's office regarding the above. He was seen a few weeks ago for routine followup, and he was noted for microhematuria. Due to his history of kidney stone, renal ultrasound as well as IVP was done. He presents today for followup. He denies any dysuria, gross hematuria or flank pain issues. Last stone episode was over a year ago. No history of smoking. Daytime frequency 3 to 4 and nocturia 1 to 2, good stream, empties well with no incontinence. Creatinine 1.0 on June 25, 2008, UA at that time was noted for 5-9 RBCs, renal ultrasound of 07/24/2008 revealed 6 mm left intrarenal stone, with no hydronephrosis. IVP same day revealed a calcification over the left kidney, but without bilateral hydronephrosis. The calcification previously noted on the ureter appears to be outside the course of the ureter. Otherwise unremarkable. This is discussed. IMPRESSION: 1. A 6-mm left intrarenal stone, nonobstructing, by ultrasound and IVP. The patient is asymptomatic. We have discussed surgical intervention versus observation. He indicates that this stone is not bothersome, prefers observation, need for hydration with a goal of making over 2 liters of urine within 24 hours is discussed. 2. Microhematuria, we discussed possible etiologies of this, and the patient is agreeable to cystoscopy in the near future. Urine sent for culture and sensitivity. PLAN: As above. The patient will follow up for cystoscopy, urine sent for cytology, continue hydration. Call if any concern. The patient is seen and evaluated by myself."
630,Urology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Umbilical hernia. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Umbilical hernia. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Repair of umbilical hernia. ANESTHESIA: General. COMPLICATIONS: None. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Minimal. PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: The patient was prepped and draped in the sterile fashion. An infraumbilical incision was formed and taken down to the fascia. The umbilical hernia carefully reduced back into the cavity, and the fascia was closed with interrupted vertical mattress sutures to approximate the fascia, and then the wounds were infiltrated with 0.25% Marcaine. The skin was reattached to the fascia with 2-0 Vicryls. The skin was approximated with 2-0 Vicryl subcutaneous and then 4-0 Monocryl subcuticular stitches, dressed with Steri-Strips and 4 x 4's. Patient was extubated and taken to the recovery area in stable condition."
631,Urology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: History of bladder tumor with abnormal cytology and areas of erythema. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: History of bladder tumor with abnormal cytology and areas of erythema. PROCEDURE PERFORMED: 1. Cystoscopy. 2. Bladder biopsy with fulguration. ANESTHESIA: IV sedation with local. SPECIMEN: Urine cytology and right lateral wall biopsies. PROCEDURE: After the consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the operating room and given IV sedation. He was then placed in dorsal lithotomy position and prepped and draped in standard fashion. A #21 French cystoscope was then used to visualized the entire urethra and bladder. There was noted to be a narrowing of the proximal urethra, however, the scope was able to pass through. The patient was noted to have a previously resected prostate. On visualization of the bladder, the patient did have areas of erythema on the right as well as the left lateral walls, more significant on the right side. The patient did have increased vascularity throughout the bladder. The ________ two biopsies of the right lateral wall and those were sent for pathology. The Bovie cautery was then used to cauterize the entire area of the biopsy as well as surrounding erythema. Bovie was also utilized to cauterize the areas of erythema on the left lateral wall. No further bleeding was identified. The bladder was drained and the cystoscope was removed. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the recovery room. He will have his defibrillator restarted and will followup with Dr. X in approximately two weeks for the result. He will be discharged home with antibiotics as well as pain medications. He is to restart his Coumadin not before Sunday."
632,Urology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Bilateral vesicoureteral reflux with right reflux nephropathy after Deflux injection. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Bilateral vesicoureteral reflux with right reflux nephropathy after Deflux injection. PROCEDURE: Cystoscopy under anesthesia, bilateral HIT/STING with Deflux under general anesthetic. ANESTHESIA: General inhalational anesthetic. FLUIDS RECEIVED: 250 mL crystalloids. ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: Less than 5 mL. SPECIMENS: Urine sent for culture. ABNORMAL FINDINGS: Gaping ureteral orifices, right greater than left, with Deflux not in or near the ureteral orifices. Right ureteral orifice was HIT with 1.5 mL of Deflux and left with 1.2 mL of Deflux. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 4-1/2-year-old boy with history of reflux nephropathy and voiding and bowel dysfunction. He has had a STING procedure performed but continues to have reflux bilaterally. Plan is for another injection. DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION: The patient was taken to the operating room where surgical consent, operative site, and patient identification were verified. Once he was anesthetized, IV antibiotics were given. He was then placed in a lithotomy position with adequate padding of his arms and legs. His urethra was calibrated to 12-French with a bougie a boule. A 9.5-French cystoscope was used and the offset system was then used. His urethra was normal without valves or strictures. His bladder was fairly normal with minimal trabeculations but no cystitis noted. Upon evaluation, the patient's right ureteral orifice was found to be remarkably gaping and the Deflux that was present was not in or near ureteral orifice but it was inferior to it below the trigone. This was similarly found on the left side where the Deflux was not close to the orifice as well. It was slightly more difficult because of the amount impacted upon our angle for injection. We were able to ultimately get the Deflux to go ahead with HIT technique on the right into the ureter itself to inject a total of 1.5 mL to include the HIT technique as well as the ureteral orifice itself on the right and left sides and some on the uppermost aspect. Once we injected this, we ran the irrigant over the orifice and it no longer fluttered and there was no bleeding. Similar procedure was done on the left. This was actually more difficult as the Deflux injection from before displaced the ureter slightly more laterally but again HIT technique was performed. There was some mild bleeding and Deflux was used to stop this as well and again no evidence of fluttering of the ureteral orifice after injection. At the end of the procedure, the irrigant was drained and 2% lidocaine jelly was instilled in the urethra. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was in stable condition upon transfer to Recovery. A low-dose of IV Toradol was given at the end of the procedure as well."
633,Urology," HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient presents today for followup, history of erectile dysfunction, last visit started on Cialis 10 mg. He indicates that he has noticed some mild improvement of his symptoms, with no side effect. On this dose, he is having firm erection, able to penetrate, lasting for about 10 or so minutes. No chest pain, no nitroglycerin usage, no fever, no chills. No dysuria, gross hematuria, fever, chills. Daytime frequency every three hours, nocturia times 0, good stream. He does have a history of elevated PSA and biopsy June of this year was noted for high grade PIN, mid left biopsy, with two specimens being too small to evaluate. PSA 11.6. Dr. X's notes are reviewed. IMPRESSION: 1. Some improvement of erectile dysfunction, on low dose of Cialis, with no side effects. The patient has multiple risk factors, but denies using any nitroglycerin or any cardiac issues at this time. We reviewed options of increasing the medication, versus trying other medications, options of penile prosthesis, Caverject injection use as well as working pump is reviewed. 2. Elevated PSA in a patient with a recent biopsy showing high-grade PIN, as well as two specimens not being large enough to evaluate. The patient tells me he has met with his primary care physician and after discussion, he is in consideration of repeating a prostate ultrasound and biopsy. However, he would like to meet with Dr. X to discuss these prior to biopsy. PLAN: Following detailed discussion, the patient wishes to proceed with Cialis 20 mg, samples are provided as well as Levitra 10 mg, may increase this to 20 mg and understand administration of each and contraindication as well as potential side effects are reviewed. The patient not to use them at the same time. Will call if any other concern. In the meantime, he is scheduled to meet with Dr. X, with a prior PSA in consideration of a possible repeating prostate ultrasound and biopsy. He declined scheduling this at this time. All questions answered."
634,Urology," Thank you for allowing me to help in the evaluation of the patient who, as you know, is a 44-year-old male with a history of a skin lesion for approximately one year now. It has been given a label in the past of a skin tag. The patient states it is not painful, has had no trauma or bleeding to that area. The patient is interested in evaluation because he is on the move with his work and would like it taken care of. He has no voiding complaints and no history of sexually transmitted diseases. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: None. PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Back surgery with a fusion of L5-S1. MEDICATIONS: He does take occasional Percocet for his back discomfort. ALLERGIES: HE HAS NO ALLERGIES. SOCIAL HISTORY: He is a smoker. He takes rare alcohol. His employment is that he does dynamite work and actually putting in the dynamite in large holes for destroying ground to that pipeline can be laid. He travels to anywhere for his work. He is married with one son. FAMILY HISTORY: Negative for prostate cancer, kidney cancer, bladder cancer, enlarged prostate or kidney disease. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Negative for tremors, headaches, dizzy spells, numbness, tingling, feeling hot or cold, tired or sluggishness, abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting, indigestion, heartburn, fevers, chills, weight loss, wheezing, frequent cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, varicose veins, high blood pressure, skin rash, joint pain, ear infections, sore throat, sinus problems, hay fever, blood clotting problems, depressive affect or eye problems. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION GENERAL: The patient is afebrile. His vital signs are stable. He is 177 pounds, 5 feet, 8 inches. Blood pressure 144/66. He is healthy appearing. He is alert and oriented x 3. HEART: Regular rate and rhythm. LUNGS: Clear to auscultation. ABDOMEN: Soft and nontender. His penis is circumcised. He has a pedunculated cauliflower-like lesion on the dorsum of the penis at approximately 12 o'clock. It is very obvious and apparent. He also has a mildly raised brown lesion that the patient states has been there ever since he can remember and has not changed in size or caliber. His testicles are descended bilaterally. There are no masses. ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: This is likely molluscum contagiosum (genital warts) caused by HPV. I did state to the patient that this is likely a viral infection that could have had a long incubation period. It is not clear where this came from but it is most likely sexually transmitted. He is instructed that he should use protected sex from this point on in order to try and limit the transmission. Regarding the actual lesion itself, I did mention that we could apply a cream of Condylox, which could take up to a month to work. I also offered him C02 laser therapy for the genital warts, which is an outpatient procedure. The patient is very interested in something quick and effective such as a CO2 laser procedure. I did state that the recurrence rate is significant and somewhere as high as 20% despite enucleating these lesions. The patient understood this and still wished to proceed. There is minimal risk otherwise except for those inherent in laser injury and accidental injury. The patient understood and wished to proceed."
635,Urology," PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Bilateral undescended testes. POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Bilateral undescended testes. OPERATION PERFORMED: Bilateral orchiopexy. ANESTHESIA: General. HISTORY: This 8-year-old boy has been found to have a left inguinally situated undescended testes. Ultrasound showed metastasis to be high in the left inguinal canal. The right testis is located in the right inguinal canal on ultrasound and apparently ultrasound could not be displaced into the right hemiscrotum. Both testes appeared to be normal in size for the boy's age. OPERATIVE FINDINGS: As above, both testes appeared viable and normal in size, no masses. There is a hernia on the left side. The spermatic cord was quite short on the left and required Prentiss Maneuver to achieve adequate length for scrotal placement. OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: The boy was taken to the operating room, where he was placed on the operating table. General anesthesia was administered by Dr. X, after which the boy's lower abdomen and genitalia were prepared with Betadine and draped aseptically. A 0.25% Marcaine was infiltrated subcutaneously in the skin crease in the left groin in the area of the intended incision. An inguinal incision was then made through this area, carried through the subcutaneous tissues to the anterior fascia. External ring was exposed with dissection as well. The fascia was opened in direction of its fibers exposing the testes, which lay high in the canal. The testes were freed with dissection by removing cremasteric and spermatic fascia. The hernia sac was separated from the cord, twisted and suture ligated at the internal ring. Lateral investing bands of the spermatic cords were divided high into the inguinal internal ring. However, this would only allow placement of the testes in the upper scrotum with some tension. Therefore, the left inguinal canal was incised and the inferior epigastric artery and vein were ligated with #4-0 Vicryl and divided. This maneuver allowed for placement of the testes in the upper scrotum without tension. A sub dartos pouch was created by separating the abdominal fascia from the scrotal skin after making an incision in the left hemiscrotum in the direction of the vessel. The testes were then brought into the pouch and anchored with interrupted #4-0 Vicryl sutures. The skin was approximated with interrupted #5-0 chromic catgut sutures. Inspection of the spermatic cord in the inguinal area revealed no twisting and the testicular cover was good. Internal oblique muscle was approximated to the shelving edge and Poupart ligament with interrupted #4-0 Vicryl over the spermatic cord and the external oblique fascia was closed with running #4-0 Vicryl suture. Additional 7 mL of Marcaine was infiltrated subfascially and the skin was closed with running #5-0 subcuticular after placing several #4-0 Vicryl approximating sutures in the subcutaneous tissues. Attention was then turned to the opposite side, where an orchiopexy was performed in a similar fashion. However, on this side, there was no inguinal hernia. The testes were located in a superficial pouch of the inguinal canal and there was adequate length on the spermatic cord, so that the Prentiss maneuver was not required on this side. The sub dartos pouch was created in a similar fashion and the wounds were closed similarly as well. The inguinal and scrotal incisions were cleansed after completion of the procedure. Steri-Strips and Tegaderm were applied to the inguinal incisions and collodion to the scrotal incision. The child was then awakened and transported to post-anesthetic recovery area apparently in satisfactory condition. Instrument and sponge counts were correct. There were no apparent complications. Estimated blood loss was less than 20 to 30 mL."
636,Urology,
637,Urology," REASON FOR VISIT: Overactive bladder with microscopic hematuria. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 56-year-old noted to have microscopic hematuria with overactive bladder. Her cystoscopy performed was unremarkable. She continues to have some episodes of frequency and urgency mostly with episodes during the day and rare at night. No gross hematuria, dysuria, pyuria, no other outlet obstructive and/or irritative voiding symptoms. The patient had been previously on Ditropan and did not do nearly as well. At this point, what we will try is a different medication. Renal ultrasound is otherwise unremarkable, notes no evidence of any other disease. IMPRESSION: Overactive bladder with microscopic hematuria most likely some mild atrophic vaginitis is noted. She has no other significant findings other than her overactive bladder, which had continued. At this juncture what I would like to do is try a different anticholinergic medication. She has never had any side effects from her medication. PLAN: The patient will discontinue Ditropan. We will start Sanctura XR and we will follow up as scheduled. Otherwise we will continue to follow her urinalysis over the next year or so."
