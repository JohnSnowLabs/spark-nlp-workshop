the upper right sternal border , and a 1/6 decrescendo diastolic murmur heard best at Erb 's point , with no gallop or rub appreciated .\nThe abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended .\nThere are no palpable masses , and there is no shake tenderness .\nThere is a well-healed right subcostal scar , and a well-healed right paramedian scar .\nRectal examination is nontender , free of any palpable masses , and guaiac-negative stool .\nExtremities :\nno clubbing , cyanosis or edema .\nNeurological examination is nonfocal .\nLABORATORY DATA :\nA panel of serum electrolytes is normal .\nThe white blood cell count is 7.3 , hematocrit 28.4 , platelets 586,000 .\nLymphocyte differential count shows 77% PMNs , 13% lymphocytes , 8% monocytes , and 1% basophils .\nAlkaline phosphatase is 1,342 , lactacte dehydrogenase is 253 , and AST is 221 .\nTotal bilirubin is 10.7 , and direct bilirubin is 8.2 .\nTotal protein is 7.1 , and albumin is 2.1 .\nSerum amylase is 43 .\nCalcium is 8.2 , magnesium 1.8 , and phosphorous 3.1 .\nX-ray examination of the chest reveals clear lungs and a normal heart .\nKUB and upright abdominal x-rays revealed no obstruction or perforation , focal dilatation of small bowel in the right upper quadrants , and two calcified densities noted in the right upper quadrants , which may represent gall stones .\nUltrasonography of the right upper abdominal quadrant reveals a portal mass with calcification and possible invasion of the portal vein , thought to appear suspiciously similar to a hepatocellular carcinoma .\nIntrahepatic biliary duct dilatation was noted proximal to the mass .\nElectrocardiography reveals normal sinus rhythm , with non-specific ST and T-wave abnormalities in leads 2 , 3 , and AVF .\nThe axis and intervals are otherwise within normal limits .\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\nThe patient was admitted to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital to the General Surgery Service of Dr. Lynea Moyduhe .\nA modified upper GI x-ray series was obtained , which revealed malpositioning of the duodenum and jejunum in the right abdomen , consistent with intestinal malrotation , but no evidence of obstruction in the duodenum or jejunum was identified .\nTherefore , the patient was prevented from taking anything by mouth and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was performed .\nThis study identified a 5 centimeter narrowed segment in the distal common bile duct , and moderately severe dilatation of the left biliary radicals in the right hepatic duct .\nA temporary stent was placed , which seemed to function well despite its unsatisfactory positioning .\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well , and there were no complications .\nHe was returned to the Surgical Ward in stable condition .\nBecause of the probable malignant nature of the patient 's biliary obstruction , the patient was returned to the GI lab on 11/25/93 , where repeat endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was performed .\nThis procedure was performed under general anesthesia , and resulted in successful placement of a permanent stent within the distal common bile duct .\nAdditionally , a computer tomography guided needle biopsy was performed of the paraportal mass .\nThese procedures were well tolerated by the patient , and were free of complication .\nAs before , the patient was covered with post-procedure antibiotic therapy .\nHe was returned to the surgical ward in stable condition .\nPreliminary report on the biopsy specimen at the time of this dictation describes the presence of acute and chronic inflammation , but no malignant cells .\nHowever , two cytology specimens were both positive for malignant cells , the histopathologic characteristics of which suggest adenocarcinoma .\nFollowing the permanent stent placement , the patient 's diet was slowly advanced .\nHis serum bilirubin levels and other liver function studies continued to normalize .\nBecause of his rapid progress , the resolution of his right upper quadrant pain , and the fact that no surgical therapy was indicated at this time , the patient was discharged to his group home on 11/29/93 .\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE :\nImproved .\nDOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :\n1 ) Discharged to group home ,\n2 ) diet as tolerated ,\n3 ) activity ad lib ,\n4 ) followup with Dr. Moyduhe ,\n5 )\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :\nTagamet 400 mg. po q.day , Tetracycline 250 mg. po bid prn ingrown hair .\nLUPEVICKETTE L.

Heparin and given oxygen three liters with sats remaining somewhere between 85 and 90% .\nShe was also started on Zithromax .\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS :\nNotable for no palpitations , chest pain , syncope , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , claudication , chronic venous stasis , tuberculosis , pneumonia , gastrointestinal disturbances , weakness , easy bruising , anemia or bleeding .\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY

respiratory distress .\nDetails not available .\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION :\nThe patient was comfortable in the sitting position with pursed lip breathing , afebrile , pulse 120 beats per minute , blood pressure 136/90 .\nHEENT exam notable for normocephalic , atraumatic head , pupils equal , round , reactive to light , mild oropharyngeal cyanosis .\nOropharynx with moist mucous membranes .\nNeck was supple , no thyromegaly , no nodules , 2+ carotids bilaterally .\nJugular venous pressure 12 cm .\nChest exam notable for decreased bilateral breath sounds and expiratory wheeze bilaterally , no egophony , hyperresonant , hyperexpanded .\nCardiac :\nnotable for normal point of maximum impulse , right sided S3 , no murmurs .\nAbdomen soft , non-tender , quiet bowel sounds , no bruits , no hepatosplenomegaly , no scars .\nNeurologically grossly intact .\nExtremities :\nno edema .\nBilateral spider varicosities .\n2+ dorsalis pedis bilaterally .\nNo femoral bruits .\nLABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION :\nPotassium 5.3 , BUN 26 , creatinine 1.6 , glucose 211 .\nArterial blood gases :\npH 7.27 , PCO2 70 , PO2 70 , hematocrit 49% .\nWhite blood count was 11.5 , hematocrit 51.6 .\nChest X-ray :\nsubtle increased density in the left middle lung .\nElectrocardiogram notable for sinus tachycardia with emphysematous pattern , poor R progression V1 through V3 , and P. pulmonale with right axis deviation .\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\nThe patient was admitted for acute and chronic respiratory distress with likely chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and question of a pulmonary embolus .\nThe patient was ruled out for myocardial infarction with serial CK 's which were normal .\nEchocardiogram was obtained which showed normal left ventricle , a dilated right ventricle with diffuse hypokinesis .\nThe RVSP was estimated at 35 .\nEchocardiogram findings with persistent , profound right heart failure .\nThe patient subsequently underwent a pulmonary arteriogram which revealed no pulmonary emboli , but pulmonary artery pressure of 39/22 , wedge pressure of 12 and a right atrial pressure of 10 .\nThe patient also had mild liver function test abnormalities , for which she underwent right upper quadrant ultrasound which showed patent portal vein , patent hepatic vein and artery and bilateral small pleural effusions with a 4 cm. complex cystic lesion with calcified walls on the lateral aspect of the spleen .\nThe patient 's heparin was subsequently discontinued .\nPulmonary status stabilized , with the patient 's room air sat hovering around 90% .\nMicrobiologic work up for possible chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare exacerbation was subsequently negative .\nThe patient remained cardiovascularly stable but unclear etiology of her subtle electrocardiogram changes and respiratory distress .\nIt was subsequently felt after full work up with a negative PA gram , plus / minus VQ , negative echocardiogram , negative sero-CK 's and no evolving electrocardiogram that the patient had pulmonary hypertension secondary to chronic lung disease .\nIt was felt that the patient likely had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease of greater severity and duration than initially suspected and by history from the patient , in particular supported by her chronic CO2 retention on subsequent arterial blood gases .\nThe patient was maintained on treatment for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation , including steroid taper and nebs as well as antibiotic coverage .\nRepeat chest x-ray subsequently showed hyperinflation consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , no signs of pneumonia or pulmonary edema , bilateral blunting of the costophrenic angles , consistent with pleural thickening , and / or small bilateral pleural effusions , consistent with right upper quadrant ultrasound .\nPulmonary Service was consulted .\nThey recommendations included smoking cessation , recommendation for

Neurological :\nOn admission the patient was intubated and sedated .\nHer sedation was gradually weaned during her first month in the Intensive Care Unit and she was noted to have an underlying depression and history of obsessive compulsive disorder as listed from the patient and her family .\nA psychiatric evaluation was obtained and she was placed on Paxil at 5 milligrams which was gradually increased to a total of 20 milligrams po q day at the time of her admission .\nOn August 29th , Ms. Abreun again required sedation when she found apneic and hypotensive .\nShe spent several days in the Intensive Care Unit at that time , during which her sedation was gradually weaned back to off .\n2. Pulmonary :\nMs. Abreun was admitted , sedated and on a respirator , requiring minimal settings with a pressure support of 10 and a pep of 5 .\nAfter two weeks of intubation on July 25th the patient went to the operating room for a tracheostomy which she tolerated without issue .\nOver the next several weeks , the ventilatory support was gradually weaned to off .\nBy August 9th she was tolerating trach mask trials and was on the verge of tracheostomy removal by August 29th .\nAt this time , she had a sudden episode of respiratory distress accompanied by hypotension and unresponsiveness .\nShe was bag masked and taken immediately to the Intensive Care Unit where she was placed on respiratory support with SIMV settings which were gradually weaned over the course of her ten days in the Intensive Care Unit .\nAfter her wean from the respiratory , she was transferred back to the floor and over the next several days tolerated trach mask trials admirably and had her tracheostomy removed on September 16th , 1998 .\nAt the time of her discharge , she had no acute respiratory issues .\n3. Cardiovascular :\nMs. Abreun was admitted on cardiac support requiring 30 of Neo-Synephrine .\nShe was placed on a Swan Gans catheter monitor and gradually weaned off the Neo-Synephrine by the 22nd of July .\nShe required no further support and had no further issues until August 29th when she had her respiratory crisis and was transferred to the unit .\nAt this time her dramatic pressure drop required Dopamine support at levels of 500 micrograms per minute .\nA Swan Gans catheter floated at this time demonstrated an SVR of 500 .\nShe was supported with Dopamine and with fluid and was slow to come off the Dopamine requiring approximately 8 to 10 days for full weaning .\nAfter the wean she required no further cardiac medication and had no further issues .\n4. Renal :\nMs. Abreun 's fluid management was an important contributor to her hospital course .\nShe presented with massive ascites and anasarca for which she received large volume diuresis with regular Lasix dosing daily .\nRenal parameters were normal until the time of her respiratory cardiovascular crisis on August 29th .\nAt this time , it was noted that her bun jumped to levels of approximately 80 , while her creatinine stayed at levels of .6 to .7 .\nAn elevation by Dr. Freiermthalskush of renal medicine at first suspected a subclinical congestive heart failure as being responsible for a prerenal azotemia , however on further elucidation of the patient 's course , it is evident that a broad sepsis caused by her pneumonia was responsible for her decreased SVR and eventual renal hypoperfusion .\nHer azotemia responded readily to pressor support and fluid resuscitation .\nAt the end of her second Intensive Care Unit admission , her bun and creatinine had resolved to normal values .\n5. Gastrointestinal :\nMs. Abreun was admitted nothing by mouth , intubated on intravenous fluids alone .\nShe was immediately begun on total parenteral nutrition therapy for what would be a prolonged course without PO intake .\nOn July 25th a G tube was placed and feeds were begun gradually .\nThese G tube feeds were gradually increased with a total parenteral nutrition wean , however at the time of her re-admission to the Intensive Care Unit on August 29th aspiration was suspected and all tube feeds were held .\nShe was maintained on total parenteral nutrition for the course of her time in the Intensive Care Unit .\nAt the end of this time , she was begun gradually on G tube feeding , however she was able to tolerate only very small volumes and produce large aspirates .\nThis problem had remained and been ongoing for the remainder of her hospital at Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital .\nShe is currently being supported on tube feeds of Vivonex at a rate of approximately 20 and hour with aspirates being measured q 4 hours and measuring from 30 to 250 regularly .\nShe has also been supplemented with Glutamine 10 grams b.i.d. via the G tube in hopes of reviving what most certainly be her gut atrophy from prolonged disuse .\nMs. Abreun , from the onset of her stay at Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital demonstrated elevated alkaline phosphatase levels in isolation from her other liver function tests .\nThese values ranging as high as 2300 were evaluated by gastrointestinal consult who came and performed and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography which demonstrated a normal biliary system with diameters on the large end of normal .\nStone was demonstrated in the gallbladder , but there was no evidence of obstruction and the study was ready as normal .\n5 'nucleotidase values have also been elevated ranging from 150 to 180 .\nTo date there has been no satisfactory explanation for these elevations in alkaline phosphatase and 5 'nucleotidase and all associated studies have been negative .\nFurther evaluation of this during her later hospital stay or as an outpatient .\n6. Infectious disease :\nMs. Abreun underwent a work up for tuberculosis at the beginning of her hospital course .\nShe ruled out by PPD .\nThe initial management of her necrotizing fascitis was empiric with Imipenem , Flagyl and Vancomycin .\nBecause of the extent of her wound , she was also treated with hyperbaric oxygen which was of some benefit in resolving her infection .\nThe course of Flagyl , Imipenem and Vancomycin was continued for fourteen days .\nAt this time Imipenem were discontinued and Vancomycin was maintained alone for additional several days .\nShe then went without antibiotic therapy for a period of several weeks until her crisis of August 29th .\nON admission to the unit , she was begun on triple antibiotic therapy with Levo / Vanc/Flagyl .\nShortly thereafter Gentamicin was added to the regimen which was maintained for a period of one week until cultures came back and her therapy could be stream lined to Vancomycin , Levofloxacin alone .\nAfter a ten day course of Levofloxacin it was discontinued , Vancomycin was maintained for five additional days , after which time , it was discontinued as well and she was without antibiotics .\nOn discharge , she was currently taking no antibiotics .\nMs. Abreun entered the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital having taking only oral hypoglycemic agents for control of her diabetes .\nBecause of the stress of her infection and Intensive Care Unit admission she was requiring sliding scale Insulin for the full course of her hospital stay .\nHer total parenteral nutrition was also supplemented with Insulin NPH for better control .\nHer total parenteral nutrition is currently supplemented with 30 units NPH q day and she is on a sliding scale to control the remainder of her sugars .\nMs. Abreun 's hypothyroidism diagnosed shortly before her admission was an important aspect of her therapy during her course at Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital .\nHer thyroid necessity was poorly controlled with a Synthroid dose of 0.125 milligrams for the majority of her stay .\nAt the time of her admission to the Intensive Care Unit on August 29th it was noted that she had a thyroid stimulating hormone that was dramatically raised to a value of 26.83 .\nMore active supplementation was performed increasing her dose to .3 milligrams q day , which caused a rapid resolution of her thyroid studies and an improvement in her physiology almost immediately .\nShe has since been maintained on a dose of 0.2 milligrams IV q d .\nHowever , she has had a gradual rise in her thyroid stimulating hormone to a value of 6.68 .\nHer discharge medication will include Synthroid dose of 0.3 milligrams po q day with recommendation that this parameter be followed closely .\nIN SUMMARY :\nMs. Abreun is a fifty nine-year-old female who presented with necrotizing fascitis of the right hip , status post debridement , severely debilitated by the extent of her infection .\nOver the course of 2 months this infection was cleared , the wound was cleaned and split thickness skin grafting was successful in covering over the wound .\nHer course , however was complicated by an methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia which was resistant to therapy and which produced a profound sepsis which caused a hypotensive ana apneic episode which required Intensive Care Unit support for a period of a week .\nHer course was also complicated by her hypoactive thyroid function which went unrecognized for some period , but has since resolved with aggressive Synthroid therapy .\nCurrently , her most issues are the advancement of her tube feeds and the restarting of her PO intake which was planned to begin for the next several days before her transfer was initiated .\nHer wound also requires further care as smaller areas of non-take in the graft are being management with sterile saline wet to dry dressings .\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE :\nStable with issues resolving .\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\nHeparin 5,000 units sub q b.i.d.\nPrilosec 20 milligrams per G tube q day .\nPaxil 10 milligrams per G tube q.h.s.\nMilk of Magnesia 30 ccs per G tube q.h.s.\nLotrimin cream b.i.d. to effected areas .\nNystatin powder b.i.d. to effected areas .\nLasix 20 milligrams intravenous q day .\nSynthroid 0.3 milligrams per G tube q day .\nReglan 10 milligrams per G tube t.i.d.\nPeri-Colace 15 ccs per G tube q.h.s.\nGlutamine 10 grams diluted as necessary per G tube t.i.d.\nAtivan 0.5 milligrams to 1 milligrams per G tube or sublingual q 6 hours whenever necessary .\nInsulin sliding scale as follows ;

:\n11-4-93\nPRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :\ncerebellar hematoma .\nASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :\n1. deep venous thrombosis ,\n2. history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .\nSPECIAL PROCEDURES AND OPERATIONS :\n10-11-93 , suboccipital craniectomy with evacuation of cerebellar hematoma and left lateral cerebellar hemisphere resection .\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\nThe patient is a 112y year old female who was found unresponsive and underwent an initial evaluation at Tonland County Medical Center where a computerized tomography scan showed evidence of an acute posterior ______________ bleed .\nShe was transferred to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital for further neurosurgical evaluation .\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\nAs documented previously in the patient 's medical record , includes a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , and coronary artery disease as evaluated by cardiac catheterization on 07/93 , although no cardiac catheterization report is available , the discharge summary that no evidence of significant coronary artery disease was found .\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\nAtenolol 25 mg PO q.day , Procardia XL 60 mg PO q.day , Pepcid 20 mg PO b.i.d. , Isordil 10 mg PO t.i.d.\nALLERGIES :\nThe patient has no known drug allergies .\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\nOn physical examination on admission , she is an elderly woman with labored respirations .\nHer blood pressure was 148/65 , pulse 78 , respirations 20 , temperature was afebrile .\nHer head , eyes , ears , nose , throat examination showed normocephalic , atraumatic head , oropharynx was clear , her lungs had coarse breath sounds bilaterally .\nCardiovascular exam :\nII / VI systolic ejection murmur .\nThe heart exam revealed a normal Sl and S2 .\nThe abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended , positive bowel sounds .\nExtremities :\n2+ edema in the bilateral lower extremities .\nHer neurological examination revealed that she was awake and alert at the time of her arrival to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital and was moving all extremities to commands with pupils equal , round , reactive to light and accommodation .\nHer extra ocular movements were intact .\nLABORATORY DATA :\nsignificant for normal electrolytes , BUN and creatinine of 27 and 1.1 , electrocardiogram which revealed normal sinus rhythm at 78 beats per minute with T wave inversions in V2 through V6 .\nThe chest X-ray showed a left pleural effusion .\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\nThe patient arrived at the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital and given her history of variably responsive state , and her computerized tomography scan showing a cerebellar hematoma , the patient was brought immediately to the Operating Room after consultation with the Medicine Service , given the previously noted electrocardiogram changes .\nIt was felt that her prior evaluation at the Ona Hospital had showed no significant coronary artery disease , according to cardiac catheterization results at that time .\nHowever , invasive monitoring was undertaken in the operating room , as well as intravenous nitroglycerin for blood pressure control as needed .\nThe patient tolerated the initial procedure well .\nOn the next morning , however , a computerized tomography scan revealed recurrent hemorrhage with obliteration of her cisterns .\nShe was awake and following commands .\nIt was necessary , however , to return to the operating room for re-evacuation of her hematoma , which was performed .\nThe patient 's postoperative course was remarkably benign given the patient 's age and past medical history .\nThe patient was then extubated on the fifth postoperative day .\nShe did develop some respiratory distress on the first day post-extubation , requiring 48 hours of re-intubation .\nHer subsequent course from a respiratory standpoint has been relatively unremarkable .\nIn addition , the patient has done very well from a neurological standpoint .\nShe is very bright , alert and oriented x three with an essentially normal neurological examination except for some bilateral dysmetria .\nShe has been tolerating a regular diet and has been working with physical therapy towards ambulation .\nOn 10-28-93 , the patient 's course was complicated by the development of a left lower extremity deep venous thrombosis .\nShe had been maintained on subcutaneous heparin and pneumoboots initially postoperatively and developed her thrombosis in this setting .\nSince that time , she has been maintained on bedrest and Coumadinized .\nHer current prothrombin time on 11-3-93 was 14.8 and it is felt that she could begin to be mobilized to a chair .\nHer prothrombin time should be followed in rehabilitation to maintain it at the level of 14-16 .\nThe patient overall has done very well following her hospitalization .\nWe feel that she is an excellent candidate for rehabilitation and has been accepted at Villrow Health to continue this effort .\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\nCoumadin , dosed daily to maintain a prothrombin time of 14-16 .\nHer dosing has currently been 4-5 mg PO qhs and we suspect that she will even out at a dose of anywhere from 2.5 to 3 mg PO qhs to maintain her level .\nOther medications include :\nIsordil 10 mg PO t.i.d. , which has been held for systolic blood pressure of less than 110 .\nThe patient also has been taking Fluconazole 100 mg PO b.i.d.; she is on day two of a five day course .\nAdditionally , Cimetidine 400 mg PO t.i.d.\nDISPOSITION / PLAN ON DISCHARGE :\nThe patient is transferred to Villrow Health .\nShe should be seen in the Neurosurgery Service clinic in six weeks ' time for follow up evaluation .\nShe should continue taking Coumadin to maintain a therapeutic prothrombin time in the 14-16 range for 4-6 weeks 'time .\nShe will require physical therapy and occupational therapy at Villrow Health .\nDALYWOO DROREITE , M.D.\nTR :\niq / bmot\nDD :\n11-4-93\nTD :\n11/04/93\nCC :\nSTAT\n[ report_end ]\n"

Sieh and Shufffyfe did not recommend operative repair of severe mitral regurgitation or aortic stenosis .\nHe was thus discharged with plans for continued medical therapy of his coronary artery disease .\nUnfortunately , the patient continued to deteriorate and was readmitted for an attempt at hemodynamic tailoring and possible inotropic support .\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\nIs notable for above .\nFor long standing dilated cardiomyopathy , severe mitral regurgitation and moderate aortic stenosis with a calculated aortic valve area of 1.1 by previous catheterization .\nThe patient had limited coronary artery disease with an occluded right coronary artery collateralized from the left system .\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\nThe patient was a well appearing pleasant man who was dyspneic on the examining table .\nInitial blood pressure was 95/65 , heart rate 80 and regular .\nRespiratory rate was 14 .\nJugular venous pressure was 7 with modest hepatojugular reflex .\nThe carotids were 2+ and the lungs were notable for diminished breath sounds with inspiratory rhonchi .\nThe point of maximum impulse was displaced and the first and second heart sounds were unremarkable with a 2/6 murmur of mitral regurgitation .\nThere was no S3 gallop .\nAbdomen was soft and non-tender and the rest of the examination was notable only for a slightly diminished pulses and poor perfusion .\nLABORATORY DATA :\nNotable for a sodium of 144 , potassium 3.7 , BUN 43 , creatinine 1.8 , albumin 3.0 , hematocrit 36 , white count 9.5 , platelet count 254 and a negative urinalysis .\nA chest x-ray revealed moderate cardiomegaly with modest edema and the electrocardiogram revealed a normal sinus rhythm with left axis deviation , previous inferior apical infarct and right bundle branch block .\nHOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :\nThe patient was admitted to the hospital and underwent right heart catheterization which revealed a right atrial pressure of 11 , pulmonary artery pressure of 55/25 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 26 and a cardiac output of 2.7 liters per minute .\nThe PA line was kept in place while the patient was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit where he underwent an attempt at hemodynamic tailoring .\nInitially Nipride was begun with some augmentation of the cardiac index but eventually a fall of the cardiac index to 1.8 .\nThe patient was then begun on Milrinone to a dose of .4 mcg. per kg. per minute with improvement in his cardiac index to approximately 2.0 and a corresponding fall in his filling pressures .\nBecause of the increased ectopy that appeared to be temporally associated with this infusion , the patient was switched to Dobutamine and titrated to a dose of 250 mcg. per minute .\nOn Dobutamine the cardiac index was 2.4-2.7 and at the end of his hemodynamic tailoring which included vigorous diuresis and the addition of Isordil and Captopril back to his chronic medical program , the patient 's right atrial pressure was 6 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was 9 and the cardiac index was 2.7 .\nSystemic vascular resistance was 900 .\nThe patient was then decannulated and sent to the floor with improvement in his central hemodynamics .\nOver the subsequent days of his hospitalization , the patient had adjustment of his diuretic program .\nAt discharge his goal weight will be 120 pounds and he will be maintained on a chronic Dobutamine infusion at 250 mcg. per minute .\nShould he tachy phylax to this which is inevitable , he will be begun on a home Milrinone infusion per previous protocol .\nThe patient on the dose of Dobutamine noted , had little in the way of resting symptoms and was without paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , and orthopnea and able to ambulate approximately 100-150 feet without dyspnea .\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\nLasix 20 mg. q.day .\nIsordil 10 mg. t.i.d. Aldactone 25 mg. q.d. Digoxin .125 mg. q.d. Plavix 75 mg. q.d. Allopurinol 100 mg. q.d.\nSerevent and Flovent inhalers the patient b.i.d. Zoloft 25 mg. q.d. Nexium 40 mg. b.i.d. Captopril 25 mg. t.i.d. Zocor 20 mg. q.d. Seroquel 25 mg. q.d.\nThe patient will be maintained with a goal weight of 120 pounds .\nShould his weight fall below 118 pounds , then he has been instructed to hold his Lasix .\nShould his weight increase above 122 pounds , then the patient will take 40 mg. of Lasix a day .\nFOLLOW UP :\nHe will be followed closely by Dr. Sieh and Mizy Flomhemp of the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital Heart Failure Program .\nIn addition he will seen as necessary by Dr. Ri Tlandmaul of the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital Psychiatry Service .\nCC :\nMIZY FLOMHEMP , M.D. , FAIRM OF IJORDCOMPMAC HOSPITAL PONTSONBARRESON HOSPITAL , STEMSTRICTALLE MEDICAL CENTER .\nFA KNOTTIPPSFYFE , M.D. , FAIRM OF IJORDCOMPMAC HOSPITAL PULMONARY ASSOCIATES AKA G SIEH , M.D.\nDICTATING FOR :\nElectronically Signed AKA G SIEH , M.D. 03/09/2002 07:51 _____________________________ AKA G SIEH , M.D.\nTR :\nerp\nDD :\n02/13/2002\nTD :\n02/13/2002 12:39 P 159798\ncc :\nAKA G SIEH , M.D. TOMEDANKELL DIEDREWAND FLOWAYLES , M.D. AMAN SCKOLLMINEVUILLE , M.D. WIN E SHUFFFYFE , M.D.\n[ report_end ]\n"

:\n413-18-46\nADMISSION DATE :\n05/12/2000\nDISCHARGE DATE :\n05/17/2000\nPRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :\nPulmonary edema .\nASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :\nCongestive heart failure , coronary artery disease , mediastinal mass , inferior myocardial infarction , bronchiectasis .\nADVERSE DRUG REACTIONS :\nNone .\nCLINICAL INFECTIONS :\nNone .\nPRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :\nCardiac catheterization .\nASSOCIATED PROCEDURES :\nVQ scan , lower extremities noninvasive Doppler studies and overnight oximetry saturation monitoring .\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\nMr. Bridge is an 81-year-old man with a history of restrictive and obstructive lung disease , dilated cardiomyopathy , inferior myocardial infarction , and anterior mediastinal masses admitted with acute onset of pulmonary edema .\nIn the setting of inadvertently decreasing Lasix from 80 mg. po 40 mg. a day Mr. Bridge had sudden onset dyspnea after approximate day and a half prodrome culminating in severe dyspnea .\nUpon arrival in the Emergency Room Mr. Bridge 's saturations were in the mid 80s and he was promptly rendered more comfortable with high flow oxygen , morphine , and nitrates and intravenous Lasix .\nChest x-ray was relatively unrevealing for interstitial or alveolar edema and with clinical improvement ensued with the immediate therapy in the Emergency Room as noted .\nThe patient denied angina , syncope , preceding worsening orthopnea , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , palpitations , chest pain , hematemesis or melena .\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\nIs notable for an inferior myocardial infarction , restrictive and obstructive lung disease with an FEV1 of .9 and FVC of 1.34 and a moderate at best response to bronchodilators , and a negative sestamibi scan in December , 1999 apart from a severe fixed inferolateral defect , systolic dysfunction with recent echocardiography revealing an LVID of 62 mm. and ejection fraction of 28 percent , moderate mitral regurgitation and mild-to-moderate aortic stenosis with a peak gradient of 33 and a mean gradient of 19 and a valve area of 1.4 cm. squared .\nIn addition , Mr. Bridge has an anterior mediastinal mass 2x2x1.7 cm. by recent computerized tomography scan without surrounding or adjacent adenopathy or parenchymal lung disease apart from bronchiectasis .\nHis cardiomyopathy work up entailed a negative ANA , negative SPEP , UPEP and Benz-Jones proteins , normal ferritin , thyroid stimulating hormone and a recent work up for possible bimomatous associated myasthenia gravis that was negative .\nThe patient lives on Ewi with his wife .\nHe is a non-smoker and drinks rare alcohol .\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\nThe patient was a very pleasant man who appeared his stated age .\nBlood pressure was 155/60 , heart rate 70 with occasional premature ventricular contractions , respirations 14 .\nMr. Bridge was dyspneic speaking in short sentences initially on high flow oxygen .\nJugular venous pressure was 8 with a brisk inspiratory descent .\nThere was no thyromegaly .\nCarotids were 2+ .\nBreath sounds were decreased at the bases only with distant heart sounds and a 2 out of 6 systolic ejection murmur consistent with aortic stenosis with Gallavardin like radiation to the apex .\nAbdomen :\nsoft , nontender with hepatosplenomegaly , or hepatojugular reflex , bruits or pulsations .\nThere was no rash and no edema and the neurological examination was non-focal .\nLABORATORY DATA :\nNotable for a sodium of 145 , potassium 3.6 , BUN 23 , creatinine 1.3 , glucose 104 , hematocrit 42 , white count 8.7 , platelet count 235 and a PT of 12.9 seconds .\nThe urinalysis was negative .\nThe Troponin I was less than .4 and the creatine kinase was 114 .\nChest x-ray revealed moderate cardiomegaly with no clear interstitial or alveolar pulmonary edema and chronic atelectasis and / or scarring at both lung bases .\nThe electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm with premature atrial complexes and right bundle branch block with left anterior hemiblock and old anterior myocardial infarction .\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\nThe patient was admitted to the Hospital and underwent an approximate 1.5 liter diuresis within the first 24 hours with improvement in his symptoms and improvement in his oxygen saturations .\nAfter a long discussion with the patient and his family it was determined that a cardiac catheterization would be prudent .\nPrior to catheterization a VQ scan was performed which revealed a moderate probability for PE with a subsegmental defect in the lingular on the left lung .\nSubsequent lower extremities noninvasive studies and D-dimer test were both negative rendering the probability of acute pulmonary embolism less than 2 percent .\nIt was not felt that the patient would be in need of chronic Coumadin therapy in lieu of this low probability findings in toto .\nCoronary angiography revealed occlusion of the right coronary artery proximally with insignificant plaquing in the left anterior descending artery and circumflex arteries .\nAfter a approximate 3 liter total diuresis the right atrial pressure was 5 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 14 , pulmonary vacuolar resistance 353 and the cardiac output depressed at 2.95 liters per minute , or a cardiac index of 1.7 liters per minute .\nBased upon these findings it was felt that Mr. Bridge most likely has multi-factorial dyspnea owing to both his ventilatory limitation and to a chronic low output state .\nIn Hospital he was seen by both Speech Therapy , physical therapy , and the Uspend Harmemewood Medical Center Congestive Heart Failure Nurse Practitioner Program .\nHis Isordil was increased in Hospital and blood pressure control was relative episodic with systolic pressures ranging between 100 and 160 .\nFuture adjustments will be made at home pending his blood pressure measures .\nAt a goal weight of 142 pounds , Mr. Bridge 's filling pressures appeared ideal with a wedge pressure of 14 and his goal weight range will be between 142 and 44 pounds at home .\nThe patient will be followed by Dr. Fraction within a week of discharge and by Nieie Naebrand Freierm of the Dyathenslycha Medical Center .\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\nImdur 120 mg. PO q.d. Captopril 100mg. PO t.i.d. Lasix 80 mg. PO q.d. Potassium chloride 40 mEq. PO q.d. Coreg 12.5 mg. b.i.d. Cozaar 100 mg. b.i.d. Plavix 75 mg. q.d. Allopurinol 300 mg. q.d.

:\n01/06/94\nDISCHARGE DATE :\n02/17/94\nPRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :\nLeft lung atelectasis with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .\nASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :\nBilateral mastectomy treated with radiation therapy and chemotherapy .\nPRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :\n1/13/94 - flexible bronchoscopy with biopsy , mediastinoscopy and biopsy , left pleural biopsy with excision of redundant left lower lobe emphysematous bullae ( reduction pneumoplasty ) .\nASSOCIATED PROCEDURES :\n2/14/94 - tracheostomy .\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\nMrs. Scarv is a 70 year old female who presented with a two and a half year history of dyspnea and progressively worsening exercise tolerance .\nHer work up included a cardiac catheterization which showed moderate disease and pulmonary function tests which showed an FEV1 of .93 and a DLCO of 5.12 .\nHer x-rays and CT scans showed progressive infiltrate in the left lower lobe .\nShe underwent bronchoscopy on 1/6/94 by the Pulmonary Service .\nShe was admitted post-bronchoscopy because of dyspnea and pain .\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\n( 1 ) hysterectomy .\n( 2 ) colonic polypectomy .\n( 3 ) Bilateral mastectomy treated with radiation therapy and chemotherapy .\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\nprednisone 10 mg q.d. , atenolol 25 mg q.d. , Cytotec 10 mg q.d. , Zantac 150 mg b.i.d.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION :\nrespirations 22 , pulse 96 , systolic pressure 100 , head , eyes , ears , nose , throat examination :\nsclerae nonicteric , PERRL , mucous membranes not cyanotic , neck was supple , carotids were 2+ without bruits .\nThe heart exam revealed a normal Sl and S2 regular rate and rhythm , no murmurs .\nChest :\ndecreased breath sounds at left base , crackles at both bases .\nThe abdomen was soft and non-tender , no masses .\nExtremities :\nslight cyanosis of fingers , no peripheral edema .\nADMISSION LABORATORY DATA :\nRoom air blood gas 54/26/7.48 .\nElectrolytes notable for potassium 4.2 , BUN 28 , creatinine 1.0 , hematocrit 44.4 , white blood count 8.6 , chest X-ray post biopsy :\ntiny left apical pneumothorax without interval change .\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\nEarly in through her hospitalization her electrocardiograms remained unchanged and she ruled out for myocardial infarction by enzymes .\nHer oxygen saturations remained 88-93 percent on four liters of nasal prong oxygen .\nUpon review of her computerized tomography scan there was demonstration of progressive collapse of her left lower lobe with a mass like effect adjacent to the atelectasis .\nThere were two large mediastinal nodes and needle biopsy of the left lobe lesion was non-diagnostic .\nShe was referred for tissue diagnosis and on 1/13/94 was brought to the operating room .\nShe underwent flexible bronchoscopy with mediastinoscopy .\nThese were negative for tumor and a mini left thoracotomy was performed with pleural biopsy .\nIntraoperatively there was a large emphysematous portion of the left lung which prohibited her left lower lobe to fully expand .\nIt was decided to perform reduction pneumoplasty .\nThis proceeded uneventfully .\nShe was extubated and stable with a good airway and good oxygen saturation .\nHowever , upon transferring her from the operating room bed to the stretcher she had an arrest .\nThis appeared to be respiratory in origin .\nShe was placed back on the operating room table and cardiopulmonary resuscitation was begun .\nPressors were given and she quickly responded with a return in blood pressure and heart rate .\nHer blood pressure remained unstable requiring large amounts of pressors .\nX-rays showed no pneumothorax and there was no bleeding from her chest tubes .\nShe was therefore transferred up to the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit .\nEarly in her postoperative course her pulmonary artery pressures were quite high , 70/30 .\nHer wedge pressure was 20 and there were no electrocardiogram changes .\nShe ruled out for myocardial infarction .\nShe developed a picture consistent with right heart failure with pulmonary hypertension and require nitric oxide administration .\nThis improved her right heart function with lower PA pressures .\nShe developed a right pleural effusion which required chest tube placement to remove 1200 ccs of straw-colored fluid .\nShe remained fully ventilated with marginal hemodynamic status on Levophed , dobutamine and nitric oxide .\nUltimately she was able to be weaned off of her Levophed as well as her nitric oxide .\nHowever , because of persistent episodes of right heart failure , dobutamine was started .\nThis improved her cardiac function .\nShe failed to wean from the ventilator and on 2/14/94 was brought to the operating room for a tracheostomy .\nShe had a complicated course from an Infectious Disease standpoint with multiple positive cultures including sputum positive for Pseudomonas cepacia , blood cultures which were positive for Streptococcus milleri .\nThe right pleural fluid was also positive for Streptococcus milleri .\nShe had Citrobacter from her sinuses with evidence of sinusitis .\nShe was treated with multiple courses of broad spectrum antibiotics .\nGiven her protracted postoperative course the family uniformly decided to withdraw all support and initiate comfort measures only .\nThis was discussed with the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit staff .\nHer support was withdrawn and she expired on 2/17/94 at 9:00 p.m.\nThe patient 's family was notified .\nRIELLEUS LARGE , M.D.\nTR :\nsiw / bmot\nDD :\n02/17/94\nTD :\n02/19/94\n[ report_end ]\n"

:\n413-18-46\nADMISSION DATE :\n11/04/2000\nDISCHARGE DATE :\n11/09/2000\nPRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :\nPulmonary edema .\nASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :\nCongestive heart failure , coronary artery disease , mediastinal mass , inferior myocardial infarction , bronchiectasis .\nADVERSE DRUG REACTIONS :\nNone .\nCLINICAL INFECTIONS :\nNone .\nPRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :\nCardiac catheterization .\nASSOCIATED PROCEDURES :\nVQ scan , lower extremities noninvasive Doppler studies and overnight oximetry saturation monitoring .\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\nMr. State is an 81-year-old man with a history of restrictive and obstructive lung disease , dilated cardiomyopathy , inferior myocardial infarction , and anterior mediastinal masses admitted with acute onset of pulmonary edema .\nIn the setting of inadvertently decreasing Lasix from 80 mg. po 40 mg. a day Mr. State had sudden onset dyspnea after approximate day and a half prodrome culminating in severe dyspnea .\nUpon arrival in the Emergency Room Mr. State 's saturations were in the mid 80s and he was promptly rendered more comfortable with high flow oxygen , morphine , and nitrates and intravenous Lasix .\nChest x-ray was relatively unrevealing for interstitial or alveolar edema and with clinical improvement ensued with the immediate therapy in the Emergency Room as noted .\nThe patient denied angina , syncope , preceding worsening orthopnea , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , palpitations , chest pain , hematemesis or melena .\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\nIs notable for an inferior myocardial infarction , restrictive and obstructive lung disease with an FEV1 of .9 and FVC of 1.34 and a moderate at best response to bronchodilators , and a negative sestamibi scan in May , 1999 apart from a severe fixed inferolateral defect , systolic dysfunction with recent echocardiography revealing an LVID of 62 mm. and ejection fraction of 28 percent , moderate mitral regurgitation and mild-to-moderate aortic stenosis with a peak gradient of 33 and a mean gradient of 19 and a valve area of 1.4 cm. squared .\nIn addition , Mr. State has an anterior mediastinal mass 2x2x1.7 cm. by recent computerized tomography scan without surrounding or adjacent adenopathy or parenchymal lung disease apart from bronchiectasis .\nHis cardiomyopathy work up entailed a negative ANA , negative SPEP , UPEP and Benz-Jones proteins , normal ferritin , thyroid stimulating hormone and a recent work up for possible bimomatous associated myasthenia gravis that was negative .\nThe patient lives on Quelene with his wife .\nHe is a non-smoker and drinks rare alcohol .\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\nThe patient was a very pleasant man who appeared his stated age .\nBlood pressure was 155/60 , heart rate 70 with occasional premature ventricular contractions , respirations 14 .\nMr. State was dyspneic speaking in short sentences initially on high flow oxygen .\nJugular venous pressure was 8 with a brisk inspiratory descent .\nThere was no thyromegaly .\nCarotids were 2+ .\nBreath sounds were decreased at the bases only with distant heart sounds and a 2 out of 6 systolic ejection murmur consistent with aortic stenosis with Gallavardin like radiation to the apex .\nAbdomen :\nsoft , nontender with hepatosplenomegaly , or hepatojugular reflex , bruits or pulsations .\nThere was no rash and no edema and the neurological examination was non-focal .\nLABORATORY DATA :\nNotable for a sodium of 145 , potassium 3.6 , BUN 23 , creatinine 1.3 , glucose 104 , hematocrit 42 , white count 8.7 , platelet count 235 and a PT of 12.9 seconds .\nThe urinalysis was negative .\nThe Troponin I was less than .4 and the creatine kinase was 114 .\nChest x-ray revealed moderate cardiomegaly with no clear interstitial or alveolar pulmonary edema and chronic atelectasis and / or scarring at both lung bases .\nThe electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm with premature atrial complexes and right bundle branch block with left anterior hemiblock and old anterior myocardial infarction .\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\nThe patient was admitted to the Hospital and underwent an approximate 1.5 liter diuresis within the first 24 hours with improvement in his symptoms and improvement in his oxygen saturations .\nAfter a long discussion with the patient and his family it was determined that a cardiac catheterization would be prudent .\nPrior to catheterization a VQ scan was performed which revealed a moderate probability for PE with a subsegmental defect in the lingular on the left lung .\nSubsequent lower extremities noninvasive studies and D-dimer test were both negative rendering the probability of acute pulmonary embolism less than 2 percent .\nIt was not felt that the patient would be in need of chronic Coumadin therapy in lieu of this low probability findings in toto .\nCoronary angiography revealed occlusion of the right coronary artery proximally with insignificant plaquing in the left anterior descending artery and circumflex arteries .\nAfter a approximate 3 liter total diuresis the right atrial pressure was 5 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 14 , pulmonary vacuolar resistance 353 and the cardiac output depressed at 2.95 liters per minute , or a cardiac index of 1.7 liters per minute .\nBased upon these findings it was felt that Mr. State most likely has multi-factorial dyspnea owing to both his ventilatory limitation and to a chronic low output state .\nIn Hospital he was seen by both Speech Therapy , physical therapy , and the Uspend Harmemewood Medical Center Congestive Heart Failure Nurse Practitioner Program .\nHis Isordil was increased in Hospital and blood pressure control was relative episodic with systolic pressures ranging between 100 and 160 .\nFuture adjustments will be made at home pending his blood pressure measures .\nAt a goal weight of 142 pounds , Mr. State 's filling pressures appeared ideal with a wedge pressure of 14 and his goal weight range will be between 142 and 44 pounds at home .\nThe patient will be followed by Dr. State within a week of discharge and by Nieie Naebrand Freierm of the Dyathenslycha Medical Center .\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\nImdur 120 mg. PO q.d. Captopril 100mg. PO t.i.d. Lasix 80 mg. PO q.d. Potassium chloride 40 mEq. PO q.d. Coreg 12.5 mg. b.i.d. Cozaar 100 mg. b.i.d. Plavix 75 mg. q.d. Allopurinol 300 mg. q.d. Pulmacort and Serevent inhalers 2 puffs b.i.d. Zocor 20 mg. q.d. Prilosec 20 mg. q.d. Colace 100 mg. t.i.d.\nFOLLOW UP :\nThe patient will see Dr. State , as noted , in follow up .\nAKA G STATE , M.D. CARDIAC TRANSPLANT STEMSTRICTALLE MEDICAL CENTER Electronically Signed AKA G STATE , M.D. 11/17/2000 12:46 _____________________________ ??\nTR :\nrij\nDD :\n11/09/2000\nTD :\n11/14/2000 1:09 P\ncc :\nAKA G STATE , M.D. AMAN SCKOLLMINEVUILLE , M.D. FA HEN KNOTTIPPSFYFE , M.D.\n[ report_end ]\n"

Lockstrip and Rekefreiermin of Neurosurgery .\nThe biopsy was consistent with poorly-differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma , thought to be lung primary , given his chest X-ray findings and smoking history .\nMr. Days subsequently underwent external X-ray therapy to the cervical spine for palliation .\nBone-scan and abdominal computerized tomography scan in October 1993 showed metastatic disease diffusely in the ribs , cervical , and lumbar spine , pelvis , and femur , and metastases to the liver and left adrenal gland .\nIn December 1993 , Mr. Days underwent brachiotherapy of his right upper lobe mass .\nSince that time , his disease has progressed with increasing metastases , at least his pelvis and spine .\nCompression fractures of T12 and L3 were noted in February 1993 .\nMr. Days has also developed a slowly-progressive microcytic anemia , with elevated ferritin and normal B12 and folate levels over the past several months , thought secondary to probable bone marrow involvement of his tumor .\nHe also has apparently developed a mild-moderate persistent leukocytosis over the past 1-2 months , progressively higher neutrophil percentages , but without clear evidence of systemic infection .\nHe also developed rather regular night sweats and fevers , which have been attributed to tumor fevers .\nOn 03/23/94 , Mr. Days presented to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital Emergency Ward for significant sacral decubitus ulcer , which was debrided by Surgery .\nThey recommended a ten-day course of Keflex , which he completed , and b.i.d. wet-to-dry dressing changes .\nHe was PPD-negative , with positive control , back in September 1993 , but that needs to be verified .\nHe received a Pneumovax in 09/93 .\nOn the day of admission , the patient presented with chief complaint of difficulty focusing , walking , and coordinating his movements for the past three days .\nThe patient 's family initially attributed this to overmedicaion with Tylenol III .\nHe denied any nausea , vomiting , unusual fevers or rigors , or acute confusional state .\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\nHis adenocarcinoma is outlined above .\n2. Hypertension , controlled with Nadolol .\n3. Constipation , rather severe , secondary to pain medications .\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\nMS-Contin , 30 mg. , b.i.d. , Nadolol , about 350 mg. , qD , Tylenol No. III , prn , multivitamins , and five stool softeners .\nHis initial blood gas was 47/37/7.47 on room air , with corresponding O2 saturation of 88% .\nHis hematocrit on admission was 28.6 , with a white count of 16.4 , and platelet count of 313 .\nHis differential included 92% polys , 2% bands , one lymphocyte , 4 monocytes , and one eosinophil .\nHis electrolytes were normal , with a sodium of 136 , potassium of 4 , chloride of 102 , bicarbonate was 24.3 , BUN of 24 , and creatinine of 1.1 .\nHis glucose was 166 .\nHis calcium was 9 , his phosphate was 3.4 , his magnesium was 2 , his albumin was 1.8 , his globulin was 4.9 , his LDH was 422 , his SGOT was 43 , his alkaline phosphatase was 424 , his total bilirubin was 1.2 , and direct bilirubin was 0.6 .\nHis chest X-ray on admission compared to January 9 , 1993 :\nThere was increase in volume loss in the right upper lobe .\nThere was mild patchy consolidation consistent with collapse or infection .\nThe right hemidiaphragm was more elevated , and new left-sided metastases were evident .\nHead computerized tomography scan revealed a 1 cm. lesion with surrounding edema and a mild midline cyst in the right occipital lobe , consistent with a metastatic lesion .\nThere may be two additional smaller metastases present .\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\nThis is a 63 year old cachectic , ill-appearing man , in mild respiratory distress .\nHis temperature was 96.4 , his blood pressure was 178/72 , his pulse was 86 , and respirations were 23 .\nHis head , eyes , ears , nose , throat examination was normocephalic , atraumatic , pupils equal , round , reactive to light and accommodation , extra ocular movements were intact , fundi were benign , without papilledema , and no lesions .\nHis oropharynx was benign .\nHis neck was supple , no lymphadenopathy , no jugular venous distention , his carotids were 2+ , without bruits , and his neck was without any masses .\nHis lungs had some right upper lobe wheezing , and rhonchi , with an increased I to E ratio , and expiratory wheezes throughout .\nOn cardiac examination , he was regular rate , normal Sl and S2 , no murmurs or extra heart sounds .\nHis abdomen :\nHe did have bowel sounds , soft , nontender , nondistended , no hepatosplenomegaly .\nExtremities :\nHe had 2+ pulses throughout , no clubbing , cyanosis or edema .\nHis skin :\nHe did have a decubitus ulcer over the sacrum , with no evidence of supra-infection .\nNeurologically , he was alert and oriented times three , with cranial nerves II / XII grossly intact .\nStrength was 5/5 throughout , except for left lower extremity , 4/5 weakness secondary to hip pain .\nHis sensory examination was grossly intact .\nThere were no cerebellar deficits .\nHis reflexes were normal , with downgoing toes bilaterally .\nThe patient 's HOSPITAL COURSE was significant for a chest computerized tomography scan , the impression which showed :\n1. Marked interval progression of metastatic carcinoma of the lung , with chest wall , bony , pulmonary , hepatic , and vertebral metastases , as above .\n2. Interval development of large bilateral pleural effusions , larger on the right .\n3. Compression fracture of T12 vertebral body .\nThis may or may not be pathologic .\nThe patient also had a head computerized tomography scan done , which showed the new metastasis , as mentioned above .\nThe patient was begun on palliative X-ray therapy to the brain and to the right pelvis , where he also has metastases .\nThe patient was started on intravenous Dilantin for seizure prophylaxis and Decadron to prevent cerebral edema in the setting of his radiation treatments .\nAt the time of discharge , the patient will require ten more treatments to the left hip , and nine to the brain .\nAlso of note , the patient was empirically treated during this hospitalization for a possible post-destructive pneumonia .\nThe patient was unable to bring up sputum throughout this hospitalization , with an increased white count , with a left shift on admission , and a chest X-ray , suggestive of a partial collapse of the right upper lobe , and it was thought to empirically treat this patient with antibiotics .\nThe patient 's sacral decubitus was followed throughout by Surgery throughout his hospital course .\nThis hospital course was also significant for having a family meeting on the 15th of April to decide what further treatments would maximize the patient 's quality of life .\nThe patient and the family opted for palliative X-ray therapy and home hospice .\nThe patient was discharged with full knowledge of his grave prognosis , to go home with home hospice .\nDOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :\nDecadron , 2 mg. , po , q6h , to be tapered , Tylenol with Codeine , 1 tablet , po , t.i.d. , Dilantin , 100 mg. , one tablet , po , t.i.d. , Colace , 100 mg. , 1 tablet , po , t.i.d. , Nadolol , 40 mg. , one tablet , po , qD , Carafate , 1 tablet , po , q.i.d. , Dilaudid , 2 mg. , one tablet , po , q3-4h , Dulcolax , 1 tablet , po , qD , MS-Contin , 45 mg. , one tablet , po , qAM , and MS-Contin , 60 mg. , po , qPM , and Amoxicillin , 500 mg. , q.i.d.\nThe patient is to follow up with his primary M.D. , Dr. Besti Kotebreun , and with the Radiation Oncologist , Dr. Skizeis for further X-ray therapy .\nELLOT DAYS , M.D.\nTR :\njmr / bmot\nDD :\n4/16/94\nTD :\n04/17/94\nCC :\nSTAT discharge summary .\nCopy to Dr. Ellot Days .\n[ report_end ]\n"

Mevacor ,\n2. Thyroxine ,\n3. Maxzide .\nSOCIAL HISTORY :\nThe patient is a nondrinker and has a 30 pack year smoking history .\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\nOn physical examination , her vital signs included a temperature of 98.2 , blood pressure of 122/72 , heart rate of 100 , she was in no respiratory distress .\nThe head , eyes , ears , nose , throat examination :\nno scleral icterus .\nHer neck was supple , no adenopathy .\nHer lungs were clear to auscultation and percussion .\nCardiovascular exam :\nregular rate and rhythm .\nThe abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended , obese , well healed incisions , no hepatomegaly .\nLABORATORY DATA :\nsignificant for a hematocrit of 41.8 , white blood count of 7.0 , alkaline phosphatase 133 , total bilirubin 0.6 , direct bilirubin 0.2 , prothrombin time 9.4 , partial thromboplastin time of 25.0 .\nThe admission chest X-ray showed bilateral apical calcific densities that were felt to be consistent with granulomas .\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\nThe patient was admitted and underwent abdominal ultrasound , which was more consistent with a cystic lesion .\nShe also had a magnetic resonance imaging study , which suggested cyst or hemangioma .\nHowever , a computerized tomography scan suggested a solid mass .\nGiven the uncertainty , decision was made to proceed with angiography and exploration to resolve the issue .\nA mesenteric angiogram on 11-27-92 demonstrated no variant anatomy , the venous phase being okay , and no other abnormalities .\nOn 11-28-92 , the patient was brought to the Operating Room where she underwent exploratory laparotomy , total mobilization of the liver with intraoperative ultrasound , resection of fat necrosis of the small bowel mesentery and extensive lysis of adhesions .\nDr. Besti Kotebreun of the Radiology Service performed intraoperative ultrasound , and carefully looked at the entire liver .\nThe mass that had been seen on computerized tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging study proved to be a simple cyst and the rest of the liver looked perfectly normal .\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well and postoperatively had a relatively uneventful course .\nShe was advanced slowly to a regular diet .\nShe did have some persistent fever after the operation with a white blood count in the 14-15,000 range and on the day of discharge , her temperature was in the 101 range .\nShe said that she routinely runs fevers to 101 or 102 at home and has for years , and insisted upon going home .\nThis seemed reasonable given there was no identifiable source for a fever at the time of discharge and she promised close follow up for any problems .\nIt should be noted that her CEA upon admission was 13.9 , indicating that she must have tumor somewhere .\nShe underwent a computerized tomography scan of the chest prior to discharge , which demonstrated no evidence of pulmonary metastases .\nShe also underwent a bone scan by Nuclear Radiology , which demonstrated no findings suggestive of metastatic disease .\nHer pathology report was as follows :\n1. mesenteric nodule was adipose tissue with fibrosis and fat necrosis with no evidence of malignancy ,\n2. peripancreatic mesentery , small bowel biopsy was adipose tissue with fibrosis and fat necrosis with no evidence of malignancy , and\n3. lymph node excision from the periportal region was no evidence of malignancy .\nThe patient was discharged home in stable condition on 12-04-92 .\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\n1.

:\n4-13-93\nDIAGNOSES :\nAortic stenosis .\nASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :\nStenosis of porcine aortic valve with fibrous pannus formation , coronary disease , status post aortic valve replacement and coronary artery bypass grafting , manic depressive disorder , left ventricular dysfunction , question of basilar artery migraine .\nPRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :\n4-2-93 , right and left heart catheterization ( transeptal ) with coronary graft and left ventriculogram .\n4-8-93 , open heart aortic valve replacement and bypass of right coronary artery .\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\nMr. No is a 65 year old male who , in 1986 , had a coronary artery bypass grafting procedure at Noughwell Entanbon Health in Stoningi , Kansas .\nThis involved construction of an internal mammary graft from the left internal mammary artery to the left circumflex , a right internal mammary was anastomosed to the anterior descending and diagonal branch , and a saphenous vein was constructed to the right coronary artery .\nHe did well , but appeared here in 1991 with high grade aortic stenosis , and an ejection fraction of only 23% .\nHe underwent aortic valve replacement with a porcine valve by Dr. G Hemp .\nFollowing this , he was followed closely by Dr. Brown in Na .\nOver the last several months , he has had a recurrence of his congestive heart failure and an echocardiogram performed by Dr. Brown suggested the possibility of the development of aortic stenosis .\nHe also was having some chest tightness , as well as increasing shortness of breath .\nThe patient was referred here for further evaluation .\nMr. No suffers from a bipolar mood disorder , together with hypercholesterolemia and vertebral basilar insufficiency .\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\nOn physical examination , the patient was a well developed , stocky gentleman .\nThe blood pressure was 115/80 , pulse 80 , respirations of 20 , venous pressure elevated at 3 cm above the clavicle at 90 degrees .\nThere were very small , barely palpable carotid pulses .\nThere was dullness at the right base , with a high diaphragm and possibly some fluid .\nThe cardiac examination showed a left ventricular tap at the fifth intercostal space left of the midclavicular line .\nThere was a grade II / VI systolic ejection murmur in the aortic area , no third sound , and paradoxical splitting of the second sound .\nThe liver was not palpable .\nThere were diminished pulses in the legs .\nLABORATORY DATA :\nThe hemoglobin was 14.4 grams percent , white blood count 6,900 , platelet count 125,000 , sodium 137 mEq. per liter , potassium of 4.7 , BUN and creatinine of 23 and 1.3 mg percent .\nThe electrocardiogram showed left ventricular hypertrophy and non-specific ST-T wave changes .\nThe chest film showed massive cardiomegaly with pulmonary venous engorgement .\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\nI indicated to Dr. Brown that I had never seen a situation in which an adult had stenosed aortic valve so rapidly , but certainly his clinical signs suggested aortic stenosis .\nAccordingly , on April 2 , 1993 , he underwent a cardiac catheterization .\nThe study showed that the right internal mammary and left internal mammary artery grafts were patent to the distal vessels .\nThe right saphenous vein graft was also patent , but there was a high grade narrowing in the vessel beyond it .\nUsing transeptal catheterization , he proved to have a 70 mm gradient across the aortic valve and there was no doubt about his aortic stenosis .\nThe left ventricular contraction showed an ejection fraction of around 25% .\nAn attempt at transesophageal echocardiogram was unsuccessful , because the patient was not cooperative .\nOn April 8 , 1993 , Dr. G Hemp performed open heart surgery .\nAt the time of operation , the porcine valve showed a heavy fibrous pannus underneath the valve , and there was what looked like organized thrombus in the leaflets which impeded leaflet movement .\nThere was no calcification of the valve , and no clear evidence of infection .\nI have in fact never seen anything quite like this on an aortic porcine valve .\nThe valve was replaced , and a saphenous vein graft was then constructed from the distal saphenous vein graft that was already in place to the distal right coronary artery beyond the obstruction .\nThe surgery was very difficult , because of a great deal of scarring from the previous operation , but generally things went along smoothly .\nMr. No was on the pump for 2 hours and 25 minutes , with an aortic crossclamp time of 1 hour and 48 minutes .\nPostoperatively , the patient was extubated on the first postoperative day .\nHe had a good deal of pulmonary congestion .\nHe seemed to be doing well until the morning of 4-13-93 when he suddenly became pulseless .\nThere was no evidence of ventricular fibrillation .\nCardiopulmonary resuscitation was immediately undertaken , but was not successful .\nThe patient had his chest opened for any evidence of tamponade and there was no evidence of bleeding .\nThe heart appeared to be flaccid .\nWe really have no good explanation of what this was all about .\nHe was being treated for a possible pneumonia .\nHe did have a good deal of pulmonary congestion , but this occurred suddenly and unexpectedly .\nCardiopulmonary resuscitation efforts were carried out for virtually one hour , but were unsuccessful .\nThe patient was pronounced dead on the morning of 4-13-93 .\nA post mortem examination will be performed .\nTAARNNA LANCELOILNEG , M.D.\nTR :\nra / bmot\nDD :\n4-14-93\nTD :\n04/15/93\nCC :\nDr. Shajen Brown Dr.

Coronary artery disease .\n2. Interstitial lung disease\n3. Mitral regurgitation .\n4. Aortic stenosis .\n5. Systolic hypertension .\n6. Status post myocardial infarction .\n7. Transurethral resection of prostate .\n8. Inguinal hernia repair .\n9. Thoracic shingles .\n10. Cataracts .\n11. History of peptic ulcer disease .\n12. History of gout .\n13. Mediastinal mass on previous CT scans .\nPRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :\n1. Cardiac catheterization .\n2. Echocardiogram .\n3. Sleep study .\n4. Chest CT scan .\nADVERSE DRUG REACTIONS :\nNone .\nCLINICAL INFECTIONS :\nNone .\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\nMr. Warm is an 83 year old man with chronic congestive heart failure , mitral regurgitation and aortic stenosis who was admitted for diagnostic cardiac catheterization .\nOver the last four to five months , Mr. Warm has noted a marked decline in functional capacity with nearly daily PND and orthopnea .\nHe has not experienced recent syncope but did have a syncopal episode in 1 resulting in implantation of a defibrillator .\nAlthough in the past , he has been somewhat ambivalent with respect to cardiac surgery , given the decline in his functional capacity , he agreed to undergo repeat cardiac catheterization with a view towards defining his candidacy for cardiac surgery .\nThe patient lives independently with his wife in Connecticut and continues to be less and less active unfortunately .\nHe has nearly curtailed his trips to a gymnasium for cardiopulmonary exercising .\nHe does not drink alcohol and does not smoke cigarettes .\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION :\nOn examination , the patient was an extraordinarily pleasant man who appeared his stated age .\nHis blood pressure was 110/70 .\nHeart was 82 and regular .\nRespiratory rate was 16 .\nHis jugular venous pressure was not elevated and his carotids were 2+ .\nLungs were notable for adequate air movement with no rales .\nThe first and second heart sounds were physiologically split and the cardiac impulse was rather diffuse and inferiorly displaced .\nThere was an S3 gallop at the apex and a 2/6 murmur of mitral regurgitation at the apex which radiated to the axilla .\nThe abdomen was soft and nontender .\nThere was no organomegaly but modest hepatojugular reflex .\nThe extremities were without edema and were warm and well perfused .\nThe posterior tibialis pulses were intact .\nLABORATORY DATA :\nSodium 140 , potassium 5.0 , BUN 45 , creatinine 1.9 , glucose 90 .\nAlbumin 3.6 , hematocrit 41 , white count 8.6 , platelets 388 and PT 12.6 seconds .\nThe chest X-ray revealed cardiomegaly and no significant congestion .\nThe ECG was paced .\nAn outpatient echocardiogram revealed a left atrium of 45 mms. , an LV of 60 mms. , ejection fraction of 26% , moderate to severe mitral regurgitation by color and spectral Doppler , aortic stenosis with a valve area of .8 cms. squared with a peak gradient of 50 , a mean gradient of 30 , an ejection fraction of 26% with diffuse left ventricular hypokinesis and more severe inferior hypokinesis .\nThere was mild tricuspid insufficiency , an estimated RV peak systolic pressure of 55 and a mild diffuse hypokinesis of the right ventricle .\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\nThe patient was admitted to the hospital following uncomplicated cardiac catheterization that revealed a right atrial pressure of 5 , a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 23 , pulmonary artery pressure of 56/22 with a mean of 36 , a cardiac output of 6.1 liters per minute with a cardiac index of 3.8 liters per minute per meter squared .\nThe aortic valve gradient was approximately 32 mms of Mercury peak with a calculated aortic valve area of 1.1 cms. squared .\nCoronary angiography revealed occlusion of the dominant right coronary artery in the proximal segment with distal reconstitution via left to right collaterals .\nLeft ventriculography revealed a dilated , diffusely and severe hypokinetic left ventricle with the anterior basilar wall best perfused and an ejection fraction of 18% .\nThere was 3+ mitral regurgitation and reflux into the pulmonary veins in the ------ views .\nIn addition , there was a 60% lesion in the left circumflex artery and only minimal irregularities in the left anterior descending itself .\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well apart from a small rise in his creatinine to 2.3 which returned to his baseline value of approximately 1.7 to 1.9 at the time of discharge after holding his diuretics and his vasodilator medications .\nThe patient was seen in consultation by Dr. Win Shufffyfe of the Cardiac Surgery Service and after a long discussion with the patient , Dr. Shufffyfe and the patient 's family , it was decided to defer cardiac surgery likely indefinitely and probably permanently given the patient 's age , co-morbidities , lack of probable benefit with relief of his mitral regurgitation , modest aortic stenosis and relatively modest coronary artery disease .\nWhile in hospital , the patient was seen by Lenni Breutzoln who felt that the incremental benefit from biventricular pacing was likely to be modest .\nThe patient also underwent a sleep study which revealed evidence for fairly advanced and severe obstructive sleep apnea with multiple hypopneas and apneas , mean duration of which was approximately 30 seconds with one episodes of 68 seconds with a desaturation to 71% .\nThe patient was fitted with a CPAP apparatus with titration of 8-12 cms. of water as tolerated as an outpatient .\nIn addition , the patient had oxygen therapy given his prominent desaturation at night .\nAt the time of discharge , the patient 's vasodilator regimen had been winnowed appreciably and he was discharged with a goal weight of 125 lbs .\nHe will be followed both by Dr. Warm closely upon return to his son 's home in Connecticut and by Gie Lung of the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital Heart Failure Partners Home Care Program .\nDISCHARGE ORDERS :\n1. Prn nitroglycerin 0.3 mgs. qd .\n2. Zocor 20 mgs qd .\n3. Serevent 2 puffs bid .\n4. Nexium 20 mgs. qd .\n5. Proscar 5 mgs. qd .\n6. Ambien 10 mgs. qhs prn .\n7. Allopurinol 75 mgs. qd .\n8. Zoloft 25 mgs. qd .\n9. Flovent 110 micrograms bid inhaled .\n10. Lopressor 25 mgs. bid .\n11. KCL 20 meqs. qd .\n12. Lisinopril 2.5 mgs. qd .\n13. Lasix 40 mgs. bid .\n14. Metolazone 2.5 mgs. qd .\n15. Plavix 75 mgs. qd .\n16. Imdur 90 mgs. qd .\nFOLLOW-UP INSTRUCTIONS :\nThe patient will be seen in follow-up by Dr. Warm one week post-discharge and by Gie Lung in the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital Heart Failure Care Program .\nThe patient also will likely relocate to the Du , KS area for the short term .\nCC :\nFairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital Heart Failure Program Stemstrictalle Medical Center Dr. Fa Knottippsfyfe Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital Pulmonary Division AKA G LUNG , M.D.\nDICTATING FOR :\nElectronically Signed AKA G LUNG , M.D. 09/21/2002 16:34 _____________________________ AKA G LUNG , M.D.\nTR :\nql\nDD :\n09/15/2002\nTD :\n09/18/2002 2:40 P 457846\ncc :\nAKA G LUNG , M.D. AMAN SCKOLLMINEVUILLE , M.D. WIN E SHUFFFYFE , M.D.\n[ report_end ]\n"

( interval unspecified ) , Prozac 40 mg. po q.day , Lovestatin 20 mg. po bid , aspirin q. day and supplemental potassium .\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\nRemarkable for an oriented , alert male in no acute distress with decreased breath sounds at the right base consistent with effusion and a 3/6 systolic murmur consistent with aortic stenosis .\nHis pulse exam was intact .\nCardiac catheterization demonstrated elevated right and left-sided filling pressures at rest , with pulmonary hypertension and normal cardiac index .\nThere was severe aortic stenosis of 70 millimeter peak gradient , native three vessel disease with patent left internal mammary artery graft to the left circumflex , dissection of the left main was induced by the catheter tip .\nA patent right internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending artery and diagonal was noted , and a patent saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery was present .\nAlso of note , pulmonary edema was induced by dye and anxiety and treated with Lasix , Morphine , oxygen and nitroglycerin .\nPost-procedure he was admitted to the CCU because of the history of left main dissection .\nHe remained hemodynamically stable but of note , would not tolerate a transesophageal echo because of anxiety-he would not swallow the probe .\nTransthoracic echo demonstrated gradients of 100 peak and 65 mean across the aortic valve and there was mild aortic insufficiency and ejection fraction was noted to be 18% with global hypokinesis .\nThe next several days were remarkable for events in which the patient was quite agitated and was evaluated by Psychiatry and treated with Ativan .\nThe patient was then evaluated by Cardiac Surgery for probable re-do aortic valve replacement and possible re-do coronary artery bypass grafting .\nIn the course of preoperative workup , Mr. Has was evaluated completely by Psychiatry with diagnoses including underlying chronic depression well-controlled on Prozac , underlying organ brain vulnerability of unclear etiology , possibly microvascular infarct , acute paranoid and belligerent behavior , possibly due to medications .\nOn December 12 the patient underwent surgery , including a re-do aortic valve replacement with # 25 St. Jude and re-do coronary artery bypass grafting times one ; saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery as a veno-venous jump graft .\nThe total bypass time :\n2 hours 25 minutes .\nTotal crossclamp time :\n1 hour and 48 minutes .\nThe patient was admitted to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit postoperatively with stable hemodynamics on Lidocaine at one , Dobutamine at 200 and Nipride .\nThe patient was extubated by postoperative day # 1 but was noted to be relatively hypoxemic with high oxygen requirement .\nChest x-ray demonstrating pulmonary edema .\nAggressive diuresis was undertaken and the patient responded , albeit sluggishly .\nIn addition , he remained agitated .\nThis was attributed to mild hypoxia and / or his underlying psychiatric diagnoses and he was treated with Haldol appropriately .\nOn day # 2 the patient continued to diurese and this was maintained with the Lasix/ Mannitol infusion .\nHis urine output remained at 150 to 200 cc. an hour .\nDespite this , his chest x-ray continued to show severe pulmonary edema and the clinical picture correlated .\nHe required anti-hypertensive therapy initially with Nipride which was changed to Hydralazine to avoid shunting .\nHe received several units of packed red blood cells to increase his hematocrit and oncotic pressure .\nVery early in the morning on postoperative day # 3 , the patient became acutely hypoxic after several hours of marginal oxygenation with respiratory rates in the thirties and the patient was urgently intubated , without complication .\nWith positive pressure ventilation and continued diuresis , his arterial blood gases improved .\nThroughout this he remained hemodynamically stable .\nException was a ten beat run of ventricular tachycardia which was thought to be ischemic in origin and treated with nitrates and Lidocaine .\nHis chest x-ray blossomed to demonstrate pulmonary infiltrate and the patient began to produce sputum .\nInfectious Disease consultation was obtained for evaluation of his purulent sputum and the patient was covered with Vancomycin , Ceftazidime and Gentamicin .\nCardiology evaluation commented on the patient 's increasing ventricular ectopy and suggested that these were due to an R and T phenomenon from his pacer in the setting of prolonged QT interval .\nConsequently his Pronestyl was discontinued .\nIn addition , the patient was given magnesium to bring his level above 2 .\nOn the evening of the 18th , the patient continued to remain hemodynamically stable , although his oxygenation was clearly deteriorating and more marginal .\nOn 60% FIO2 his pO2 was 63 .\nIt was increased to 65% with pO2 of 81 .\nAt approximately 7:50 a.m. , house officer was called to the room for blood pressure of 70/40 with falling oxygen saturations .\nThe patient was immediately given 400 mg. of Calcium Chloride i.v. push and ventilator disconnected and the patient manually ventilated .\nWithin one minute , the patient lost his blood pressure and CPR was initiated and code was called .\nThe patient initially continued to have rhythm consistent with EMV and he was bolused with Levophed and given some volume while compressions continued .\nThe patient 's prothrombin time had been 23 early the same morning and tamponade was considered and thoracotomy instruments obtained .\nThe chest was opened partially and through sub-xyphoid area it was determined that there was no evidence of tamponade .\nCompressions were continued and adequate pulse was felt and arterial blood gases demonstrated adequate oxygenation and perfusion .\nThe patient 's rhythm degenerated to ventricular tachycardia and he was shocked , initially without response but after several doses of Epinephine , one-half mg. of Atropine and a bolus of Lidocaine we were able to obtain a blood pressure and rhythm only briefly , and quickly deteriorated back to ventricular fibrillation .\nFurther attempts at resuscitation were unsuccessful and the patient was pronounced dead at 8:30 a.m.\nThe family has been notified and autopsy consent has been obtained .\nLENNI BREUTZOLN , M.D.\nTR :\nbp / bmot\nDD :\n12/17/93\nTD :\n12/18/93\nCC :\nG Hemp , M.D. Taarnna Has , M.D.\n[ report_end ]\n"

treated with Gentamicin and Ancef for 14 days intravenous ( bug being sensitive to these two drugs ) .\nA left pleural effusion developed and this was tapped with ultrasound guidance , and found to be sterile , and without evidence of empyema .\nThe patient is on Ciprofloxacin .\nThe day of discharge is day #3 of 7 , after which antibiotics should be totally discontinued .\nShe has developed bad thrush in this setting , she is not yet able to swallow and so she is on Nystatin swish and spit five times a day .\nShe also gets Peridex to clean out her mouth .\nOnce her liver enzymes are completely normal , a seven day course of Fluconazol may be helpful if the thrush is not spontaneously resolving off of antibiotics .\nShe has been afebrile for greater than 10 days , including several days on oral antibiotics .\nThe patient 's liver enzymes were noted to be elevated mid way through her hospital course , to about three times normal , especially the SGOT and SGPT .\nThese have spontaneously reversed , and are nearly normal at the time of discharge .\nA right upper quadrant ultrasound documented gallstones , without evidence of common bile duct dilatation or active cholecystitis .\nThe exact cause of her liver enzyme elevation is unclear , but we are being careful about administering drugs , which might irritate the liver .\nThe patient had a steady decline in her hematocrit during this hospitalization .\nIron studies are all entirely normal , her anemia is attributed to anemia or chronic disease with hypoproliferation as well as multiple phlebotomies .\nThe plan is to give her folic acid , but not iron .\nThe patient 's potassiums have been repeatedly low and require daily checks and repletion .\nThis is thought due to the extensive course of Gentamicin which she received .\nThis must be carefully checked despite the standing order for potassium .\nThe patient has had low sodiums during this hospitalization .\nThis may due to her central nervous system process or her pulmonary process , with fluids administered as described , she should not have any problems from this .\nHer sodiums were never below 130 .\nShe does well with tube feeds .\nHer tube feeds orders are as follow :\nfull strength Replete with fiber at 70 cc. per hour .\nIn addition , the patient gets 250 cc. of juice ( not water ) three times a day .\nShe also gets Lactinex granules three packages in each bottle of tube feeds .\nShe also gets Metamucil one teaspoon with the first bolus of juice each day .\nPlease note that evaluation by the swallowing therapist , showed that the patient is aspirating at this time , but there is great hope from the nature of her deficit and the good movements of her tongue that normal swallowing should return soon .\nIt is for this reason that she is discharged with an nasogastric tube and that no plans for G tube placement are made at this time .\nShe has a history of of angina without myocardial infarction that has not been worked up .\nShe did have brief chest pain twice during this admission that did not correlate with electrocardiogram changes .\nIn the first week of November , her electrocardiogram showed T wave inversions in the lateral leads , correlating with an increase in the LDH , but not CK .\nThis did not normalize with administration of Isordil and the patient denied chest pain at this time .\nAs of 5/9 , her electrocardiogram had reverted back to normal and there is no evidence of congestive heart failure or continued electrocardiogram changes , and chest pain is absent .\nHer cholesterol was 350 here .\nShe has been off of her hypercholesterol medicines .\nThese can be restarted when it is deemed reasonable , in view of her acute disease and recently elevated liver enzymes .\nNote that the liver enzymes were normal on admission , at which time she was taking all of the above cholesterol medicines .\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\nMetamucil 1 teaspoon q.d. , with first bolus of juice , juice 250 cc. down nasogastric tube t.i.d. , tube feeds as above , Lactinex as above , Tagamet 800 mg. nasogastric tube qhs , Nystatin swish and spit 10 cc. five times a day , Cardizem slow release 90 mg. PO q.d. , Folic Acid 1 mg. PO q.d. , Ciprofloxacin 500 mg. PO b.i.d. , discontinue on 12/10/92 KayCiel 30 mEq. down nasogastric tube q.d. , Peridex 10 cc. swish and spit q.i.d. , Coumadin 4 mg. nasogastric tube on odd days , alternating with 5 mg. nasogastric tube on even days , once daily , Tylenol 650 mg. PO and PR q6hours PRN pain , Nystatin powder to axilla and groin as needed .\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :\nBasilar artery stenosis with basilar thrombosis and \" top of the basilar \" syndrome .\nIncludes recent infarct to pons , mid brain , left thalamus , bilateral temporal lobes and left visual cortex , on Coumadin .\nThe patient is do not resuscitate at family 's request .\nLeft lower lobe pneumonia , resolving now on oral antibiotics .\nGallstones , thought to be inactive .\nImproving liver enzyme elevation .\nAnemia , discharge hematocrit 28 , not iron deficient .\nLow potassium , thought due to Gentamicin .\nLow sodium , responsive to fluid restriction .\nHistory of coronary artery disease .\nThrush .\nHigh cholesterol .\nThe patient needs prothrombin time checked daily , patient needs potassium checked daily , patient needs sodium checked at least every other day .\nDO JOASSCCHIRD , M.D.\nDICTATING FOR :\nNAREA SWALLOW , M.D.\nTR :\nsw / bmot\nDD :\n12/6/92\nTD :\n12/06/92\nCC :\nDr. Namarce May STAT\n[ report_end ]\n"

Hearing of Box Memorial Hospital Nursing Home .\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\nincludes hypertension , cataract od. , urinary incontinence x 2 years and hearing aids .\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY :\nincludes coronary artery bypass grafting in 08/91 in the Ona Hospital .\nApparently the patient has had no angina or congestive heart failure since .\nBilateral knee replacements in 1973 .\nCarpal tunnel releases in 1982 and 1965.\ncholecystectomy in 1967 .\nHysterectomy in 1952 .\nRight heart biopsy in 1990 which was benign .\nFAMILY HISTORY :\nwas noncontributory .\nMEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER :\nincluded Percocet , Tenormin , Xanax , Mevacor and with a history of of Calan , Ornade and Lasix .\nALLERGIES :\nThere were no known drug allergies .\nHABITS :\ndid not include tobacco or alcohol ingestion .\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\nOn physical examination on admission the patient was somnolent but conversant , oriented x 1 only .\nChest was clear .\nHeart had regular rate and rhythm .\nNeck was supple without mass or bruits .\nThe abdomen was soft and nontender .\nCalves were nontender .\nOn neuro exam the patient was somnolent but readily arousable to conversation .\nShe looked at the examiner and carried an appropriate conversation but only for seconds at a time .\nHer face was strong and symmetric .\nShe felt pin prick and light touch bilaterally to the face symmetrically .\nHer extra ocular movements were full without nystagmus .\nShe sees light only od. which is chronic .\nShe reads large print os.\nHer tongue was midline and her palate elevated symmetrically .\nShe could not maintain her arms long enough to detect drift .\nShe also lifted both legs and flexes at the knees .\nHer grip is 5/5 bilaterally .\nAnkle dorsiflexion and plantar flexion were 5/5 bilaterally .\nLABORATORY DATA :\nOn admission her labs. were notable for a hematocrit of 41.9 , white blood count 11.1 , MCV 87 , sodium 142 , potassium 3.0 , chloride 101 , bicarb. 29.3 , BUN 13 , creatinine 0.9 and sugar 134 .\nA head CT performed on 01/10/92 revealed no cerebrovascular accident and no evidence of acute blood .\nMRA / MRI revealed a left internal carotid artery aneurysm about 7 mm. in width .\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\nThe patient was admitted to Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital where a four vessel cerebral angiogram was performed on 01/13/92 .\nThis revealed a lobulated aneurysm at the p. comm. origin on the left .\nThis was a left internal carotid artery aneurysm .\nThe internal carotid arteries and middle cerebral artery showed irregularity of caliber probably due to atherosclerosis .\nAfter much discussion , endovascular treatment with GD coils were recommended .\nThe patient underwent coiling on 01/14/92 .\nThis showed that 60-70% of the distal aneurysm was obliterated by the coils .\nOne coil protruded into the lumen of the left internal carotid artery aneurysm .\nIt was thought that the risk of subarachnoid hemorrhage was low but still substantial from the untreated proximal lobe .\nAlso the risk of ischemia or infarct from the internal carotid artery coil could lead to thromboembolism .\nTherefore the lowest overall risk was thought to be a craniotomy to obliterate the aneurysm and possibly remove the protruding coil .\nTherefore after discussion in detail with Sister Rora Dose , a left pterional craniotomy was performed on 01/15/92 .\nAt this time it was noted that the left internal carotid artery aneurysm was mostly within the cavernous sinus and the extracavernous portion was extremely atherosclerotic .\nTherefore no clip was possible and the patient underwent a muslin wrapping of the aneurysm .\nThe patient postoperatively was able to open her eyes to voice and name .\nHer pupils were equal and reactive and she was able to localize with the left upper extremity as well as raise the right upper extremity above the bed .\nHer consciousness as well as her strength improved gradually and the patient was referred for rehabilitation at a chronic care center .\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :\nsubarachnoid hemorrhage and left internal carotid artery aneurysm .\nPROCEDURES :\nOn 01/13/92 four vessel cerebral angiogram .\n01/14/92 embolization of the left internal carotid artery aneurysm .\n01/15/92 left pterional craniotomy for left internal carotid artery aneurysm with exploration and muslin wrap of the aneurysm .\nCOMPLICATIONS :\nThere were no noted complications .\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\ninclude heparin 5000 units sq. b.i.d. , MOM 30 cc. p.o. q. hs. , Dulcolax 10 mg. p.o. b.i.d. p.r.n. , Tenormin 50 mg. p.o. b.i.d. , Calan 60 mg. p.o. t.i.d. , Omeprazole 20 mg. p.o.q.d. , Lasix 20 mg. p.o. b.i.d. , potassium chloride 40 mEq. p.o. b.i.d. , Dilantin 200 mg. p.o. b.i.d. , Lotrimin to groin t.i.d. , Droperidol .625 mg. po 1.25 mg. m. q. 6 p.r.n. , Dulcolax 1 pr. q.d. p.r.n. , Tylenol 975 mg. q. 6 p.r.n. and CZI sliding scale b.i.d.\nThe patient has increased her p.o. intake however given her uncertain p.o. intake the patient was not started on a p.o. antidiabetic regimen .\nTherefore we suggest a fasting blood sugar q.d. for several days after discharge .\nIf the fasting blood sugar remains greater than 160 we would have the local M.D. consider starting the patient on p.o. medications such as Glyburide .\nThis may include Tolinase at 100 mg. p.o. q. am .\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE :\nStable .\nFOLLOW UP :\nThe patient is to follow up with Dr. Telshey Peg .\nTOMEDANKELL WIRE , M.D. dictating for TELSHEY PEG , M.D.\nTR :\nth / bmot\nDD :\n02-01-92\nTD :\n02/01/92\nCC :\n[ report_end ]\n"

postoperative myocardial infarction , and thrombocytopenia .\nSPECIAL PROCEDURES AND OPERATIONS :\nFebruary 6 , 1994 , rigid bronchoscopy with biopsy and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy .\nASSOCIATED PROCEDURES :\nOn February 10 , 1994 , flexible bronchoscopy , flexible esophagoscopy , rigid bronchoscopy , transhiatal esophagectomy ( partial ) , substernal gastric interposition and jejunostomy .\nMultiple bronchoscopies , chest tube insertion .\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\nThe patient was a 71 year old white female with a history of carcinoid lung cancer who presented for evaluation of a tracheoesophageal fistula .\nThe patient was initially diagnosed in 1978 with atypical small cell carcinoma of the lung and treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy until 1980 .\nShe did well for approximately twelve years until she was diagnosed with carcinoid cancer of the same right upper lobe .\nThis may have been the initial primary cancer although it is unclear at present .\nBronchoscopy at that time showed an endobronchial tumor of the right upper lobe bronchus and it was felt to be unresectable .\nShe underwent four treatments of brachytherapy in March through May of 1993 .\nShe had been doing reasonably well until December of 1993 when she presented with persistent and worsening cough and near strangulation on attempts at eating solids or drinking liquids .\nA bronchoscopy showed a tracheoesophageal fistula with an opening into the trachea above the carina and no tumor in the right upper lobe .\nShe has been on total parenteral nutrition and has been nothing by mouth since then .\nA barium swallow prior to admission showed the presence of a tracheoesophageal fistula with entrance into the right mainstem bronchus below the carina .\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\nBronchitis , asthma , carcinoid cancer , no history of coronary artery disease or cerebrovascular accident .\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY :\nThe patient is status post appendectomy , hysterectomy and right salpingo-oophorectomy , bladder suspension and a tumor removal from the right neck .\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\nCefuroxime 1.5 grams intravenously q8h , Solu-Medrol 62.5 mg intravenously q8h , Ventolin metered dose inhaler , 2 puffs PO q.i.d. , Pepcid 20 mg intravenously b.i.d.\nALLERGIES :\nThe patient is allergic to penicillin , morphine , codeine .\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\nThe patient is a pleasant white female in no acute distress .\nShe is afebrile with stable vital signs .\nThe head , eyes , ears , nose , throat examination was unremarkable .\nNeck shows a well healed low collar incision without adenopathy or bruit .\nThe lungs showed mild inspiratory wheeze and moderate expiratory wheezes .\nBreath sounds are present bilaterally .\nCardiovascular exam :\nregular rate and rhythm .\nThe abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended .\nExtremities :\nno clubbing , cyanosis or edema .\nThe rectal examination is guaiac negative with a minimal amount of stool .\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\nThe patient was admitted on February 5 , 1994 and had a central venous line placed in her right subclavian .\nThe patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 6 , 1994 where she underwent rigid and flexible bronchoscopy and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy .\nFindings included necrotic debris in the distal trachea at the carina and right mainstem bronchus .\nEsophageal mucosa was visible through the trachea .\nHer steroids were weaned and the patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 10 , 1994 where she underwent once again flexible bronchoscopy and flexible esophagoscopy , as well as rigid bronchoscopy .\nShe then had a transhiatal esophagectomy which was partial , and a substernal gastric interposition as well as a jejunostomy .\nThe pathology report suggested that the area was involved with radiation esophagitis and focal ulceration .\nShe remained ventilator dependent postoperatively and was taken to the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit .\nThe patient was maintained on triple antibiotics which included Vancomycin , ceftazidime and Gentamicin .\nOn postoperative day two , she had an electroencephalogram which showed no evidence of seizure activity but some generalized slowing .\nThe patient was seen in consultation by the Neurology Service for her apparent postoperative encephalopathy and episodes of shaking .\nAn endoscopy was also performed on postoperative day two which showed clean anastomosis .\nShe received multiple bronchoscopies for pulmonary toilet .\nThe patient was maintained on tube feedings and the ventilator .\nA repeat echocardiogram on February 18 showed no significant change of her previous echocardiogram on February 11 , which showed only a small pericardial effusion .\nA pelvic and abdominal computerized tomography scan on February 18 also showed no evidence of a focal collection or abscess .\nShe remained intermittently febrile despite numerous antibiotics .\nHer

:\n7/2/93\nPRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :\ncoronary artery disease .\nASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :\ncongestive heart failure , atrial fibrillation , H / O protein reaction , elevated cholesterol , obesity , sleep apnea , chronic lung disease and pleural effusions .\nPRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :\n6/24/93 , coronary artery bypass surgery X 2 .\nOTHER PROCEDURES :\n6/24/93 , left internal mammary artery to anterior descending X 1 .\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\nDigoxin .25 mg. po q d , Captopril 12.5 mg. po bid , Coumadin 2.5 mg. po q PM , Lasix 20 mg. po q d , potassium chloride 20 mEq , PO q d , iron sulfate 300 mg. po q d , X 1 month , aspirin 80 mg. po q d , Verapamil 80 mg. po tid .\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE :\nstable .\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\nPauci May is a sixty three year old patient referred by Dr. Laymie Aslinke for significant coronary artery disease .\nHe developed acute pulmonary edema on May 27 , 1993 , and was admitted to Sonpathcermu Jords Hospital , and found to be in rapid atrial fibrillation .\nHe denied any angina .\nHe had a gaited cardiac blood pool scan that showed an ejection fraction of 31% .\nHis pulmonary function tests showed FEV1 of 2.1 , and he was found to have intermittent obstructive sleep apnea .\nAn echocardiogram showed a dilated left atrium with mitral anular calcification .\nHe was discharged home but readmitted on May 21 with recurrent congestive heart failure .\nA Thallium Stress Test showed equivocal ST segment changes with fixed apical and inferior defects .\nHis coronary risk factors include cigarette smoking , obesity , a family history of coronary disease , and elevated serum cholesterol .\nHe also has a history of atrial fibrillation with sinus pauses during sleep apnea .\nOn June 4 , 1993 , he underwent cardiac catheterization .\nHe was found to have an occluded right coronary artery , 70% distal left main lesion , 80% proximal ramus lesion , and his left ventricular ejection shows preserved function except for akinesis of the inferior wall .\nHis ejection fraction was 50% , a carotid duplex study showed plaqueing but no critical lesions .\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\nAs above .\nSOCIAL HISTORY :\nHe has a wife Pandeprob and lives in Ashing .\nHe did smoke up to three pack per day .\nHe has three children .\nHe is retired .\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\nSix foot , 250 pounds .\nHe is a well appearing male , in no distress .\nHIs blood pressure was 140/70 , pulse 80 and irregular .\nHis neck veins were not distended .\nHis carotids showed bilateral bruits .\nHis lungs are clear .\nHis cardiac exam shows a 1/6 systolic ejection murmur .\nHis abdomen is obese , but benign .\nHis peripheral pulses are intact .\nHe has no peripheral edema .\nHis Neurological exam is nonfocal .\nLABORATORY DATA :\nsodium 140 , potassium 4.4 , chloride 104 , CO2 30 , calcium 9.3 , phosphorous 1.2 , BUN 9 , creatinine 1.3 , glucose 183 .\nUric acid 8.4 , bilirubin 0.7 , alkaline phosphatase 72 , amylase 46 , SGOT 20 , and his Digoxin level was 1.0 .\nhematocrit 38% , white blood cell count 7700 , MCV 86 , PT and PTT were normal .\nurinalysis was unremarkable .\nHis chest X-ray was normal with bilateral pleural thickening .\nHis electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation .\nThere were nonspecific ST and T wave changes .\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\nThe patient was admitted to Hellworthston Hospital .\nThere , he stabilized , and was seen in consultation by Cardiology and Anesthesiology .\nThere was concern over his sleep apnea , but he appeared to have primarily cardiac disease and therefore because of the left main stenosis , it was reasonable to proceed .\nOn June 24 , 1993 , Dr. Lenni Breutzoln performed triple coronary bypass surgery .\nHe placed a left internal mammary artery graft to the left anterior descending , single saphenous vein to the posterior descending artery with 170 cc. per minute flow and a single saphenous vein to the circumflex with 140 cc. per minute flow .\nHe weaned easily off cardiopulmonary bypass .\nHe had no hemodynamic difficulties .\nHe was able to wean from the ventilator , but he did have marginal oxygenation throughout .\nHe did revert back to atrial fibrillation .\nHe was extubated within forty eight hours .\nHe was transferred out of the Surgical Intensive Care Unit on June 26 .\nHe reverted back to atrial fibrillation that required Digoxin , and Verapamil to control .\nHe could not be converted back to normal sinus rhythm even with a trial of Quinaglute .\nHe also had anemia and he was seen in consultation by the Nutrition Service .\nHe was advised to have an ideal body weight of 178 pounds , and clearly a 2300 calorie diet was appropriate for him .\nWeight reduction would be important in the long term management of his coronary disease .\nHe was treated with Digoxin and Diuretics along with Ace inhibitors because of his depressed left ventricular function .\nHe was able to ambulate although somewhat slowly because of his rapid atrial fibrillation .\nIt was considered to obtain a pulmonary consultation on a formal basis , but it was then felt that he would do better by healing fully from his surgery , because he really had little in the way of pulmonary complications , despite the history of sleep apnea of an obstructive basis .\nPrimary in his long term management is cardiac rehabilitation with weight reduction .\nHe will be followed closely in 23 Hwy , Hamp by Dr. Laymie Aslinke .\nMAY A , M.D.\nTR :\not / bmot\nDD :\n7/1/93\nTD :\n07/02/93\nCC :\nDr. Daizsmaellille Dr. Lenni Breutzoln , Reos 0\n[ report_end ]\n"

:\n9-19-93\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\nThe patient is a 78 year old male with dysphagia who was found to have endoscopically two nodules in the esophagus , biopsy of which showed small cell carcinoma .\nRecently , he has complained of pain radiating down the left leg and work up had shown absent left knee jerk .\nPlain films of the lumbosacral spine showed some scoliosis with blastic changes around L3 .\nThe bone marrow biopsy was positive for metastatic carcinoma .\nThe patient was admitted for further evaluation .\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\nOn physical examination on admission , the blood pressure was 164/90 , pulse 88 , respirations 20 .\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\nNote :\npast medical history included hypertension , treated by Cardizem .\nThe patient also has a history of degenerative joint disease .\nHe had an episode of chest pain but ruled out for myocardial infarction .\nOn physical examination , vital signs were as above .\nThe head , eyes , ears , nose , throat examination was within normal limits , neck was supple , lungs were clear to auscultation and percussion .\nThe abdomen was benign with no masses felt .\nCardiovascular exam :\ngrade I / VI systolic ejection murmur at the right upper sternal border , single S1 , S2 .\nThe rectal examination showed guaiac negative stool .\nExtremities :\nwithin normal limits .\nThe neurological examination showed an absent left knee jerk .\nCerebellar function was normal .\nLABORATORY DATA :\nsignificant for a sodium of 140 , potassium 3.9 , chloride 105 , BUN and creatinine 21 and 1.5 , LDH 732 , SGOT 84 , alkaline phosphatase 145 , bilirubin 0.3 , calcium 10 , albumen 4.1 , globulin 3.9 , white blood count 8.9 , hematocrit 43.3 , 62 polys , 26 lymphs , 9 monos , 1 eo , 2 basos , prothrombin time 9.8/10.0 , partial thromboplastin time 31.8 .\nDuring this admission , an upper gastrointestinal and small bowel follow-through on 9-5-93 was normal .\nA computerized tomography scan of the chest showed diffuse esophageal wall thickening , dilatation of the esophagus with air fluid levels and no evidence of mediastinitis and some air space disease in a medial segment of the right middle lobe .\nBone scan showed multiple regions of abnormally increased activity in the dorsal spine and lumbar vertebrae , as well as a right anterior fourth rib , consistent with metastases .\nA magnetic resonance imaging study of the brain showed no definite evidence of metastatic deposits .\nThere was microvascular disease .\nA computerized tomography scan of the abdomen showed multiple low density lesions within the liver , consistent with metastatic disease and a 1.5 centimeter low thoracic paraesophageal lymph node , pathological .\nSpleen , pancreas and kidneys were within normal limits .\nA magnetic resonance imaging study of the brain showed no metastases .\nThe magnetic resonance imaging study of the spine showed extensive bony metastases .\nThere was no evidence of spinal cord compression on magnetic resonance imaging study , though there was evidence of pressure on the L4 nerve root .\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\nThe patient was admitted and he was started on chemotherapy and radiation therapy to the L4 spine region .\nThe first course of chemotherapy was given from 8-19-93 through 8-21-93 .\nThis was VP-16 150 mg daily x three and cisplatin 60 mg daily x three with Zofran 11 mg on three occasions as an antiemetic and each dose of cisplatin was preceded by 12.5 grams of Decadron .\nThe chemotherapy was well tolerated but did result in febrile neutropenia .\nGranulocyte colony stimulating factor was added .\nThus white blood count dropped to 0.6 minimum on 8-27 , with platelet count of 63,000 but with granulocyte colony stimulating factor support and antibiotics for febrile neutropenia , white blood count recovered .\nActually the lowest white blood count was 0.5 on 8-31-93 .\nOn that occasion , platelet count was as low as 17,000 .\nBy 9-8-93 , the white blood count was back up to 16.2 .\nThe patient 's course was complicated by severe pain and intractable nausea and vomiting and severe substernal pain .\nHe is on MS Contin and also on Duragesic patch .\nHe continued to have nausea and vomiting .\nThe patient was seen in consultation by Dr. Signs of Gastroenterology .\nEventually , a PICC line was inserted and he was given central total parenteral nutrition because of severe anorexia during radiation therapy .\nTwo weeks passed without a bowel movement because of the lack of intake and eventually that resolved .\nIt was felt that endoscopy would be of value .\nA central venous line was placed on 8-29-93 .\nAfter neutropenia resolved by 9-2-93 with white blood count rising to 2.2 and platelet count to 28,000 , endoscopy became feasible .\nThis was done on 9-4-93 and there were inflammatory exudates , ulcerations , and granulation tissue in the middle and distal third of the esophagus , but the tumor polypoid masses had completely disappeared .\nCytologic brushings of the ulcerated areas were positive for cancer cells but deep biopsies were negative .\nThe patient was treated with fluconazole in case there was any Monilia , although biopsy did not confirm the presence of Monilia .\nGradually during the hospitalization , the sternal pain improved , as did the pain in the left hip and the patient became able to ambulate somewhat .\nHe was making progress and accordingly , a second course of chemotherapy was given at lower dose .\nHe received VP-16 100 mg daily x three , 9-12 , 9-13 and 9-14-93 , and cisplatin 40 mg daily x three on that same date with Zofran 10 mg.\nThe only problem was some recurrent nausea .\nThe radiation therapy was finally finished on the day of discharge , 9-19-93 , at which point the patient was able to take fluids and food but was still occasionally vomiting .\nHis white blood count was in the range of 53,000 because Neupogen had been started with his second cycle of chemotherapy and will be continued until it is clear that he has passed the nadir of any neutropenia to be expected from this cycle of chemotherapy .\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :\n1. metastatic small cell cancer of esophageal origin to liver and bone ,\n2. severe ulcerations of the esophagus at sites of prior tumor ,\n3. intractable nausea and vomiting ,\n4. pain syndrome , largely resolved ,\n5. hypertension .\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\nPrilosec 20 mg PO qa.m. , Senokot one to two tablets PO q.day as needed , Colace 100 mg PO b.i.d. , Microstatin 100,000 units swish and swallow four times a day , Darvocet-N 100 1 PO q4h prn pain , Cardizem 240 mg PO q.day , Neupogen 300 mg subcutaneously q.day x ten days , depending on trend of blood counts , Compazine 10 mg PO q6h prn nausea , PICC line

Status post permanent pacemaker implantation in 1984 ( Medtronic model # 8422 VVI ) ,\n4. no known drug allergies .\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\nOn physical examination on admission , the patient appeared well .\nThe rhythm was atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response between 100 and 130 beats per minute .\nThe lungs were clear .\nThe Cardiovascular exam showed an irregular rhythm .\nThe first and second heart sounds were otherwise normal .\nThere were no murmurs or gallops .\nLABORATORY DATA :\nOn admission , the electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation with intermittent ventricular pacing , and a left bundle branch block pattern at baseline .\nThe baseline creatinine was 1.8 .\nThe hematocrit was 44 and the prothrombin time was 12.7 on the evening of admission .\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\nThe patient was taken to the Cardiac Electrophysiology Laboratory on 4-24-93 .\nThe baseline rhythm was documented to be atrial fibrillation with a mean ventricular response rate of 125 beats per minute .\nA total of two radio frequency applications ( 60 seconds , 55 volts , 33 watts ) was applied with the ablation catheter and a typical HIS position ( right anteroseptal ) resulting in complete heart block with an underlying ventricular rhythm resulting from pacing at 50 beats per minute .\nNo spontaneous rhythm was demonstrated after pacemaker programming down to a rate of 30 beats per minute .\nAfter fifteen minutes of observation , the rhythm remained ventricular paced at 50 beats per minute with a threshold of 2.5 volts at 0.1 milliseconds pulse width .\nThe pacemaker was reprogrammed to a rate of 70 beats per minute at 2.5 volts and 0.5 milliseconds pulse width .\nSensitivity was reprogrammed to 5 volts .\nThe patient tolerated this procedure without difficulty .\nHe was transferred back to the Scst.ontdrain University Medical Center Step Down Unit in satisfactory condition .\nThere were no groin complications related to his venous puncture site .\nHe was maintained on interim heparin and his Coumadin was reinitiated .\nThroughout the remainder of his hospitalization he remained in atrial fibrillation with complete heart block , as expected , with ventricular demand pacing at 70 beats per minute .\nThe final program settings of his Medtronic # 8422 VVI pacemaker were 70 beats per minute , pulse width 0.5 milliseconds , amplitude 2.5 volts , sensitivity 5 millivolts , refractory period 325 milliseconds .\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :\n1. Drug resistance atrial fibrillation ,\n2. radio frequency ablation of HIS bundle ,\n3. pacemaker dependence ,\n4. peripheral vascular disease , as above .\nSPECIAL PROCEDURES AND OPERATIONS :\n1. Radio frequency ablation of HIS bundle with resultant complete AV block and pacemaker dependence , 4-24-93 ,\n2. transthoracic echocardiogram , 4-25-93 .\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\nCoumadin 5 mg qhs five days a week omitting Sunday and Wednesday .\nCOMPLICATIONS :\nNone .\nDISPOSITION :\nThe patient will follow up with his local cardiologist at Da Valley Health , Dr. Ri Roleubbreun .\nHe will be seen by Dr. Shuff in the future as necessary .\nESTIMATED DISABILITY AND PROBABLE DURATION :\nIndefinite .\nCA WAR , M.D.\nDICTATING FOR :\nRI WAR , M.D.\nTR :\nmw / bmot\nDD :\n4-25-93\nTD :\n04/25/93\nCC :\n[ report_end ]\n"

:\n126-10-12\nADMISSION DATE :\n06/13/94\nDISCHARGE DATE :\n07/01/94\nPRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :\nCardiogenic shock .\nOTHER DIAGNOSES :\n1 ) Coronary artery disease .\n2 ) Atrial fibrillation .\n3 ) Acute renal failure .\n4 ) Crohn 's disease .\nPRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :\n6/13/94 :\nIntra-aortic balloon placement .\n6/17/94 :\nIntubation .\nHemodialysis .\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\nThis is a 56-year-old man with a history of ischemic disease transferred to the FIH for further care for cardiogenic shock .\nMr. Given had an anterior myocardial infarction in 1981 .\nHe had inferior myocardial infarction in February 1992 .\nHis course was complicated at that time by hypertension and an echocardiogram showed an LV ejection fraction of 0.10 to 0.15 .\nIn August , 1993 he had an out of hospital cardiac arrest .\nHe rule in for another myocardial infarction at that time .\nHe was transferred to the FIH where he underwent a work up of both his arrhythmia and his heart failure .\nAn automatic implantable defibrillator was placed .\nHe was thought to be a good candidate for a transplant at that time as coronary arteriography showed diffuse disease in the LAD and right coronary arteries as well as a proximal circumflex stenosis .\nBecause of the diffuse nature of the disease and the left ventricular dysfunction , Mr. Given was thought not to be a revascularization candidate and was listed for a transplant .\nMr. Given waited as an outpatient for the availability of a donor heart .\nHe was admitted to the hospital in late April with multiple episodes of bloody diarrhea .\nColonoscopy demonstrated severe Crohn 's disease with sparing of the rectum .\nA perirectal fistula was seen .\nTreatment with IV corticosteroids led to improvement and Mr. Given was discharged from the hospital ten days ago .\nOn the evening of April 22nd , Mr. Given developed progressively worsening dyspnea .\nHe presented to the Iming Medical Center emergency room on the morning of April 22nd with hypertension and dyspnea .\nHe was given intravenous fluid to support his blood pressure and developed pulmonary edema and was intubated .\nHypertension continued and an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed .\nHe is now being transferred to the FIH for further treatment .\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\nPhysical examination on transfer was remarkable for a blood pressure of 80/56 and a heart rate of 124 .\nHis CVP was 16 .\nHe was on the balloon pump at the time .\nHis chest was clear anteriorly .\nHis cardiac exam was remarkable for a summation gallop .\nNo murmur was auscultated but the high heart rate did diminish the possibility of this .\nHis abdomen was soft and he had no extremity edema .\nHis feet were cool but there were pedal pulses bilaterally .\nLABORATORY DATA :\nAdmission laboratory studies included a hematocrit of 34.3 and a white count of 25,700 .\nThe sodium was 126 , the BUN 80 and a creatinine of 4.6 .\nElectrocardiogram revealed a sinus tachycardia with an intraventricular conduction defect .\nThere were inferior Q waves consistent with an old infarct .\nThe chest x-ray revealed mild pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly .\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\nMr. Given was admitted to the hospital and it was hoped that his end organ dysfunction would improve with a period of ballooning and improved perfusion such as to allow transplantation to eventually take place .\nHe was maintained on Levophed as a vasopressor as well as dopamine and dobutamine .\nIt was noted that his intra-aortic balloon pump was only a 30 ml pump , and on the day after admission , Mr. Given was taken to the catheterization laboratory where this was exchanged for a 40 ml pump .\nAfter replacement of the intra-aortic balloon pump , Mr. Given remained critically ill , although there was some improvement in his augmented diastolic pressure .\nHe did develop atrial fibrillation , however , which led to hemodynamic decompensation with a wedge pressure of 32 and a cardiac index of 1.6 .\nIt was hoped that with continued inotropic support this would improve .\nHe also remained intubated .\nMr. Given was seen by Dr. Farstshuff of the GI Service for advice regarding his Crohn 's disease .\nAll of these issues , including his acute renal failure , were thought to be contraindications to transplantation .\nAs Mr. Given did not have any bowel sounds , he did have to remain on nasogastric suction .\nHe was seen in consultation by Dr. Needs of the Renal Unit .\nDr. Needs felt that the patient had had ischemic acute tubular necrosis and that we could continue to administer diuretics in a an effort to take off volume , but that we did have to allow time to pass in order to see improvement .\nProcainamide was begun in an effort to convert Mr. Given to sinus rhythm from atrial fibrillation .\nInitially he was in and out of sinus rhythm , but paroxysmal atrial fibrillation did occur frequently .\nAs Mr. Given 's renal function did not improve , he was begun on continuous venovenous hemodialysis .\nThis resulted in a reasonable clearance of creatinine .\nHe was able to get some fluid off as well .\nWith getting some volume off , the patient 's ventilation improved , as did many of his other metabolic parameters .\nHis cardiac index had also improved with this to 2.7 , although he was on dobutamine as well .\nOn 6/19 an effort was made to attempt to wean the intra-aortic balloon pump .\nWith a decrease in the counterpulsation ration , he developed atrial flutter with a fall in blood pressure and cardiac index .\nThe balloon pump was restored .\nHe was continued on this as well as on dobutamine and amrinone support .\nHe continued on hemodialysis , but had little urine output .\nSupportive care continued .\nUnfortunately , the white blood count began rising , raising the possibility of sepsis .\nBroad spectrum antibiotics to cover potential sources in the gastrointestinal tract were begun and ciprofloxacin was added .\nMr. Given 's blood pressure appeared to stabilize .\nAnother effort was made on 6/22 to attempt to wean the balloon , but this led to an increase in his wedge pressure and a fall in his arterial pressure , and this was stopped and he was restored to full counterpulsation .\nHe had been able to be transiently extubated after dialysis had reduced his lung water , but he had to be reintubated on 6/24 .\nHemodialysis continued with maintenance of reasonable metabolic parameters .\nHe did develop worsening metabolic acidosis .\nHis hemodialysis was adjusted in an effort to resolve this .\nHe continued on vancomycin , ciprofloxacin , Zosyn , and fluconazole antibiotics .\nAnother effort was made to attempt to wean the intra-aortic balloon pump on 6/26 .\nThis resulted in a fall in his cardiac index , but his blood pressure and wedge pressure were stable .\nHe did have runs of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia .\nOn 6/29 Mr. Given began developing periods of hypotension .\nThe patient stated that he did not want to be reintubated , as it became quite clear that he would not be a transplant candidate .\nHe began having multiple runs of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia .\nThe patient and his significant friend , Incloztaua , had a long discussion with his physicians and they felt that , given the futility of his situation , supportive care should be ended .\nIndicative of this , Mr. Given took his oxygen mask and demanded that it not be replaced .\nHe developed progressive hypotension and was pronounced dead early on the morning of 7/1 .\nCAGHALA R.

2+ pulses throughout bilaterally without bruits .\nLABORATORY DATA :\nOn admission , chest x-ray revealed two nodular opacities that were projected over the left lung , one over the anterior aspect of the left fourth rib and the other over the interspace between the anterior sixth and seventh ribs .\nThese were also seen on previous film .\nThese were felt to be consistent with a granulomata .\nThere was also a bipolar pacemaker present .\nCreatinine was 0.9 , BUN 13 , hematocrit was 40 .\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\nThe patient was admitted to the hospital on 01/15/93 and on the following day was taken to the operating room where he underwent a saphenous coronary artery bypass graft to the diagonal , circumflex marginal artery , and acute marginal coronary artery and left internal mammary artery graft to the left anterior descending coronary artery .\nThis operation was performed by Dr. Chitllik Kote .\nIntraoperative findings were as follows :\nThe pericardium was opened to reveal a heart that appeared essentially normal .\nThe diagonal coronary artery was isolated , opened and probed with a 1.5 millimeter probe .\nThe circumflex marginal artery was small and only took a 1 millimeter probe tightly .\nThe first main was anastomosed side to side to the diagonal and end to end to the circumflex marginal artery .\nThe left anterior descending artery was then isolated , opened , probed with a 1.5 millimeter probe and anastomosed to the left internal mammary artery .\nThe acute marginal branch of the right coronary artery was isolated , opened and probed with a 1.5 millimeter probe tightly and a second main was anastomosed to this .\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well and was transported to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit in stable condition on nitroglycerin at 50 mcg. per minute Levophed at 4 mcg. per minute and Lidocaine at 1 mg. r minute .\nThe patient was extubated on postoperative day # 1 and transported to the routine postoperative care floor on postoperative day # 2 in good condition .\nThe only issue of note during the patient 's SICU course was a small right apical pneumothorax which disappeared on repeat chest x-ray .\nThe other issue was that the Pacer Lab was consulted for an atrial sensing problem .\nThe pace setter 2022 Synchrony II was interrogated .\nIt was found to have inadequate atrial sensing , even post re-programming to the maximum sensitivity at 0.5 millivolts .\nNo changes with unipolar ring or tip .\nThe V threshhold was changed from 0.6 millivolts/ 2.0 millivolts to 0.8 millivolts/ 4.0 millivolts .\nThe V sensor was changed from 4 millivolts to 2 millivolts .\nIt was felt that the atrial pacing would improve as the edema resolved .\nMeanwhile , the patient was AV paced using the epicardial wires .\nWhile on the routine postoperative care floor the patient continued to progress well .\nOf note , he developed a small right apical pneumothorax which was followed on serial films and found to be stable and was not causing the patient any respiratory distress .\nAlso , the Pacer Service re-programmed the patient 's cardiac pacer to a VVIR mode with a rate of 60 beats per minute , an AV delay of 175 , a maximum track of 120 .\nThe ventricular pulse configuration was bipolar with a V-pulse width of .8 , a V-pulse amplitude of 4.0 , a V-sense configuration of bipolar , a V-sensitivity of 2.0 and a V-refractory of 250 .\nThe atrial pulse configuration was bipolar with an A-pulse width of .4 , an A-pulse amplitude of 2.5 , an A-sensed configuration that was bipolar , an A-sensitivity that was .5 , an A-refractory that was 325 .\nBlanking was set at 38 , AV-safety option was on enable , PVC options were on , PMT options were off , a rate respiratory AV-delay was on enable , a magnet was temporary off .\nThe threshhold was 2.0 .\nThe measured average sensor was 2.0 .\nThe slope was 8 .\nThe maximum sensory rate was 110 .\nThe reaction time was fast , the recovery time was medium .\nThe patient continued to progress well and was ultimately discharged on 01/22/93 in good condition .\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :\nCoronary artery disease .\nPRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :\nSaphenous coronary artery bypass graft to the diagonal , circumflex marginal artery and acute marginal coronary artery and left internal mammary artery graft to the left anterior descending artery on 01/17/93 by Dr. Chitllik Kote .\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE :\nGood .\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\nLasix 40 mg. po q.day , Ecotrin 325 mg. po q.day , Iron 325 mg. po tid , Folate 1 mg. po q.day , Lopid 600 mg. po bid , Questran 1 scoop bid .\nDISPOSITION :\nThe patient was discharged to home .\nHe will followup with Dr. Chitllik Kote , Cardiothoracic Surgery ; with Dr. Naka Jesc of Cardiology ; and with Dr. Tomedankell Flowayles of Sephsandpot Center in Chandbay .\nLEEN PAUGBREUN , M.D.\nDICTATING FOR :\nCHITLLIK KOTE , M.D.\nTR :\nxd / bmot\nDD :\n01/24/93\nTD :\n01/26/93\nCC :\nChitllik Kote , M.D. Naka Jesc , M.D. Tomedankell Flowayles , M.D. T.

:\n10-24-93\nDISCHARGE DATE :\n11-2-93\nPRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :\nNon-Q wave myocardial infarction .\nASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :\nStatus post anterior myocardial infarction in 05-93 , status post percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of left anterior descending in 05-93 , hypertension , diabetes mellitus .\nPRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :\nCoronary angiography , exercise tolerance test with Thallium .\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\nMetoprolol 50 mg PO bid , Isordil 20 mg PO tid , enteric coated aspirin 1 PO qd .\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\nThe patient is a 65 year old Portuguese male with a history of an anterior myocardial infarction i May 1993 and is status post a percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the LAD who presented on 10-24-93 with crushing substernal chest pain and shortness of breath .\nHe had no prior cardiac history until May 1993 when on 5-24 he had crushing chest pain which radiated to his left arm .\nHe was found at that time to have 3-4 mm ST segment elevations in V1 through V4 at Pre Health .\nThe patient was transferred to Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital and had 4-7 mm ST segment elevations across the precordium with Q's in V1 and V2 , 2 mm ST elevation in AVL , and 1-2 mm reciprocal ST depression in II , III , and F.\nOn physical examination at that time he had bright red blood per rectum and therefore lysis was deferred and he was taken directly to the cardiac catheterization lab .\nThe cardiac catheterization results at that time revealed a right atrial pressure of 7 , pulmonary artery pressure of 29/16 , RV 33/8 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 16 .\nHe had a 95% proximal left anterior descending lesion which was PTCA 'd to a residual of 30% and an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed .\nHe also had some mild to moderate disease at the OM1 noted at that time .\nThe patient was transferred to the Cardiac Care Unit where he had a peak CPK of 5,042 and 26.7% MB's .\nHis intra-aortic balloon pump was weaned without problems .\nHe had hypotension with beta blockers and therefore they were not started .\nOn day six , an echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 44% with anterior akinesis and septal hypokinesis .\nOn day nine , he had a low level exercise tolerance test with Thallium which was positive for 2.5 mm horizontal depressions in II , III , and AVF , and 1.5 mm downsloping ST depressions in V5 and V6 , as well as some anteroseptal redistribution on Thallium .\nTherefore , he went to repeat cardiac catheterization which revealed that the left anterior descending site was patent and revealed a distal PDA lesion and a circumflex lesion after the OM .\nThe patient was discharged to home and is supposed to follow up with Dr. Shuffburle of Gastroenterology for work up of his bright red blood per rectum and is supposed to follow up with Dr. Amesin of Cardiology and Dr. Shuffpasc of Dingclearf Alllirefaith Memorial Hospital .\nHowever , he did not keep any of these appointments .\nHe went home and did not take any of his medications and smoked and drank heavily throughout the several months .\nOn the a.m. of 10-24-93 , the patient developed crushing substernal chest pain and shortness of breath .\nHe came to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital Emergency Ward where he was noted to be ashen and diaphoretic .\nHe was treated with oxygen , aspirin , five sublingual nitroglycerins , heparin , and was eventually made pain free with that regimen .\nCARDIAC RISK FACTORS :\nHis cardiac risk factors included hypertension , diabetes mellitus , hypercholesterolemia , cigarette smoking , and a positive family history .\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\nHis past medical history included hypertension and non-insulin diabetes mellitus which is diet controlled .\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY :\nHis past surgical history had included gastric ulcer surgery and appendectomy .\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\nOn admission , he was on Isordil 10 tid and enteric coated aspirin , but he was not taking either of these medications .\nHABITS :\nThe patient smokes one pack per day and has a history of heavy alcohol use .\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\nThe physical examination on admission revealed a blood pressure of 110/70 , a heart rate of 66 , respirations of 24 , temperature of 98 .\nThe HEENT exam revealed the extra ocular movements intact .\nThe pupils equal , round , reactive to light .\nThe oropharynx was clear and the fundi were normal .\nThere were no hypertensive or diabetic changes .\nThe neck was suppled , with no lymphadenopathy and no jugular venous distention .\nThe carotids were 1+ without bruits .\nThe heart was regular rate and rhythm , S4 , S1 , S2 , with a I / VI systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border .\nThe lungs were clear , except for a few dry crackles bibasilarly .\nThe abdomen revealed a midline scar and a right lower quadrant scar , and it was soft and nontender wit positive bowel sounds .\nThe liver edge was 2 cm below the right costal margin , but smooth and nontender .\nThere was no splenomegaly .\nThe femoral pulses were diminished .\nHe had bilateral intertrigo in his femoral region as well as his axillae .\nThe extremities revealed no clubbing , cyanosis or edema .\nThe pulses were 1+ bilaterally .\nThe skin exam revealed changes consistent with vitiligo .\nThe rectal examination was guaiac negative .\nLABORATORY DATA :\nThe laboratory data revealed normal electrolytes , BUN and creatinine , normal liver function tests , a first CPK of 140 , and a hematocrit of 43.1 .\nThe portable chest X-ray showed clear lungs , slight enlarged heart , and a mildly elevated hemidiaphragm .\nThe electrocardiogram was normal sinus rhythm at 81 , with normal intervals and normal axis , had poor R-wave progression consistent with an old anterior myocardial infarction , had flipped T-waves in V1 through V5 , which were of no significant change since his last EKG on 5-25-93 .\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\nThe patient was admitted to the Step Down Unit for a rule out MI protocol .\nHe was treated with aspirin , heparin , and intravenous nitroglycerin .\nNo beta blockers was started because of his history of hypertension with beta blockers and because his blood pressure of only 110/70 .\nThe patient ruled in for myocardial infarction with a peak CPK of 219 and 20.9% MB fraction .\nThis was a non-Q wave myocardial infarction as there were no diagnostic electrocardiogram changes .\non 10-27-93 , the patient went to the cath lab which revealed a small nondominant right coronary artery without any lesions , a restenosis of the proximal left anterior descending lesion that had been PTCA 'd , a lesion in the first OM , and a moderately severe left circumflex lesion after the OM3 .\nThe left ventriculogram revealed an akinetic anterolateral and apical ventricle .\nGiven the results of this cardiac catheterization , which were not significantly changed from his previous cardiac catheterization prior to the PTCA , it was elected to attempt to medically manage the patient .\nHe was ambulated progressively on the floor .\nA beta blocker was started with Metoprolol initially at 25 mg PO bid and eventually increased to 50 mg PO bid .\nThe patient ambulated extensively on the FIH 20 floor each day without any episodes of chest pain or shortness of breath .\nOn 11-2-93 , the patient underwent a low level treadmill exercise test with Thallium imaging .\nThis treadmill test was done on medications , including beta blockers , in hopes to assess an amount of ischemia on treatment .\nThe patient was able to exercise for approximately nine minutes on a modified Bruce protocol , however , he did not reach his predicted maximal heart rate while he was on the beta blockade .\nThere were no diagnostic electrocardiogram changes during the treadmill exercise test , although he did have 0.5 to 1 mm ST depression in II , III , and AVF .\nThe study was halted for shortness of breath and there was no chest pain .\nThallium images revealed a moderate sized region of ischemic but viable myocardium involving the anteroseptal and lateral segments of the left ventricle .\nThere was also some evidence of left ventricular dysfunction during the test .\nThese images were essentially unchanged compared with the previous Thallium images in May 1993 .\nAfter extensive discussion between myself , Dr. Amesin , and Dr. Scgach , it was elected to discharge the patient to home with medical management .\nThe patient was extremely reluctant to undergo surgery , although he understands that this may become necessary in the future .\nDr. Amesin had a long discussion with the patient 's daughters revolving primarily around issues of the patient 's compliance .\nPreviously he had not taken any of his medicines and smoked heavily on the outside and not kept any of his appointments .\nThe importance of quitting smoking as well as continuing to follow his medical regimen was emphasized to the daughter and to the patient .\nShe will be actively involved in encouraging the patient to comply with this medical regimen and also to follow up with Dr. Amesin as well as Dr. Lfsquarc on the outside .\nThe patient remained guaiac negative throughout the entire hospitalization .\nDespite being on heparin for a short time , his hematocrit remained very stable with only a small dip after the catheterization was done .\nHe will need to be followed up as an out patient for guaiac positive stools and possibly worked up for this in the future .\nCAGHALA UINTEELE , M.D.\nTR :\nyf / bmot\nDD

DATE :\n09/29/93\nPRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :\nLeft internal carotid occlusion .\nASSOCIATED DIAGNOSES :\ncoronary artery disease , insulin dependent diabetes mellitus , status post right above-knee amputation and status post left great toe amputation .\nPRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :\nleft carotid endarterectomy 09/22/93 .\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\nThis 75 year old Hispanic male with insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and peripheral vascular disease , status post a middle cerebral artery cerebrovascular accident was admitted for left carotid endarterectomy .\nHis history of present illness began with a worsening left toe ulcer in 06/93 resulting in a left great toe amputation .\nApproximately two days following discharge , his family members noted that his behavior had changed , including personality changes , confusion and self-neglect\nOn 08/07/93 he was admitted to Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital where an magnetic resonance imaging study confirmed a 4 centimeter infarct in the left frontoparietal and temporal areas without evidence of bleeding .\nHe was noted to have calcified vertebral artery .\nHis infarct was felt to be consistent with a superior middle cerebral infarct .\nAt that time Holter monitor showed no abnormalities .\nAn echocardiogram was reportedly normal and an MRI angiogram documented a 95% occlusion of his left coronary artery .\nHe was sent home on Coumadin for follow up with Vascular Surgery for carotid endarterectomy and presented on 09/18/93 for his procedure .\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\ninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus for five years and peripheral vascular disease , status post a right above knee amputation in 1987 for gangrene and status post his left great toe amputation in 06/93 .\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\nIncluded Coumadin 2.5 mg. g with 5 mg. d , Lasix 40 mg. q.day and NPH insulin 55 units sub-cu. qam .\nSUBSTANCE HISTORY :\nNotable for remote alcohol abuse .\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\nHe was reportedly well-appearing with a temperature of 99.7 , blood pressure of 140/86 , heart rate of 92 and respiratory rate of 20 .\nHEENT was normocephalic , atraumatic with a supple neck and no lymphadenopathy .\nLungs demonstrated bilateral bibasilar crackles .\nCardiac exam :\nregular rate and rhythm , S1 , S2 , and a systolic flow murmur was noted .\nHis abdomen was reportedly soft , nontender with normoactive bowel sounds .\nExtremities showed no evidence of clubbing , cyanosis or edema .\nPulses were markedly diminished bilaterally .\nRadially the left carotid pulse was felt to be stronger than the right and the left dorsalis pedis pulse was 1+ .\nBilateral carotid bruits were noted as well .\nNeurologic exam was notable for disorientation to time , increased tone in his left upper extremity and slight right facial droop and a markedly decreased gag on the right side .\nThe deep tendon reflexes were present and symmetric .\nLABORATORY DATA :\nsodium of 138 , potassium of 4.4 , chloride of 101 , bicarbonate 30.9 , BUN of 16 , creatinine 1.0 , glucose of 283 , hematocrit of 41.5 , white blood count of 6.7 with 50% polys , 29% lymphs .\nPlatelet count of 224,000 , prothrombin time of 12.2 , partial thromboplastin time of 30.9 .\nHis admission electrocardiogram was normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 90 with PR interval of .14 , QRS of .08 with ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities consistent with apical lateral subendocardial ischemia relative to the August 7 , 1993 electrocardiogram .\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\nMr. Iron was admitted to the Ossontonville Milt Ywestmeadtl Marlenc Hospital where he underwent preoperative evaluation .\nA medical consultation was obtained for his abnormal electrocardiogram with recommendation for a Persantine Thallium study .\nOn 09/21/93 he underwent a Persantine Thallium study with no complaints of chest pain .\nHis heart rate went from 70 to 84 , 63% maximal predicted heart rate .\nBlood pressure was unchanged .\nAfter Persantine infusion , electrocardiogram showed 1 to 2 millimeter downsloping ST-depressions , V4 through V6 , 0.5 to 1 millimeter ST-depressions in 1 , 2 and AVF .\nThe changes returned to baseline after intravenous Aminophylline was administered .\nThe test was felt to be positive for ischemia and Thallium images demonstrated a small amount of inferoapical ischemia as well as left ventricular dilatation upon exercise and normal pulmonary uptake .\nOn 09/22/93 he underwent an uncomplicated left carotid endarterectomy and was treated intraoperatively with nitroglycerin .\nOn 09/23 he was noted to have asymptomatic ST-depressions of 1 to 2 millimeters in leads 2 , 3 , F , V2 through V6 .\nHe ruled out for a myocardial infarction with serial CPK 's on nitro paste , oxygen , Metoprolol and aspirin .\nThe ST-depressions largely resolved .\nOn 09/26/93 he was transferred to the Medical Service for further evaluation of his cardiovascular status .\nA Cardiology consult was obtained with recommendations for maximization of medical regimen and deferring cardiac catheterization at that time .\nHis course was also remarkable for adjustments in his insulin regimen with difficult control of his glucose and postoperative anemia treated with iron sulfate .\nOn 09/29/93 he remained hemodynamically stable with his left carotid endarterectomy site healing well .\nHe was discharged home to follow up with Dr. Tiffill Sapnins of Dingclearf Alllirefaith Memorial Hospital and Dr. Dwainco Rallsversgach of Cardiology .\nHe was to follow up as well in the H Health Network for postoperative care .\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\nEcotrin 1 po q.day , Isordil 20 mg. po tid , Lopressor 50 mg. po bid , NPH insulin 55 units subcutaneously q.am and Iron sulfate 325 mg. po bid

:\n8/9/93\nPRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :\nAcute myocardial infarction .\nASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :\nLower gastrointestinal bleed .\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\nThe patient is a 65 year old Portuguese male whose cardiac risk factors include hypertension , diabetes mellitus , hypercholesterolemia , tobacco use and a positive family history .\nHe was a previously healthy male who reports a pattern of intermittent chest pain during the week prior to admission .\nOn the night prior to admission he was awakened from sleep with severe substernal chest pain radiating to the left arm , accompanied by back pain at about 9:30 p.m.\nHe was taken to the Pre Health emergency room and at about 2:45 a.m. on 7/30 an electrocardiogram demonstrated 3 to 4 mm ST elevations in leads V1 to V4 and 2 mm ST elevations in lead V5 .\nHe was treated with nitroglycerin , antacids and intravenous morphine .\nHe was transferred to Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital hemodynamically stable .\nHE arrived in the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital emergency room with a blood pressure of 120/80 , heart rate 90 .\nAn electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm at a rate of 94 with premature ventricular contractions .\nIt was notable for 4 to 7 mm ST elevations throughout the precordium with Qs in leads V1 and V2 , with 2 mm ST elevations in aVL and 1 to 2 mm reciprocal ST depressions in leads II , III and aVF .\nThe initial physical examination was notable for bright red blood per rectum .\nHe was treated with intravenous nitroglycerin , intravenous morphine , aspirin , Ativan and a LIdocaine drip .\nBecause of the noted bright red blood per rectum , thrombolysis was deferred and the patient was taken immediately to the cardiac catheterization laboratory .\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\nNotable only for surgical repair of an ulcer and a remote appendectomy .\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\nNone\nALLERGIES :\nPenicillin , which gives him a rash .\nSOCIAL HISTORY :\nHis habits include smoking one pack per day for many years and moderate to heavy alcohol use .\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\nThe patient was an elderly appearing male in no significant distress .\nHis pulse was 84 and regular , blood pressure 114/70 .\nThe head , eyes , ears , nose , throat examination was unremarkable .\nThe neck was supple .\nThe carotids were of normal amplitude without bruits .\nOn cardiac examination he had a nonpalpable left ventricular impulse , a quiet S1 and S2 , no murmurs .\nHe had an audible S3 and a jugular venous pressure of 8 .\nOn lung examination he had rales one third up bilaterally .\nHis abdomen was soft and nontender with no hepatosplenomegaly , no guarding and no rebound .\nOn rectal examination he had bright red blood in the vault without any stool .\nHis extremities were without clubbing , cyanosis or edema .\nLABORATORY DATA :\nThe hematocrit was 44.9 , white blood count 14.3 , platelet count 301,000 , sodium 138 , potassium 3.7 , chloride 102 , CO2 27.4 , BUN 12 , creatinine 1.0 , glucose 147 .\nThe electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 94 , left atrial enlargement , ST elevations in V4 through V6 , I and aVL , consistent with acute anterolateral myocardial infarction with Q waves in V1 to V3 and reciprocal ST depressions in leads II , III and aFV .\nThe chest X-ray showed a normal cardiac and mediastinal silhouette , mild pulmonary edema and an elevated left hemidiaphragm .\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\nThe patient was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory where hemodynamic measurements included a right atrial pressure of 7 , a right ventricular pressure of 33/8 , pulmonary artery pressure 29/16 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 16 .\nHe had a proximal 95% left anterior descending lesion and mild to moderate disease in the first obtuse marginal .\nThe left anterior descending lesion was angioplastied to a 30% residual stenosis .\nAn intra-aortic balloon pump was placed in the left groin prophylactically .\nThe patient was hemodynamically stable throughout and was transferred to the MICU .\nOn hospital day 2 the intra-aortic balloon pump was weaned .\nThe patient was intermittently agitated while on the intra-aortic balloon pump and was treated presumptively for alcohol withdrawal with Serax .\nThe Lidocaine drip was rapidly weaned as well .\nOn the third hospital day the intra-aortic balloon pump was removed .\nThe intravenous nitroglycerin and heparin were weaned off .\nAfter removal of the intra-aortic balloon pump the patient was noticeably less agitated .\nOn the fourth hospital day an attempt was made to transfer the patient to the floor .\nHowever , after a single dose of 25 mg of po metoprolol , the patient 's blood pressure dropped to the 60/40 range and he was therefore kept in the MICU .\nThe peak CPK level was on the second hospital day and was 5,042 with 26.7% MB fraction .\nOn the fifth hospital day the patient was considered stable for transfer to the floor .\nOnce on the floor the patient had no recurrent chest pain .\nAn echocardiogram was performed on the sixth hospital day which demonstrated an ejection fraction of 44% .\nOn transfer to the medical floor the patient was noted to have guaiac negative stool .\nHe was evaluated by the GI Service who felt that , given the patient 's course , he could undergo flexible sigmoidoscopy electively at some point in the future .\nThe patient underwent exercise stress testing with thallium on the ninth hospital day .\nHe exercised for 7 minutes and 30 seconds , achieving 80% of the maximal heart rate on the modified Bruce protocol .\nHe did not have chest pain .\nThere were ST and T wave abnormalities with 2.5 mm horizontal depressions at the beginning of 3 minutes of exercise , which persisted into recovery .\nThe thallium images showed fixed anterior and septal wall defects without any definite evidence of redistribution .\nBased on this data , on the tenth hospital day the patient underwent repeat cardiac catheterization which demonstrated a patent left anterior descending site , a circumflex lesion after the third obtuse marginal , and a distal posterior descending artery lesion with a tight stenosis and a small vessel .\nThese findings were considered not to be hemodynamically significant and the patient was therefore to be discharged on medical therapy including nitrates and aspirin .\nBecause of his persistently marginal blood pressure at 100/70 , an ACE inhibitor which was tried briefly and a beta blockers were elected not to be continued .\nThe patient was discharged in stable condition on the eleventh hospital day .\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSES :\n1. Acute myocardial infarction .\n2. Lower gastrointestinal bleed .\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\nEnteric coated aspirin , 1 po qd ; Isordil , 10 mg po tid ; Serax , 15 mg qhs x five days ; Carafate , 1 gram po bid ; Lotrimin cream 1% to affected areas on the skin ; multivitamins , 1 qd .\nPROCEDURES :\n1. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty .\n2. Repeat cardiac catheterization .\n3. Exercise stress testing with thallium .\nCOMPLICATIONS :\nNone .\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE :\nStable .\nDISPOSITION :\nThe patient is to follow up with Dr. Ra Shuffburle in GI Clinic in one week , Dr. Telshey Patient in Cardiology Clinic in one week , Dr. ______________ in Lifairg Louen Likison Hospital Medical Center in three weeks .\nESTIMATED DISABILITY :\nOne month , to be determined by follow up with Dr. Dose .\nCA SHUFF , M.D.\nTR :\nwa / bmot\nDD :\n8/9/93\nTD :\n08/10/93\nCC :\n[ report_end ]\n"

Grade II / V laceration of liver ,\n2. rupture of left renal vein ,\n3. tear of transverse mesocolon ,\n4. serosal tear of transverse colon ,\n5. blunt fracture of the neck of the pancreas .\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS AND HOSPITAL COURSE :\nMr. Breath was a 32 year old previously healthy unbelted driver whose car was hit at high speed by a vehicle driven by an intoxicated driver .\nThe patient was ejected and his vehicle rolled over , possibly over him .\nHe was found awake at the scene , complaining of abdominal pain .\nHe had a blood pressure of 60 systolic upon arrival of the Giles Min General Hospital crew .\nIntravenous fluids was given .\nHe was paralyzed and endotracheally intubated , and a 14 gauge catheter was inserted in his left chest because of poor breath sounds .\nHe arrived at the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital at 02:30 with a blood pressure of 86 and a heart rate of 170 .\nLarge bore cannulas were inserted into the femoral veins , bilateral chest tubes were placed , and his blood pressure rose to 110 systolic after two liters of crystalloid .\nHe had an ecchymosis over the medial right costal margin and his abdomen was distended .\nHis hematocrit was 36 , and creatinine 1.6 .\nThe abdominal tap was grossly positive for blood .\nHis blood pressure fell to 60 systolic as he was being transferred to the computerized tomography scan table ; the scan was aborted and he was taken directly to the operating room at 03:00 .\nAt laparotomy , there was a liter of blood in the peritoneal cavity .\nThere was a class II laceration of the left liver at the falciform ligament which was actively bleeding , a tear of the transverse mesocolon from its base to the bowel wall with active bleeding , a 7 cm serosal tear of the adjacent transverse colon , and a large central retroperitoneal hematoma .\nControl of the super-celiac aorta was obtained , and both left and right sided \" Mattox \" maneuvers were performed .\nThe retroperitoneum was opened , with vigorous bleeding resulting .\nThis was controlled , necessitating ten minutes of aortic clamping and found to have originated from the rupture of the left renal vein one centimeter from its junction with the inferior vena cava .\nThe vein was divided and suture ligated .\nBleeding from the liver was controlled with sutures .\nThe tears in the transverse mesocolon and colon serosa were repaired .\nThe examination of the remainder of the abdominal contents revealed no other injury ; in particular , the entire anterior surface and the immediately juxtaduodenal posterior surface of the pancreas were normal .\nThe patient was now very stable , and he was taken to the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit .\nThe patient had received ten units of packed red blood cells , five units of fresh frozen plasma , seven units of platelets , and nine liters of Ringer 's lactate .\nAn intracranial pressure monitoring bolt had been placed by the Neurosurgery Service staff during the laparotomy .\nIntracranial pressures were normal .\nThat day , cranial computerized tomography scan and cervical spine films were normal .\nAn arch aortogram was normal .\nOver the ensuing twenty-four hours , bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray with poor oxygenation and labile blood pressure requiring PA line guided fluid and pressors developed .\nThe patient had a large fluid requirement with total body capillary leak , decreasing SVR , oliguria unresponsive to Lasix / Mannitol accompanied by a rise in creatinine to 3.2 , worsening ARDS , a rise in temperature to 103 , and a serum amylase of 1265 .\nHe was returned to the operating room on July 4 .\nThree liters of clear green fluid were found in the abdominal cavity .\nExploration of the pancreas revealed a posterior fracture a the superior mesenteric vessels .\nBecause of the intense diffuse inflammatory reaction that had already set in , it was decided that neither distal pancreatic resection nor Roux-en-Y drainage was feasible .\nFour large flat Jackson-Pratt drains were placed , and gastrostomy , jejunostomy , and cholecystostomy tubes , as well as a right subclavian Quinton catheter were placed .\nThe patient 's hemodynamics had improved markedly with the evacuation of the peritoneal pancreatic fluid , so that he was no longer on pressors .\nHowever , upon transfer from the operating room table to the RICU bed , he suffered a cardiac arrest , which upon investigation was a primary respiratory arrest ; the initial arterial blood gas was 32/88/6.92 .\nHe was successfully resuscitated after fifteen minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation and he was taken to the RICU .\nContinuous venovenous hemodialysis was started on July 5 , and continued for most of the remainder of the patient 's course .\nVancomycin , Flagyl , and Aztreonam were given for gram negative Coccobacilli ( later identified as Bacteroides ) that had grown in his blood cultures and gram negative rods ( Enterobacter ) in his peritoneal fluid .\nHe was kept sedated and paralyzed because of his severe adult respiratory distress syndrome .\nTotal parenteral nutrition was started on July 5 .\nInitial improvement was followed by recurrence of low SVR , high cardiac output , ongoing acidosis , requiring norepinephrine infusion in the 30 to 40 mcg per minute range ; drainage from the Jackson-Pratt drains were minimal despite irrigation and manipulation .\nThe patient was returned to the operating room on July 10 , where several loculated thin fluid collections were drained and obviously necrotic tissue was debrided .\nIt was decided to place more drains and pack the lesser sac with Adaptic and laparotomy pads .\nThe abdomen was left open , with the wound margins connected by a sheet of Marlex mesh to prevent evisceration .\nHe was returned to the operating room on July 12 , 13 , 16 , 19 , 21 , and 23 for packing change , irrigation and debridement .\nTracheostomy was also performed on July 17 .\nThere was severe diffuse peritonitis with intense inflammation , infection , and patchy necrosis of peritoneal surfaces and of the distal pancreas .\nThe subsequent overall course was a slow downhill one , with ongoing extreme hyperdynamic ( cardiac output 12 to 15 liters per minute ) and catabolic state .\nOn July 26 , abdominal irrigation and debridement was performed in the RICU ; this was repeated daily for the next three days .\nOn July 29 , the septic state with low SVR and acidosis accelerated beyond the control of maximal support .\nHis blood pressure gradually fell , and he died early on July 30 , 1993 .\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :\nSevere blunt abdominal trauma with rupture of liver , left renal vein , pancreas , and transverse mesocolon .\nSPECIAL PROCEDURES AND OPERATIONS :\n1. 7-2-93 , emergency room exploratory laparotomy , repair of liver laceration , repair of torn transverse mesocolon , repair of serosal tear of transverse colon , ligation and division of ruptured left renal vein , exploration of pancreas ,\n2. 7-4-93 , exploratory laparotomy , irrigation and debridement , pancreatic drainage placement , gastrostomy tube , jejunostomy , cholecystostomy , placement of right subclavian Quinton catheter ,\n3. 7-10-93 , abdominal irrigation and debridement and packing of pancreas ,\n4. 7-12-93 , 7-14 , 7-20 , 7-22 , and 7-24 , were the same as 7-10-93 , and 7-17 was the same with the addition of tracheostomy were same as 7-10 ,\nCOMPLICATIONS :\nSevere necrotizing pancreatitis and diffuse peritonitis .\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\nN / A.\nDOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :\nN / A.\nESTIMATED DISABILITY AND PROBABLE DURATION :\nN / A.\nDISPOSITION :\nMason Street .\nRISSPA BREATH , M.D.\nTR :\nun / bmot\nDD :\n08-07-93\nTD :\n08/08/93\nCC :\n[ report_end ]\n"

AV conduction tissue disease .\n2. Coronary artery disease .\nPRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :\nRadiofrequency ablation of the slow pathway and permanent pacemaker implantation .\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\nPatient is an 82-year-old male with a past medical history significant for coronary artery disease ( status-post PCI of the RCA one week ago ) , history of peripheral vascular disease and preserved LV function with history of nonsustained VT .\nHe was transferred from an outside hospital for further investigation and management of his recent arrhythmic problem .\nHe was noted by the cardiologist to complain of some malaise with no complaints of weakness and malaise .\nHe also complained of mild palpitations and syncope .\nAt the time of his visit to his cardiologist 's office , he was noted to be in tachycardia which was found to be a junctional tachycardia , treated with carotid sinus massage , breaking into sinus bradycardia .\nIn the setting of the sinus bradycardia , he had a very prolonged PR interval and happened to be on sotalol which was subsequently discontinued .\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\nEcotrin ; Lipitor ; Cardura ; Plavix ; Lasix ; Cozaar ; Procardia .\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\nHe was comfortable , afebrile with a heart rate of 60 beat / min and a blood pressure of 100/70 , respirations 18 .\nJVP was not raised .\nHis cardiac exam revealed a fourth heart sounds , normal S1 , S2 and an ejection systolic murmur at the base of the heart .\nHis abdominal examination was benign .\nLungs were clear .\nHis EKG at the time of presentation showed evidence of sinus bradycardia , prolonged PR interval at 100-500 ms and evidence of Wenckebach .\nHis EKG also showed evidence of atrial echo beats and evidence of a slow AV nodal re-entrant tachycardia .\nIMPRESSION :\nPatient is an 82-year-old gentleman with a history of coronary artery disease and peripheral vascular disease with evidence of intrinsic conduction tissue disease who presented with an AVNRT .\nHe was admitted with the idea of having electrophysiology study to determine the exact mechanism of his tachycardia and subsequently undergo radiofrequency ablation .\nIt was also felt that because of his underlying conduction tissue disease , he would benefit from having a permanent pacemaker implanted .\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\nThe patient had his electrophysiology study on 12/23/2002 .\nHis baseline tracings showed evidence of a high AV block with AV Wenckebach at 550 ms.\nHe had evidence of AVNRT , typical slow-fast variant which was easily inducible .\nTwo radiofrequency ablations at the slow pathway terminated the tachycardia .\nThe patient was not inducible for tachycardia at the end of the procedure .\nThe procedure was well tolerated , and he was transferred back to the step-down unit for further monitoring .\nOn the next morning of 12/26/2002 , the patient had a dual chamber permanent pacemaker implanted .\nThis was a Medtronic Sigma SDR 303 type pacemaker .\nHis atrial and ventricular lead were both bipolar .\nThe atrial measurements were as follows :\namplitude 5.6 to 8 mV , outflow threshold of 0.5 volts at 0.4 ms , evidence for lead impedance of 450 ohm .\nHis ventricular measurements were as follows :\nRV amplitude of greater than 15.68 , output threshold of 0.5 volts at 0.5 ms and impedance of 680 ohm .\nThe patient was kept overnight for further monitoring .\nNoninvasive pacemaker evaluation on 12/26/2002 showed optimal sensing and capture thresholds of both the atrial and ventricular leads .\nA chest x-ray prior to discharge showed adequate position of the atrial and ventricular leads .\nOf note , there was a coincidental finding of a small solitary pulmonary nodule on his chest x-ray , and the patient has been advised regarding obtaining a CAT scan after discharge to follow up on this .\nAfter discussions with the patient and his family , they preferred having the CAT scan performed at the hospital closer to their residence so that it could be sequentially followed up with serial CAT scans if there was a need for the same .\nThe patient will follow up with his cardiologist as well as his primary care physician in the outpatient setting .\nHe has also been given a follow-up appointment with the pacemaker clinic .\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :\nHis medications at the time of discharge essentially remain the same .\nHe is being discharged on :\n1. Lipitor 20 mg p.o. q.d.\n2. Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d.\n3. Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.d.\n4. Cozaar 100 mg p.o. q.d.\n5. Procardia 60 mg p.o. q.d.\n6. Cardura 5 mg p.o. q.d.\n7. Isordil 20 mg p.o. t.i.d.\n8.

Urinary tract infection .\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\nThe patient is a 74 year old female with metastatic papillary carcinoma of the thyroid who presented to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital on 4/28/93 with progressive weakness , weight loss and shortness of breath .\nThe patient was in a good state of health until January of 1993 when she developed a serious upper respiratory tract infection associated with weakness and fatigue .\nShe had also reported a weight loss of 15 pounds over the past two months .\nAlthough her upper respiratory tract infection seemed to be resolving , her weakness persisted .\nA work up begun by her internist , Dr. Brain , revealed a white blood cell count of 49,000 with 50% eosinophils .\nShe was admitted to Box Memorial Hospital Nursing Home for further evaluation .\nData collected there included a chest x-ray which was unremarkable .\nThe liver function tests showed an alkaline phosphatase of 303 , LDH 310 , SGOT 66 , albumin 2.5 .\nA peripheral blood smear showed mature eosinophils in increased numbers .\nChromosomal studies were negative .\nA bone scan showed increased uptake at the manubrium at the site of an old fracture , as well as in the right supraclavicular area .\nA thyroid ultrasound showed an inferior thyroid mass .\nThis was followed by an abdominal CT which showed an enlarged spleen , a lytic lesion on the right iliac bone and a benign renal cyst .\nBiopsy of the lytic lesion was consistent with metastases papillary carcinoma of the thyroid .\nAn upper gastrointestinal was unremarkable .\nThe small bowel follow through was within normal limits .\nA thyroid scan revealed decreased function and displacement of the thyroid by a cold mass located inferiorly with calcifications on the right side .\nA chest CT also revealed a small pulmonary nodule with a necrotic mass involving the right lung posteriorly .\nThe patient was subsequently referred to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital under the service of Dr. Brain .\nShe continued to have profound weakness , a decreased appetite and weight loss .\nShe also developed lower extremity edema as well as left upper extremity swelling associated with increased shortness of breath on exertion .\nA needle biopsy of the right thyroid nodule showed papillary thyroid carcinoma .\nThe patient reports no history of radiation exposure , no family history of thyroid carcinoma , no recent travels or exposure to tuberculosis .\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\nIncludes a history of atrial fibrillation with good heart rate control on Digoxin .\nShe reports no prior surgical history .\nThe patient also reports no known drug allergy .\nSOCIAL HISTORY :\nThe patient lives alone in Leschle Drive , Sonpo , and does not report a smoking or alcohol history .\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\nLanoxin , 0.25 mg po qd ; Lasix , 20 mg po qd .\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\nThe patient is a pleasant , elderly female in no acute distress .\nHer vital signs showed a blood pressure of 126/72 , pulse 84 , respirations 22 , temperature 98.6 .\nShe had a 3 x 4 cm firm , nontender right thyroid mass that seemed to be fixed to the trachea .\nShe had no jugular venous distention or bruits .\nThe lungs exhibited right basilar dullness one quarter of the way up .\nShe had no definite S3 .\nThe liver edge was palpable to 6 cm below the right costal margin .\nHer spleen could not be palpated .\nShe had 4+ edema to the knees bilaterally .\nLABORATORY DATA :\nOn admission the white blood count was 67.3 with a differential of 21% polys , 16% bands , 3% lymphocytes , 2% monocytes , 57% eosinophils and 1% myelocytes .\nHer hematocrit was 38.8 , hemoglobin 13.7 , platelet count 155,000 , PT 12.7/10.1 , PTT 33.9 , erythrocyte sedimentation rate 18 , calcium 7.5 , phosphorus 3.5 , sodium 136 , potassium 3.7 , BUN 15 , total protein 5.9 , albumin 2.3 , globulin 3.6 , alkaline phosphatase 379 , SGOT 37 , Digoxin level 0.7 .\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\nThe patient was admitted to Dr. Shatermivaet S Brain on 4/28/93 with a history of papillary carcinoma of the thyroid with bone involvement and possible lung involvement .\nWork up was begun for the possible myeloproliferative / myelodysplastic disorder associated with the hyper-eosinophilic syndrome .\nAccordingly , an Oncology consult was called on 4/29/93 and a bone marrow aspirate biopsy was performed .\nThis revealed maturation of leukocytes to all stages with markedly increased eosinophilic proliferation .\nA lung biopsy was performed on 4/30/93 without definitive results .\nDuring this time the patient 's coagulation status had improved with Vitamin K therapy with PTs normalizing .\nANCA serum results were negative .\nANA results were also nonsuggestive .\nThe patient continued to suffer from edema of the left upper extremity and a Vascular Radiology consult revealed a thrombosis of the left subclavian vein extending into the axillary vein .\nThere was some thrombosis of the left internal jugular vein as well .\nA head CT was performed and was completely negative for any metastatic process involving the brain .\nThus , a heparin sliding scale was begun .\nMeanwhile , the patient 's eosinophilia was treated with a trial of prednisone .\nShe also developed a mild urinary tract infection which responded to Bactrim , but which was subsequently stopped because of diarrhea .\nThe conclusions at this time of the thyroid cytologist , as well as the bone pathologist , were that the findings were diagnostic of papillary thyroid carcinoma with pulmonary metastases .\nDr. Trial was subsequently consulted on 5/5 for surgical intervention .\nOn 5/6/93 the patient underwent a right thyroidectomy with sacrifice of the right recurrent laryngeal nerve as well as the right sternothyroid muscle and lower parathyroid gland .\nShe underwent autotransplantation of the right upper parathyroid gland , as well as repair of a right posterior membranous tracheotomy .\nShe was received in the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit immediately postoperatively in stable condition .\nHer rate was well controlled on Digoxin .\nThe patient was transferred to the floor on 5/7 .\nOn the ward she continued a gentle diuresis as well as Solu-Medrol therapy .\nCalcium levels remained 7.2 to 7.5 postoperatively .\nShe continued to improve with a slight hoarseness in her voice that was expected .\nShe continued to exhibit asymptomatic atrial fibrillation .\nAnticoagulation was begun on the third postoperative day with Coumadin .\nShe was effectively anticoagulated with a PT in the range between 15 and 17 over a control of 10 .\nShe also received a Radiation Therapy consult for local control of her invasive carcinoma .\nShe did well on the ward and was discharged on her ninth postoperative day .\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :\nMetastatic papillary thyroid carcinoma .\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\nCoumadin , 5 mg po alternating with 2.5 mg po ; prednisolone , 30 mg po bid ; hydrochlorothiazide , 50 mg po bid ; potassium chloride , 40 mEq po bid ; Augmentin , 500 mg po tid ; Digoxin , 0.125 mg po qd ; Tylenol , 650 mg po q4h prn ; Carafate , 1 gram po bid ; Synthroid , 0.125 mg po qd .\nDISPOSITION :\nThe patient was discharged home with Terchestlumnesamp Medical Center referral for weekly blood tests , potassium and PT .\nThe patient is also to keep her left arm elevated and to remain on a low sodium diet .\nShe will be maintained on a PT between 15 and 17 with Coumadin .\nArrangements will be made for radiation therapy to the right neck and right iliac crest .\nThe prognosis for rehabilitation potential is guarded .\nLENNI BRAIN , M.D.\nDICTATING FOR :\nERTCA TRIAL , M.D.\nTR :\nak / bmot\nDD :\n05/15/93\nTD :\n05/15/93\nCC :\nDr. Trial , Ertca Dirk , Dr. Lenni Brain\n[ report_end ]\n"

Multiple myeloma ( progressive )\n3. Type II diabetes mellitus\n4. Hypercalcemia\n5. Chronic metabolic acidosis ( incompletely compensated )\n6. Chronic leg pain and weakness of uncertain etiology\n7. Chronic obstructive lung disease ( former smoker )\n8. Chronic anemia ( multifactorial )\n9. Hyperlipidemia\n10. History of major affective disorder ( currently compensated )\nPRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :\nNone\nHOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :\nThis is one of several Ponta,itri- University Medical Center admissions for this 74-year old female with multiple medical problems who developed multiple myeloma with bench Jones proteinuria over one year ago .\nThere were lytic lesions seen in her bones and the patient was started on intermittent courses of melphalan with Prednisone .\nShe had a partial response , but continued to have inappropriate amounts of gamma globulins in her blood and urine and remained anemic and poorly responsive to erythropoietin .\nThe patient has had one previous admission for the same symptoms a couple of months ago that she came in with this time , namely generalized weakness which in fact has on both occasions been accompanied by progressively worsening renal insufficiency .\nThe weakness is non focal although since she has had chronic problems with pain in her legs for uncertain reasons she was having difficulty walking .\nHer appetite was gone .\nShe was having some nausea .\nNo recent history of a change in her medicines or lapse in them .\nNo changes in her breathing .\nShe did not seem sleepy or confused .\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\nblood pressure 130/40 , heart rate 78 regular .\nWeight 132 , ( had been 126 one year previously ) .\nTemperature 97 .\nThe patient was pale with a fine tremor of her upper extremities .\nShe could walk hesitantly for a few steps , was anicteric , lucid , not tachypneic .\nShe has flat affect at baseline and does not give may clues about somatic distress when she has some .\nHer lungs were clear .\nheart ; without murmur or gallop .\nHer jugular venous pressure was four to five centimeters of water , carotid upstrokes normal .\nsoft , non tender abdomen with normal bowel sounds .\nNo hepatosplenomegaly or masses .\nShe had 2+ edema of the ankles without tender cords or erythema .\nShe was moving all four extremities .\nHer cranial nerves were grossly intact to inspection .\nLABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION :\nHematocrit 24.6 , white count 4.0 , platelet count 170,000 , normal differential , sodium 143 , potassium 5.7 , chloride 113 , carbon dioxide 18.9 , BUN and creatinine 71/5.2 , glucose 177 .\nHOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :\nThe patient was admitted to the Ponta,itri- University Medical Center as a front door admission and although her electrocardiogram is equivocal , a second potassium also came back elevated so she was treated with two doses of sodium K-exulate with improvement of her potassium to within normal limits .\nOver the following days , she was gently hydrated .\nHer urine was alkalinized using intravenous and later oral sodium bicarbonate and her creatinine rose to a high of about 5.8 .\nShe was seen by the nephrology service and it was deemed quite likely that the acute and chronic renal insufficiency that had progressed causing this admission was related to her myeloma kidney .\nIn the weeks prior to admission she had just begun thalidomide orally as a salvage treatment for her myeloma .\nShe tolerated without sedation but probably was not at a therapeutic dose and it had had no impact by the time of her admission .\nThe patient , her son Randdor So and I had several long conversations about the potential for further renal deterioration and need for hemodialysis .\nThe family and the patient felt quite clearly that hemodialysis was not indicated if the underlying myeloma was not controllable .\nThey did agree , however to one more attempt at pulse Decadron therapy with consists of oral Decadron forty mgs PO q.day ( in divided doses ) for four consecutive days followed by four days off , followed by four days on , etc. for a total of eight sessions of four days of Decadron on .\nBy the time she had left she had completed only the first of the four consecutive days as expected her blood sugars went up into high 300's or 400s and she needed sliding scale regular insulin in addition to standing doses of NPH .\nOn the days when she was not on Decadron the standing doses of NPH were sometimes suspended because her blood sugars would get to 41 and she would have remarkably few symptoms in this setting , perhaps related to the low dose beta blockers that she also takes .\nThere had been a slight down turn in her creatinine by discharge to 4.7 but there was concern that she could not tolerate any greater hydration rates due to crackles in her bases although her jugular venous pressure went about six and she was never symptomatic with fluid overload .\nPotassium did not appear to be a problem throughout the rest of her hospitalization .\nShe was also seen by the pain service who was baffled by the cause for her lower extremity leg pain that has been present for several years , not progressive , minimally responsive to narcotics and currently on a second trial of Neurontin of dubious value and would probably by the first medicine that I discontinue if she was feeling too sleepy or weak .\nThe problem may be a combination of degenerative joint disease with spinal stenosis as well as neuropathic changes from diabetes +/- her myeloma .\nThe patient also requested to be do not resuscitate , do not intubate and this was also in agreement with her son So .\nThe patient is transferred to a skilled nursing facility to continue the pulses of Decadron under close monitoring for blood sugars insulin regulation and to see that her potassium does not worsen and that perhaps her creatinine will improve a slight bit more , although probably not come back to normal .\nShe will finish her last planned pulse of Decadron by about November 25 , 2003 at which point depending on her creatinine and her status we may or may not elect further such treatments .\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\n1. heparin 5000 units subQ b.i.d.\n2. clonazepam 0.5 mgs PO q.h.s.\n3. risperidone 3 mgs PO q.h.s.\n4. regular insulin on a sliding scale as detailed in discharge medication orders , but essentially no insulin for blood sugars less than 200 but from 201 to 250 give four units subQ , 251 to 300 give six units subQ , from 301 to 350 give eight units subQ , from 351 to 400 give ten units subQ , and if over 400 give twelve units subQ.\nshe also has standing doses of insulin NPH ten in the morning , ten in the evening and tentatively these will only be used during the days of high Decadron and perhaps should not be used on the days without Decadron .\n5. Metoprolol titrate 12.5 mgs PO b.i.d.\n6. Calcium acetate ( Phos-Lo ) 667 mgs PO t.i.d.\n7. Trazodone 25 mics PO q.h.s.\n8. Neurontin 100 mics PO q.h.s.\n9. Dilaudid 1-2 mgs PO q6h prn for leg pain .\n10. Colace 100 mgs PO t.i.d.\n11. Senna two tablets PO b.i.d.\n12. Dexamethasone one the scheduled days will be 20 mgs PO b.i.d. with food for four consecutive days alternating with four days off and four days on .\nThe next start of the four days of pulse dexamethasone will be on Wednesday , Oct 6 , 2003 and should complete itself by November 25 , 2003 .\n13. Ranitidine 75 mgs PO b.i.d.\n14. Sodium bicarbonate 650 mgs PO t.i.d.\n15. Hydrocortisone 2.5 percent cream to facial seborrheic dermatitis b.i.d.\n16. Furosemide 40 mgs PO b.i.d.\nThe patient should probably have daily weights to make sure that she is not getting fluid overloaded and should aim for an oral intake of clear liquids of at least two liters PO q.day to help continue flushing her kidneys .\nThe patient was discharged in stable satisfactory condition .\nThe patient should have an arranged visit to see Dr. Lyn Ralekote in the hematology oncology clinic ( 692 ) 673 3025 on approximately Friday , Oct 15 , 2003 LYN MEARD SCALE , M.D.\nDICTATING FOR :\nElectronically Signed LYN MEARD SCALE , M.D.\n11/04/2003 12:18\n_____________________________ LYN MEARD SCALE , M.D.\nTR :\nkxs\nDD :\n10/02/2003\nTD :\n10/03/2003 9:49 A 437894\ncc :\nLYN MEARD SCALE , M.D. /STAT\n[ report_end ]\n"
