commonly used to treat emphysema? answer: Hello, There are two types of medications to treat emphysema: 1. Alpha agonists ( like albuterol or albuterol / levosalbutamol ) are used to treat symptoms of shortness of breath ( SOB ) and tightness in the chest ( tightness in chest ). These meds cause a mild to moderate increase in heart rate ( tachycardia ). 2. Beta blockers ( like propranolol or metoprolol ) are used to treat or to prevent symptoms of heart failure ( ejection fraction is 20 % or less ). These medications cause or worsen shortness of breath, tightness in chest, heart rate. You can take a combination of these medications. The combination that you will work best is a two - pill combination of albuterol and propranolol ( half tablet twice a day ). This will reduce or eliminate the need for albuterol and albuterol / levosalbutamol in your case. The other medications are used in consultation with your physician., {score -> 0.65545124}, []}]|\n","+------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n","\n"]}],"source":["TEXT = \"What medications are commonly used to treat emphysema?\"\n","\n","data = spark.createDataFrame([[TEXT]]).toDF(\"text\")\n","\n","result = model.transform(data)\n","\n","result.show(truncate=False)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":6,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":20197,"status":"ok","timestamp":1759255388791,"user":{"displayName":"Mehmet Daƒü","userId":"14052875917891496135"},"user_tz":-180},"id":"Ov56x4ueAten","outputId":"3585f5c3-c6f3-4221-8637-e228c230af40"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n","|result                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n","+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n","|[question: What medications are commonly used to treat emphysema? answer: Hello, There are two types of medications to treat emphysema: 1.
