NER Model Implementation in Spark NLP\n","\n","  The deep neural network architecture for NER model in\n","Spark NLP is BiLSTM-CNN-Char framework. a slightly modified version of the architecture proposed by Jason PC Chiu and Eric Nichols ([Named Entity Recognition with Bidirectional LSTM-CNNs\n","](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.08308)). It is a neural network architecture that\n","automatically detects word and character-level features using a\n","hybrid bidirectional LSTM and CNN architecture, eliminating\n","the need for most feature engineering steps.\n","\n","  In the original framework, the CNN extracts a fixed length\n","feature vector from character-level features. For each word,\n","these vectors are concatenated and fed to the BLSTM network\n","and then to the output layers. They employed a stacked\n","bi-directional recurrent neural network with long short-term\n","memory units to transform word features into named entity\n","tag scores. The extracted features of each word are fed into a\n","forward LSTM network and a backward LSTM network. The\n","output of each network at each time step is decoded by a linear\n","layer and a log-softmax layer into log-probabilities for each tag\n","category. These two vectors are then simply added together to\n","produce the final output. In the architecture of the proposed framework in the original paper, 50-dimensional pretrained word\n","embeddings is used for word features, 25-dimension character\n","embeddings is used for char features, and capitalization features\n","(allCaps, upperInitial, lowercase, mixedCaps, noinfo) are used\n","for case features."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"huGcLHSP6oVb"},"source":["## 2.

Her Coumadin was placed on hold. A repeat echocardiogram was checked. She was started on prophylaxis for DVT with Lovenox 40 mg subcutaneously. Her history dated back to March 2005 when she first sought medical attention for evidence of pericarditis, which was treated with pericardial window in an outside hospital, at that time she was also found to have mesenteric pain and thrombosis, is now anticoagulated. Her pericardial fluid was accumulated and she was seen by Dr. Y. At that time, she was recommended for pericardectomy, which was performed by Dr. Z. Review of her CT scan from March 2006 prior to her pericardectomy, already shows bilateral plural effusions. The patient improved clinically after the pericardectomy with resolution of her symptoms. Recently, she was readmitted to the hospital with chest pain and found to have bilateral pleural effusion, the right greater than the left. CT of the chest also revealed a large mediastinal lymph node. We reviewed the pathology obtained from the pericardectomy in March 2006, which was diagnostic of mesothelioma. At this time, chest tube placement for drainage of the fluid occurred and thoracoscopy with fluid biopsies, which were performed, which revealed epithelioid malignant mesothelioma. The patient was then stained with a PET CT, which showed extensive uptake in the chest, bilateral pleural pericardial effusions, and lymphadenopathy. She also had acidic fluid, pectoral and intramammary lymph nodes and uptake in L4 with SUV of 4. This was consistent with stage III disease. Her repeat echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 45% to 49%.

At this time, he has been admitted for anemia with hemoglobin of 7.1 and requiring transfusion.\\n(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\\nDIAGNOSIS:\\nRefractory anemia that is transfusion dependent.\\nCHIEF COMPLAINT:\\nI needed a blood transfusion.\\nHISTORY:\\nThe patient is a 78-year-old gentleman with no substantial past medical history except for diabetes. He denies any comorbid complications of the diabetes including kidney disease, heart disease, stroke, vision loss, or neuropathy. At this time, he has been admitted for anemia with hemoglobin of 7.1 and requiring transfusion. He reports that he has no signs or symptom of bleeding and had a blood transfusion approximately two months ago and actually several weeks before that blood transfusion, he had a transfusion for anemia. He has been placed on B12, oral iron, and Procrit. At this time, we are asked to evaluate him for further causes and treatment for his anemia. He denies any constitutional complaints except for fatigue, malaise, and some dyspnea. He has no adenopathy that he reports. No fevers, night sweats, bone pain, rash, arthralgias, or myalgias.\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:\\nDiabetes.\\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY:\\nHernia repair.\\nALLERGIES:\\nHe has no allergies.\\nMEDICATIONS:\\nListed in the chart and include Coumadin, Lasix, metformin, folic acid, diltiazem, B12, Prevacid, and Feosol.\\nSOCIAL HISTORY:\\nHe is a tobacco user. He does not drink. He lives alone, but has family and social support to look on him.\\nFAMILY HISTORY:\\nNegative for blood or cancer disorders according to the patient.\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:\\nGENERAL: He is an elderly gentleman in no acute distress. He is sitting up in bed eating his breakfast. He is alert and oriented and answering questions appropriately.\\nVITAL SIGNS: Blood pressure of 110/60, pulse of 99, respiratory rate of 14, and temperature of 97.4. He is 69 inches tall and weighs 174 pounds.\\nHEENT: Sclerae show mild arcus senilis in the right. Left is clear. Pupils are equally round and reactive to light. Extraocular movements are intact. Oropharynx is clear.\\nNECK: Supple. Trachea is midline. No jugular venous pressure distention is noted. No adenopathy in the cervical, supraclavicular, or axillary areas.\\nCHEST: Clear.\\nHEART: Regular rate and rhythm.\\nABDOMEN: Soft and nontender. There may be some fullness in the left upper quadrant, although I do not appreciate a true spleen with inspiration.\\nEXTREMITIES: No clubbing, but there is some edema, but no cyanosis.\\nNEUROLOGIC: Noncontributory.\\nDERMATOLOGIC: Noncontributory.\\nCARDIOVASCULAR: Noncontributory.\\nIMPRESSION:\\nAt this time is refractory anemia, which is transfusion dependent. He is on B12, iron, folic acid, and Procrit. There are no sign or symptom of blood loss and a recent esophagogastroduodenoscopy, which was negative. His creatinine was 1. My impression at this time is that he probably has an underlying myelodysplastic syndrome or bone marrow failure. His creatinine on this hospitalization was up slightly to 1.6 and this may contribute to his anemia.\\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\\nAt this time, my recommendation for the patient is that he undergoes further serologic evaluation with reticulocyte count, serum protein, and electrophoresis, LDH, B12, folate, erythropoietin level, and he should undergo a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy. I have discussed the procedure in detail which the patient. I have discussed the risks, benefits, and successes of that treatment and usefulness of the bone marrow and predicting his cause of refractory anemia and further therapeutic interventions, which might be beneficial to him. He is willing to proceed with the studies I have described to him. We will order an ultrasound of his abdomen because of the possible fullness of the spleen, and I will probably see him in follow up after this hospitalization.\\nAs always, we greatly appreciate being able to participate in the care of your patient. We appreciate the consultation of the patient.\\nKeywords:\\nhematology - oncology, electrophoresis, ldh, b12, folate, erythropoietin level, reticulocyte count, serum protein, blood transfusion, bone

three years prior to presentation , associated with an acute hepatitis , and obesity with a body mass index ( BMI ) of 33.5 kg/m2 , presented with a one-week history of polyuria , polydipsia , poor appetite , and vomiting . \n","Two weeks prior to presentation , she was treated with a five-day course of amoxicillin for a respiratory tract infection . \n","She was on metformin , glipizide , and dapagliflozin for T2DM and atorvastatin and gemfibrozil for HTG . She had been on dapagliflozin for six months at the time of presentation . \n","Physical examination on presentation was significant for dry oral mucosa ; significantly , her abdominal examination was benign with no tenderness , guarding , or rigidity . \n","Pertinent laboratory findings on admission were : serum glucose 111 mg/dl , bicarbonate 18 mmol/l , anion gap 20 , creatinine 0.4 mg/dL , triglycerides 508 mg/dL , total cholesterol 122 mg/dL , glycated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) 10% , and venous pH 7.27 . \n","Serum lipase was normal at 43 U/L . Serum acetone levels could not be assessed as blood samples kept hemolyzing due to significant lipemia . \n","The patient was initially admitted for starvation ketosis , as she reported poor oral intake for three days prior to admission . \n","However , serum chemistry obtained six hours after presentation revealed her glucose was 186 mg/dL , the anion gap was still elevated at 21 , serum bicarbonate was 16 mmol/L , triglyceride level peaked at 2050 mg/dL , and lipase was 52 U/L . \n","The β-hydroxybutyrate level was obtained and found to be elevated at 5.29 mmol/L - the original sample was centrifuged and the chylomicron layer removed prior to analysis due to interference from turbidity caused by lipemia again . \n","The patient was treated with an insulin drip for euDKA and HTG with a reduction in the anion gap to 13 and triglycerides to 1400 mg/dL , within 24 hours . \n","Her euDKA was thought to be precipitated by her respiratory tract infection in the setting of SGLT2 inhibitor use . \n","The patient was seen by the endocrinology service and she was discharged on 40 units of insulin glargine at night , 12 units of insulin lispro with meals , and metformin 1000 mg two times a day . \n","It was determined that all SGLT2 inhibitors should be discontinued indefinitely .
