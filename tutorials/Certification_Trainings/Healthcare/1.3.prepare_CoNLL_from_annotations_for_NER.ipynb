Fetal hemoglobin (HbF) decreases polymerization of sickle hemoglobin (HbS) and improves outcomes in sickle cell disease (SSD). Therefore, a therapeutic goal in SSD is pharmacologic reactivation of HbF. Silencing of the gamma-globin (HbF) gene is associated with DNA methylation. The cytosine analog 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (decitabine) hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. We examined if subcutaneous decitabine could increase HbF levels and improve SSD pathophysiology without cytotoxicity. Eight symptomatic SSD patients resistant or intolerant of standard treatment with hydroxyurea received decitabine 0.2 mg/kg subcutaneously 1 to 3 times per week in 2 cycles of 6-week duration. Treatment decreased neutrophils and increased mean HbF (6.5% to 20.4%, P <.0001) and mean total hemoglobin (76 to 96 g/L [7.6 to 9.6 g/dL], P <.001). Features of vaso-occlusive crisis pathophysiology such as red cell adhesion, endothelial damage, and coagulation pathway activity significantly improved. gamma-Globin gene promoter methylation decreased, and platelets and the proportion of megakaryocytes and erythroid cells in the marrow increased without a decrease in marrow cellularity, consistent with a DNA hypomethylating, noncytotoxic mechanism of action. Weekly subcutaneous decitabine produces cumulative increases in HbF and total hemoglobin through a noncytotoxic mechanism of action. Chronic dosing and sustained increases in hemoglobin F and total hemoglobin levels may be possible. Further studies in SSD and thalassemia are indicated.\",\n          \"Smoothened is a fully competent activator of the heterotrimeric G protein G(i). Smoothened (Smo) is a 7-transmembrane protein essential to the activation of Gli transcription factors (Gli) by hedgehog morphogens. The structure of Smo implies interactions with heterotrimeric G proteins, but the degree to which G proteins participate in the actions of hedgehogs remains controversial. We posit that the G(i) family of G proteins provides to hedgehogs the ability to expand well beyond the bounds of Gli. In this regard, we evaluate here the efficacy of Smo as it relates to the activation of G(i), by comparing Smo with the 5-hydroxytryptamine(1A) (5-HT(1A)) receptor, a quintessential G(i)-coupled receptor. We find that with use of [(35)S]guanosine 5'-(3-O-thio)triphosphate, first, with forms of G(i) endogenous to human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cells made to express epitope-tagged receptors and, second, with individual forms of G\\u03b1(i) fused to the C terminus of each receptor, Smo is equivalent to the 5-HT(1A) receptor in the assay as it relates to capacity to activate G(i). This finding is true regardless of subtype of G(i) (e.g., G(i2), G(o), and G(z)) tested. We also find that Smo endogenous to HEK-293 cells, ostensibly through inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, decreases intracellular levels of cAMP. The results indicate that Smo is a receptor that can engage not only Gli but also other more immediate effectors.\",\n          \"Topoisomerase II\\u03b2 deficiency enhances camptothecin-induced apoptosis. Camptothecin (CPT), a topoisomerase (Top) I-targeting drug that stabilizes Top1-DNA covalent adducts, can induce S-phase-specific cytotoxicity due to the arrest of progressing replication forks. However, CPT-induced non-S-phase cytotoxicity is less well characterized. In this study, we have identified topoisomerase II\\u03b2 (Top2\\u03b2) as a specific determinant for CPT sensitivity, but not for many other cytotoxic agents, in non-S-phase cells. First, quiescent mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) lacking Top2\\u03b2 were shown to be hypersensitive to CPT with prominent induction of apoptosis. Second, ICRF-187, a Top2 catalytic inhibitor known to deplete Top2\\u03b2, specifically sensitized MEFs to CPT. To explore the molecular basis for CPT hypersensitivity in Top2\\u03b2-deficient cells, we found that upon CPT exposure, the RNA polymerase II large subunit (RNAP LS) became progressively depleted, followed by recovery to nearly the original level in wild-type MEFs, whereas RNAP LS remained depleted without recovery in Top2\\u03b2-deficient cells. Concomitant with the reduction of the RNAP LS level, the p53 protein level was greatly induced. Interestingly, RNAP LS depletion has been well documented to lead to p53-dependent apoptosis. Altogether, our findings support a model in which Top2\\u03b2 deficiency promotes CPT-induced apoptosis in quiescent non-S-phase cells, possibly due to RNAP LS depletion and p53 accumulation.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":4}],"source":["!wget -q https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JohnSnowLabs/spark-nlp-workshop/master/tutorials/Certification_Trainings/Healthcare/data/ChemProt/chemprot_train_text.csv\n","train_text_df = pd.read_csv('chemprot_train_text.csv')\n","train_text_df.head()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"A1m1UWirBXXe"},"outputs":[],"source":["def make_conll(text:pd.DataFrame, entity:pd.DataFrame,\n","               save_tag:bool=None,\n","               save_conll:bool=None,\n","               verbose:bool=None,\n","               begin_deviation:int=0,\n","               end_deviation:int=0 )->str:\n","\n","    df_text = text.iloc[:,[0,1]]\n","    df_entity = entity.iloc[:,[0,1,2,3,4]]\n","    df_text.columns = ['text_id','text']\n","    df_entity.columns = ['text_id','begin','end','chunk','entity']\n","    entity_list = list(df_entity.entity.unique())\n","\n","\n","    ########--------------1.tag transformation function------------########\n","\n","    def transform_text(text, entities, verbose=None):\n","\n","        tag_list=[]\n","        for entity in entities.iterrows():\n","\n","            begin = entity[1][1] + begin_deviation\n","            end = entity[1][2] + end_deviation\n","            chunk = entity[1][3]\n","            tag = entity[1][4]\n","            text = text[:end] + f' </END_NER:{tag}> ' + text[end:]\n","            text = text[:begin] + f' <START_NER:{tag}> ' + text[begin:]\n","            tag_list.append(tag)\n","\n","        sum_of_added_entity = Counter(tag_list)\n","        sum_of_entity = Counter(entities['entity'].values)\n","\n","        if verbose:\n","            print(f'Processed text id   : {entities.text_id.values[:1]}')\n","            print(f'Original Entities   : {sum_of_entity}\\nAdded Entities      : {sum_of_added_entity}')\n","            print(f'Number Equality     : {sum_of_added_entity == sum_of_entity}')\n","            print(\"==\"*40)\n","\n","        if not sum_of_entity == sum_of_added_entity:\n","            print(\"There is a problem in text id:\")\n","            print(entities.text_id.values[0])\n","            raise Exception(\"Check this text!\")\n","\n","        return text\n","\n","\n","    ######---------------2.apply_transform_text function ----------------#######\n","\n","    def apply_tag_ner(df_text, df_entity, save=None, verbose=None):\n","\n","        for text_id in tqdm(df_text.text_id):\n","            text  = df_text.loc[df_text['text_id']==text_id]['text'].values[0]\n","            entities  = df_entity.loc[(df_entity['text_id']==text_id)].sort_values(by='begin',ascending=False)\n","\n","            df_text.loc[df_text['text_id']==text_id, 'text'] = transform_text(text, entities, verbose=verbose)\n","\n","        if save:\n","            df_text.to_csv(\"text_with_ner_tag.csv\", index=False, encoding='utf8')\n","\n","        return df_text\n","\n","\n","    ##########----------------3.RUNNING TAG FUNCTION---------------#############\n","\n","    print(\"Text tagging starting.

Fetal hemoglobin (HbF) decreases polymerization of sickle hemoglobin (HbS) and improves outcomes in sickle cell disease (SSD). Therefore, a therapeutic goal in SSD is pharmacologic reactivation of HbF. Silencing of the gamma-globin (HbF) gene is associated with DNA methylation. The cytosine analog 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (decitabine) hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase. We examined if subcutaneous decitabine could increase HbF levels and improve SSD pathophysiology without cytotoxicity. Eight symptomatic SSD patients resistant or intolerant of standard treatment with hydroxyurea received decitabine 0.2 mg/kg subcutaneously 1 to 3 times per week in 2 cycles of 6-week duration. Treatment decreased neutrophils and increased mean HbF (6.5% to 20.4%, P <.0001) and mean total hemoglobin (76 to 96 g/L [7.6 to 9.6 g/dL], P <.001). Features of vaso-occlusive crisis pathophysiology such as red cell adhesion, endothelial damage, and coagulation pathway activity significantly improved. gamma-Globin gene promoter methylation decreased, and platelets and the proportion of megakaryocytes and erythroid cells in the marrow increased without a decrease in marrow cellularity, consistent with a DNA hypomethylating, noncytotoxic mechanism of action. Weekly subcutaneous decitabine produces cumulative increases in HbF and total hemoglobin through a noncytotoxic mechanism of action. Chronic dosing and sustained increases in hemoglobin F and total hemoglobin levels may be possible. Further studies in SSD and thalassemia are indicated.\",\n          \"Smoothened is a fully competent activator of the heterotrimeric G protein G(i). Smoothened (Smo) is a 7-transmembrane protein essential to the activation of Gli transcription factors (Gli) by hedgehog morphogens. The structure of Smo implies interactions with heterotrimeric G proteins, but the degree to which G proteins participate in the actions of hedgehogs remains controversial. We posit that the G(i) family of G proteins provides to hedgehogs the ability to expand well beyond the bounds of Gli. In this regard, we evaluate here the efficacy of Smo as it relates to the activation of G(i), by comparing Smo with the 5-hydroxytryptamine(1A) (5-HT(1A)) receptor, a quintessential G(i)-coupled receptor. We find that with use of [(35)S]guanosine 5'-(3-O-thio)triphosphate, first, with forms of G(i) endogenous to human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cells made to express epitope-tagged receptors and, second, with individual forms of G\\u03b1(i) fused to the C terminus of each receptor, Smo is equivalent to the 5-HT(1A) receptor in the assay as it relates to capacity to activate G(i). This finding is true regardless of subtype of G(i) (e.g., G(i2), G(o), and G(z)) tested. We also find that Smo endogenous to HEK-293 cells, ostensibly through inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, decreases intracellular levels of cAMP. The results indicate that Smo is a receptor that can engage not only Gli but also other more immediate effectors.\",\n          \"Topoisomerase II\\u03b2 deficiency enhances camptothecin-induced apoptosis. Camptothecin (CPT), a topoisomerase (Top) I-targeting drug that stabilizes Top1-DNA covalent adducts, can induce S-phase-specific cytotoxicity due to the arrest of progressing replication forks. However, CPT-induced non-S-phase cytotoxicity is less well characterized. In this study, we have identified topoisomerase II\\u03b2 (Top2\\u03b2) as a specific determinant for CPT sensitivity, but not for many other cytotoxic agents, in non-S-phase cells. First, quiescent mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) lacking Top2\\u03b2 were shown to be hypersensitive to CPT with prominent induction of apoptosis. Second, ICRF-187, a Top2 catalytic inhibitor known to deplete Top2\\u03b2, specifically sensitized MEFs to CPT. To explore the molecular basis for CPT hypersensitivity in Top2\\u03b2-deficient cells, we found that upon CPT exposure, the RNA polymerase II large subunit (RNAP LS) became progressively depleted, followed by recovery to nearly the original level in wild-type MEFs, whereas RNAP LS remained depleted without recovery in Top2\\u03b2-deficient cells. Concomitant with the reduction of the RNAP LS level, the p53 protein level was greatly induced. Interestingly, RNAP LS depletion has been well documented to lead to p53-dependent apoptosis. Altogether, our findings support a model in which Top2\\u03b2 deficiency promotes CPT-induced apoptosis in quiescent non-S-phase cells, possibly due to RNAP LS depletion and p53 accumulation.\"\n
