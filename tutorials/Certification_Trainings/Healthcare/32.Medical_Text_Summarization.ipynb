He is drowsy, but easily arousable and appropriate with conversation. He is oriented to person, place, and situation. He is normocephalic, atraumatic. His sclerae are anicteric. His mucous membranes are somewhat tacky. His neck is supple and symmetric. His respirations are unlabored and clear. He has a regular rate and rhythm. His abdomen is soft.

Ninety infants, with birth weights of 600 to 1250 gm, were entered into a prospective, randomized, controlled trial to receive either indomethacin, 0.1 mg/kg per dose, or placebo less than 24 hours and again every 24 hours for six doses. Echocardiography was performed on day 1 before treatment and on day 7, 24 hours after treatment. A hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) was confirmed with an out-of-study echocardiogram, and the nonresponders were treated with standard indomethacin or ligation. Forty-three infants received indomethacin (birth weight, 915 +/- 209 gm; gestational age, 26.4 +/- 1.6 weeks; 25 boys), and 47 received placebo (birth weight, 879 +/- 202 gm; gestational age, 26.4 +/- 1.8 weeks; 22 boys) (P = not significant). Of 90 infants, 77 (86%) had a PDA by echocardiogram on the first day of life before study treatment; 84% of these PDAs were moderate or large in size in the indomethacin-treated group compared with 93% in the placebo group. Nine of forty indomethacin-treated infants (21%) were study-dose nonresponders compared with 22 (47%) of 47 placebo-treated infants (p < 0.018). There were no significant differences between both groups in any of the long-term outcome variables, including intraventricular hemorrhage, duration of oxygen therapy, endotracheal intubation, duration of stay in neonatal intensive care unit, time to regain birth weight or reach full caloric intake, incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and survival. No significant differences were noted in the incidence of oliguria, elevated plasma creatinine concentration, thrombocytopenia, pulmonary hemorrhage, or necrotizing enterocolitis. The prophylactic use of low doses of indomethacin, when initiated in the first 24 hours of life in low birth weight infants who receive prophylactic surfactant in the delivery room, decreases the incidence of left-to-right shunting at the level of the ductus arteriosus.\"\"\"\n","\n","light_result = light_model.annotate(text)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":16,"metadata":{"id":"euCPEo_oxBg3","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1696180497803,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":27,"user":{"displayName":"Selçuk Mengüverdi","userId":"15361124602135819062"}},"outputId":"27169f54-f338-478e-8998-cd0ae0cba6bd"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["[\"A trial was performed on 90 newborn babies with low birthweight babies who received 0.1mg/kg pro dose indomethadiain or placebo less less then 24 hours for sixdosed.

The main outcome measures were residual disease after cytoreduction, frequency of radical surgical resection, and 5-year disease-specific survival.\\\\n The study comprised 194 patients, including 144 with carcinomatosis. The mean patient age and follow-up time were 64.4 and 3.5 years, respectively. After surgery, 131 (67.5%) of the 194 patients had less than 1 cm of residual disease (definition of optimal cytoreduction). Considering all patients, residual disease was the only independent predictor of survival; the need to perform radical procedures to achieve optimal cytoreduction was not associated with a decrease in survival. For the subgroup of patients with carcinomatosis, residual disease and the performance of radical surgical procedures were the only independent predictors. Disease-specific survival was markedly improved for patients with carcinomatosis operated on by surgeons who most frequently used radical procedures compared with those least likely to use radical procedures (44% versus 17%, P < .001).\\\\n Overall, residual disease was the only independent predictor of survival. Minimizing residual disease through aggressive surgical resection was beneficial, especially in patients with carcinomatosis.\"\"\"\n","\n","light_result = light_model.annotate(text)\n","\n","document_text = textwrap.fill(light_result['document'][0], width=120)\n","summary_text = textwrap.fill(light_result['summary'][0], width=120)\n","\n","print(\"➤ Document :\\n{}\".format(document_text))\n","print(\"\\n\")\n","print(\"➤ Summary : \\n{}\".format(summary_text))\n","print(\"\\n\")"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"fZIpLiRB5nTi"},"source":["## 📃 summarizer_clinical_questions\n","\n","This model is a modified version of Flan-T5 (LLM) based summarization model that is finetuned with medical questions exchanged in clinical mediums (clinic, email, call center etc.) by John Snow Labs.

Subsequently, this condensed text, distilled to its most vital sentences, is input into our 'Medical Summarizer' model. This model further abbreviates the text within a medical context, enabling us to generate a manageable and contextually accurate summarization of extensive medical documents. This two-tier approach facilitates maximum information extraction from texts and captures the essence of medical texts more efficiently and swiftly."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"5UaDtpSHxBhB"},"source":["➤ So, to illustrate our two-step approach, let's consider an example:"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":27,"metadata":{"id":"bQ3SRpT-xBhB","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1696182892836,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":64577,"user":{"displayName":"Selçuk Mengüverdi","userId":"15361124602135819062"}},"outputId":"ded7bfba-3644-4f6b-8aab-496536bd16bb"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["sentence_detector_dl download started this may take some time.\n","Approximate size to download 354.6 KB\n","[OK!]\n","sent_small_bert_L2_128 download started this may take some time.\n","Approximate size to download 16.1 MB\n","[OK!]\n","summarizer_biomedical_pubmed download started this may take some time.\n","[OK!]\n"]}],"source":["documenter = DocumentAssembler() \\\n","    .setInputCol(\"text\")\\\n","    .setOutputCol(\"documents\")\n","\n","sentence_detector = SentenceDetectorDLModel() \\\n","    .pretrained()\\\n","    .setInputCols(\"documents\") \\\n","    .setOutputCol(\"sentences\")\n","\n","sentence_embeddings = BertSentenceEmbeddings()\\\n","    .pretrained(\"sent_small_bert_L2_128\")\\\n","    .setInputCols([\"sentences\"])\\\n","    .setOutputCol(\"sentence_embeddings\")\n","\n","summarizer = ExtractiveSummarization()\\\n","    .setInputCols([\"sentences\", \"sentence_embeddings\"])\\\n","    .setOutputCol(\"extractive_summaries\")\\\n","    .setSummarySize(12)\\\n","    .setSimilarityThreshold(0.5)\\\n","    .setReturnSingleDocument(True)\n","\n","medical_summarizer = MedicalSummarizer.pretrained(\"summarizer_biomedical_pubmed\", \"en\", \"clinical/models\")\\\n","    .setInputCols([\"extractive_summaries\"])\\\n","    .setOutputCol(\"medical_summaries\")\\\n","    .setMaxTextLength(768)\\\n","    .setMaxNewTokens(512)\\\n","    .setDoSample(True)\\\n","    .setRefineSummary(True)\\\n","    .setRefineSummaryTargetLength(100)\\\n","    .setRefineMaxAttempts(3)\\\n","    .setRefineChunkSize(512)\n","\n","pipeline = Pipeline(\n","    stages=[\n","        documenter,\n","        sentence_detector,\n","        sentence_embeddings,\n","        summarizer,\n","        medical_summarizer\n","])\n","\n","model = pipeline.fit(spark.createDataFrame([[\"\"]]).toDF(\"text\"))\n","\n","light_model = LightPipeline(model)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":28,"metadata":{"id":"S2nkcG6qxBhC","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1696182892837,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":19,"user":{"displayName":"Selçuk Mengüverdi","userId":"15361124602135819062"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["text = \"\"\"Cancer continues to be one of the leading causes of death globally, despite advancements in our understanding of its biology and the development of more effective treatments.

(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\n","\n","HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Connor is a 50-year-old female who returns to clinic for a wound check. The patient underwent an APR secondary to refractory ulcerative colitis. Subsequently, she developed a wound infection, which has since healed. On our most recent visit to our clinic, she has her perineal stitches removed and presents today for followup of her perineal wound. She describes no drainage or erythema from her bottom. She is having good ostomy output. She does not describe any fevers, chills, nausea, or vomiting. The patient does describe some intermittent pain beneath the upper portion of the incision as well as in the right lower quadrant below her ostomy. She has been taking Percocet for this pain and it does work. She has since run out has been trying extra strength Tylenol, which will occasionally help this intermittent pain. She is requesting additional pain medications for this occasional abdominal pain, which she still experiences.\n","\n","PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Temperature 95.8, pulse 68, blood pressure 132/73, and weight 159 pounds. This is a pleasant female in no acute distress. The patient's abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended with a well-healed midline scar. There is an ileostomy in the right hemiabdomen, which is pink, patent, productive, and protuberant. There are no signs of masses or hernias over the patient's abdomen.\n","\n","ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: This is a pleasant 50-year-old female who has undergone an APR secondary to refractory ulcerative colitis. Overall, her quality of life has significantly improved since she had her APR. She is functioning well with her ileostomy. She did have concerns or questions about her diet and we discussed the BRAT diet, which consisted of foods that would slow down the digestive tract such as bananas, rice, toast, cheese, and peanut butter. I discussed the need to monitor her ileostomy output and preferential amount of daily output is 2 liters or less. I have counseled her on refraining from soft drinks and fruit drinks. I have also discussed with her that this diet is moreover a trial and error and that she may try certain foods that did not agree with her ileostomy, however others may and that this is something she will just have to perform trials with over the next several months until she finds what foods that she can and cannot eat with her ileostomy. She also had questions about her occasional abdominal pain. I told her that this was probably continue to improve as months went by and I gave her a refill of her Percocet for the continued occasional pain. I told her that this would the last time I would refill the Percocet and if she has continued pain after she finishes this bottle then she would need to start ibuprofen or Tylenol if she had continued pain. The patient then brought up some right hand and arm numbness, which has been there postsurgically and was thought to be from positioning during surgery. This is all primarily gone away except for a little bit of numbness at the tip of the third digit as well as some occasional forearm muscle cramping. I told her that I felt that this would continue to improve as it has done over the past two months since her surgery. I told her to continue doing hand exercises as she has been doing and this seems to be working for her. Overall, I think she has healed from her surgery and is doing very well. Again, her quality of life is significantly improved. She is happy with her performance. We will see her back in six months just for a general routine checkup and see how she is doing at that time.\"\"\""]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"HCSQSXkAxBhD"},"source":["## ➮ Map-Reduce Based MedicalSummarizer"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"CW9qm5S3xBhD"},"source":["✔︎ Our MedicalSummarizer model, in conjunction with the Map-Reduce Approach parameters, generates a more abstract summary that rephrases and rewrites the text to condense it further and take up less space.
