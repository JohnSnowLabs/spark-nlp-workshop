    "## How it works\n",
    "\n",
    "This annotator is a kind of RegexMatcher based on a JSON file, that is defined through the parameter `setJsonPath()`\n",
    "\n",
    "In this JSON file, you define the regex that you want to match along with the information that will output on metadata field.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example here, you define the name of an entity that will categorize the matches, the regex value and the  `matchScope` that will tell the regex whether to make a full match or a partial match\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"entity\": \"Stage\",\n",
    "  \"ruleScope\": \"sentence\",\n",
    "  \"regex\": \"[cpyrau]?[T][0-9X?][a-z^cpyrau]*\",\n",
    "  \"matchScope\": \"token\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ignore the `ruleScope` for the moment, it's always at a `sentence` level. Which means find match on each sentence. So, for example for this text:\n",
    "```\n",
    "A patient has liver metastases pT1bN0M0 and the T5 primary site may be colon or lung. If the primary site is not clearly identified , this case is cT4bcN2M1, Stage Grouping 88. N4 A child T?N3M1  has soft tissue aM3 sarcoma and the staging has been left unstaged. Both clinical and pathologic staging would be coded pT1bN0M0 as unstageable cT3cN2.Medications started.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The expected result will be:\n",
    "```\n",
    "val expectedResult = Array(\"pT1bN0M0\", \"T5\", \"cT4bcN2M1\", \"T?N3M1\", \"pT1bN0M0\", \"cT3cN2.Medications\")\n",
    "val expectedMetadata =\n",
    "Array(Map(\"field\" -> \"Stage\", \"normalized\" -> \"\", \"confidenceValue\" -> \"0.13\", \"hits\" -> \"regex\", \"sentence\" -> \"0\"),\n",
    "\t  Map(\"field\" -> \"Stage\", \"normalized\" -> \"\", \"confidenceValue\" -> \"0.13\", \"hits\" -> \"regex\", \"sentence\" -> \"0\"),\n",
    "\t  Map(\"field\" -> \"Stage\", \"normalized\" -> \"\", \"confidenceValue\" -> \"0.13\", \"hits\" -> \"regex\", \"sentence\" -> \"1\"),\n",
    "\t  Map(\"field\" -> \"Stage\", \"normalized\" -> \"\", \"confidenceValue\" -> \"0.13\", \"hits\" -> \"regex\", \"sentence\" -> \"2\"),\n",
    "\t  Map(\"field\" -> \"Stage\", \"normalized\" -> \"\", \"confidenceValue\" -> \"0.13\", \"hits\" -> \"regex\", \"sentence\" -> \"3\"),\n",
    "\t  Map(\"field\" -> \"Stage\", \"normalized\" -> \"\", \"confidenceValue\" -> \"0.13\", \"hits\" -> \"regex\", \"sentence\" -> \"3\")\n",
    "\t )\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Whereas, using a `matchScope` at sub-token level it will output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "val expectedResult = Array(\"pT1b\", \"T5\", \"cT4bc\", \"T?\", \"pT1b\", \"cT3c\")\n",
    "val expectedMetadata =\n",
    "Array(Map(\"field\" -> \"Stage\", \"normalized\" -> \"\", \"confidenceValue\" -> \"0.13\", \"hits\" -> \"regex\", \"sentence\" -> \"0\"),\n",
    "Map(\"field\" -> \"Stage\", \"normalized\" -> \"\", \"confidenceValue\" -> \"0.13\", \"hits\" -> \"regex\", \"sentence\" -> \"0\"),\n",
    "Map(\"field\" -> \"Stage\", \"normalized\" -> \"\", \"confidenceValue\" -> \"0.13\", \"hits\" -> \"regex\", \"sentence\" -> \"1\"),\n",
    "Map(\"field\" -> \"Stage\", \"normalized\" -> \"\", \"confidenceValue\" -> \"0.13\", \"hits\" -> \"regex\", \"sentence\" -> \"2\"),\n",
    "Map(\"field\" -> \"Stage\", \"normalized\" -> \"\", \"confidenceValue\" -> \"0.13\", \"hits\" -> \"regex\", \"sentence\" -> \"3\"),\n",
    "Map(\"field\" -> \"Stage\", \"normalized\" -> \"\", \"confidenceValue\" -> \"0.13\", \"hits\" -> \"regex\", \"sentence\" -> \"3\")\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `confidence` value is another feature, which is computed  basically using a heuristic approach based on how many matches it has.\n",
    "\n",
    "To clarify how many matches, this is an example of the JSON file with additional fields that will define the match we want to get\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"entity\": \"Gender\",\n",
    "  \"ruleScope\": \"sentence\",\n",
    "  \"matchScope\": \"token\",\n",
    "  \"prefix\": [\"birth\", \"growing\", \"assessment\"],\n",
    "  \"suffix\": [\"faster\", \"velocities\"],\n",
    "  \"contextLength\": 50,\n",
    "  \"context\": [\"typical\", \"grows\"]\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "for example, `prefix` and `suffix` refer to the words that are required to be near the word we want to match.\n",
    "\n",
    "This two work also with `contextLength` that will tell the maximum distance that prefix or suffix words can be away from the word to match, whereas `context` are words that must be immediately after or before the word to match\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, there is another feature that can be used. The `dictionary` parameter. In this parameter, you define the set of words that you want to match and the word that will replace this match.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, with this definition, you are telling `ContextualParser` that when words `woman`, `female`, and `girl` are matched those will be replaced by `female`, whereas `man`, `male`, `boy` and `gentleman` are matched those will be replaced by `male`. \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "female  woman   female  girl\n",
    "male    man male    boy gentleman\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So, for example for this text:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "At birth, the typical boy is growing slightly faster than the typical girl, but the velocities become equal at about seven months, and then the girl grows faster until four years. From then until adolescence no differences in velocity can be detected.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The expected output of the annotator will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "val expectedResult = Array(\"boy\", \"girl\", \"girl\")\n",
    "val expectedMetadata =\n",
    "Array(Map(\"field\" -> \"Gender\", \"normalized\" -> \"male\", \"confidenceValue\" -> \"0.13\", \"hits\" -> \"regex\", \"sentence\" -> \"0\"),\n",
    "Map(\"field\" -> \"Gender\", \"normalized\" -> \"female\", \"confidenceValue\" -> \"0.13\", \"hits\" -> \"regex\", \"sentence\" -> \"0\"),\n",
    "Map(\"field\" -> \"Gender\", \"normalized\" -> \"female\", \"confidenceValue\" -> \"0.13\", \"hits\" -> \"regex\", \"sentence\" -> \"0\"))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For the `dictionary`, you just need to define a csv or tsv file, where the first element of the row is the normalized word, the other elements will be the values to match. You can define several words and elements to match just by adding another row and you set the path to the file on the parameter `setDictionary`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `dictionary` parameter is of the type` ExternalResource` by default the delimiter is `\"\\t\"` you cand set another delimiter if your want according to your dictionary file format.\n"
