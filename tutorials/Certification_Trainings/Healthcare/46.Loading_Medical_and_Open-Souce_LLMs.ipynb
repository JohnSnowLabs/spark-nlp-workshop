This module allows using John Snow Labs' licensed LLMs at various sizes that are finetuned on medical context for certain tasks. It provides various methods for setting parameters, loading models, generating text, and retrieving metadata. The `LLMLoader` includes methods for setting various parameters such as input prefix, suffix, cache prompt, number of tokens to predict, sampling techniques, temperature, penalties, and more. Overall, the `LLMLoader`  provides a flexible and extensible framework for interacting with language models in a Python and Scala environment using PySpark and Java."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"okhT7AcXxben"},"source":["## Colab Setup"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"UPYaQizloMiq"},"outputs":[],"source":["import json, os\n","from google.colab import files\n","\n","if 'spark_jsl.json' not in os.listdir():\n","  license_keys = files.upload()\n","  os.rename(list(license_keys.keys())[0], 'spark_jsl.json')\n","\n","with open('spark_jsl.json') as f:\n","    license_keys = json.load(f)\n","\n","# Defining license key-value pairs as local variables\n","locals().update(license_keys)\n","os.environ.update(license_keys)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"jphatV_n_u-T"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Installing pyspark and spark-nlp\n","!
