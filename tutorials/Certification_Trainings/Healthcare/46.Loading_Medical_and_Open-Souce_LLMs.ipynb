pancreatitis three years ago. She presented with a one-week history of polyuria, poor appetite, and vomiting. She has been on metformin, glipizide, dapagliflozin, atorvastatin, and gemfibrozil for her conditions.\\nO: Physical examination showed dry oral mucosa but was otherwise benign with no tenderness, guarding, or rigidity. Laboratory findings revealed serum glucose at 111 mg/dL, creatinine at 0.4 mg/dL, triglycerides at 508 mg/dL, total cholesterol at 122 mg/dL, and venous pH at 7.27. She was on dapagliflozin for six months prior to presentation.\\nA: The primary diagnosis is diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) based on the patient's symptoms of polyuria, poor appetite, vomiting, and elevated triglycerides and total cholesterol. Differential diagnoses include complications from her underlying diabetes and HTG. The patient's history of HTG-induced pancreatitis and recent use of dapagliflozin are also relevant.\\nP: The management plan includes close monitoring of her glucose levels and electrolyte balance. She will be started on intravenous insulin and hydration to treat DKA. Dietary adjustments will be made to manage her diabetes and HTG. Regular follow-up appointments will be scheduled to monitor her glucose levels and adjust her medications as necessary.
