In this direction, We are excited to introduce our new Text2SQL annotator. This powerful tool revolutionizes the way you interact with databases by effortlessly translating natural language text prompts into accurate and effective SQL queries. With the integration of a state-of-the-art LLM, this annotator opens new possibilities for enhanced data retrieval and manipulation, streamlining your workflow and boosting efficiency.\n","\n","Also we have a new text2sql_mimicsql model that is specifically finetuned on MIMIC-III dataset schema for enhancing the precision of SQL queries derived from medical natural language queries on MIMIC dataset.\n","\n","In addition, we introduced a model can generate SQL queries from natural questions and custom database schemas with a single table. It is based on a large-size LLM, which is finetuned by John Snow Labs on a dataset having schemas with single tables.\n","\n","\n","Available models can be found at the [Models Hub](https://nlp.johnsnowlabs.com/models?annotator=Text2SQL).\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"okhT7AcXxben"},"source":["## Colab Setup"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"G7dOaR_TlgE-"},"source":["📌To run this yourself, you will need to upload your license keys to the notebook.
