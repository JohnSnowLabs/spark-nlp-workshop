        "`SentenceDetectorDL` (SDDL) is based on a general-purpose neural network model for sentence boundary detection.  The task of sentence boundary detection is to identify sentences within a text. Many natural language processing tasks take a sentence as an input unit, such as part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing, named entity recognition or machine translation.\n",
