This annotator can be fed by either the output of NER model, NGramGenerator or YAKE, and could be used to generate similarity scores for each NER chunk that is coming out of any (clinical) NER model. That is, you can now sort your clinical entities by the importance of them with respect to document or sentence that they live in. Additionally, you can also use this new annotator to grab new clinical chunks that are missed by a pretrained NER model as well as summarizing the whole document into a few important sentences or phrases."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"FEqS98yM3o1s"},"source":["Chunk KeyPhrase Extraction uses Bert Sentence Embeddings to determine the most relevant key phrases describing a text. The input to the model consists of chunk annotations and sentence or document annotation. The model compares the chunks against the corresponding sentences/documents and selects the chunks which are most representative of the broader text context (i.e. the document or the sentence they belong to). The key phrases candidates (i.e. the input chunks) can be generated in various ways, e.g. by NGramGenerator, TextMatcher or NerConverter. The model operates either at sentence (selecting the most descriptive chunks from the sentence they belong to) or at document level. In the latter case, the key phrases are selected to represent all the input document annotations.\n","\n","This model is a subclass of BertSentenceEmbeddings and shares all parameters with it.
