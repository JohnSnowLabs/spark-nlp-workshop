PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :;;;;;;;;
Hypopharyngeal cancer .;;;;;;;;
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :;;;;;;;;
Removal of left neck lymph node and esophageal endoscopy and dilation .;;;;;;;;
HISTORY AND REASON FOR ADMISSION :;;;;;;;;
This is a 69 year-old white male status post surgery in July of 1993 for a laryngopharyngoesophagogastrectomy with gastric reconstruction and modified right neck dissection for pharyngeal cancer .;;;;;;;;
Since that surgery , the patient has had dysphagia off and on , solids worse than liquids .;;;;;;;;
Sometimes solids get stuck for about 10 minutes .;;;;;;;;
About two months ago the patient had come to the emergency room because he couldn 't swallow for three days .;;;;;;;;
He required esophageal dilation .;;;;;;;;
Also , since July the patient has noted bilateral lymphadenopathy , especially the large submandibular , which has gotten larger .;;;;;;;;
It is difficult to get an exact history as to the onset of the lymphadenopathy , as the patient cannot vocalize and is intoxicated at the time of admission .;;;;;;;;
The lymphadenopathy is uncomfortable but not painful .;;;;;;;;
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :;;;;;;;;
Significant for radiation therapy after his surgery in July , a tracheoesophageal fistula , which was repaired , exploratory laparotomy in November , 1994 , for small bowel obstruction , hypertension , colitis , neonatal jaundice , and on September 1 , 1993 , drainage of a neck abscess .;;;;;;;;
He underwent closure of pharyngeal cutaneous fistula with muscle interposition on November 5 , 1994 , and a left upper lobectomy in September , 1993 , for lung cancer .;;;;;;;;
ALLERGIES :;;;;;;;;
Aspirin .;;;;;;;;
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :;;;;;;;;
None .;;;;;;;;
SOCIAL HISTORY :;;;;;;;;

Positive weight gain since his last admission , positive diarrhea times two weeks-soft brown stools .;;;;;;;;
Negative bright red blood per rectum , negative coughing , negative hemoptysis , negative hematemesis , negative chest pain , positive shortness of breath with exertion .;;;;;;;;
The patient can walk or go up a flight of stairs without any shortness of breath , however .;;;;;;;;
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :;;;;;;;;
The patient was a pleasant , mildly intoxicated male with grossly swollen neck .;;;;;;;;
He was afebrile with stable vital signs .;;;;;;;;
Head , eyes , ears , nose , throat :;;;;;;;;
normocephalic , atraumatic , pupils equal , regular and reactive to light and accommodation , extra ocular muscles intact .;;;;;;;;
Tongue with multiple white-yellow lesions .;;;;;;;;
Neck grossly swollen at the midline and right angle with jaw , unable to fully swallow .;;;;;;;;

Extremities without clubbing , cyanosis or edema .;;;;;;;;
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN :;;;;;;;;
This 69 year-old male status post laryngopharyngo-esophagogastrectomy for cancer in 05/93 now represents with progressive dysphagia and gross lymphadenopathy and neck mass .;;;;;;;;
The patient is mildly intoxicated .;;;;;;;;
HOSPITAL COURSE :;;;;;;;;
The patient was given overnight hydration .;;;;;;;;
He was taken to the operating room on May 14 , 1994 , for a bronchoscopy and esophagoscopy , dilatation and biopsy .;;;;;;;;
His left neck mass was excised and preliminarily was said to be squamous cell carcinoma .;;;;;;;;
The patient had esophagoscopy , where a stenosis was noted which was dilated to a # 49 French catheter .;;;;;;;;
There were no complications .;;;;;;;;
The patient was taken to the floor in stable condition .;;;;;;;;
Postoperatively , there was no crepitus and X-rays showed no mediastinal air .;;;;;;;;
Neck biopsy site was clean .;;;;;;;;
On May 15 , the patient 's diet was advanced to a soft diet and then later in the day to a regular diet .;;;;;;;;
Radiation Oncology was consulted and it was determined that Mr. Douet still had room for more palliative radiation therapy of his neck , and he arranged an appointment with Dr. Wires on Tuesday following discharge .;;;;;;;;
Dr. Wires 's telephone number is 526-6508 .;;;;;;;;
On May 16 , the patient was tolerating PO well , his lungs were clear , and he was discharged to home in stable condition .;;;;;;;;

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :;;;;;;;;
Mr. State is an 81-year-old man with a history of restrictive and obstructive lung disease , dilated cardiomyopathy , inferior myocardial infarction , and anterior mediastinal masses admitted with acute onset of pulmonary edema .;;;;;;;;
In the setting of inadvertently decreasing Lasix from 80 mg. po 40 mg. a day Mr. State had sudden onset dyspnea after approximate day and a half prodrome culminating in severe dyspnea .;;;;;;;;
Upon arrival in the Emergency Room Mr. State 's saturations were in the mid 80s and he was promptly rendered more comfortable with high flow oxygen , morphine , and nitrates and intravenous Lasix .;;;;;;;;
Chest x-ray was relatively unrevealing for interstitial or alveolar edema and with clinical improvement ensued with the immediate therapy in the Emergency Room as noted .;;;;;;;;
The patient denied angina , syncope , preceding worsening orthopnea , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , palpitations , chest pain , hematemesis or melena .;;;;;;;;
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :;;;;;;;;
Is notable for an inferior myocardial infarction , restrictive and obstructive lung disease with an FEV1 of .9 and FVC of 1.34 and a moderate at best response to bronchodilators , and a negative sestamibi scan in May , 1999 apart from a severe fixed inferolateral defect , systolic dysfunction with recent echocardiography revealing an LVID of 62 mm. and ejection fraction of 28 percent , moderate mitral regurgitation and mild-to-moderate aortic stenosis with a peak gradient of 33 and a mean gradient of 19 and a valve area of 1.4 cm. squared .;;;;;;;;
In addition , Mr. State has an anterior mediastinal mass 2x2x1.7 cm. by recent computerized tomography scan without surrounding or adjacent adenopathy or parenchymal lung disease apart from bronchiectasis .;;;;;;;;
His cardiomyopathy work up entailed a negative ANA , negative SPEP , UPEP and Benz-Jones proteins , normal ferritin , thyroid stimulating hormone and a recent work up for possible bimomatous associated myasthenia gravis that was negative .;;;;;;;;
The patient lives on Quelene with his wife .;;;;;;;;
He is a non-smoker and drinks rare alcohol .;;;;;;;;
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :;;;;;;;;
The patient was a very pleasant man who appeared his stated age .;;;;;;;;
Blood pressure was 155/60 , heart rate 70 with occasional premature ventricular contractions , respirations 14 .;;;;;;;;
Mr. State was dyspneic speaking in short sentences initially on high flow oxygen .;;;;;;;;
Jugular venous pressure was 8 with a brisk inspiratory descent .;;;;;;;;
There was no thyromegaly .;;;;;;;;
Carotids were 2+ .;;;;;;;;
Breath sounds were decreased at the bases only with distant heart sounds and a 2 out of 6 systolic ejection murmur consistent with aortic stenosis with Gallavardin like radiation to the apex .;;;;;;;;
Abdomen :;;;;;;;;
soft , nontender with hepatosplenomegaly , or hepatojugular reflex , bruits or pulsations .;;;;;;;;
There was no rash and no edema and the neurological examination was non-focal .;;;;;;;;
LABORATORY DATA :;;;;;;;;
Notable for a sodium of 145 , potassium 3.6 , BUN 23 , creatinine 1.3 , glucose 104 , hematocrit 42 , white count 8.7 , platelet count 235 and a PT of 12.9 seconds .;;;;;;;;
The urinalysis was negative .;;;;;;;;
The Troponin I was less than .4 and the creatine kinase was 114 .;;;;;;;;
Chest x-ray revealed moderate cardiomegaly with no clear interstitial or alveolar pulmonary edema and chronic atelectasis and / or scarring at both lung bases .;;;;;;;;
The electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm with premature atrial complexes and right bundle branch block with left anterior hemiblock and old anterior myocardial infarction .;;;;;;;;
HOSPITAL COURSE :;;;;;;;;
The patient was admitted to the Hospital and underwent an approximate 1.5 liter diuresis within the first 24 hours with improvement in his symptoms and improvement in his oxygen saturations .;;;;;;;;
After a long discussion with the patient and his family it was determined that a cardiac catheterization would be prudent .;;;;;;;;
Prior to catheterization a VQ scan was performed which revealed a moderate probability for PE with a subsegmental defect in the lingular on the left lung .;;;;;;;;
Subsequent lower extremities noninvasive studies and D-dimer test were both negative rendering the probability of acute pulmonary embolism less than 2 percent .;;;;;;;;
It was not felt that the patient would be in need of chronic Coumadin therapy in lieu of this low probability findings in toto .;;;;;;;;
Coronary angiography revealed occlusion of the right coronary artery proximally with insignificant plaquing in the left anterior descending artery and circumflex arteries .;;;;;;;;
After a approximate 3 liter total diuresis the right atrial pressure was 5 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 14 , pulmonary vacuolar resistance 353 and the cardiac output depressed at 2.95 liters per minute , or a cardiac index of 1.7 liters per minute .;;;;;;;;
Based upon these findings it was felt that Mr. State most likely has multi-factorial dyspnea owing to both his ventilatory limitation and to a chronic low output state .;;;;;;;;
In Hospital he was seen by both Speech Therapy , physical therapy , and the Uspend Harmemewood Medical Center Congestive Heart Failure Nurse Practitioner Program .;;;;;;;;
His Isordil was increased in Hospital and blood pressure control was relative episodic with systolic pressures ranging between 100 and 160 .;;;;;;;;
Future adjustments will be made at home pending his blood pressure measures .;;;;;;;;
At a goal weight of 142 pounds , Mr. State 's filling pressures appeared ideal with a wedge pressure of 14 and his goal weight range will be between 142 and 44 pounds at home .;;;;;;;;
The patient will be followed by Dr. State within a week of discharge and by Nieie Naebrand Freierm of the Dyathenslycha Medical Center .;;;;;;;;
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :;;;;;;;;
Imdur 120 mg. PO q.d. Captopril 100mg. PO t.i.d. Lasix 80 mg. PO q.d. Potassium chloride 40 mEq. PO q.d. Coreg 12.5 mg. b.i.d. Cozaar 100 mg. b.i.d. Plavix 75 mg. q.d. Allopurinol 300 mg. q.d.

These nodules are confirmed by chest CT and demonstrated to be smaller than 3 millimeter peripheral nodules appearing in both lung apices .;;;;;;;;
The CT also demonstrated questionable right hepatic hemangioma and multiple tubular hypodensities were hepatic veins should be .;;;;;;;;
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :;;;;;;;;
Because of the extensiveness of Ms. Abreun 's hospital course it will be organized by system :;;;;;;;;
1. Neurological :;;;;;;;;
On admission the patient was intubated and sedated .;;;;;;;;
Her sedation was gradually weaned during her first month in the Intensive Care Unit and she was noted to have an underlying depression and history of obsessive compulsive disorder as listed from the patient and her family .;;;;;;;;
A psychiatric evaluation was obtained and she was placed on Paxil at 5 milligrams which was gradually increased to a total of 20 milligrams po q day at the time of her admission .;;;;;;;;
On August 29th , Ms. Abreun again required sedation when she found apneic and hypotensive .;;;;;;;;
She spent several days in the Intensive Care Unit at that time , during which her sedation was gradually weaned back to off .;;;;;;;;
2. Pulmonary :;;;;;;;;
Ms. Abreun was admitted , sedated and on a respirator , requiring minimal settings with a pressure support of 10 and a pep of 5 .;;;;;;;;
After two weeks of intubation on July 25th the patient went to the operating room for a tracheostomy which she tolerated without issue .;;;;;;;;
Over the next several weeks , the ventilatory support was gradually weaned to off .;;;;;;;;
By August 9th she was tolerating trach mask trials and was on the verge of tracheostomy removal by August 29th .;;;;;;;;
At this time , she had a sudden episode of respiratory distress accompanied by hypotension and unresponsiveness .;;;;;;;;
She was bag masked and taken immediately to the Intensive Care Unit where she was placed on respiratory support with SIMV settings which were gradually weaned over the course of her ten days in the Intensive Care Unit .;;;;;;;;
After her wean from the respiratory , she was transferred back to the floor and over the next several days tolerated trach mask trials admirably and had her tracheostomy removed on September 16th , 1998 .;;;;;;;;
At the time of her discharge , she had no acute respiratory issues .;;;;;;;;
3. Cardiovascular :;;;;;;;;
Ms. Abreun was admitted on cardiac support requiring 30 of Neo-Synephrine .;;;;;;;;
She was placed on a Swan Gans catheter monitor and gradually weaned off the Neo-Synephrine by the 22nd of July .;;;;;;;;
She required no further support and had no further issues until August 29th when she had her respiratory crisis and was transferred to the unit .;;;;;;;;
At this time her dramatic pressure drop required Dopamine support at levels of 500 micrograms per minute .;;;;;;;;
A Swan Gans catheter floated at this time demonstrated an SVR of 500 .;;;;;;;;
She was supported with Dopamine and with fluid and was slow to come off the Dopamine requiring approximately 8 to 10 days for full weaning .;;;;;;;;
After the wean she required no further cardiac medication and had no further issues .;;;;;;;;
4. Renal :;;;;;;;;
Ms. Abreun 's fluid management was an important contributor to her hospital course .;;;;;;;;
She presented with massive ascites and anasarca for which she received large volume diuresis with regular Lasix dosing daily .;;;;;;;;
Renal parameters were normal until the time of her respiratory cardiovascular crisis on August 29th .;;;;;;;;
At this time , it was noted that her bun jumped to levels of approximately 80 , while her creatinine stayed at levels of .6 to .7 .;;;;;;;;
An elevation by Dr. Freiermthalskush of renal medicine at first suspected a subclinical congestive heart failure as being responsible for a prerenal azotemia , however on further elucidation of the patient 's course , it is evident that a broad sepsis caused by her pneumonia was responsible for her decreased SVR and eventual renal hypoperfusion .;;;;;;;;
Her azotemia responded readily to pressor support and fluid resuscitation .;;;;;;;;
At the end of her second Intensive Care Unit admission , her bun and creatinine had resolved to normal values .;;;;;;;;
5. Gastrointestinal :;;;;;;;;
Ms. Abreun was admitted nothing by mouth , intubated on intravenous fluids alone .;;;;;;;;
She was immediately begun on total parenteral nutrition therapy for what would be a prolonged course without PO intake .;;;;;;;;
On July 25th a G tube was placed and feeds were begun gradually .;;;;;;;;
These G tube feeds were gradually increased with a total parenteral nutrition wean , however at the time of her re-admission to the Intensive Care Unit on August 29th aspiration was suspected and all tube feeds were held .;;;;;;;;
She was maintained on total parenteral nutrition for the course of her time in the Intensive Care Unit .;;;;;;;;
At the end of this time , she was begun gradually on G tube feeding , however she was able to tolerate only very small volumes and produce large aspirates .;;;;;;;;
This problem had remained and been ongoing for the remainder of her hospital at Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital .;;;;;;;;
She is currently being supported on tube feeds of Vivonex at a rate of approximately 20 and hour with aspirates being measured q 4 hours and measuring from 30 to 250 regularly .;;;;;;;;
She has also been supplemented with Glutamine 10 grams b.i.d. via the G tube in hopes of reviving what most certainly be her gut atrophy from prolonged disuse .;;;;;;;;
Ms. Abreun , from the onset of her stay at Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital demonstrated elevated alkaline phosphatase levels in isolation from her other liver function tests .;;;;;;;;
These values ranging as high as 2300 were evaluated by gastrointestinal consult who came and performed and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography which demonstrated a normal biliary system with diameters on the large end of normal .;;;;;;;;
Stone was demonstrated in the gallbladder , but there was no evidence of obstruction and the study was ready as normal .;;;;;;;;
5 'nucleotidase values have also been elevated ranging from 150 to 180 .;;;;;;;;
To date there has been no satisfactory explanation for these elevations in alkaline phosphatase and 5 'nucleotidase and all associated studies have been negative .;;;;;;;;
Further evaluation of this during her later hospital stay or as an outpatient .;;;;;;;;
6. Infectious disease :;;;;;;;;
Ms. Abreun underwent a work up for tuberculosis at the beginning of her hospital course .;;;;;;;;
She ruled out by PPD .;;;;;;;;
The initial management of her necrotizing fascitis was empiric with Imipenem , Flagyl and Vancomycin .;;;;;;;;
Because of the extent of her wound , she was also treated with hyperbaric oxygen which was of some benefit in resolving her infection .;;;;;;;;
The course of Flagyl , Imipenem and Vancomycin was continued for fourteen days .;;;;;;;;
At this time Imipenem were discontinued and Vancomycin was maintained alone for additional several days .;;;;;;;;
She then went without antibiotic therapy for a period of several weeks until her crisis of August 29th .;;;;;;;;
ON admission to the unit , she was begun on triple antibiotic therapy with Levo / Vanc/Flagyl .;;;;;;;;
Shortly thereafter Gentamicin was added to the regimen which was maintained for a period of one week until cultures came back and her therapy could be stream lined to Vancomycin , Levofloxacin alone .;;;;;;;;
After a ten day course of Levofloxacin it was discontinued , Vancomycin was maintained for five additional days , after which time , it was discontinued as well and she was without antibiotics .;;;;;;;;
On discharge , she was currently taking no antibiotics .;;;;;;;;
Ms. Abreun entered the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital having taking only oral hypoglycemic agents for control of her diabetes .;;;;;;;;
Because of the stress of her infection and Intensive Care Unit admission she was requiring sliding scale Insulin for the full course of her hospital stay .;;;;;;;;
Her total parenteral nutrition was also supplemented with Insulin NPH for better control .;;;;;;;;
Her total parenteral nutrition is currently supplemented with 30 units NPH q day and she is on a sliding scale to control the remainder of her sugars .;;;;;;;;
Ms. Abreun 's hypothyroidism diagnosed shortly before her admission was an important aspect of her therapy during her course at Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital .;;;;;;;;
Her thyroid necessity was poorly controlled with a Synthroid dose of 0.125 milligrams for the majority of her stay .;;;;;;;;
At the time of her admission to the Intensive Care Unit on August 29th it was noted that she had a thyroid stimulating hormone that was dramatically raised to a value of 26.83 .;;;;;;;;
More active supplementation was performed increasing her dose to .3 milligrams q day , which caused a rapid resolution of her thyroid studies and an improvement in her physiology almost immediately .;;;;;;;;
She has since been maintained on a dose of 0.2 milligrams IV q d .;;;;;;;;
However , she has had a gradual rise in her thyroid stimulating hormone to a value of 6.68 .;;;;;;;;
Her discharge medication will include Synthroid dose of 0.3 milligrams po q day with recommendation that this parameter be followed closely .;;;;;;;;
IN SUMMARY :;;;;;;;;
Ms. Abreun is a fifty nine-year-old female who presented with necrotizing fascitis of the right hip , status post debridement , severely debilitated by the extent of her infection .;;;;;;;;
Over the course of 2 months this infection was cleared , the wound was cleaned and split thickness skin grafting was successful in covering over the wound .;;;;;;;;
Her course , however was complicated by an methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia which was resistant to therapy and which produced a profound sepsis which caused a hypotensive ana apneic episode which required Intensive Care Unit support for a period of a week .;;;;;;;;
Her course was also complicated by her hypoactive thyroid function which went unrecognized for some period , but has since resolved with aggressive Synthroid therapy .;;;;;;;;
Currently , her most issues are the advancement of her tube feeds and the restarting of her PO intake which was planned to begin for the next several days before her transfer was initiated .;;;;;;;;
Her wound also requires further care as smaller areas of non-take in the graft are being management with sterile saline wet to dry dressings .;;;;;;;;

Neurological examination :;;;;;;;;
Cranial nerves II-XII intact with the exception of right cranial nerves X , right facial nerve paresis , right glossopharyngeal nerve paresis , left visual field partial absence ( noticed post procedure ) .;;;;;;;;
LABORATORY DATA AND RADIOLOGIC DATA :;;;;;;;;
During hospitalization computerized tomography scan examination of brain performed with and without intravenous contrast enhancement was obtained , following demonstration of left partial homonymous hemianopsia .;;;;;;;;
Computerized tomography scan demonstrated two murally enhancing cystic masses , the first occupying much of the inferior right cerebellar hemisphere , the second shown focally in the left lateral occipital lobe , with associated vasogenic edema .;;;;;;;;
Metastatic disease suspected .;;;;;;;;
Additional magnetic resonance angiogram examination requested .;;;;;;;;
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :;;;;;;;;
The patient was admitted on 1/10/99 , at which time intentional balloon sacrifice of right coronary artery was performed .;;;;;;;;
Systemic anticoagulation was accomplished with limited mobility permitted .;;;;;;;;
Over the course of the next three days the patient was mobilized .;;;;;;;;
At this time the diagnosis of presumed metastatic involvement of a super-tentorial and infratentorial compartments had been arrived at , and it was also noted that the patient 's swallowing was sufficiently impaired where Nutrition was compromised and in question .;;;;;;;;
It was decided at this point that the patient 's neck resection may need to be withheld pending exploration of chemotherapeutic and radiation therapy options , and that the Nutrition status would need to be addressed .;;;;;;;;
As such , it was decided that a transfer to the Valtawnprinceel Community Memorial Hospital under Dr. Cuchsoissfreiermcot 'care , who is the patient 's Oncologic Otolaryngologic Surgeon , should be entertained .;;;;;;;;
On the evening of 1/14/99 , nursing noticed that the patient was somewhat confused , and suspected a possible post ictal state .;;;;;;;;
As such , the patient was placed on Dilantin , and Dilantin is being continued .;;;;;;;;
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :;;;;;;;;
Good , with the exception of brain metastases and difficulty swallowing .;;;;;;;;
DOCTOR 'S DISCHARGE ORDERS :;;;;;;;;
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :;;;;;;;;
Dilantin 100 mg. t.i.d. Kaopectate 30 cc. PO q.4 hours .;;;;;;;;
Tylenol 650 mg. PO q.4 hours .;;;;;;;;
DISPOSITION :;;;;;;;;
The patient 's instructions will mainly center on Dr. Cuchsoissfreiermcot 'recommendations regarding continuing therapy .;;;;;;;;
Of note , the patient has a questionable history of a Penicillin allergy .;;;;;;;;

HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :;;;;;;;;
This is one of several Ponta,itri- University Medical Center admissions for this 74-year old female with multiple medical problems who developed multiple myeloma with bench Jones proteinuria over one year ago .;;;;;;;;
There were lytic lesions seen in her bones and the patient was started on intermittent courses of melphalan with Prednisone .;;;;;;;;
She had a partial response , but continued to have inappropriate amounts of gamma globulins in her blood and urine and remained anemic and poorly responsive to erythropoietin .;;;;;;;;
The patient has had one previous admission for the same symptoms a couple of months ago that she came in with this time , namely generalized weakness which in fact has on both occasions been accompanied by progressively worsening renal insufficiency .;;;;;;;;
The weakness is non focal although since she has had chronic problems with pain in her legs for uncertain reasons she was having difficulty walking .;;;;;;;;
Her appetite was gone .;;;;;;;;
She was having some nausea .;;;;;;;;
No recent history of a change in her medicines or lapse in them .;;;;;;;;
No changes in her breathing .;;;;;;;;
She did not seem sleepy or confused .;;;;;;;;
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :;;;;;;;;
blood pressure 130/40 , heart rate 78 regular .;;;;;;;;
Weight 132 , ( had been 126 one year previously ) .;;;;;;;;
Temperature 97 .;;;;;;;;
The patient was pale with a fine tremor of her upper extremities .;;;;;;;;
She could walk hesitantly for a few steps , was anicteric , lucid , not tachypneic .;;;;;;;;
She has flat affect at baseline and does not give may clues about somatic distress when she has some .;;;;;;;;
Her lungs were clear .;;;;;;;;
heart ; without murmur or gallop .;;;;;;;
Her jugular venous pressure was four to five centimeters of water , carotid upstrokes normal .;;;;;;;;
soft , non tender abdomen with normal bowel sounds .;;;;;;;;
No hepatosplenomegaly or masses .;;;;;;;;
She had 2+ edema of the ankles without tender cords or erythema .;;;;;;;;
She was moving all four extremities .;;;;;;;;
Her cranial nerves were grossly intact to inspection .;;;;;;;;
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION :;;;;;;;;
Hematocrit 24.6 , white count 4.0 , platelet count 170,000 , normal differential , sodium 143 , potassium 5.7 , chloride 113 , carbon dioxide 18.9 , BUN and creatinine 71/5.2 , glucose 177 .;;;;;;;;
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :;;;;;;;;
The patient was admitted to the Ponta,itri- University Medical Center as a front door admission and although her electrocardiogram is equivocal , a second potassium also came back elevated so she was treated with two doses of sodium K-exulate with improvement of her potassium to within normal limits .;;;;;;;;
Over the following days , she was gently hydrated .;;;;;;;;
Her urine was alkalinized using intravenous and later oral sodium bicarbonate and her creatinine rose to a high of about 5.8 .;;;;;;;;
She was seen by the nephrology service and it was deemed quite likely that the acute and chronic renal insufficiency that had progressed causing this admission was related to her myeloma kidney .;;;;;;;;
In the weeks prior to admission she had just begun thalidomide orally as a salvage treatment for her myeloma .;;;;;;;;
She tolerated without sedation but probably was not at a therapeutic dose and it had had no impact by the time of her admission .;;;;;;;;
The patient , her son Randdor So and I had several long conversations about the potential for further renal deterioration and need for hemodialysis .;;;;;;;;
The family and the patient felt quite clearly that hemodialysis was not indicated if the underlying myeloma was not controllable .;;;;;;;;
They did agree , however to one more attempt at pulse Decadron therapy with consists of oral Decadron forty mgs PO q.day ( in divided doses ) for four consecutive days followed by four days off , followed by four days on , etc. for a total of eight sessions of four days of Decadron on .;;;;;;;;
By the time she had left she had completed only the first of the four consecutive days as expected her blood sugars went up into high 300's or 400s and she needed sliding scale regular insulin in addition to standing doses of NPH .;;;;;;;;
On the days when she was not on Decadron the standing doses of NPH were sometimes suspended because her blood sugars would get to 41 and she would have remarkably few symptoms in this setting , perhaps related to the low dose beta blockers that she also takes .;;;;;;;;
There had been a slight down turn in her creatinine by discharge to 4.7 but there was concern that she could not tolerate any greater hydration rates due to crackles in her bases although her jugular venous pressure went about six and she was never symptomatic with fluid overload .;;;;;;;;
Potassium did not appear to be a problem throughout the rest of her hospitalization .;;;;;;;;
She was also seen by the pain service who was baffled by the cause for her lower extremity leg pain that has been present for several years , not progressive , minimally responsive to narcotics and currently on a second trial of Neurontin of dubious value and would probably by the first medicine that I discontinue if she was feeling too sleepy or weak .;;;;;;;;
The problem may be a combination of degenerative joint disease with spinal stenosis as well as neuropathic changes from diabetes +/- her myeloma .;;;;;;;;
The patient also requested to be do not resuscitate , do not intubate and this was also in agreement with her son So .;;;;;;;;
The patient is transferred to a skilled nursing facility to continue the pulses of Decadron under close monitoring for blood sugars insulin regulation and to see that her potassium does not worsen and that perhaps her creatinine will improve a slight bit more , although probably not come back to normal .;;;;;;;;
She will finish her last planned pulse of Decadron by about November 25 , 2003 at which point depending on her creatinine and her status we may or may not elect further such treatments .;;;;;;;;
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :;;;;;;;;
1. heparin 5000 units subQ b.i.d.;;;;;;;;
2. clonazepam 0.5 mgs PO q.h.s.;;;;;;;;
3. risperidone 3 mgs PO q.h.s.;;;;;;;;
4. regular insulin on a sliding scale as detailed in discharge medication orders , but essentially no insulin for blood sugars less than 200 but from 201 to 250 give four units subQ , 251 to 300 give six units subQ , from 301 to 350 give eight units subQ , from 351 to 400 give ten units subQ , and if over 400 give twelve units subQ.;;;;;;;;
she also has standing doses of insulin NPH ten in the morning , ten in the evening and tentatively these will only be used during the days of high Decadron and perhaps should not be used on the days without Decadron .;;;;;;;;
5. Metoprolol titrate 12.5 mgs PO b.i.d.;;;;;;;;
6. Calcium acetate ( Phos-Lo ) 667 mgs PO t.i.d.;;;;;;;;
7. Trazodone 25 mics PO q.h.s.;;;;;;;;
8. Neurontin 100 mics PO q.h.s.;;;;;;;;
9. Dilaudid 1-2 mgs PO q6h prn for leg pain .;;;;;;;;
10. Colace 100 mgs PO t.i.d.;;;;;;;;
11. Senna two tablets PO b.i.d.;;;;;;;;
12. Dexamethasone one the scheduled days will be 20 mgs PO b.i.d. with food for four consecutive days alternating with four days off and four days on .;;;;;;;;
The next start of the four days of pulse dexamethasone will be on Wednesday , Oct 6 , 2003 and should complete itself by November 25 , 2003 .;;;;;;;;
13. Ranitidine 75 mgs PO b.i.d.;;;;;;;;
14. Sodium bicarbonate 650 mgs PO t.i.d.;;;;;;;;
15. Hydrocortisone 2.5 percent cream to facial seborrheic dermatitis b.i.d.;;;;;;;;
16. Furosemide 40 mgs PO b.i.d.;;;;;;;;
The patient should probably have daily weights to make sure that she is not getting fluid overloaded and should aim for an oral intake of clear liquids of at least two liters PO q.day to help continue flushing her kidneys .;;;;;;;;
The patient was discharged in stable satisfactory condition .;;;;;;;;
The patient should have an arranged visit to see Dr. Lyn Ralekote in the hematology oncology clinic ( 692 ) 673 3025 on approximately Friday , Oct 15 , 2003 LYN MEARD SCALE , M.D.;;;;;;;;

IDENTIFYING DATA :;;;;;;;;
This 75 year old female was transferred from Iming Medical Center for angioplasty .;;;;;;;;
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :;;;;;;;;
Unstable angina .;;;;;;;;
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :;;;;;;;;
Hypertension .;;;;;;;;
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :;;;;;;;;
Right and circumflex angioplasty , cardiac catheterization on 12-6-93 .;;;;;;;;
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :;;;;;;;;
This 75 year old woman was previously admitted here in November 1993 for chronic angina .;;;;;;;;
She had mild mitral regurgitation and a slightly diminished ejection fraction .;;;;;;;;
There was a 90% right coronary stenosis which was reduced to 30 with a balloon angioplasty .;;;;;;;;
There were three lesions in the circumflex , dilated successfully .;;;;;;;;
However , the low circumflex marginal vessel could not be crossed with the balloon .;;;;;;;;
She did well in follow up , being treated for hypertension .;;;;;;;;
In the end of 1992 , she was feeling well and was taken off Isordil .;;;;;;;;
During the winter and early parts of 1993 , the patient noticed increasing fatigue , symptoms of breathlessness and recurrent substernal chest pressure which finally led to admission to Xas Tupalmsmodral Hospital on 11-11-93 with documentation of a subendocardial myocardial infarction and a blood pressure of 210/108 .;;;;;;;;
Cardiac catheterization towards the end of the hospitalization showed recurrent right coronary artery stenosis proximally and high grade new stenosis in the distal circumflex at the area of the origin of the previously untreated low circumflex marginal vessel .;;;;;;;;
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :;;;;;;;;
Medications on transfer were Ecotrin , Vasotec 5 mg , Lopressor 25 bid , Isordil 20 tid , Procardia XL once per day , and Lasix 20 q3 days .;;;;;;;;
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :;;;;;;;;
On physical examination , the blood pressure was 150 , heart rate 70 , bilateral carotid bruits , grade II systolic ejection murmur , good femoral pulses without bruits , good dorsalis pedis pulses with no posterior tibial pulses felt .;;;;;;;;
LABORATORY DATA :;;;;;;;;
The electrocardiogram revealed left bundle branch block .;;;;;;;;
The electrolytes were normal .;;;;;;;;
The admission hematocrit was 34 .;;;;;;;;
HOSPITAL COURSE :;;;;;;;;
On 12-6-93 , angioplasty was performed of the right coronary artery using a 3 mm solo balloon reducing the stenosis from 80 to approximately 20% with a faint diagonal lucency which was not obstructive .;;;;;;;;
The new distal circumflex lesion was dilated with a 2.0 mm balloon with a good result and minimal persistent stenosis .;;;;;;;;
But the low circumflex marginal could not be entered with a wire .;;;;;;;;
The first marginal had a 505 stenosis at its origin , which was not attempted .;;;;;;;;
The patient did well post procedure .;;;;;;;;
He developed a grape sized hematoma over the femoral artery with a loud bruit .;;;;;;;;
The ultrasound on the day of discharge showed no evidence of pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula .;;;;;;;;
The blood pressure was 150-170 systolic .;;;;;;;;
The patient was ambulating without symptoms .;;;;;;;;
ADDENDUM :;;;;;;;;
The admission hematocrit was 34 .;;;;;;;;
This fell to 25 after the cardiac catheterization without evidence of bleeding and rose to 29 by the time of discharge .;;;;;;;;
DOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :;;;;;;;;
She was discharged with advice by Cardiac Rehabilitation for gradually increasing activity .;;;;;;;;
She will be followed by her physician at Cean , Dr. Dieseld Pollejesc , for further pressure management and follow up of the femoral hematoma .;;;;;;;;
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :;;;;;;;;
Stable , resolving anemia .;;;;;;;;
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :;;;;;;;;
Ecotrin 160 mg per day , Vasotec 5 mg per day , Lopressor 25 bid , Isordil 20 tid , Procardia XL 30 per day , Lasix 20 mg q3 days .;;;;;;;;

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :;;;;;;;;
Mr. He is a 77 year old male with squamous cell carcinoma of the lung .;;;;;;;;
The initial presentation was the orifice of the right upper lobe with mediastinoscopy positive for subcarinal lymph node .;;;;;;;;
He received 6,000 rads to his mediastinum with external beam .;;;;;;;;
Subsequently , he returned to Goo where he received another 3,000 rads via an endobronchial catheter , apparently due to recurrence .;;;;;;;;

ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :;;;;;;;;
History of colon cancer , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , obesity , hypertension , history of myocardial infarction .;;;;;;;;
SPECIAL PROCEDURES AND OPERATIONS :;;;;;;;;
January 3 , 1994 , median sternotomy with mediastinal exploration , radical resection of tumor and aortopulmonary window ; partial resection of adjacent lung , en bloc resection of vagus and phrenic nerves ; partial pericardectomy ; fiberoptic bronchoscopy .;;;;;
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :;;;;;;;;
The patient is a 66 year old white female with metastatic colon carcinoma with a mass in the left superhilar region , who presents for bronchoscopy , mediastinal exploration and resection .;;;;;;;;
The patient was in her usual state of health until she experienced the onset of abdominal pain in early 1992 .;;;;;;;;
In December of 1992 , she underwent a transverse colectomy for colon carcinoma which was Duke 's grade B-II , lymph nodes were negative .;;;;;;;;
She received postoperative chemotherapy .;;;;;;;;
In September of 1992 , she underwent an exploratory laparotomy because of an increased level of CEA in her blood with the presence of a liver abnormality on computerized tomography scan .;;;;;;;;
The exploratory laparotomy was negative .;;;;;;;;
She continued to have a rise in her CEA level which prompted a further work up .;;;;;;;;
In September of 1993 , an abdominal and pelvic computerized tomography scan was negative and in June of 1993 , she had a negative bone scan .;;;;;;;;
In December of 1994 , a thoracic computerized tomography scan showed a four centimeter soft tissue mass on the left suprahilar region , adjacent to the aortopulmonary window .;;;;;;;;
She also experienced increased hoarseness over the preceding months , which was due to left vocal cord paralysis .;;;;;;;;
She also complains of increased shortness of breath for the preceding month and now presents for mediastinal exploration and resection of her probable metastatic mass .;;;;;;;;
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :;;;;;;;;
The patient has a history of hypertension , coronary artery disease , previous myocardial infarction in 1983 , hypothyroidism , history of breast cancer and history of colon cancer .;;;;;;;;
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :;;;;;;;;
The past surgical history is notable for a 1971 mastectomy on the right , 1937 appendectomy , 1991 cholecystectomy , 1992 transverse colectomy , 1992 exploratory laparotomy , 1991 bilateral cataract surgery .;;;;;;;;
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :;;;;;;;;
Levoxine 0.125 mg PO q.day , Vasotec 10 mg PO b.i.d. , Maxzide 75/50 , 30 mg PO q.day .;;;;;;;;
ALLERGIES :;;;;;;;;
The patient is allergic to sulfa .;;;;;;;;
HABITS :;;;;;;;;
50 pack year smoking history , still smoking currently .;;;;;;;;
Ethanol :;;;;;;;;
none .;;;;;;;;
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :;;;;;;;;
On physical examination , she is an obese white female in no acute distress with a hoarse voice .;;;;;;;;
The head , eyes , ears , nose , throat examination shows that she is normocephalic , atraumatic , extra ocular movements are intact , pupils equal , round , reactive to light and accommodation , and the oropharynx was clear , neck was supple without lymphadenopathy , either axillary or supraclavicular .;;;;;;;;
Chest is clear with decreased breath sounds at the left base .;;;;;;;;
She has a previous right mastectomy .;;;;;;;;
Cardiovascular exam :;;;;;;;;
regular rate and rhythm , without murmur , rub or gallop .;;;;;;;;
Abdomen :;;;;;;;;
obese with multiple well healed surgical incisions , positive bowel sounds .;;;;;;;;
The rectal examination is guaiac negative without masses .;;;;;;;;
Extremities :;;;;;;;;
no clubbing , cyanosis or edema .;;;;;;;;
The neurological examination is nonfocal .;;;;;;;;
HOSPITAL COURSE :;;;;;;;;
The patient was admitted to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital .;;;;;;;;
The patient was brought to the Operating Room on January 3 , 1994 where she underwent a median sternotomy with removal of her mediastinal mass .;;;;;;;;
This mass was situated in the aortopulmonary window and was sent to pathology .;;;;;;;;
The frozen section analysis revealed this to be adenocarcinoma , metastatic disease from the colon most likely .;;;;;;;;
She had a chest tube placed intraoperatively and another placed postoperatively in the recovery room , for what was presumed to be a left pleural effusion .;;;;;;;;
This tube drained only a small amount of fluid and it was likely that the effusion was made to look more severe in the presence of left hemidiaphragm elevation .;;;;;;;;
This additional chest tube was removed the following day .;;;;;;;;
Her postoperative hematocrit was 31 , compared to a preoperative level of 43 .;;;;;;;;
Her postoperative recovery was really quite remarkable .;;;;;;;;
Mediastinal chest tube was removed on postoperative day three .;;;;;;;;
The patient was discharged home in stable condition on postoperative day six .;;;;;;;;
DOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :;;;;;;;;
Percocet for pain .;;;;;;;;

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :;;;;;;;;
The patient is a 65 year old female , status post a right colectomy for colon cancer , now with some question of hepatic metastases .;;;;;;;;
She has received postoperative chemotherapy .;;;;;;;;
She has had some right sided abdominal pain and apparently had a computerized tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging study at an outside hospital that showed a question of hepatic metastases .;;;;;;;;
She was referred to Dr. Duhenile and is now scheduled for ultrasound , magnetic resonance imaging study , angiography and possible surgical resection .;;;;;;;;

3. Maxzide .;;;;;;;;
SOCIAL HISTORY :;;;;;;;;
The patient is a nondrinker and has a 30 pack year smoking history .;;;;;;;;
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :;;;;;;;;
On physical examination , her vital signs included a temperature of 98.2 , blood pressure of 122/72 , heart rate of 100 , she was in no respiratory distress .;;;;;;;;
The head , eyes , ears , nose , throat examination :;;;;;;;;
no scleral icterus .;;;;;;;;
Her neck was supple , no adenopathy .;;;;;;;;
Her lungs were clear to auscultation and percussion .;;;;;;;;
Cardiovascular exam :;;;;;;;;
regular rate and rhythm .;;;;;;;;
The abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended , obese , well healed incisions , no hepatomegaly .;;;;;;;;
LABORATORY DATA :;;;;;;;;
significant for a hematocrit of 41.8 , white blood count of 7.0 , alkaline phosphatase 133 , total bilirubin 0.6 , direct bilirubin 0.2 , prothrombin time 9.4 , partial thromboplastin time of 25.0 .;;;;;;;;
The admission chest X-ray showed bilateral apical calcific densities that were felt to be consistent with granulomas .;;;;;;;;
HOSPITAL COURSE :;;;;;;;;
The patient was admitted and underwent abdominal ultrasound , which was more consistent with a cystic lesion .;;;;;;;;
She also had a magnetic resonance imaging study , which suggested cyst or hemangioma .;;;;;;;;
However , a computerized tomography scan suggested a solid mass .;;;;;;;;
Given the uncertainty , decision was made to proceed with angiography and exploration to resolve the issue .;;;;;;;;
A mesenteric angiogram on 11-27-92 demonstrated no variant anatomy , the venous phase being okay , and no other abnormalities .;;;;;;;;
On 11-28-92 , the patient was brought to the Operating Room where she underwent exploratory laparotomy , total mobilization of the liver with intraoperative ultrasound , resection of fat necrosis of the small bowel mesentery and extensive lysis of adhesions .;;;;;;;;
Dr. Besti Kotebreun of the Radiology Service performed intraoperative ultrasound , and carefully looked at the entire liver .;;;;;;;;
The mass that had been seen on computerized tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging study proved to be a simple cyst and the rest of the liver looked perfectly normal .;;;;;;;;
The patient tolerated the procedure well and postoperatively had a relatively uneventful course .;;;;;;;;
She was advanced slowly to a regular diet .;;;;;;;;
She did have some persistent fever after the operation with a white blood count in the 14-15,000 range and on the day of discharge , her temperature was in the 101 range .;;;;;;;;
She said that she routinely runs fevers to 101 or 102 at home and has for years , and insisted upon going home .;;;;;;;;
This seemed reasonable given there was no identifiable source for a fever at the time of discharge and she promised close follow up for any problems .;;;;;;;;
It should be noted that her CEA upon admission was 13.9 , indicating that she must have tumor somewhere .;;;;;;;;
She underwent a computerized tomography scan of the chest prior to discharge , which demonstrated no evidence of pulmonary metastases .;;;;;;;;
She also underwent a bone scan by Nuclear Radiology , which demonstrated no findings suggestive of metastatic disease .;;;;;;;;
Her pathology report was as follows :;;;;;;;;
1. mesenteric nodule was adipose tissue with fibrosis and fat necrosis with no evidence of malignancy ,;;;;;;;;
2. peripancreatic mesentery , small bowel biopsy was adipose tissue with fibrosis and fat necrosis with no evidence of malignancy , and;;;;;;;;
3. lymph node excision from the periportal region was no evidence of malignancy .;;;;;;;;
The patient was discharged home in stable condition on 12-04-92 .;;;;;;;;

PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :;;;;;;;;
left carotid endarterectomy 09/22/93 .;;;;;;;;
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :;;;;;;;;
This 75 year old Hispanic male with insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and peripheral vascular disease , status post a middle cerebral artery cerebrovascular accident was admitted for left carotid endarterectomy .;;;;;;;;
His history of present illness began with a worsening left toe ulcer in 06/93 resulting in a left great toe amputation .;;;;;;;;
Approximately two days following discharge , his family members noted that his behavior had changed , including personality changes , confusion and self-neglect;;;;;;;;
On 08/07/93 he was admitted to Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital where an magnetic resonance imaging study confirmed a 4 centimeter infarct in the left frontoparietal and temporal areas without evidence of bleeding .;;;;;;;;
He was noted to have calcified vertebral artery .;;;;;;;;
His infarct was felt to be consistent with a superior middle cerebral infarct .;;;;;;;;
At that time Holter monitor showed no abnormalities .;;;;;;;;
An echocardiogram was reportedly normal and an MRI angiogram documented a 95% occlusion of his left coronary artery .;;;;;;;;
He was sent home on Coumadin for follow up with Vascular Surgery for carotid endarterectomy and presented on 09/18/93 for his procedure .;;;;;;;;
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :;;;;;;;;
insulin dependent diabetes mellitus for five years and peripheral vascular disease , status post a right above knee amputation in 1987 for gangrene and status post his left great toe amputation in 06/93 .;;;;;;;;
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :;;;;;;;;
Included Coumadin 2.5 mg. g with 5 mg. d , Lasix 40 mg. q.day and NPH insulin 55 units sub-cu. qam .;;;;;;;;
SUBSTANCE HISTORY :;;;;;;;;
Notable for remote alcohol abuse .;;;;;;;;
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :;;;;;;;;
He was reportedly well-appearing with a temperature of 99.7 , blood pressure of 140/86 , heart rate of 92 and respiratory rate of 20 .;;;;;;;;
HEENT was normocephalic , atraumatic with a supple neck and no lymphadenopathy .;;;;;;;;
Lungs demonstrated bilateral bibasilar crackles .;;;;;;;;
Cardiac exam :;;;;;;;;
regular rate and rhythm , S1 , S2 , and a systolic flow murmur was noted .;;;;;;;;
His abdomen was reportedly soft , nontender with normoactive bowel sounds .;;;;;;;;
Extremities showed no evidence of clubbing , cyanosis or edema .;;;;;;;;
Pulses were markedly diminished bilaterally .;;;;;;;;
Radially the left carotid pulse was felt to be stronger than the right and the left dorsalis pedis pulse was 1+ .;;;;;;;;
Bilateral carotid bruits were noted as well .;;;;;;;;
Neurologic exam was notable for disorientation to time , increased tone in his left upper extremity and slight right facial droop and a markedly decreased gag on the right side .;;;;;;;;
The deep tendon reflexes were present and symmetric .;;;;;;;;
LABORATORY DATA :;;;;;;;;
sodium of 138 , potassium of 4.4 , chloride of 101 , bicarbonate 30.9 , BUN of 16 , creatinine 1.0 , glucose of 283 , hematocrit of 41.5 , white blood count of 6.7 with 50% polys , 29% lymphs .;;;;;;;;
Platelet count of 224,000 , prothrombin time of 12.2 , partial thromboplastin time of 30.9 .;;;;;;;;
His admission electrocardiogram was normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 90 with PR interval of .14 , QRS of .08 with ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities consistent with apical lateral subendocardial ischemia relative to the August 7 , 1993 electrocardiogram .;;;;;;;;
HOSPITAL COURSE :;;;;;;;;
Mr. Iron was admitted to the Ossontonville Milt Ywestmeadtl Marlenc Hospital where he underwent preoperative evaluation .;;;;;;;;
A medical consultation was obtained for his abnormal electrocardiogram with recommendation for a Persantine Thallium study .;;;;;;;;
On 09/21/93 he underwent a Persantine Thallium study with no complaints of chest pain .;;;;;;;;
His heart rate went from 70 to 84 , 63% maximal predicted heart rate .;;;;;;;;
Blood pressure was unchanged .;;;;;;;;
After Persantine infusion , electrocardiogram showed 1 to 2 millimeter downsloping ST-depressions , V4 through V6 , 0.5 to 1 millimeter ST-depressions in 1 , 2 and AVF .;;;;;;;;
The changes returned to baseline after intravenous Aminophylline was administered .;;;;;;;;
The test was felt to be positive for ischemia and Thallium images demonstrated a small amount of inferoapical ischemia as well as left ventricular dilatation upon exercise and normal pulmonary uptake .;;;;;;;;
On 09/22/93 he underwent an uncomplicated left carotid endarterectomy and was treated intraoperatively with nitroglycerin .;;;;;;;;
On 09/23 he was noted to have asymptomatic ST-depressions of 1 to 2 millimeters in leads 2 , 3 , F , V2 through V6 .;;;;;;;;
He ruled out for a myocardial infarction with serial CPK 's on nitro paste , oxygen , Metoprolol and aspirin .;;;;;;;;
The ST-depressions largely resolved .;;;;;;;;
On 09/26/93 he was transferred to the Medical Service for further evaluation of his cardiovascular status .;;;;;;;;
A Cardiology consult was obtained with recommendations for maximization of medical regimen and deferring cardiac catheterization at that time .;;;;;;;;
His course was also remarkable for adjustments in his insulin regimen with difficult control of his glucose and postoperative anemia treated with iron sulfate .;;;;;;;;
On 09/29/93 he remained hemodynamically stable with his left carotid endarterectomy site healing well .;;;;;;;;
He was discharged home to follow up with Dr. Tiffill Sapnins of Dingclearf Alllirefaith Memorial Hospital and Dr. Dwainco Rallsversgach of Cardiology .;;;;;;;;
He was to follow up as well in the H Health Network for postoperative care .;;;;;;;;

DIAGNOSES :;;;;;;;;
Aortic stenosis .;;;;;;;;
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :;;;;;;;;
Stenosis of porcine aortic valve with fibrous pannus formation , coronary disease , status post aortic valve replacement and coronary artery bypass grafting , manic depressive disorder , left ventricular dysfunction , question of basilar artery migraine .;;;;;;;;
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :;;;;;;;;
4-2-93 , right and left heart catheterization ( transeptal ) with coronary graft and left ventriculogram .;;;;;;;;
4-8-93 , open heart aortic valve replacement and bypass of right coronary artery .;;;;;;;;
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :;;;;;;;;
Mr. No is a 65 year old male who , in 1986 , had a coronary artery bypass grafting procedure at Noughwell Entanbon Health in Stoningi , Kansas .;;;;;;;;
This involved construction of an internal mammary graft from the left internal mammary artery to the left circumflex , a right internal mammary was anastomosed to the anterior descending and diagonal branch , and a saphenous vein was constructed to the right coronary artery .;;;;;;;;
He did well , but appeared here in 1991 with high grade aortic stenosis , and an ejection fraction of only 23% .;;;;;;;;
He underwent aortic valve replacement with a porcine valve by Dr. G Hemp .;;;;;;;;
Following this , he was followed closely by Dr. Brown in Na .;;;;;;;;
Over the last several months , he has had a recurrence of his congestive heart failure and an echocardiogram performed by Dr. Brown suggested the possibility of the development of aortic stenosis .;;;;;;;;
He also was having some chest tightness , as well as increasing shortness of breath .;;;;;;;;
The patient was referred here for further evaluation .;;;;;;;;
Mr. No suffers from a bipolar mood disorder , together with hypercholesterolemia and vertebral basilar insufficiency .;;;;;;;;
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :;;;;;;;;
On physical examination , the patient was a well developed , stocky gentleman .;;;;;;;;
The blood pressure was 115/80 , pulse 80 , respirations of 20 , venous pressure elevated at 3 cm above the clavicle at 90 degrees .;;;;;;;;
There were very small , barely palpable carotid pulses .;;;;;;;;
There was dullness at the right base , with a high diaphragm and possibly some fluid .;;;;;;;;
The cardiac examination showed a left ventricular tap at the fifth intercostal space left of the midclavicular line .;;;;;;;;
There was a grade II / VI systolic ejection murmur in the aortic area , no third sound , and paradoxical splitting of the second sound .;;;;;;;;
The liver was not palpable .;;;;;;;;
There were diminished pulses in the legs .;;;;;;;;
LABORATORY DATA :;;;;;;;;
The hemoglobin was 14.4 grams percent , white blood count 6,900 , platelet count 125,000 , sodium 137 mEq. per liter , potassium of 4.7 , BUN and creatinine of 23 and 1.3 mg percent .;;;;;;;;
The electrocardiogram showed left ventricular hypertrophy and non-specific ST-T wave changes .;;;;;;;;
The chest film showed massive cardiomegaly with pulmonary venous engorgement .;;;;;;;;
HOSPITAL COURSE :;;;;;;;;
I indicated to Dr. Brown that I had never seen a situation in which an adult had stenosed aortic valve so rapidly , but certainly his clinical signs suggested aortic stenosis .;;;;;;;;
Accordingly , on April 2 , 1993 , he underwent a cardiac catheterization .;;;;;;;;
The study showed that the right internal mammary and left internal mammary artery grafts were patent to the distal vessels .;;;;;;;;
The right saphenous vein graft was also patent , but there was a high grade narrowing in the vessel beyond it .;;;;;;;;
Using transeptal catheterization , he proved to have a 70 mm gradient across the aortic valve and there was no doubt about his aortic stenosis .;;;;;;;;
The left ventricular contraction showed an ejection fraction of around 25% .;;;;;;;;
An attempt at transesophageal echocardiogram was unsuccessful , because the patient was not cooperative .;;;;;;;;
On April 8 , 1993 , Dr. G Hemp performed open heart surgery .;;;;;;;;
At the time of operation , the porcine valve showed a heavy fibrous pannus underneath the valve , and there was what looked like organized thrombus in the leaflets which impeded leaflet movement .;;;;;;;;
There was no calcification of the valve , and no clear evidence of infection .;;;;;;;;
I have in fact never seen anything quite like this on an aortic porcine valve .;;;;;;;;
The valve was replaced , and a saphenous vein graft was then constructed from the distal saphenous vein graft that was already in place to the distal right coronary artery beyond the obstruction .;;;;;;;;
The surgery was very difficult , because of a great deal of scarring from the previous operation , but generally things went along smoothly .;;;;;;;;
Mr. No was on the pump for 2 hours and 25 minutes , with an aortic crossclamp time of 1 hour and 48 minutes .;;;;;;;;
Postoperatively , the patient was extubated on the first postoperative day .;;;;;;;;
He had a good deal of pulmonary congestion .;;;;;;;;
He seemed to be doing well until the morning of 4-13-93 when he suddenly became pulseless .;;;;;;;;
There was no evidence of ventricular fibrillation .;;;;;;;;
Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was immediately undertaken , but was not successful .;;;;;;;;
The patient had his chest opened for any evidence of tamponade and there was no evidence of bleeding .;;;;;;;;
The heart appeared to be flaccid .;;;;;;;;
We really have no good explanation of what this was all about .;;;;;;;;
He was being treated for a possible pneumonia .;;;;;;;;
He did have a good deal of pulmonary congestion , but this occurred suddenly and unexpectedly .;;;;;;;;
Cardiopulmonary resuscitation efforts were carried out for virtually one hour , but were unsuccessful .;;;;;;;;
The patient was pronounced dead on the morning of 4-13-93 .;;;;;;;;
A post mortem examination will be performed .;;;;;;;;

DISCHARGE DATE :;;;;;;;;
02-01-92 The patient is an 80 year old right-handed female who is a nun whose admission to Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital on the 11th was the first for her .;;;;;;;;
She was admitted with a subarachnoid hemorrhage presumed to have occurred nine days prior to admission .;;;;;;;;
She was admitted with confusion and a left internal carotid artery aneurysm present on MR angiogram .;;;;;;;;
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :;;;;;;;;
On 01/03/92 the patient was noted to have nausea and a marked increase in her mild baseline confusion of several years duration .;;;;;;;;
She was transferred to a facility at Atl Mil , Maryland in Oakwest on 01/10/92 with a headache , nausea and worsening confusion as well as incomprehensible speech .;;;;;;;;
She was not able to follow commands and had a low grade temperature with a question of a right facial droop .;;;;;;;;
She was then transferred to Box Memorial Hospital Nursing Home where a lumbar puncture revealed a few red blood cells and white blood cells but also showed marked xanthochromia .;;;;;;;;
She did not reveal any meningismus .;;;;;;;;
The patient was transferred to Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital and referred under the care of Dr. Telshey Peg by Dr. Rerhea T. Hearing of Box Memorial Hospital Nursing Home .;;;;;;;;
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :;;;;;;;;
includes hypertension , cataract od. , urinary incontinence x 2 years and hearing aids .;;;;;;;;
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :;;;;;;;;
includes coronary artery bypass grafting in 08/91 in the Ona Hospital .;;;;;;;;
Apparently the patient has had no angina or congestive heart failure since .;;;;;;;;
Bilateral knee replacements in 1973 .;;;;;;;;
Carpal tunnel releases in 1982 and 1965.;;;;;;;;
cholecystectomy in 1967 .;;;;;;;;
Hysterectomy in 1952 .;;;;;;;;
Right heart biopsy in 1990 which was benign .;;;;;;;;
FAMILY HISTORY :;;;;;;;;
was noncontributory .;;;;;;;;
MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER :;;;;;;;;
included Percocet , Tenormin , Xanax , Mevacor and with a history of of Calan , Ornade and Lasix .;;;;;;;;
ALLERGIES :;;;;;;;;
There were no known drug allergies .;;;;;;;;
HABITS :;;;;;;;;
did not include tobacco or alcohol ingestion .;;;;;;;;
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :;;;;;;;;
On physical examination on admission the patient was somnolent but conversant , oriented x 1 only .;;;;;;;;
Chest was clear .;;;;;;;;
Heart had regular rate and rhythm .;;;;;;;;
Neck was supple without mass or bruits .;;;;;;;;
The abdomen was soft and nontender .;;;;;;;;
Calves were nontender .;;;;;;;;
On neuro exam the patient was somnolent but readily arousable to conversation .;;;;;;;;
She looked at the examiner and carried an appropriate conversation but only for seconds at a time .;;;;;;;;
Her face was strong and symmetric .;;;;;;;;
She felt pin prick and light touch bilaterally to the face symmetrically .;;;;;;;;
Her extra ocular movements were full without nystagmus .;;;;;;;;
She sees light only od. which is chronic .;;;;;;;;
She reads large print os.;;;;;;;;
Her tongue was midline and her palate elevated symmetrically .;;;;;;;;
She could not maintain her arms long enough to detect drift .;;;;;;;;
She also lifted both legs and flexes at the knees .;;;;;;;;
Her grip is 5/5 bilaterally .;;;;;;;;
Ankle dorsiflexion and plantar flexion were 5/5 bilaterally .;;;;;;;;
LABORATORY DATA :;;;;;;;;
On admission her labs. were notable for a hematocrit of 41.9 , white blood count 11.1 , MCV 87 , sodium 142 , potassium 3.0 , chloride 101 , bicarb. 29.3 , BUN 13 , creatinine 0.9 and sugar 134 .;;;;;;;;
A head CT performed on 01/10/92 revealed no cerebrovascular accident and no evidence of acute blood .;;;;;;;;
MRA / MRI revealed a left internal carotid artery aneurysm about 7 mm. in width .;;;;;;;;
HOSPITAL COURSE :;;;;;;;;
The patient was admitted to Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital where a four vessel cerebral angiogram was performed on 01/13/92 .;;;;;;;;
This revealed a lobulated aneurysm at the p. comm. origin on the left .;;;;;;;;
This was a left internal carotid artery aneurysm .;;;;;;;;
The internal carotid arteries and middle cerebral artery showed irregularity of caliber probably due to atherosclerosis .;;;;;;;;
After much discussion , endovascular treatment with GD coils were recommended .;;;;;;;;
The patient underwent coiling on 01/14/92 .;;;;;;;;
This showed that 60-70% of the distal aneurysm was obliterated by the coils .;;;;;;;;
One coil protruded into the lumen of the left internal carotid artery aneurysm .;;;;;;;;
It was thought that the risk of subarachnoid hemorrhage was low but still substantial from the untreated proximal lobe .;;;;;;;;
Also the risk of ischemia or infarct from the internal carotid artery coil could lead to thromboembolism .;;;;;;;;
Therefore the lowest overall risk was thought to be a craniotomy to obliterate the aneurysm and possibly remove the protruding coil .;;;;;;;;
Therefore after discussion in detail with Sister Rora Dose , a left pterional craniotomy was performed on 01/15/92 .;;;;;;;;
At this time it was noted that the left internal carotid artery aneurysm was mostly within the cavernous sinus and the extracavernous portion was extremely atherosclerotic .;;;;;;;;
Therefore no clip was possible and the patient underwent a muslin wrapping of the aneurysm .;;;;;;;;
The patient postoperatively was able to open her eyes to voice and name .;;;;;;;;
Her pupils were equal and reactive and she was able to localize with the left upper extremity as well as raise the right upper extremity above the bed .;;;;;;;;
Her consciousness as well as her strength improved gradually and the patient was referred for rehabilitation at a chronic care center .;;;;;;;;
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :;;;;;;;;
subarachnoid hemorrhage and left internal carotid artery aneurysm .;;;;;;;;
PROCEDURES :;;;;;;;;
On 01/13/92 four vessel cerebral angiogram .;;;;;;;;
01/14/92 embolization of the left internal carotid artery aneurysm .;;;;;;;;
01/15/92 left pterional craniotomy for left internal carotid artery aneurysm with exploration and muslin wrap of the aneurysm .;;;;;;;;
COMPLICATIONS :;;;;;;;;
There were no noted complications .;;;;;;;;
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :;;;;;;;;
include heparin 5000 units sq. b.i.d. , MOM 30 cc. p.o. q. hs. , Dulcolax 10 mg. p.o. b.i.d. p.r.n. , Tenormin 50 mg. p.o. b.i.d. , Calan 60 mg. p.o. t.i.d. , Omeprazole 20 mg. p.o.q.d. , Lasix 20 mg. p.o. b.i.d. , potassium chloride 40 mEq. p.o. b.i.d. , Dilantin 200 mg. p.o. b.i.d. , Lotrimin to groin t.i.d. , Droperidol .625 mg. po 1.25 mg. m. q. 6 p.r.n. , Dulcolax 1 pr. q.d. p.r.n. , Tylenol 975 mg. q. 6 p.r.n. and CZI sliding scale b.i.d.;;;;;;;;
The patient has increased her p.o. intake however given her uncertain p.o. intake the patient was not started on a p.o. antidiabetic regimen .;;;;;;;;
Therefore we suggest a fasting blood sugar q.d. for several days after discharge .;;;;;;;;
If the fasting blood sugar remains greater than 160 we would have the local M.D. consider starting the patient on p.o. medications such as Glyburide .;;;;;;;;
This may include Tolinase at 100 mg. p.o. q. am .;;;;;;;;

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :;;;;;;;;
Osteochondromatosis , right knee .;;;;;;;;
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :;;;;;;;;
This 68 year old white male who had a seven to eight year history of knee pain .;;;;;;;;
In 1984 , he had the right knee aspirated and was noted to have some uric acid crystals , although serum uric acid was normal and erythrocyte sedimentation rate .;;;;;;;;
He continued to have intermittent symptoms and was noted to have some fullness in the suprapatellar pouch .;;;;;;;;
Plain films taken by his orthopedist in Mongcana Ster Staarv revealed some soft tissue calcification within the medial and lateral compartments of the joint .;;;;;;;;
an magnetic resonance imaging study demonstrated calcification densities in the suprapatellar bursa region , also with hypertrophia of the synovium .;;;;;;;;
It was felt that the patient had synovial chondromatosis and would benefit from an open synovectomy and debridement .;;;;;;;;
He was admitted for that procedure .;;;;;;;;

Dilated cardiomyopathy .;;;;;;;;
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :;;;;;;;;
Interstitial lung disease , mitral regurgitation , systolic hypertension , status post myocardial infarction , transurethral resection of prostate , inguinal hernia repair , shingles , cataracts , ulcer disease , gout , mediastinal mass , thymoma .;;;;;;;;
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :;;;;;;;;

ADVERSE DRUG REACTIONS :;;;;;;;;
None .;;;;;;;;
CLINICAL INFECTIONS :;;;;;;;;
None .;;;;;;;;
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :;;;;;;;;
Mr. Nertland is an 84-year-old man who was admitted with decompensated heart failure .;;;;;;;;
The patient has a long standing history of significant left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe mitral regurgitation and moderate aortic stenosis .;;;;;;;;
He was recently hospitalized at the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital for repeat cardiac catheterization .;;;;;;;;
After a comprehensive assessment , Drs. Sieh and Shufffyfe did not recommend operative repair of severe mitral regurgitation or aortic stenosis .;;;;;;;;
He was thus discharged with plans for continued medical therapy of his coronary artery disease .;;;;;;;;
Unfortunately , the patient continued to deteriorate and was readmitted for an attempt at hemodynamic tailoring and possible inotropic support .;;;;;;;;
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :;;;;;;;;
Is notable for above .;;;;;;;;
For long standing dilated cardiomyopathy , severe mitral regurgitation and moderate aortic stenosis with a calculated aortic valve area of 1.1 by previous catheterization .;;;;;;;;
The patient had limited coronary artery disease with an occluded right coronary artery collateralized from the left system .;;;;;;;;
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :;;;;;;;;
The patient was a well appearing pleasant man who was dyspneic on the examining table .;;;;;;;;
Initial blood pressure was 95/65 , heart rate 80 and regular .;;;;;;;;
Respiratory rate was 14 .;;;;;;;;
Jugular venous pressure was 7 with modest hepatojugular reflex .;;;;;;;;
The carotids were 2+ and the lungs were notable for diminished breath sounds with inspiratory rhonchi .;;;;;;;;
The point of maximum impulse was displaced and the first and second heart sounds were unremarkable with a 2/6 murmur of mitral regurgitation .;;;;;;;;
There was no S3 gallop .;;;;;;;;
Abdomen was soft and non-tender and the rest of the examination was notable only for a slightly diminished pulses and poor perfusion .;;;;;;;;
LABORATORY DATA :;;;;;;;;
Notable for a sodium of 144 , potassium 3.7 , BUN 43 , creatinine 1.8 , albumin 3.0 , hematocrit 36 , white count 9.5 , platelet count 254 and a negative urinalysis .;;;;;;;;
A chest x-ray revealed moderate cardiomegaly with modest edema and the electrocardiogram revealed a normal sinus rhythm with left axis deviation , previous inferior apical infarct and right bundle branch block .;;;;;;;;
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :;;;;;;;;
The patient was admitted to the hospital and underwent right heart catheterization which revealed a right atrial pressure of 11 , pulmonary artery pressure of 55/25 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 26 and a cardiac output of 2.7 liters per minute .;;;;;;;;
The PA line was kept in place while the patient was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit where he underwent an attempt at hemodynamic tailoring .;;;;;;;;
Initially Nipride was begun with some augmentation of the cardiac index but eventually a fall of the cardiac index to 1.8 .;;;;;;;;
The patient was then begun on Milrinone to a dose of .4 mcg. per kg. per minute with improvement in his cardiac index to approximately 2.0 and a corresponding fall in his filling pressures .;;;;;;;;
Because of the increased ectopy that appeared to be temporally associated with this infusion , the patient was switched to Dobutamine and titrated to a dose of 250 mcg. per minute .;;;;;;;;
On Dobutamine the cardiac index was 2.4-2.7 and at the end of his hemodynamic tailoring which included vigorous diuresis and the addition of Isordil and Captopril back to his chronic medical program , the patient 's right atrial pressure was 6 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was 9 and the cardiac index was 2.7 .;;;;;;;;
Systemic vascular resistance was 900 .;;;;;;;;
The patient was then decannulated and sent to the floor with improvement in his central hemodynamics .;;;;;;;;
Over the subsequent days of his hospitalization , the patient had adjustment of his diuretic program .;;;;;;;;
At discharge his goal weight will be 120 pounds and he will be maintained on a chronic Dobutamine infusion at 250 mcg. per minute .;;;;;;;;
Should he tachy phylax to this which is inevitable , he will be begun on a home Milrinone infusion per previous protocol .;;;;;;;;
The patient on the dose of Dobutamine noted , had little in the way of resting symptoms and was without paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , and orthopnea and able to ambulate approximately 100-150 feet without dyspnea .;;;;;;;;
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :;;;;;;;;
Lasix 20 mg. q.day .;;;;;;;;
Isordil 10 mg. t.i.d. Aldactone 25 mg. q.d. Digoxin .125 mg. q.d. Plavix 75 mg. q.d. Allopurinol 100 mg. q.d.;;;;;;;;
Serevent and Flovent inhalers the patient b.i.d. Zoloft 25 mg. q.d. Nexium 40 mg. b.i.d. Captopril 25 mg. t.i.d. Zocor 20 mg. q.d. Seroquel 25 mg. q.d.;;;;;;;;
The patient will be maintained with a goal weight of 120 pounds .;;;;;;;;
Should his weight fall below 118 pounds , then he has been instructed to hold his Lasix .;;;;;;;;
Should his weight increase above 122 pounds , then the patient will take 40 mg. of Lasix a day .;;;;;;;;
FOLLOW UP :;;;;;;;;
He will be followed closely by Dr. Sieh and Mizy Flomhemp of the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital Heart Failure Program .;;;;;;;;
In addition he will seen as necessary by Dr. Ri Tlandmaul of the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital Psychiatry Service .;;;;;;;;

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :;;;;;;;;
Mr. Warm is an 83 year old man with chronic congestive heart failure , mitral regurgitation and aortic stenosis who was admitted for diagnostic cardiac catheterization .;;;;;;;;
Over the last four to five months , Mr. Warm has noted a marked decline in functional capacity with nearly daily PND and orthopnea .;;;;;;;;
He has not experienced recent syncope but did have a syncopal episode in 1 resulting in implantation of a defibrillator .;;;;;;;;
Although in the past , he has been somewhat ambivalent with respect to cardiac surgery , given the decline in his functional capacity , he agreed to undergo repeat cardiac catheterization with a view towards defining his candidacy for cardiac surgery .;;;;;;;;
The patient lives independently with his wife in Connecticut and continues to be less and less active unfortunately .;;;;;;;;
He has nearly curtailed his trips to a gymnasium for cardiopulmonary exercising .;;;;;;;;
He does not drink alcohol and does not smoke cigarettes .;;;;;;;;
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION :;;;;;;;;
On examination , the patient was an extraordinarily pleasant man who appeared his stated age .;;;;;;;;
His blood pressure was 110/70 .;;;;;;;;
Heart was 82 and regular .;;;;;;;;
Respiratory rate was 16 .;;;;;;;;
His jugular venous pressure was not elevated and his carotids were 2+ .;;;;;;;;
Lungs were notable for adequate air movement with no rales .;;;;;;;;
The first and second heart sounds were physiologically split and the cardiac impulse was rather diffuse and inferiorly displaced .;;;;;;;;
There was an S3 gallop at the apex and a 2/6 murmur of mitral regurgitation at the apex which radiated to the axilla .;;;;;;;;
The abdomen was soft and nontender .;;;;;;;;
There was no organomegaly but modest hepatojugular reflex .;;;;;;;;
The extremities were without edema and were warm and well perfused .;;;;;;;;
The posterior tibialis pulses were intact .;;;;;;;;
LABORATORY DATA :;;;;;;;;
Sodium 140 , potassium 5.0 , BUN 45 , creatinine 1.9 , glucose 90 .;;;;;;;;
Albumin 3.6 , hematocrit 41 , white count 8.6 , platelets 388 and PT 12.6 seconds .;;;;;;;;
The chest X-ray revealed cardiomegaly and no significant congestion .;;;;;;;;
The ECG was paced .;;;;;;;;
An outpatient echocardiogram revealed a left atrium of 45 mms. , an LV of 60 mms. , ejection fraction of 26% , moderate to severe mitral regurgitation by color and spectral Doppler , aortic stenosis with a valve area of .8 cms. squared with a peak gradient of 50 , a mean gradient of 30 , an ejection fraction of 26% with diffuse left ventricular hypokinesis and more severe inferior hypokinesis .;;;;;;;;
There was mild tricuspid insufficiency , an estimated RV peak systolic pressure of 55 and a mild diffuse hypokinesis of the right ventricle .;;;;;;;;
HOSPITAL COURSE :;;;;;;;;
The patient was admitted to the hospital following uncomplicated cardiac catheterization that revealed a right atrial pressure of 5 , a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 23 , pulmonary artery pressure of 56/22 with a mean of 36 , a cardiac output of 6.1 liters per minute with a cardiac index of 3.8 liters per minute per meter squared .;;;;;;;;
The aortic valve gradient was approximately 32 mms of Mercury peak with a calculated aortic valve area of 1.1 cms. squared .;;;;;;;;
Coronary angiography revealed occlusion of the dominant right coronary artery in the proximal segment with distal reconstitution via left to right collaterals .;;;;;;;;
Left ventriculography revealed a dilated , diffusely and severe hypokinetic left ventricle with the anterior basilar wall best perfused and an ejection fraction of 18% .;;;;;;;;
There was 3+ mitral regurgitation and reflux into the pulmonary veins in the ------ views .;;;;;;;;
In addition , there was a 60% lesion in the left circumflex artery and only minimal irregularities in the left anterior descending itself .;;;;;;;;
The patient tolerated the procedure well apart from a small rise in his creatinine to 2.3 which returned to his baseline value of approximately 1.7 to 1.9 at the time of discharge after holding his diuretics and his vasodilator medications .;;;;;;;;
The patient was seen in consultation by Dr. Win Shufffyfe of the Cardiac Surgery Service and after a long discussion with the patient , Dr. Shufffyfe and the patient 's family , it was decided to defer cardiac surgery likely indefinitely and probably permanently given the patient 's age , co-morbidities , lack of probable benefit with relief of his mitral regurgitation , modest aortic stenosis and relatively modest coronary artery disease .;;;;;;;;
While in hospital , the patient was seen by Lenni Breutzoln who felt that the incremental benefit from biventricular pacing was likely to be modest .;;;;;;;;
The patient also underwent a sleep study which revealed evidence for fairly advanced and severe obstructive sleep apnea with multiple hypopneas and apneas , mean duration of which was approximately 30 seconds with one episodes of 68 seconds with a desaturation to 71% .;;;;;;;;
The patient was fitted with a CPAP apparatus with titration of 8-12 cms. of water as tolerated as an outpatient .;;;;;;;;
In addition , the patient had oxygen therapy given his prominent desaturation at night .;;;;;;;;
At the time of discharge , the patient 's vasodilator regimen had been winnowed appreciably and he was discharged with a goal weight of 125 lbs .;;;;;;;;
He will be followed both by Dr. Warm closely upon return to his son 's home in Connecticut and by Gie Lung of the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital Heart Failure Partners Home Care Program .;;;;;;;;

CAUSE OF DEATH :;;;;;;;;
Cardiogenic shock .;;;;;;;;
CAUSATIVE FACTORS :;;;;;;;;
Including cardiomyopathy , aortic stenosis , status post aortic valve replacement , coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass grafting with congestive heart failure and pulmonary edema .;;;;;;;;
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :;;;;;;;;
The patient is a 65 year old male who sustained a small myocardial infarction first in 1978 , with course thereafter including a coronary artery bypass graft by Dr. Wierst ______________at Noughwell Entanbon Health in 1986 .;;;;;;;;
In 1991 he presented with congestive heart failure and he underwent porcine aortic valve replacement .;;;;;;;;
In the seven to eight months preceding admission , he developed recurrent angina with dyspnea on exertion .;;;;;;;;
The patient was admitted for cardiac catheterization in early December , 1993 .;;;;;;;;
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :;;;;;;;;
Significant for vertebrobasilar insufficiency , bipolar mood disorder , and hypercholesterolemia , as well as some baseline renal insufficiency .;;;;;;;;
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :;;;;;;;;
Procardia sustained release 60 mg. po q.day , Digoxin .25 mg. po q.day , Lasix 30 mg. ( interval unspecified ) , Prozac 40 mg. po q.day , Lovestatin 20 mg. po bid , aspirin q. day and supplemental potassium .;;;;;;;;
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :;;;;;;;;
Remarkable for an oriented , alert male in no acute distress with decreased breath sounds at the right base consistent with effusion and a 3/6 systolic murmur consistent with aortic stenosis .;;;;;;;;
His pulse exam was intact .;;;;;;;;
Cardiac catheterization demonstrated elevated right and left-sided filling pressures at rest , with pulmonary hypertension and normal cardiac index .;;;;;;;;
There was severe aortic stenosis of 70 millimeter peak gradient , native three vessel disease with patent left internal mammary artery graft to the left circumflex , dissection of the left main was induced by the catheter tip .;;;;;;;;
A patent right internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending artery and diagonal was noted , and a patent saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery was present .;;;;;;;;
Also of note , pulmonary edema was induced by dye and anxiety and treated with Lasix , Morphine , oxygen and nitroglycerin .;;;;;;;;
Post-procedure he was admitted to the CCU because of the history of left main dissection .;;;;;;;;
He remained hemodynamically stable but of note , would not tolerate a transesophageal echo because of anxiety-he would not swallow the probe .;;;;;;;;
Transthoracic echo demonstrated gradients of 100 peak and 65 mean across the aortic valve and there was mild aortic insufficiency and ejection fraction was noted to be 18% with global hypokinesis .;;;;;;;;
The next several days were remarkable for events in which the patient was quite agitated and was evaluated by Psychiatry and treated with Ativan .;;;;;;;;
The patient was then evaluated by Cardiac Surgery for probable re-do aortic valve replacement and possible re-do coronary artery bypass grafting .;;;;;;;;
In the course of preoperative workup , Mr. Has was evaluated completely by Psychiatry with diagnoses including underlying chronic depression well-controlled on Prozac , underlying organ brain vulnerability of unclear etiology , possibly microvascular infarct , acute paranoid and belligerent behavior , possibly due to medications .;;;;;;;;
On December 12 the patient underwent surgery , including a re-do aortic valve replacement with # 25 St. Jude and re-do coronary artery bypass grafting times one ; saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery as a veno-venous jump graft .;;;;;;;
The total bypass time :;;;;;;;;
2 hours 25 minutes .;;;;;;;;
Total crossclamp time :;;;;;;;;
1 hour and 48 minutes .;;;;;;;;
The patient was admitted to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit postoperatively with stable hemodynamics on Lidocaine at one , Dobutamine at 200 and Nipride .;;;;;;;;
The patient was extubated by postoperative day # 1 but was noted to be relatively hypoxemic with high oxygen requirement .;;;;;;;;
Chest x-ray demonstrating pulmonary edema .;;;;;;;;
Aggressive diuresis was undertaken and the patient responded , albeit sluggishly .;;;;;;;;
In addition , he remained agitated .;;;;;;;;
This was attributed to mild hypoxia and / or his underlying psychiatric diagnoses and he was treated with Haldol appropriately .;;;;;;;;
On day # 2 the patient continued to diurese and this was maintained with the Lasix/ Mannitol infusion .;;;;;;;;
His urine output remained at 150 to 200 cc. an hour .;;;;;;;;
Despite this , his chest x-ray continued to show severe pulmonary edema and the clinical picture correlated .;;;;;;;;
He required anti-hypertensive therapy initially with Nipride which was changed to Hydralazine to avoid shunting .;;;;;;;;
He received several units of packed red blood cells to increase his hematocrit and oncotic pressure .;;;;;;;;
Very early in the morning on postoperative day # 3 , the patient became acutely hypoxic after several hours of marginal oxygenation with respiratory rates in the thirties and the patient was urgently intubated , without complication .;;;;;;;;
With positive pressure ventilation and continued diuresis , his arterial blood gases improved .;;;;;;;;
Throughout this he remained hemodynamically stable .;;;;;;;;
Exception was a ten beat run of ventricular tachycardia which was thought to be ischemic in origin and treated with nitrates and Lidocaine .;;;;;;;;
His chest x-ray blossomed to demonstrate pulmonary infiltrate and the patient began to produce sputum .;;;;;;;;
Infectious Disease consultation was obtained for evaluation of his purulent sputum and the patient was covered with Vancomycin , Ceftazidime and Gentamicin .;;;;;;;;
Cardiology evaluation commented on the patient 's increasing ventricular ectopy and suggested that these were due to an R and T phenomenon from his pacer in the setting of prolonged QT interval .;;;;;;;;
Consequently his Pronestyl was discontinued .;;;;;;;;
In addition , the patient was given magnesium to bring his level above 2 .;;;;;;;;
On the evening of the 18th , the patient continued to remain hemodynamically stable , although his oxygenation was clearly deteriorating and more marginal .;;;;;;;;
On 60% FIO2 his pO2 was 63 .;;;;;;;;
It was increased to 65% with pO2 of 81 .;;;;;;;;
At approximately 7:50 a.m. , house officer was called to the room for blood pressure of 70/40 with falling oxygen saturations .;;;;;;;;
The patient was immediately given 400 mg. of Calcium Chloride i.v. push and ventilator disconnected and the patient manually ventilated .;;;;;;;;
Within one minute , the patient lost his blood pressure and CPR was initiated and code was called .;;;;;;;;
The patient initially continued to have rhythm consistent with EMV and he was bolused with Levophed and given some volume while compressions continued .;;;;;;;;
The patient 's prothrombin time had been 23 early the same morning and tamponade was considered and thoracotomy instruments obtained .;;;;;;;;
The chest was opened partially and through sub-xyphoid area it was determined that there was no evidence of tamponade .;;;;;;;;
Compressions were continued and adequate pulse was felt and arterial blood gases demonstrated adequate oxygenation and perfusion .;;;;;;;;
The patient 's rhythm degenerated to ventricular tachycardia and he was shocked , initially without response but after several doses of Epinephine , one-half mg. of Atropine and a bolus of Lidocaine we were able to obtain a blood pressure and rhythm only briefly , and quickly deteriorated back to ventricular fibrillation .;;;;;;;;
Further attempts at resuscitation were unsuccessful and the patient was pronounced dead at 8:30 a.m.;;;;;;;;
The family has been notified and autopsy consent has been obtained .;;;;;;;;

CLINICAL INFECTIONS :;;;;;;;;
None .;;;;;;;;
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :;;;;;;;;
Cardiac catheterization .;;;;;;;;
ASSOCIATED PROCEDURES :;;;;;;;;

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :;;;;;;;;
Mr. Bridge is an 81-year-old man with a history of restrictive and obstructive lung disease , dilated cardiomyopathy , inferior myocardial infarction , and anterior mediastinal masses admitted with acute onset of pulmonary edema .;;;;;;;;
In the setting of inadvertently decreasing Lasix from 80 mg. po 40 mg. a day Mr. Bridge had sudden onset dyspnea after approximate day and a half prodrome culminating in severe dyspnea .;;;;;;;;
Upon arrival in the Emergency Room Mr. Bridge 's saturations were in the mid 80s and he was promptly rendered more comfortable with high flow oxygen , morphine , and nitrates and intravenous Lasix .;;;;;;;;
Chest x-ray was relatively unrevealing for interstitial or alveolar edema and with clinical improvement ensued with the immediate therapy in the Emergency Room as noted .;;;;;;;;
The patient denied angina , syncope , preceding worsening orthopnea , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , palpitations , chest pain , hematemesis or melena .;;;;;;;;
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :;;;;;;;;
Is notable for an inferior myocardial infarction , restrictive and obstructive lung disease with an FEV1 of .9 and FVC of 1.34 and a moderate at best response to bronchodilators , and a negative sestamibi scan in December , 1999 apart from a severe fixed inferolateral defect , systolic dysfunction with recent echocardiography revealing an LVID of 62 mm. and ejection fraction of 28 percent , moderate mitral regurgitation and mild-to-moderate aortic stenosis with a peak gradient of 33 and a mean gradient of 19 and a valve area of 1.4 cm. squared .;;;;;;;;
In addition , Mr. Bridge has an anterior mediastinal mass 2x2x1.7 cm. by recent computerized tomography scan without surrounding or adjacent adenopathy or parenchymal lung disease apart from bronchiectasis .;;;;;;;;
His cardiomyopathy work up entailed a negative ANA , negative SPEP , UPEP and Benz-Jones proteins , normal ferritin , thyroid stimulating hormone and a recent work up for possible bimomatous associated myasthenia gravis that was negative .;;;;;;;;
The patient lives on Ewi with his wife .;;;;;;;;
He is a non-smoker and drinks rare alcohol .;;;;;;;;
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :;;;;;;;;
The patient was a very pleasant man who appeared his stated age .;;;;;;;;
Blood pressure was 155/60 , heart rate 70 with occasional premature ventricular contractions , respirations 14 .;;;;;;;;
Mr. Bridge was dyspneic speaking in short sentences initially on high flow oxygen .;;;;;;;;
Jugular venous pressure was 8 with a brisk inspiratory descent .;;;;;;;;
There was no thyromegaly .;;;;;;;;
Carotids were 2+ .;;;;;;;;
Breath sounds were decreased at the bases only with distant heart sounds and a 2 out of 6 systolic ejection murmur consistent with aortic stenosis with Gallavardin like radiation to the apex .;;;;;;;;
Abdomen :;;;;;;;;
soft , nontender with hepatosplenomegaly , or hepatojugular reflex , bruits or pulsations .;;;;;;;;
There was no rash and no edema and the neurological examination was non-focal .;;;;;;;;
LABORATORY DATA :;;;;;;;;
Notable for a sodium of 145 , potassium 3.6 , BUN 23 , creatinine 1.3 , glucose 104 , hematocrit 42 , white count 8.7 , platelet count 235 and a PT of 12.9 seconds .;;;;;;;;
The urinalysis was negative .;;;;;;;;
The Troponin I was less than .4 and the creatine kinase was 114 .;;;;;;;;
Chest x-ray revealed moderate cardiomegaly with no clear interstitial or alveolar pulmonary edema and chronic atelectasis and / or scarring at both lung bases .;;;;;;;;
The electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm with premature atrial complexes and right bundle branch block with left anterior hemiblock and old anterior myocardial infarction .;;;;;;;;
HOSPITAL COURSE :;;;;;;;;
The patient was admitted to the Hospital and underwent an approximate 1.5 liter diuresis within the first 24 hours with improvement in his symptoms and improvement in his oxygen saturations .;;;;;;;;
After a long discussion with the patient and his family it was determined that a cardiac catheterization would be prudent .;;;;;;;;
Prior to catheterization a VQ scan was performed which revealed a moderate probability for PE with a subsegmental defect in the lingular on the left lung .;;;;;;;;
Subsequent lower extremities noninvasive studies and D-dimer test were both negative rendering the probability of acute pulmonary embolism less than 2 percent .;;;;;;;;
It was not felt that the patient would be in need of chronic Coumadin therapy in lieu of this low probability findings in toto .;;;;;;;;
Coronary angiography revealed occlusion of the right coronary artery proximally with insignificant plaquing in the left anterior descending artery and circumflex arteries .;;;;;;;;
After a approximate 3 liter total diuresis the right atrial pressure was 5 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 14 , pulmonary vacuolar resistance 353 and the cardiac output depressed at 2.95 liters per minute , or a cardiac index of 1.7 liters per minute .;;;;;;;;
Based upon these findings it was felt that Mr. Bridge most likely has multi-factorial dyspnea owing to both his ventilatory limitation and to a chronic low output state .;;;;;;;;
In Hospital he was seen by both Speech Therapy , physical therapy , and the Uspend Harmemewood Medical Center Congestive Heart Failure Nurse Practitioner Program .;;;;;;;;
His Isordil was increased in Hospital and blood pressure control was relative episodic with systolic pressures ranging between 100 and 160 .;;;;;;;;
Future adjustments will be made at home pending his blood pressure measures .;;;;;;;;
At a goal weight of 142 pounds , Mr. Bridge 's filling pressures appeared ideal with a wedge pressure of 14 and his goal weight range will be between 142 and 44 pounds at home .;;;;;;;;
The patient will be followed by Dr. Fraction within a week of discharge and by Nieie Naebrand Freierm of the Dyathenslycha Medical Center .;;;;;;;;
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :;;;;;;;;
Imdur 120 mg. PO q.d. Captopril 100mg. PO t.i.d. Lasix 80 mg. PO q.d. Potassium chloride 40 mEq. PO q.d. Coreg 12.5 mg. b.i.d. Cozaar 100 mg. b.i.d. Plavix 75 mg. q.d. Allopurinol 300 mg. q.d.

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :;;;;;;;;
cerebellar hematoma .;;;;;;;;
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :;;;;;;;;
1. deep venous thrombosis ,;;;;;;;;
2. history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .;;;;;;;;
SPECIAL PROCEDURES AND OPERATIONS :;;;;;;;;
10-11-93 , suboccipital craniectomy with evacuation of cerebellar hematoma and left lateral cerebellar hemisphere resection .;;;;;;;;
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :;;;;;;;;
The patient is a 112y year old female who was found unresponsive and underwent an initial evaluation at Tonland County Medical Center where a computerized tomography scan showed evidence of an acute posterior ______________ bleed .;;;;;;;;
She was transferred to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital for further neurosurgical evaluation .;;;;;;;;
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :;;;;;;;;
As documented previously in the patient 's medical record , includes a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , and coronary artery disease as evaluated by cardiac catheterization on 07/93 , although no cardiac catheterization report is available , the discharge summary that no evidence of significant coronary artery disease was found .;;;;;;;;
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :;;;;;;;;
Atenolol 25 mg PO q.day , Procardia XL 60 mg PO q.day , Pepcid 20 mg PO b.i.d. , Isordil 10 mg PO t.i.d.;;;;;;;;
ALLERGIES :;;;;;;;;
The patient has no known drug allergies .;;;;;;;;
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :;;;;;;;;
On physical examination on admission , she is an elderly woman with labored respirations .;;;;;;;;
Her blood pressure was 148/65 , pulse 78 , respirations 20 , temperature was afebrile .;;;;;;;;
Her head , eyes , ears , nose , throat examination showed normocephalic , atraumatic head , oropharynx was clear , her lungs had coarse breath sounds bilaterally .;;;;;;;;
Cardiovascular exam :;;;;;;;;
II / VI systolic ejection murmur .;;;;;;;;
The heart exam revealed a normal Sl and S2 .;;;;;;;;
The abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended , positive bowel sounds .;;;;;;;;
Extremities :;;;;;;;;
2+ edema in the bilateral lower extremities .;;;;;;;;
Her neurological examination revealed that she was awake and alert at the time of her arrival to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital and was moving all extremities to commands with pupils equal , round , reactive to light and accommodation .;;;;;;;;
Her extra ocular movements were intact .;;;;;;;;
LABORATORY DATA :;;;;;;;;
significant for normal electrolytes , BUN and creatinine of 27 and 1.1 , electrocardiogram which revealed normal sinus rhythm at 78 beats per minute with T wave inversions in V2 through V6 .;;;;;;;;
The chest X-ray showed a left pleural effusion .;;;;;;;;
HOSPITAL COURSE :;;;;;;;;
The patient arrived at the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital and given her history of variably responsive state , and her computerized tomography scan showing a cerebellar hematoma , the patient was brought immediately to the Operating Room after consultation with the Medicine Service , given the previously noted electrocardiogram changes .;;;;;;;;
It was felt that her prior evaluation at the Ona Hospital had showed no significant coronary artery disease , according to cardiac catheterization results at that time .;;;;;;;;
However , invasive monitoring was undertaken in the operating room , as well as intravenous nitroglycerin for blood pressure control as needed .;;;;;;;;
The patient tolerated the initial procedure well .;;;;;;;;
On the next morning , however , a computerized tomography scan revealed recurrent hemorrhage with obliteration of her cisterns .;;;;;;;;
She was awake and following commands .;;;;;;;;
It was necessary , however , to return to the operating room for re-evacuation of her hematoma , which was performed .;;;;;;;;
The patient 's postoperative course was remarkably benign given the patient 's age and past medical history .;;;;;;;;
The patient was then extubated on the fifth postoperative day .;;;;;;;;
She did develop some respiratory distress on the first day post-extubation , requiring 48 hours of re-intubation .;;;;;;;;
Her subsequent course from a respiratory standpoint has been relatively unremarkable .;;;;;;;;
In addition , the patient has done very well from a neurological standpoint .;;;;;;;;
She is very bright , alert and oriented x three with an essentially normal neurological examination except for some bilateral dysmetria .;;;;;;;;
She has been tolerating a regular diet and has been working with physical therapy towards ambulation .;;;;;;;;
On 10-28-93 , the patient 's course was complicated by the development of a left lower extremity deep venous thrombosis .;;;;;;;;
She had been maintained on subcutaneous heparin and pneumoboots initially postoperatively and developed her thrombosis in this setting .;;;;;;;;
Since that time , she has been maintained on bedrest and Coumadinized .;;;;;;;;
Her current prothrombin time on 11-3-93 was 14.8 and it is felt that she could begin to be mobilized to a chair .;;;;;;;;
Her prothrombin time should be followed in rehabilitation to maintain it at the level of 14-16 .;;;;;;;;
The patient overall has done very well following her hospitalization .;;;;;;;;
We feel that she is an excellent candidate for rehabilitation and has been accepted at Villrow Health to continue this effort .;;;;;;;;
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :;;;;;;;;
Coumadin , dosed daily to maintain a prothrombin time of 14-16 .;;;;;;;;
Her dosing has currently been 4-5 mg PO qhs and we suspect that she will even out at a dose of anywhere from 2.5 to 3 mg PO qhs to maintain her level .;;;;;;;;
Other medications include :;;;;;;;;
Isordil 10 mg PO t.i.d. , which has been held for systolic blood pressure of less than 110 .;;;;;;;;
The patient also has been taking Fluconazole 100 mg PO b.i.d.; she is on day two of a five day course .;;;;;;;
Additionally , Cimetidine 400 mg PO t.i.d.;;;;;;;;
DISPOSITION / PLAN ON DISCHARGE :;;;;;;;;
The patient is transferred to Villrow Health .;;;;;;;;
She should be seen in the Neurosurgery Service clinic in six weeks ' time for follow up evaluation .;;;;;;;;
She should continue taking Coumadin to maintain a therapeutic prothrombin time in the 14-16 range for 4-6 weeks 'time .;;;;;;;;
She will require physical therapy and occupational therapy at Villrow Health .;;;;;;;;

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :;;;;;;;;
Relapsed extensive staged small cell lung carcinoma .;;;;;;;;
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :;;;;;;;;
VRE positive and do not resuscitate / do not intubate .;;;;;;;;
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :;;;;;;;;
Mr. Single is a 58 year old gentleman with a long standing smoking history who was diagnosed with an extensive stage small cell lung carcinoma involving his liver and his lungs in April 2000 .;;;;;;;;
He was treated with Carboplatin and Etoposide for six cycles and achieved a near complete response .;;;;;;;;
Re-staging scans in September 2000 demonstrated complete resolution of his lung and mediastinal disease and a 90% reduction in his liver metastases .;;;;;;;;
His severe abdominal pain had markedly improved and he was asymptomatic while taking narcotics for analgesia .;;;;;;;;
He presented to the emergency department of Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital on the day of admission with a three day history of severe abdominal pain .;;;;;;;;
He did not have nausea and vomiting , constipation or diarrhea .;;;;;;;;
He had run out of his narcotics for approximately three days .;;;;;;;;
Abdominal computerized tomography scan demonstrated extensive hepatic metastases consistent with relapse of his small cell lung carcinoma .;;;;;;;;
His mental status quickly deteriorated after beginning on his standard doses of Fentanyl patch and a head computerized tomography scan was obtained .;;;;;;;;
This demonstrated multiple enhancing masses in all lobes of the brain .;;;;;;;;
There was no hemorrhage seen .;;;;;;;;
He was started on steroids and began radiation therapy .;;;;;;;;
His abdominal pain was easily controlled with narcotics and his neurological deficits persisted although they did improve somewhat , once starting steroids .;;;;;;;;
Of note , he has an ataxic gait , he has periodic lapses in concentration , and he has dysphonia but no evidence of frank aspiration while he is eating his meals .;;;;;;;;
Initially , he had an expressive aphasia , but this seems to have resolved somewhat .;;;;;;;;
Other staging scans , including bone scan and chest computerized tomography scan were unremarkable for metastases in his bone but there are three new right lower lobe pulmonary nodules .;;;;;;;;
After discussion of findings of relapse of his small cell lung carcinoma with the patient he agreed to do not resuscitate / do not intubate status .;;;;;;;;
Our treatment plan of steroids and radiation therapy is to palliate his symptoms and try to improve his baseline .;;;;;;;;
These were discussed with Mr. Be 's children as well and everyone is in agreement with this plan .;;;;;;;;
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :;;;;;;;;
Otherwise unremarkable .;;;;;;;;
ALLERGIES :;;;;;;;;
The patient has no known drug allergies .;;;;;;;;
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :;;;;;;;;

LABORATORY DATA :;;;;;;;;
Unremarkable with a creatinine of 0.6 and normal glucose .;;;;;;;;
Calcium 8.8 , phosphate 2.9 , magnesium 1.8 , normal liver function tests and alkaline phosphatase is 112 .;;;;;;;;
Bilirubins are normal .;;;;;;;;
Coagulation times are normal .;;;;;;;;
The white blood count is 15,000 , hematocrit 40% , platelet count 300,000 .;;;;;;;;
Urinalysis is unremarkable .;;;;;;;;
DISPOSITION :;;;;;;;;
To Nacalv Medical Center to complete his whole brain XRT .;;;;;;;;
Ten fractions were planned and currently he is on day #6 .;;;;;;;;
His code status is do not resuscitate / do not intubate .;;;;;;;;
He will follow up with Dr. Maren Tlandflent and Dr. Lentny Be in the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital Oncology Clinic after completion of his whole brain XRT .;;;;;;;;

The neurological examination :;;;;;;;;
post angiogram her eyes were closed .;;;;;;;;
She was very responsive , somewhat sleepy , she complained of chest pain , which was diffuse , non-localizing without electrocardiogram changes and persisted for several days and then went away completely .;;;;;;;;
She was oriented to person , place , time and purpose , she recalled three out of three objects at five minutes , she is able to do calculations .;;;;;;;;
She maintained her fixation on the conversation well .;;;;;;;;
The cranial nerve exam :;;;;;;;;

Right lateral gaze , the right eye had 2 mm. of sclera showing , the left eye was normal , and there are a few beats of right beading nystagmus .;;;;;;;;
The left lateral gaze , the left eye had 1 mm. of lateral sclera showing .;;;;;;;;
Disks were flat .;;;;;;;;
Sensory limb of the right eye corneal reflex is slowed , otherwise normal .;;;;;;;;
Seventh nerve weakness on the right in a central pattern is present .;;;;;;;;
Soft palate was in the midline and moved upward nicely , but did not respond to gag .;;;;;;;;
Tongue protrudes 2 cm. with slight deviation to the right .;;;;;;;;
Sensory exam was not remarkable , cerebellar exam was not possible .;;;;;;;;
Motor exam showed greater than 4+ strength bilateral upper extremities and psoas unable to lift off bed .;;;;;;;;

Gastroc. 3 on the left and 4+ on the right .;;;;;;;;
Tibialis 3 on the left , 5+ on the right .;;;;;;;;
Reflexes were diffuse 3+ , toes upgoing bilaterally .;;;;;;;;
LABORATORY DATA :;;;;;;;;
On admission , electrocardiogram showed less than 1 mm. of ST depression in V4 to V6 , which is likely the patient 's baseline .;;;;;;;;
CK 's were mildly elevated but the MB fractions were not remarkable .;;;;;;;;
A chest X-ray showed some left lower lobe atelectasis .;;;;;;;;
Admitting creatinine was .7 , glucose 131 , white blood count was 10,000 , hematocrit was 40 , liver enzymes normal range .;;;;;;;;
HOSPITAL COURSE :;;;;;;;;
The patient was taken to the Intensive Care Unit after her angiogram .;;;;;;;;
She was aggressively anticoagulated with heparin .;;;;;;;;
A small intimal tear in the arch of the aorta during the angiogram , was without sequelae .;;;;;;;;
She was doing well with at least 4+ strength in all of her extremities , when on 11/13 , she had an acute drop in her systolic blood pressure to 70 for unclear reasons and without evidence of acute sepsis .;;;;;;;;
This was accompanied by substantial decrement in neurologic function .;;;;;;;;
"For a short time , she seemed """" locked in """" .";;;;;;;;
She has made slow progress since then and at the time of discharge has 4-strength at the left elbow and 4+ in the left wrist and hand .;;;;;;;;
Trace movement of the right elbow and 4-strength of the right wrist and hand .;;;;;;;;
4-to 4+ strength at the left ankle , 4+ strength at the right knee and right ankle .;;;;;;;;
She is unable to lift either foot off the bed .;;;;;;;;
The extra ocular movements are full .;;;;;;;;
Tongue protrudes 4 cm .;;;;;;;;
She is drowsy at times , but generally alert , responsive , interactive , able to talk in two to three word sentences when she wants to .;;;;;;;;
She has severe memory deficits , but nevertheless , is able to engage in conversation , answers questions , names things well , does calculations and recognizes family members and states preferences .;;;;;;;;
She has been working with Speech Therapy , occupational therapy and physical therapy closely and should continue to show improvement .;;;;;;;;
She is anticoagulated on Coumadin and this has been stable .;;;;;;;;
She is do not resuscitate in agreement with the wishes of her multiple family members .;;;;;;;;
Follow up computerized tomography scans and magnetic resonance imaging studies have shown infarction in bilateral basis pontis , mid brain , the superior cerebellar areas , left thalamus , bilateral temporal lobes medially and inferiorly and left posterior communicating artery .;;;;;;;;
The patient had fevers sporadically during this hospitalization with rising white blood counts .;;;;;;;;
A chest X-ray documented a progressing left lower lobe infiltrate .;;;;;;;;
Initially this improved on Clindamycin and Cefotetan , but fevers recurred on this antibiotic regimen .;;;;;;;;
Sputum grew out Klebsiella pneumoniae , and she was treated with Gentamicin and Ancef for 14 days intravenous ( bug being sensitive to these two drugs ) .;;;;;;;;
A left pleural effusion developed and this was tapped with ultrasound guidance , and found to be sterile , and without evidence of empyema .;;;;;;;;
The patient is on Ciprofloxacin .;;;;;;;;
The day of discharge is day #3 of 7 , after which antibiotics should be totally discontinued .;;;;;;;;
She has developed bad thrush in this setting , she is not yet able to swallow and so she is on Nystatin swish and spit five times a day .;;;;;;;;
She also gets Peridex to clean out her mouth .;;;;;;;;
Once her liver enzymes are completely normal , a seven day course of Fluconazol may be helpful if the thrush is not spontaneously resolving off of antibiotics .;;;;;;;;
She has been afebrile for greater than 10 days , including several days on oral antibiotics .;;;;;;;;
The patient 's liver enzymes were noted to be elevated mid way through her hospital course , to about three times normal , especially the SGOT and SGPT .;;;;;;;;
These have spontaneously reversed , and are nearly normal at the time of discharge .;;;;;;;;
A right upper quadrant ultrasound documented gallstones , without evidence of common bile duct dilatation or active cholecystitis .;;;;;;;;
The exact cause of her liver enzyme elevation is unclear , but we are being careful about administering drugs , which might irritate the liver .;;;;;;;;
The patient had a steady decline in her hematocrit during this hospitalization .;;;;;;;;
Iron studies are all entirely normal , her anemia is attributed to anemia or chronic disease with hypoproliferation as well as multiple phlebotomies .;;;;;;;;
The plan is to give her folic acid , but not iron .;;;;;;;;
The patient 's potassiums have been repeatedly low and require daily checks and repletion .;;;;;;;;
This is thought due to the extensive course of Gentamicin which she received .;;;;;;;;
This must be carefully checked despite the standing order for potassium .;;;;;;;;
The patient has had low sodiums during this hospitalization .;;;;;;;;
This may due to her central nervous system process or her pulmonary process , with fluids administered as described , she should not have any problems from this .;;;;;;;;
Her sodiums were never below 130 .;;;;;;;;
She does well with tube feeds .;;;;;;;;
Her tube feeds orders are as follow :;;;;;;;;
full strength Replete with fiber at 70 cc. per hour .;;;;;;;;
In addition , the patient gets 250 cc. of juice ( not water ) three times a day .;;;;;;;;
She also gets Lactinex granules three packages in each bottle of tube feeds .;;;;;;;;
She also gets Metamucil one teaspoon with the first bolus of juice each day .;;;;;;;;
Please note that evaluation by the swallowing therapist , showed that the patient is aspirating at this time , but there is great hope from the nature of her deficit and the good movements of her tongue that normal swallowing should return soon .;;;;;;;;
It is for this reason that she is discharged with an nasogastric tube and that no plans for G tube placement are made at this time .;;;;;;;;
She has a history of of angina without myocardial infarction that has not been worked up .;;;;;;;;
She did have brief chest pain twice during this admission that did not correlate with electrocardiogram changes .;;;;;;;;
In the first week of November , her electrocardiogram showed T wave inversions in the lateral leads , correlating with an increase in the LDH , but not CK .;;;;;;;;
This did not normalize with administration of Isordil and the patient denied chest pain at this time .;;;;;;;;
As of 5/9 , her electrocardiogram had reverted back to normal and there is no evidence of congestive heart failure or continued electrocardiogram changes , and chest pain is absent .;;;;;;;;
Her cholesterol was 350 here .;;;;;;;;
She has been off of her hypercholesterol medicines .;;;;;;;;
These can be restarted when it is deemed reasonable , in view of her acute disease and recently elevated liver enzymes .;;;;;;;;
Note that the liver enzymes were normal on admission , at which time she was taking all of the above cholesterol medicines .;;;;;;;;
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :;;;;;;;;
Metamucil 1 teaspoon q.d. , with first bolus of juice , juice 250 cc. down nasogastric tube t.i.d. , tube feeds as above , Lactinex as above , Tagamet 800 mg. nasogastric tube qhs , Nystatin swish and spit 10 cc. five times a day , Cardizem slow release 90 mg. PO q.d. , Folic Acid 1 mg. PO q.d. , Ciprofloxacin 500 mg. PO b.i.d. , discontinue on 12/10/92 KayCiel 30 mEq. down nasogastric tube q.d. , Peridex 10 cc. swish and spit q.i.d. , Coumadin 4 mg. nasogastric tube on odd days , alternating with 5 mg. nasogastric tube on even days , once daily , Tylenol 650 mg. PO and PR q6hours PRN pain , Nystatin powder to axilla and groin as needed .;;;;;;;;
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :;;;;;;;;

Low sodium , responsive to fluid restriction .;;;;;;;;
History of coronary artery disease .;;;;;;;;
Thrush .;;;;;;;;
High cholesterol .;;;;;;;;
The patient needs prothrombin time checked daily , patient needs potassium checked daily , patient needs sodium checked at least every other day .;;;;;;;;

Status post anterior myocardial infarction in 05-93 , status post percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of left anterior descending in 05-93 , hypertension , diabetes mellitus .;;;;;;;;
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :;;;;;;;;
Coronary angiography , exercise tolerance test with Thallium .;;;;;;;;
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :;;;;;;;;
Metoprolol 50 mg PO bid , Isordil 20 mg PO tid , enteric coated aspirin 1 PO qd .;;;;;;;;
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :;;;;;;;;
The patient is a 65 year old Portuguese male with a history of an anterior myocardial infarction i May 1993 and is status post a percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the LAD who presented on 10-24-93 with crushing substernal chest pain and shortness of breath .;;;;;;;;
He had no prior cardiac history until May 1993 when on 5-24 he had crushing chest pain which radiated to his left arm .;;;;;;;;
He was found at that time to have 3-4 mm ST segment elevations in V1 through V4 at Pre Health .;;;;;;;;
The patient was transferred to Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital and had 4-7 mm ST segment elevations across the precordium with Q's in V1 and V2 , 2 mm ST elevation in AVL , and 1-2 mm reciprocal ST depression in II , III , and F.;;;;;;;;
On physical examination at that time he had bright red blood per rectum and therefore lysis was deferred and he was taken directly to the cardiac catheterization lab .;;;;;;;;
The cardiac catheterization results at that time revealed a right atrial pressure of 7 , pulmonary artery pressure of 29/16 , RV 33/8 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 16 .;;;;;;;;
He had a 95% proximal left anterior descending lesion which was PTCA 'd to a residual of 30% and an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed .;;;;;;;;
He also had some mild to moderate disease at the OM1 noted at that time .;;;;;;;;
The patient was transferred to the Cardiac Care Unit where he had a peak CPK of 5,042 and 26.7% MB's .;;;;;;;;
His intra-aortic balloon pump was weaned without problems .;;;;;;;;
He had hypotension with beta blockers and therefore they were not started .;;;;;;;;
On day six , an echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 44% with anterior akinesis and septal hypokinesis .;;;;;;;;
On day nine , he had a low level exercise tolerance test with Thallium which was positive for 2.5 mm horizontal depressions in II , III , and AVF , and 1.5 mm downsloping ST depressions in V5 and V6 , as well as some anteroseptal redistribution on Thallium .;;;;;;;;
Therefore , he went to repeat cardiac catheterization which revealed that the left anterior descending site was patent and revealed a distal PDA lesion and a circumflex lesion after the OM .;;;;;;;;
The patient was discharged to home and is supposed to follow up with Dr. Shuffburle of Gastroenterology for work up of his bright red blood per rectum and is supposed to follow up with Dr. Amesin of Cardiology and Dr. Shuffpasc of Dingclearf Alllirefaith Memorial Hospital .;;;;;;;;
However , he did not keep any of these appointments .;;;;;;;;
He went home and did not take any of his medications and smoked and drank heavily throughout the several months .;;;;;;;;
On the a.m. of 10-24-93 , the patient developed crushing substernal chest pain and shortness of breath .;;;;;;;;
He came to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital Emergency Ward where he was noted to be ashen and diaphoretic .;;;;;;;;
He was treated with oxygen , aspirin , five sublingual nitroglycerins , heparin , and was eventually made pain free with that regimen .;;;;;;;;
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS :;;;;;;;;
His cardiac risk factors included hypertension , diabetes mellitus , hypercholesterolemia , cigarette smoking , and a positive family history .;;;;;;;;
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :;;;;;;;;
His past medical history included hypertension and non-insulin diabetes mellitus which is diet controlled .;;;;;;;;
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :;;;;;;;;
His past surgical history had included gastric ulcer surgery and appendectomy .;;;;;;;;
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :;;;;;;;;
On admission , he was on Isordil 10 tid and enteric coated aspirin , but he was not taking either of these medications .;;;;;;;;
HABITS :;;;;;;;;
The patient smokes one pack per day and has a history of heavy alcohol use .;;;;;;;;
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :;;;;;;;;
The physical examination on admission revealed a blood pressure of 110/70 , a heart rate of 66 , respirations of 24 , temperature of 98 .;;;;;;;;
The HEENT exam revealed the extra ocular movements intact .;;;;;;;;
The pupils equal , round , reactive to light .;;;;;;;;
The oropharynx was clear and the fundi were normal .;;;;;;;;
There were no hypertensive or diabetic changes .;;;;;;;;
The neck was suppled , with no lymphadenopathy and no jugular venous distention .;;;;;;;;
The carotids were 1+ without bruits .;;;;;;;;
The heart was regular rate and rhythm , S4 , S1 , S2 , with a I / VI systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border .;;;;;;;;
The lungs were clear , except for a few dry crackles bibasilarly .;;;;;;;;
The abdomen revealed a midline scar and a right lower quadrant scar , and it was soft and nontender wit positive bowel sounds .;;;;;;;;
The liver edge was 2 cm below the right costal margin , but smooth and nontender .;;;;;;;;
There was no splenomegaly .;;;;;;;;
The femoral pulses were diminished .;;;;;;;;
He had bilateral intertrigo in his femoral region as well as his axillae .;;;;;;;;
The extremities revealed no clubbing , cyanosis or edema .;;;;;;;;
The pulses were 1+ bilaterally .;;;;;;;;
The skin exam revealed changes consistent with vitiligo .;;;;;;;;
The rectal examination was guaiac negative .;;;;;;;;
LABORATORY DATA :;;;;;;;;
The laboratory data revealed normal electrolytes , BUN and creatinine , normal liver function tests , a first CPK of 140 , and a hematocrit of 43.1 .;;;;;;;;
The portable chest X-ray showed clear lungs , slight enlarged heart , and a mildly elevated hemidiaphragm .;;;;;;;;
The electrocardiogram was normal sinus rhythm at 81 , with normal intervals and normal axis , had poor R-wave progression consistent with an old anterior myocardial infarction , had flipped T-waves in V1 through V5 , which were of no significant change since his last EKG on 5-25-93 .;;;;;;;;
HOSPITAL COURSE :;;;;;;;;
The patient was admitted to the Step Down Unit for a rule out MI protocol .;;;;;;;;
He was treated with aspirin , heparin , and intravenous nitroglycerin .;;;;;;;;
No beta blockers was started because of his history of hypertension with beta blockers and because his blood pressure of only 110/70 .;;;;;;;;
The patient ruled in for myocardial infarction with a peak CPK of 219 and 20.9% MB fraction .;;;;;;;;
This was a non-Q wave myocardial infarction as there were no diagnostic electrocardiogram changes .;;;;;;;;
on 10-27-93 , the patient went to the cath lab which revealed a small nondominant right coronary artery without any lesions , a restenosis of the proximal left anterior descending lesion that had been PTCA 'd , a lesion in the first OM , and a moderately severe left circumflex lesion after the OM3 .;;;;;;;;
The left ventriculogram revealed an akinetic anterolateral and apical ventricle .;;;;;;;;
Given the results of this cardiac catheterization , which were not significantly changed from his previous cardiac catheterization prior to the PTCA , it was elected to attempt to medically manage the patient .;;;;;;;;
He was ambulated progressively on the floor .;;;;;;;;
A beta blocker was started with Metoprolol initially at 25 mg PO bid and eventually increased to 50 mg PO bid .;;;;;;;;
The patient ambulated extensively on the FIH 20 floor each day without any episodes of chest pain or shortness of breath .;;;;;;;;
On 11-2-93 , the patient underwent a low level treadmill exercise test with Thallium imaging .;;;;;;;;
This treadmill test was done on medications , including beta blockers , in hopes to assess an amount of ischemia on treatment .;;;;;;;;
The patient was able to exercise for approximately nine minutes on a modified Bruce protocol , however , he did not reach his predicted maximal heart rate while he was on the beta blockade .;;;;;;;;
There were no diagnostic electrocardiogram changes during the treadmill exercise test , although he did have 0.5 to 1 mm ST depression in II , III , and AVF .;;;;;;;;
The study was halted for shortness of breath and there was no chest pain .;;;;;;;;
Thallium images revealed a moderate sized region of ischemic but viable myocardium involving the anteroseptal and lateral segments of the left ventricle .;;;;;;;;
There was also some evidence of left ventricular dysfunction during the test .;;;;;;;;
These images were essentially unchanged compared with the previous Thallium images in May 1993 .;;;;;;;;
After extensive discussion between myself , Dr. Amesin , and Dr. Scgach , it was elected to discharge the patient to home with medical management .;;;;;;;;
The patient was extremely reluctant to undergo surgery , although he understands that this may become necessary in the future .;;;;;;;;
Dr. Amesin had a long discussion with the patient 's daughters revolving primarily around issues of the patient 's compliance .;;;;;;;;
Previously he had not taken any of his medicines and smoked heavily on the outside and not kept any of his appointments .;;;;;;;;
The importance of quitting smoking as well as continuing to follow his medical regimen was emphasized to the daughter and to the patient .;;;;;;;;
She will be actively involved in encouraging the patient to comply with this medical regimen and also to follow up with Dr. Amesin as well as Dr. Lfsquarc on the outside .;;;;;;;;
The patient remained guaiac negative throughout the entire hospitalization .;;;;;;;;
Despite being on heparin for a short time , his hematocrit remained very stable with only a small dip after the catheterization was done .;;;;;;;;
He will need to be followed up as an out patient for guaiac positive stools and possibly worked up for this in the future .;;;;;;;;

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :;;;;;;;;
The patient is a 65 year old Portuguese male whose cardiac risk factors include hypertension , diabetes mellitus , hypercholesterolemia , tobacco use and a positive family history .;;;;;;;;
He was a previously healthy male who reports a pattern of intermittent chest pain during the week prior to admission .;;;;;;;;
On the night prior to admission he was awakened from sleep with severe substernal chest pain radiating to the left arm , accompanied by back pain at about 9:30 p.m.;;;;;;;;
He was taken to the Pre Health emergency room and at about 2:45 a.m. on 7/30 an electrocardiogram demonstrated 3 to 4 mm ST elevations in leads V1 to V4 and 2 mm ST elevations in lead V5 .;;;;;;;;
He was treated with nitroglycerin , antacids and intravenous morphine .;;;;;;;;
He was transferred to Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital hemodynamically stable .;;;;;;;;
HE arrived in the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital emergency room with a blood pressure of 120/80 , heart rate 90 .;;;;;;;;
An electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm at a rate of 94 with premature ventricular contractions .;;;;;;;;
It was notable for 4 to 7 mm ST elevations throughout the precordium with Qs in leads V1 and V2 , with 2 mm ST elevations in aVL and 1 to 2 mm reciprocal ST depressions in leads II , III and aVF .;;;;;;;;
The initial physical examination was notable for bright red blood per rectum .;;;;;;;;
He was treated with intravenous nitroglycerin , intravenous morphine , aspirin , Ativan and a LIdocaine drip .;;;;;;;;
Because of the noted bright red blood per rectum , thrombolysis was deferred and the patient was taken immediately to the cardiac catheterization laboratory .;;;;;;;;
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :;;;;;;;;
Notable only for surgical repair of an ulcer and a remote appendectomy .;;;;;;;;
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :;;;;;;;;
None;;;;;;;;
ALLERGIES :;;;;;;;;
Penicillin , which gives him a rash .;;;;;;;;
SOCIAL HISTORY :;;;;;;;;
His habits include smoking one pack per day for many years and moderate to heavy alcohol use .;;;;;;;;
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :;;;;;;;;
The patient was an elderly appearing male in no significant distress .;;;;;;;;
His pulse was 84 and regular , blood pressure 114/70 .;;;;;;;;
The head , eyes , ears , nose , throat examination was unremarkable .;;;;;;;;
The neck was supple .;;;;;;;;
The carotids were of normal amplitude without bruits .;;;;;;;;
On cardiac examination he had a nonpalpable left ventricular impulse , a quiet S1 and S2 , no murmurs .;;;;;;;;
He had an audible S3 and a jugular venous pressure of 8 .;;;;;;;;
On lung examination he had rales one third up bilaterally .;;;;;;;;
His abdomen was soft and nontender with no hepatosplenomegaly , no guarding and no rebound .;;;;;;;;
On rectal examination he had bright red blood in the vault without any stool .;;;;;;;;
His extremities were without clubbing , cyanosis or edema .;;;;;;;;
LABORATORY DATA :;;;;;;;;
The hematocrit was 44.9 , white blood count 14.3 , platelet count 301,000 , sodium 138 , potassium 3.7 , chloride 102 , CO2 27.4 , BUN 12 , creatinine 1.0 , glucose 147 .;;;;;;;;
The electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 94 , left atrial enlargement , ST elevations in V4 through V6 , I and aVL , consistent with acute anterolateral myocardial infarction with Q waves in V1 to V3 and reciprocal ST depressions in leads II , III and aFV .;;;;;;;;
The chest X-ray showed a normal cardiac and mediastinal silhouette , mild pulmonary edema and an elevated left hemidiaphragm .;;;;;;;;
HOSPITAL COURSE :;;;;;;;;
The patient was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory where hemodynamic measurements included a right atrial pressure of 7 , a right ventricular pressure of 33/8 , pulmonary artery pressure 29/16 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 16 .;;;;;;;;
He had a proximal 95% left anterior descending lesion and mild to moderate disease in the first obtuse marginal .;;;;;;;;
The left anterior descending lesion was angioplastied to a 30% residual stenosis .;;;;;;;;
An intra-aortic balloon pump was placed in the left groin prophylactically .;;;;;;;;
The patient was hemodynamically stable throughout and was transferred to the MICU .;;;;;;;;
On hospital day 2 the intra-aortic balloon pump was weaned .;;;;;;;;
The patient was intermittently agitated while on the intra-aortic balloon pump and was treated presumptively for alcohol withdrawal with Serax .;;;;;;;;
The Lidocaine drip was rapidly weaned as well .;;;;;;;;
On the third hospital day the intra-aortic balloon pump was removed .;;;;;;;;
The intravenous nitroglycerin and heparin were weaned off .;;;;;;;;
After removal of the intra-aortic balloon pump the patient was noticeably less agitated .;;;;;;;;
On the fourth hospital day an attempt was made to transfer the patient to the floor .;;;;;;;;
However , after a single dose of 25 mg of po metoprolol , the patient 's blood pressure dropped to the 60/40 range and he was therefore kept in the MICU .;;;;;;;;
The peak CPK level was on the second hospital day and was 5,042 with 26.7% MB fraction .;;;;;;;;
On the fifth hospital day the patient was considered stable for transfer to the floor .;;;;;;;;
Once on the floor the patient had no recurrent chest pain .;;;;;;;;
An echocardiogram was performed on the sixth hospital day which demonstrated an ejection fraction of 44% .;;;;;;;;
On transfer to the medical floor the patient was noted to have guaiac negative stool .;;;;;;;;
He was evaluated by the GI Service who felt that , given the patient 's course , he could undergo flexible sigmoidoscopy electively at some point in the future .;;;;;;;;
The patient underwent exercise stress testing with thallium on the ninth hospital day .;;;;;;;;
He exercised for 7 minutes and 30 seconds , achieving 80% of the maximal heart rate on the modified Bruce protocol .;;;;;;;;
He did not have chest pain .;;;;;;;;
There were ST and T wave abnormalities with 2.5 mm horizontal depressions at the beginning of 3 minutes of exercise , which persisted into recovery .;;;;;;;;
The thallium images showed fixed anterior and septal wall defects without any definite evidence of redistribution .;;;;;;;;
Based on this data , on the tenth hospital day the patient underwent repeat cardiac catheterization which demonstrated a patent left anterior descending site , a circumflex lesion after the third obtuse marginal , and a distal posterior descending artery lesion with a tight stenosis and a small vessel .;;;;;;;;
These findings were considered not to be hemodynamically significant and the patient was therefore to be discharged on medical therapy including nitrates and aspirin .;;;;;;;;
Because of his persistently marginal blood pressure at 100/70 , an ACE inhibitor which was tried briefly and a beta blockers were elected not to be continued .;;;;;;;;
The patient was discharged in stable condition on the eleventh hospital day .;;;;;;;;
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES :;;;;;;;;
1. Acute myocardial infarction .;;;;;;;;
2. Lower gastrointestinal bleed .;;;;;;;;

Metastatic melanoma .;;;;;;;;
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :;;;;;;;;
This is the second Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital admission for Taroby Patient , a 70 year old male with a history of metastatic melanoma .;;;;;;;;
His melanoma was originally diagnosed last fall when he presented with lesions in the liver and spleen , and a chest CT showed left upper lobe nodules .;;;;;;;;
A head CT scan was negative , but an MRI scan of the spine showed an L5 metastasis with a fracture and had with epidural and paraspinal extension .;;;;;;;;
In addition , there was a T11 metastasis with cord compression .;;;;;;;;
Approximately one week ago , he was admitted to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital for chemotherapy with DTIC and Tamoxifen .;;;;;;;;
At that time , he also began radiation therapy to his lumbosacral spine .;;;;;;;;
He is continuing on the radiation therapy to date .;;;;;;;;
On February 23 , Mr. Patient presented to Dr. Patient 's office with two major symptoms .;;;;;;;;
First , he had right lower extremity swelling and lower extremity noninvasives confirmed the diagnosis of a femoral deep venous thrombosis .;;;;;;;;
Second , he had a witnessed episode in which his eyes rolled to the back of his head and there was a question of some seizure activity .;;;;;;;;
In the past , he has not been known to have a history of CNS metastases .;;;;;;;;
The episode of potential seizure activity occurred in the setting of a bowel movement and may have been associated with vasovagal activity .;;;;;;;;
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :;;;;;;;;
The past medical history is as above .;;;;;;;;
FAMILY HISTORY :;;;;;;;;
Noncontributory .;;;;;;;;
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS :;;;;;;;;
The review of systems is negative , except as above .;;;;;;;;
ALLERGIES :;;;;;;;;
The patient has no known drug allergies .;;;;;;;;
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :;;;;;;;;
The physical examination reveals a pleasant 70 year old male in no acute distress .;;;;;;;;
The blood pressure was 113/70 , pulse 66 , respirations 20 , and a temperature of 96.8 .;;;;;;;;
HEENT showed pupils equal , round , reactive to light and accommodation , and extra ocular movements intact .;;;;;;;;
The sclerae were anicteric .;;;;;;;;
The neck was supple , without jugular venous distention or increased thyroid .;;;;;;;;
Nodes :;;;;;;;;
There was no appreciable cervical , supraclavicular , axillary , or inguinal adenopathy .;;;;;;;;
The chest was clear to auscultation and percussion .;;;;;;;;
Cardiac :;;;;;;;;
regular rate and rhythm , with a I / VI systolic ejection murmur .;;;;;;;;
The abdomen showed a 10 cm liver with the edge palpable 2 fingerbreadths below the right costal margin .;;;;;;;;
The extremity exam was notable for 2+ pitting edema in the right lower extremity extending to the knee .;;;;;;;;
The neurological examination was nonfocal .;;;;;;;;
HOSPITAL COURSE :;;;;;;;;
Mr. Patient underwent venogram and inferior vena cava filter placement on February 23 , 1993 and was then he was admitted to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital for postoperative care .;;;;;;;;
He tolerated the procedure well .;;;;;;;;
In addition , the second major event that had occurred yesterday was a neurologic event of some kind .;;;;;;;;
Over the 24 hours of in house hospitalization , he did not have any further neurologic activity and was able to ambulate without assistance prior to discharge .;;;;;;;;
He will be scheduled for an MRI scan , Neurology consult , and an EEG next week as an out patient .;;;;;;;;
Mr. Patient was a poor candidate for anticoagulation because of his history of metastatic melanoma and the question of CNS metastases .;;;;;;;;

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :;;;;;;;;
The patient is a 78 year old male with dysphagia who was found to have endoscopically two nodules in the esophagus , biopsy of which showed small cell carcinoma .;;;;;;;;
Recently , he has complained of pain radiating down the left leg and work up had shown absent left knee jerk .;;;;;;;;
Plain films of the lumbosacral spine showed some scoliosis with blastic changes around L3 .;;;;;;;;
The bone marrow biopsy was positive for metastatic carcinoma .;;;;;;;;
The patient was admitted for further evaluation .;;;;;;;;
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :;;;;;;;;
On physical examination on admission , the blood pressure was 164/90 , pulse 88 , respirations 20 .;;;;;;;;
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :;;;;;;;;
Note :;;;;;;;;
past medical history included hypertension , treated by Cardizem .;;;;;;;;
The patient also has a history of degenerative joint disease .;;;;;;;;
He had an episode of chest pain but ruled out for myocardial infarction .;;;;;;;;
On physical examination , vital signs were as above .;;;;;;;;
The head , eyes , ears , nose , throat examination was within normal limits , neck was supple , lungs were clear to auscultation and percussion .;;;;;;;;
The abdomen was benign with no masses felt .;;;;;;;;
Cardiovascular exam :;;;;;;;;
grade I / VI systolic ejection murmur at the right upper sternal border , single S1 , S2 .;;;;;;;;
The rectal examination showed guaiac negative stool .;;;;;;;;
Extremities :;;;;;;;;
within normal limits .;;;;;;;;
The neurological examination showed an absent left knee jerk .;;;;;;;;
Cerebellar function was normal .;;;;;;;;
LABORATORY DATA :;;;;;;;;
significant for a sodium of 140 , potassium 3.9 , chloride 105 , BUN and creatinine 21 and 1.5 , LDH 732 , SGOT 84 , alkaline phosphatase 145 , bilirubin 0.3 , calcium 10 , albumen 4.1 , globulin 3.9 , white blood count 8.9 , hematocrit 43.3 , 62 polys , 26 lymphs , 9 monos , 1 eo , 2 basos , prothrombin time 9.8/10.0 , partial thromboplastin time 31.8 .;;;;;;;;
During this admission , an upper gastrointestinal and small bowel follow-through on 9-5-93 was normal .;;;;;;;;
A computerized tomography scan of the chest showed diffuse esophageal wall thickening , dilatation of the esophagus with air fluid levels and no evidence of mediastinitis and some air space disease in a medial segment of the right middle lobe .;;;;;;;;
Bone scan showed multiple regions of abnormally increased activity in the dorsal spine and lumbar vertebrae , as well as a right anterior fourth rib , consistent with metastases .;;;;;;;;
A magnetic resonance imaging study of the brain showed no definite evidence of metastatic deposits .;;;;;;;;
There was microvascular disease .;;;;;;;;
A computerized tomography scan of the abdomen showed multiple low density lesions within the liver , consistent with metastatic disease and a 1.5 centimeter low thoracic paraesophageal lymph node , pathological .;;;;;;;;
Spleen , pancreas and kidneys were within normal limits .;;;;;;;;
A magnetic resonance imaging study of the brain showed no metastases .;;;;;;;;
The magnetic resonance imaging study of the spine showed extensive bony metastases .;;;;;;;;
There was no evidence of spinal cord compression on magnetic resonance imaging study , though there was evidence of pressure on the L4 nerve root .;;;;;;;;
HOSPITAL COURSE :;;;;;;;;
The patient was admitted and he was started on chemotherapy and radiation therapy to the L4 spine region .;;;;;;;;
The first course of chemotherapy was given from 8-19-93 through 8-21-93 .;;;;;;;;
This was VP-16 150 mg daily x three and cisplatin 60 mg daily x three with Zofran 11 mg on three occasions as an antiemetic and each dose of cisplatin was preceded by 12.5 grams of Decadron .;;;;;;;;
The chemotherapy was well tolerated but did result in febrile neutropenia .;;;;;;;;
Granulocyte colony stimulating factor was added .;;;;;;;;
Thus white blood count dropped to 0.6 minimum on 8-27 , with platelet count of 63,000 but with granulocyte colony stimulating factor support and antibiotics for febrile neutropenia , white blood count recovered .;;;;;;;;
Actually the lowest white blood count was 0.5 on 8-31-93 .;;;;;;;;
On that occasion , platelet count was as low as 17,000 .;;;;;;;;
By 9-8-93 , the white blood count was back up to 16.2 .;;;;;;;;
The patient 's course was complicated by severe pain and intractable nausea and vomiting and severe substernal pain .;;;;;;;;
He is on MS Contin and also on Duragesic patch .;;;;;;;;
He continued to have nausea and vomiting .;;;;;;;;
The patient was seen in consultation by Dr. Signs of Gastroenterology .;;;;;;;;
Eventually , a PICC line was inserted and he was given central total parenteral nutrition because of severe anorexia during radiation therapy .;;;;;;;;
Two weeks passed without a bowel movement because of the lack of intake and eventually that resolved .;;;;;;;;
It was felt that endoscopy would be of value .;;;;;;;;
A central venous line was placed on 8-29-93 .;;;;;;;;
After neutropenia resolved by 9-2-93 with white blood count rising to 2.2 and platelet count to 28,000 , endoscopy became feasible .;;;;;;;;
This was done on 9-4-93 and there were inflammatory exudates , ulcerations , and granulation tissue in the middle and distal third of the esophagus , but the tumor polypoid masses had completely disappeared .;;;;;;;;
Cytologic brushings of the ulcerated areas were positive for cancer cells but deep biopsies were negative .;;;;;;;;
The patient was treated with fluconazole in case there was any Monilia , although biopsy did not confirm the presence of Monilia .;;;;;;;;
Gradually during the hospitalization , the sternal pain improved , as did the pain in the left hip and the patient became able to ambulate somewhat .;;;;;;;;
He was making progress and accordingly , a second course of chemotherapy was given at lower dose .;;;;;;;;
He received VP-16 100 mg daily x three , 9-12 , 9-13 and 9-14-93 , and cisplatin 40 mg daily x three on that same date with Zofran 10 mg.;;;;;;;;
The only problem was some recurrent nausea .;;;;;;;;
The radiation therapy was finally finished on the day of discharge , 9-19-93 , at which point the patient was able to take fluids and food but was still occasionally vomiting .;;;;;;;;
His white blood count was in the range of 53,000 because Neupogen had been started with his second cycle of chemotherapy and will be continued until it is clear that he has passed the nadir of any neutropenia to be expected from this cycle of chemotherapy .;;;;;;;;
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :;;;;;;;;
1. metastatic small cell cancer of esophageal origin to liver and bone ,;;;;;;;;
2. severe ulcerations of the esophagus at sites of prior tumor ,;;;;;;;;
3. intractable nausea and vomiting ,;;;;;;;;
4. pain syndrome , largely resolved ,;;;;;;;;
5. hypertension .;;;;;;;;
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :;;;;;;;;
Prilosec 20 mg PO qa.m. , Senokot one to two tablets PO q.day as needed , Colace 100 mg PO b.i.d. , Microstatin 100,000 units swish and swallow four times a day , Darvocet-N 100 1 PO q4h prn pain , Cardizem 240 mg PO q.day , Neupogen 300 mg subcutaneously q.day x ten days , depending on trend of blood counts , Compazine 10 mg PO q6h prn nausea , PICC line flushes , 200 units of heparin twice daily .;;;;;;;;
The patient will need complete blood count , differential and platelet count twice weekly on Monday and Thursday , and fax it to 463-8992 .;;;;;;;;
The patient is on diet as tolerated .;;;;;;;;
There will be plans to do additional chemotherapy in the future if the patient improves sufficiently .;;;;;;;;

The neurological examination was nonfocal .;;;;;;;;
The rectal examination was guaiac negative , no masses .;;;;;;;;
HOSPITAL COURSE :;;;;;;;;
The patient was admitted to the hospital , to the private surgery service .;;;;;;;;
A chest X-ray on admission revealed a left lower lobe nodule suspicious for metastases .;;;;;;;;
Because of this , a computerized tomography scan was obtained which revealed multiple nodules within both lungs , predominantly in the periphery , largest up to a centimeter , highly suspicious for metastases .;;;;;;;;
Due to an abnormal electrocardiogram , the patient was seen in consultation preoperatively and an exercise tolerance test with Thallium was performed , which was normal .;;;;;;;;
The patient continued to run low grade fevers but was continued on cefotetan .;;;;;;;;
On the sixth hospital day , the patient was brought to the Operating Room where she underwent right colectomy , G-tube placement .;;;;;;;;
There were no complications during the procedure .;;;;;;;;
Findings included sinus tract from the right cecum into a right lower quadrant tumor .;;;;;;;;
There was gross fecal soilage after removal of the tumor .;;;;;;;;
Infectious Disease consultation was obtained postoperatively due to the fecal contamination and patient was placed on Vancomycin , Gentamicin , and Flagyl .;;;;;;;;
She remained hemodynamically stable , although she did spike temperatures postoperatively .;;;;;;;;
All blood cultures were negative .;;;;;;;;
The patient was seen in consultation by Oncology and chemotherapy was set up for her at the Brook Hospital near her home .;;;;;;;;
The patient continued to run low grade temperatures and an abdominal computerized tomography scan was obtained which revealed no abscess .;;;;;;;;
Bowel function returned by postoperative day ten and the patient 's diet was slowly advanced and her G-tube was gradually clamped .;;;;;;;;

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :;;;;;;;;
Right thyroid papillary carcinoma .;;;;;;;;
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :;;;;;;;;
1. Pulmonary and right iliac bone metastases .;;;;;;;;
2. Eosinophilia .;;;;;;;;
3. Chronic leg edema .;;;;;;;;
4. Atrial fibrillation .;;;;;;;;
5. Congestive heart failure .;;;;;;;;
6. Left subclavian vein thrombosis .;;;;;;;;
7. Urinary tract infection .;;;;;;;;
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :;;;;;;;;
The patient is a 74 year old female with metastatic papillary carcinoma of the thyroid who presented to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital on 4/28/93 with progressive weakness , weight loss and shortness of breath .;;;;;;;;
The patient was in a good state of health until January of 1993 when she developed a serious upper respiratory tract infection associated with weakness and fatigue .;;;;;;;;
She had also reported a weight loss of 15 pounds over the past two months .;;;;;;;;
Although her upper respiratory tract infection seemed to be resolving , her weakness persisted .;;;;;;;;
A work up begun by her internist , Dr. Brain , revealed a white blood cell count of 49,000 with 50% eosinophils .;;;;;;;;
She was admitted to Box Memorial Hospital Nursing Home for further evaluation .;;;;;;;;
Data collected there included a chest x-ray which was unremarkable .;;;;;;;;
The liver function tests showed an alkaline phosphatase of 303 , LDH 310 , SGOT 66 , albumin 2.5 .;;;;;;;;
A peripheral blood smear showed mature eosinophils in increased numbers .;;;;;;;;
Chromosomal studies were negative .;;;;;;;;
A bone scan showed increased uptake at the manubrium at the site of an old fracture , as well as in the right supraclavicular area .;;;;;;;;
A thyroid ultrasound showed an inferior thyroid mass .;;;;;;;;
This was followed by an abdominal CT which showed an enlarged spleen , a lytic lesion on the right iliac bone and a benign renal cyst .;;;;;;;;
Biopsy of the lytic lesion was consistent with metastases papillary carcinoma of the thyroid .;;;;;;;;
An upper gastrointestinal was unremarkable .;;;;;;;;
The small bowel follow through was within normal limits .;;;;;;;;
A thyroid scan revealed decreased function and displacement of the thyroid by a cold mass located inferiorly with calcifications on the right side .;;;;;;;;
A chest CT also revealed a small pulmonary nodule with a necrotic mass involving the right lung posteriorly .;;;;;;;;
The patient was subsequently referred to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital under the service of Dr. Brain .;;;;;;;;
She continued to have profound weakness , a decreased appetite and weight loss .;;;;;;;;
She also developed lower extremity edema as well as left upper extremity swelling associated with increased shortness of breath on exertion .;;;;;;;;
A needle biopsy of the right thyroid nodule showed papillary thyroid carcinoma .;;;;;;;;
The patient reports no history of radiation exposure , no family history of thyroid carcinoma , no recent travels or exposure to tuberculosis .;;;;;;;;
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :;;;;;;;;
Includes a history of atrial fibrillation with good heart rate control on Digoxin .;;;;;;;;
She reports no prior surgical history .;;;;;;;;
The patient also reports no known drug allergy .;;;;;;;;
SOCIAL HISTORY :;;;;;;;;
The patient lives alone in Leschle Drive , Sonpo , and does not report a smoking or alcohol history .;;;;;;;;
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :;;;;;;;;
Lanoxin , 0.25 mg po qd ; Lasix , 20 mg po qd .;;;;;;;
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :;;;;;;;;
The patient is a pleasant , elderly female in no acute distress .;;;;;;;;
Her vital signs showed a blood pressure of 126/72 , pulse 84 , respirations 22 , temperature 98.6 .;;;;;;;;
She had a 3 x 4 cm firm , nontender right thyroid mass that seemed to be fixed to the trachea .;;;;;;;;
She had no jugular venous distention or bruits .;;;;;;;;
The lungs exhibited right basilar dullness one quarter of the way up .;;;;;;;;
She had no definite S3 .;;;;;;;;
The liver edge was palpable to 6 cm below the right costal margin .;;;;;;;;
Her spleen could not be palpated .;;;;;;;;
She had 4+ edema to the knees bilaterally .;;;;;;;;
LABORATORY DATA :;;;;;;;;
On admission the white blood count was 67.3 with a differential of 21% polys , 16% bands , 3% lymphocytes , 2% monocytes , 57% eosinophils and 1% myelocytes .;;;;;;;;
Her hematocrit was 38.8 , hemoglobin 13.7 , platelet count 155,000 , PT 12.7/10.1 , PTT 33.9 , erythrocyte sedimentation rate 18 , calcium 7.5 , phosphorus 3.5 , sodium 136 , potassium 3.7 , BUN 15 , total protein 5.9 , albumin 2.3 , globulin 3.6 , alkaline phosphatase 379 , SGOT 37 , Digoxin level 0.7 .;;;;;;;;
HOSPITAL COURSE :;;;;;;;;
The patient was admitted to Dr. Shatermivaet S Brain on 4/28/93 with a history of papillary carcinoma of the thyroid with bone involvement and possible lung involvement .;;;;;;;;
Work up was begun for the possible myeloproliferative / myelodysplastic disorder associated with the hyper-eosinophilic syndrome .;;;;;;;;
Accordingly , an Oncology consult was called on 4/29/93 and a bone marrow aspirate biopsy was performed .;;;;;;;;
This revealed maturation of leukocytes to all stages with markedly increased eosinophilic proliferation .;;;;;;;;
A lung biopsy was performed on 4/30/93 without definitive results .;;;;;;;;
During this time the patient 's coagulation status had improved with Vitamin K therapy with PTs normalizing .;;;;;;;;
ANCA serum results were negative .;;;;;;;;
ANA results were also nonsuggestive .;;;;;;;;
The patient continued to suffer from edema of the left upper extremity and a Vascular Radiology consult revealed a thrombosis of the left subclavian vein extending into the axillary vein .;;;;;;;;
There was some thrombosis of the left internal jugular vein as well .;;;;;;;;
A head CT was performed and was completely negative for any metastatic process involving the brain .;;;;;;;;
Thus , a heparin sliding scale was begun .;;;;;;;;
Meanwhile , the patient 's eosinophilia was treated with a trial of prednisone .;;;;;;;;
She also developed a mild urinary tract infection which responded to Bactrim , but which was subsequently stopped because of diarrhea .;;;;;;;;
The conclusions at this time of the thyroid cytologist , as well as the bone pathologist , were that the findings were diagnostic of papillary thyroid carcinoma with pulmonary metastases .;;;;;;;;
Dr. Trial was subsequently consulted on 5/5 for surgical intervention .;;;;;;;;
On 5/6/93 the patient underwent a right thyroidectomy with sacrifice of the right recurrent laryngeal nerve as well as the right sternothyroid muscle and lower parathyroid gland .;;;;;;;;
She underwent autotransplantation of the right upper parathyroid gland , as well as repair of a right posterior membranous tracheotomy .;;;;;;;;
She was received in the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit immediately postoperatively in stable condition .;;;;;;;;
Her rate was well controlled on Digoxin .;;;;;;;;
The patient was transferred to the floor on 5/7 .;;;;;;;;
On the ward she continued a gentle diuresis as well as Solu-Medrol therapy .;;;;;;;;
Calcium levels remained 7.2 to 7.5 postoperatively .;;;;;;;;
She continued to improve with a slight hoarseness in her voice that was expected .;;;;;;;;
She continued to exhibit asymptomatic atrial fibrillation .;;;;;;;;
Anticoagulation was begun on the third postoperative day with Coumadin .;;;;;;;;
She was effectively anticoagulated with a PT in the range between 15 and 17 over a control of 10 .;;;;;;;;
She also received a Radiation Therapy consult for local control of her invasive carcinoma .;;;;;;;;
She did well on the ward and was discharged on her ninth postoperative day .;;;;;;;;
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :;;;;;;;;
Metastatic papillary thyroid carcinoma .;;;;;;;;
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :;;;;;;;;
Coumadin , 5 mg po alternating with 2.5 mg po ; prednisolone , 30 mg po bid ; hydrochlorothiazide , 50 mg po bid ; potassium chloride , 40 mEq po bid ; Augmentin , 500 mg po tid ; Digoxin , 0.125 mg po qd ; Tylenol , 650 mg po q4h prn ; Carafate , 1 gram po bid ; Synthroid , 0.125 mg po qd .
DISPOSITION :;;;;;;;;
The patient was discharged home with Terchestlumnesamp Medical Center referral for weekly blood tests , potassium and PT .;;;;;;;;
The patient is also to keep her left arm elevated and to remain on a low sodium diet .;;;;;;;;
She will be maintained on a PT between 15 and 17 with Coumadin .;;;;;;;;
Arrangements will be made for radiation therapy to the right neck and right iliac crest .;;;;;;;;
The prognosis for rehabilitation potential is guarded .;;;;;;;;

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :;;;;;;;;
Status post elective ICD pulse generator replacement .;;;;;;;;
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :;;;;;;;;
Myotonic muscular dystrophy .;;;;;;;;
Cardiomyopathy .;;;;;;;;
Recurrent ventricular tachycardia .;;;;;;;;
status post ICD placement , status post pacemaker placement for symptomatic sinus bradycardia , history of seizure disorder , history of asthma , status post right lower extremity deep venous thrombosis , history of inferior vena cava filter placement .;;;;;;;;
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :;;;;;;;;
Replacement of ICD pulse generator .;;;;;;;;
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :;;;;;;;;
REASON FOR ADMISSION :;;;;;;;;
This is a 55-year-old female , with complicated prior medical history , including myotonic muscular dystrophy , resulting in cardiomyopathy , who also had multiple , recurrent ventricular tachycardias in the past requiring cardioversion , radio frequency ablation , pulse generator placement ( cardiovascular defibrillator ) 08/93 .;;;;;;;;
The patient is now admitted for elective replacement of her pulse generator due to end of life .;;;;;;;;
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :;;;;;;;;
The patient underwent successful replacement of her pulse generator .;;;;;;;;
This procedure was quite complicated , required intubation during [ ] anesthesia due to respiratory compromise , and was technically challenging ; however , preexistent leads did not show any problems , and the patient received new Medtronic [ ] pulse generator .;;;;;;;
The DFT was less than 24 joules .;;;;;;;;
The patient was extubated successfully and recovered uneventfully .;;;;;;;;
Final settings of her device include ejection fraction detection at the rate of 182 beats per minutes , therapy for this is 34 joules x 6 , VT detection between 160-182 beats per minute , therapy for this is 10 joules x 1 and 34 joules x 4 .;;;;;;;;
VVI is set in the backup mode at the rate of 40 beats per minute .;;;;;;;;
The patient 's pacemaker was also interrogated after procedure , if settings did not change during defibrillation , and includes minimum rate of 60 beats per minute with a maximum rate of 90 beats per minute , the mode is VVIR , bipolar configuration with a lead of an amplitude of 5 volts and with .5 msec .;;;;;;;;
The patient 's length of longevity was estimated at 35 months at this time .;;;;;;;;
The patient recovered uneventfully after the procedure .;;;;;;;;
She received standard antibiotics .;;;;;;;;
She is back to her baseline ambulatory level .;;;;;;;;
She is going to be discharged home today with follow up with Dr. Jescdrig in his private office in about two months .;;;;;;;;
She will also be followed in ICD Clinic .;;;;;;;;

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :;;;;;;;;
Adult respiratory distress syndrome .;;;;;;;;
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :;;;;;;;;
Urinary tract infection , tracheostomy status , diabetes mellitus .;;;;;;;;
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :;;;;;;;;
Mr. Stain was transferred from the Oreiewlefell Merkane I Penaltbridgesgreat University Medical Center for progressive respiratory failure and adult respiratory distress syndrome superimposed on a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , perhaps asthma , and ulcerative colitis .;;;;;;;;
His only positive result was a sputum culture for Pseudomonas and this came after he had already been on antibiotics .;;;;;;;;
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :;;;;;;;;
The physical examination on transfer showed an alert male with temperature 100 degrees , blood pressure 120/64 , heart rate 80 .;;;;;;;;
He was intubated with pressor support of 25 , and PEEP of 12.5 with 70% FIO2 .;;;;;;;;
Tracheostomy tube was in good position .;;;;;;;;
There was an audible air leak .;;;;;;;;
His chest showed bilateral rhonchi .;;;;;;;;
The abdomen was distended with active bowel sounds .;;;;;;;;
The rectal examination was unremarkable .;;;;;;;;
Extremities showed trace pulmonary edema .;;;;;;;;
LABORATORY DATA :;;;;;;;;
A chest X-ray showed diffuse bilateral alveolar infiltrates , greater in the lower lung fields than in the upper .;;;;;;;;
The EKG showed normal sinus rhythm at 83 , with an 11 degree axis , non-specific ST-T wave changes .;;;;;;;;
The sputum Gram stain showed a few polys and no organisms .;;;;;;;;
The blood gas showed a pO2 of 56 , pCO2 of 48 and pH of 7.47 .;;;;;;;;
HOSPITAL COURSE :;;;;;;;;
The patient was seen in consultation by Dr. Wire who felt that manipulation of the tracheal tube was the best approach to the air leak since it was a new trach and he was requiring such high ventilator support that it was risky to change it .;;;;;;;;
He also felt that lung biopsy at this time was rather risky .;;;;;;;;
The patient was therefore completely cultured again and begun on antibiotic coverage which would take care of the Pseudomonas he was known to have .;;;;;;;;
The steroids were tapered .;;;;;;;;
He was also begun on anti-Candida regimen for his urinary tract infection with yeast being seen .;;;;;;;;
Because of the story of hemoptysis , he also underwent an exotic bleeding work up for such things as Wegner 's and Goodpasture 's .;;;;;;;;
These results were all negative .;;;;;;;;
He continued to require very high FIO2 .;;;;;;;;
He was found to have a DVT by ultrasound .;;;;;;;;
He underwent a trial of TPA followed by heparin .;;;;;;;;
This produced substantially further hemoptysis and the need for transfusion .;;;;;;;;
He stabilized from this , but on the fifth while continuing to have extremely ventilator requirement .;;;;;;;;
In consultation with his family , it was decided that enough support had been done .;;;;;;;;
At that time , therefore , ventilator support was withdrawn under the comfort measures of morphine .;;;;;;;;

Her chest X-ray showed a diffusely interstitial lung process .;;;;;;;;
Her electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 80 , with no ischemic changed .;;;;;;;;
Her intravenous pyelogram showed atrophic right kidney with no excretion .;;;;;;;;
The size of the left kidney showed good function , but mild hydronephrosis , and columnation of the left ureter .;;;;;;;;
She had an irregular appearing bladder , with appearance of tumor versus clot .;;;;;;;;
HOSPITAL COURSE :;;;;;;;;
The patient was admitted to the service of Dr. Bolmshi , where she received intravenous fluids , abdominal and pelvic computerized tomography scan , chest computerized tomography scan , and was offered cystoscopy .;;;;;;;;
Her computerized tomography scans were consistent with tumor mass in the posterior bladder with retroperitoneal and pelvic lymphadenopathy .;;;;;;;;
She had a 24 hour urine collection for possibility of beginning chemotherapy .;;;;;;;;
Her urine output on hospital day three was light pink , and the rest of her exam was unchanged .;;;;;;;;
Both Radiation Oncology and Medical Oncology consults were obtained .;;;;;;;;

CHIEF COMPLAINT :;;;;;;;;
Elective transcatheter radio frequency ablation of the AV node for drug refractory atrial fibrillation .;;;;;;;;
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :;;;;;;;;
The patient is an 83 year old male with longstanding atrial fibrillation that has proved refractory to numerous AV nodal agents in the past .;;;;;;;;
He was recently hospitalized at Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital in the summer of 1993 for elective radio frequency ablation of the AV node , however , the patient , after extensive discussions , declined this procedure .;;;;;;;;
He is now readmitted after reconsideration and willingness to undergo treatment .;;;;;;;;
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :;;;;;;;;
The past medical history is significant for 1. chronic atrial fibrillation , refractory to numerous medications , as above ,;;;;;;;;
2. peripheral vascular disease , status post abdominal aortic aneurysm repair in April 1989 , status post axio-bifemoral grafts in September 1992 .;;;;;;;;
3. Status post permanent pacemaker implantation in 1984 ( Medtronic model # 8422 VVI ) ,;;;;;;;;
4. no known drug allergies .;;;;;;;;
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :;;;;;;;;
On physical examination on admission , the patient appeared well .;;;;;;;;
The rhythm was atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response between 100 and 130 beats per minute .;;;;;;;;
The lungs were clear .;;;;;;;;
The Cardiovascular exam showed an irregular rhythm .;;;;;;;;
The first and second heart sounds were otherwise normal .;;;;;;;;
There were no murmurs or gallops .;;;;;;;;
LABORATORY DATA :;;;;;;;;
On admission , the electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation with intermittent ventricular pacing , and a left bundle branch block pattern at baseline .;;;;;;;;
The baseline creatinine was 1.8 .;;;;;;;;
The hematocrit was 44 and the prothrombin time was 12.7 on the evening of admission .;;;;;;;;
HOSPITAL COURSE :;;;;;;;;
The patient was taken to the Cardiac Electrophysiology Laboratory on 4-24-93 .;;;;;;;;
The baseline rhythm was documented to be atrial fibrillation with a mean ventricular response rate of 125 beats per minute .;;;;;;;;
A total of two radio frequency applications ( 60 seconds , 55 volts , 33 watts ) was applied with the ablation catheter and a typical HIS position ( right anteroseptal ) resulting in complete heart block with an underlying ventricular rhythm resulting from pacing at 50 beats per minute .;;;;;;;;
No spontaneous rhythm was demonstrated after pacemaker programming down to a rate of 30 beats per minute .;;;;;;;;
After fifteen minutes of observation , the rhythm remained ventricular paced at 50 beats per minute with a threshold of 2.5 volts at 0.1 milliseconds pulse width .;;;;;;;;
The pacemaker was reprogrammed to a rate of 70 beats per minute at 2.5 volts and 0.5 milliseconds pulse width .;;;;;;;;
Sensitivity was reprogrammed to 5 volts .;;;;;;;;
The patient tolerated this procedure without difficulty .;;;;;;;;
He was transferred back to the Scst.ontdrain University Medical Center Step Down Unit in satisfactory condition .;;;;;;;;
There were no groin complications related to his venous puncture site .;;;;;;;;
He was maintained on interim heparin and his Coumadin was reinitiated .;;;;;;;;
Throughout the remainder of his hospitalization he remained in atrial fibrillation with complete heart block , as expected , with ventricular demand pacing at 70 beats per minute .;;;;;;;;
The final program settings of his Medtronic # 8422 VVI pacemaker were 70 beats per minute , pulse width 0.5 milliseconds , amplitude 2.5 volts , sensitivity 5 millivolts , refractory period 325 milliseconds .;;;;;;;;
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :;;;;;;;;
1. Drug resistance atrial fibrillation ,;;;;;;;;
2. radio frequency ablation of HIS bundle ,;;;;;;;;
3. pacemaker dependence ,;;;;;;;;
4. peripheral vascular disease , as above .;;;;;;;;
SPECIAL PROCEDURES AND OPERATIONS :;;;;;;;;
1. Radio frequency ablation of HIS bundle with resultant complete AV block and pacemaker dependence , 4-24-93 ,;;;;;;;;

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :;;;;;;;;
The patient is a 63 year old woman with a history of mixed adenocarcinoma and large cell carcinoma of the left upper lobe of the lung who is being admitted for Neoadjuvant chemotherapy with Cisplatinum , 5-FU and Velban .;;;;;;;;
Her history has been well documented in her previous notes .;;;;;;;;
Briefly , she was originally diagnosed in April 1993 with lung carcinoma .;;;;;;;;
Bronchoscopy and mediastinoscopy revealed an unresectable mediastinal tumor with the left tracheobronchial angle node positive for cancer , and the right paratracheal node positive for anthracosis .;;;;;;;;
Formal pathology revealed a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with focal giant cells .;;;;;;;;
Bone scan , head CT and other staging studies were all negative for evidence of metastatic disease .;;;;;;;;
The patient is being treated with preoperative neoadjuvant chemotherapy using 5 FU , Vinblastine , Cisplatinum and concomitant radiation therapy .;;;;;;;;
She is now admitted for her second course of that therapy .;;;;;;;;
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :;;;;;;;;

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :;;;;;;;;
Mr. Villesatelkscurb is a fifty year old black gentleman with a long history of hepatitis C , believed to be contracted during transfusions in a previous trauma .;;;;;;;;
The patient had recently prior to this admission , had a rise in his alpha feta protein and a biopsy of his liver had shown hepatocellular carcinoma .;;;;;;;;
The patient was admitted for liver transplant workup and to await liver transplant .;;;;;;;;
PAST MEDICAL and;;;;;;;;
SURGICAL HISTORY :;;;;;;;;
Significant for motor vehicle accident in 1966 , requiring exploratory laparotomy and splenectomy , tonsillectomy as a child , pneumonia in the past , hepatitis C and recent diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma .;;;;;;;;
ADVERSE DRUG REACTIONS :;;;;;;;;
no known drug allergies .;;;;;;;;
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :;;;;;;;;
On admission medications included Lasix and iron .;;;;;;;;
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :;;;;;;;;
Significant for normal head , eyes , ears , nose , throat exam with no scleral icterus .;;;;;;;;
Heart regular rate and rhythm , his lungs were clear .;;;;;;;;
He had no appreciable ascites .;;;;;;;;
He did have clubbing and palmar erythema with bilateral ankle edema .;;;;;;;;
He was Neurologically intact .;;;;;;;;
LABORATORY DATA :;;;;;;;;
bilirubin to be .6 .;;;;;;;;
SGOT of 80 .;;;;;;;;
HOSPITAL COURSE :;;;;;;;;
Preoperatively , the patient underwent chemo-embolization for his hepatocellular carcinoma .;;;;;;;;
The remainder of his preoperative course was benign .;;;;;;;;
On July 15 , 1992 , a liver became available , and the patient underwent hepatectomy and orthotopic liver transplant .;;;;;;;;
His operation was complicated by severe coagulopathy requiring fifty-nine units of packed red blood cells , 64 units of FFP and 34 units of platelets .;;;;;;;;
Postoperatively , the patient continued to have a coagulopathy requiring re-exploration on postoperatively day 2 , with findings only of hematoma and no active bleeding .;;;;;;;;
Initially , the patient did well in the Intensive Care Unit , mentally alert , and oriented , however , he continued to be coagulopathic and was requiring large amounts of blood and FFP transfusions , with a resultant pulmonary edema .;;;;;;;;
He developed renal failure felt to be ATN secondary to ischemia of his kidneys .;;;;;;;;
The patient remained intubated in the Intensive Care Unit for twelve days prior to his death .;;;;;;;;
He had daily transfusions of FFP and blood , and continued coagulopathy .;;;;;;;;
He also developed thrombocytopenia , requiring persistent platelet transfusions on a daily basis .;;;;;;;;
His immunosuppression was OKT3 and Solu Medrol , and he underwent hemodialysis and ultra filtration to remove fluid .;;;;;;;;
While in the ICU he developed seizures , requiring large amounts of intravenous Valium to break his seizures , and he was maintained on Tegretol and Dilantin .;;;;;;;;
However , he became progressively more mentally obtunded .;;;;;;;;
During the seizure , he bit his tongue , resulting in a large bleed from his tongue , which was sutured by the ENT Service , however , his continued coagulopathy resulted in bleeding from his nasopharynx , which could never be identified , and also upper gastrointestinal bleeding .;;;;;;;;
Endoscopy never revealed specific sources of bleeding , although he appeared to have a diffuse duodenitis .;;;;;;;;
He was started on Pitressin to try to control the gastrointestinal bleeding , but he continued to have severe bleeding , and became progressively hypotensive , with eventual bradycardia and cardiac arrest .;;;;;;;;
He was pronounced dead at 3:49 PM on July 15 , 1992 .;;;;;;;;

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :;;;;;;;;
Metastatic adenocarcinoma of lung primary .;;;;;;;;
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :;;;;;;;;
Metastatic brain tumor .;;;;;;;;
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :;;;;;;;;
Mr. Days presented in September 1993 with a dry cough , and left arm / hand paresthesias .;;;;;;;;
Workup at that time showed a large right upper lobe lung mass , infiltrating positive C4-C6 vertebrae , and appeared to be threatening the spinal cord .;;;;;;;;
Mr. Days underwent a biopsy and stabilization procedure of the C4 through C6 veretebrae by Drs. Lockstrip and Rekefreiermin of Neurosurgery .;;;;;;;;
The biopsy was consistent with poorly-differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma , thought to be lung primary , given his chest X-ray findings and smoking history .;;;;;;;;
Mr. Days subsequently underwent external X-ray therapy to the cervical spine for palliation .;;;;;;;;
Bone-scan and abdominal computerized tomography scan in October 1993 showed metastatic disease diffusely in the ribs , cervical , and lumbar spine , pelvis , and femur , and metastases to the liver and left adrenal gland .;;;;;;;;
In December 1993 , Mr. Days underwent brachiotherapy of his right upper lobe mass .;;;;;;;;
Since that time , his disease has progressed with increasing metastases , at least his pelvis and spine .;;;;;;;;
Compression fractures of T12 and L3 were noted in February 1993 .;;;;;;;;
Mr. Days has also developed a slowly-progressive microcytic anemia , with elevated ferritin and normal B12 and folate levels over the past several months , thought secondary to probable bone marrow involvement of his tumor .;;;;;;;;
He also has apparently developed a mild-moderate persistent leukocytosis over the past 1-2 months , progressively higher neutrophil percentages , but without clear evidence of systemic infection .;;;;;;;;
He also developed rather regular night sweats and fevers , which have been attributed to tumor fevers .;;;;;;;;
On 03/23/94 , Mr. Days presented to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital Emergency Ward for significant sacral decubitus ulcer , which was debrided by Surgery .;;;;;;;;
They recommended a ten-day course of Keflex , which he completed , and b.i.d. wet-to-dry dressing changes .;;;;;;;;
He was PPD-negative , with positive control , back in September 1993 , but that needs to be verified .;;;;;;;;
He received a Pneumovax in 09/93 .;;;;;;;;
On the day of admission , the patient presented with chief complaint of difficulty focusing , walking , and coordinating his movements for the past three days .;;;;;;;;
The patient 's family initially attributed this to overmedicaion with Tylenol III .;;;;;;;;
He denied any nausea , vomiting , unusual fevers or rigors , or acute confusional state .;;;;;;;;
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :;;;;;;;;
His adenocarcinoma is outlined above .;;;;;;;;
2. Hypertension , controlled with Nadolol .;;;;;;;;
3. Constipation , rather severe , secondary to pain medications .;;;;;;;;
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :;;;;;;;;
MS-Contin , 30 mg. , b.i.d. , Nadolol , about 350 mg. , qD , Tylenol No. III , prn , multivitamins , and five stool softeners .;;;;;;;;
His initial blood gas was 47/37/7.47 on room air , with corresponding O2 saturation of 88% .;;;;;;;;
His hematocrit on admission was 28.6 , with a white count of 16.4 , and platelet count of 313 .;;;;;;;;
His differential included 92% polys , 2% bands , one lymphocyte , 4 monocytes , and one eosinophil .;;;;;;;;
His electrolytes were normal , with a sodium of 136 , potassium of 4 , chloride of 102 , bicarbonate was 24.3 , BUN of 24 , and creatinine of 1.1 .;;;;;;;;
His glucose was 166 .;;;;;;;;
His calcium was 9 , his phosphate was 3.4 , his magnesium was 2 , his albumin was 1.8 , his globulin was 4.9 , his LDH was 422 , his SGOT was 43 , his alkaline phosphatase was 424 , his total bilirubin was 1.2 , and direct bilirubin was 0.6 .;;;;;;;;
His chest X-ray on admission compared to January 9 , 1993 :;;;;;;;;
There was increase in volume loss in the right upper lobe .;;;;;;;;
There was mild patchy consolidation consistent with collapse or infection .;;;;;;;;
The right hemidiaphragm was more elevated , and new left-sided metastases were evident .;;;;;;;;
Head computerized tomography scan revealed a 1 cm. lesion with surrounding edema and a mild midline cyst in the right occipital lobe , consistent with a metastatic lesion .;;;;;;;;
There may be two additional smaller metastases present .;;;;;;;;
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :;;;;;;;;
This is a 63 year old cachectic , ill-appearing man , in mild respiratory distress .;;;;;;;;
His temperature was 96.4 , his blood pressure was 178/72 , his pulse was 86 , and respirations were 23 .;;;;;;;;
His head , eyes , ears , nose , throat examination was normocephalic , atraumatic , pupils equal , round , reactive to light and accommodation , extra ocular movements were intact , fundi were benign , without papilledema , and no lesions .;;;;;;;;
His oropharynx was benign .;;;;;;;;
His neck was supple , no lymphadenopathy , no jugular venous distention , his carotids were 2+ , without bruits , and his neck was without any masses .;;;;;;;;
His lungs had some right upper lobe wheezing , and rhonchi , with an increased I to E ratio , and expiratory wheezes throughout .;;;;;;;;
On cardiac examination , he was regular rate , normal Sl and S2 , no murmurs or extra heart sounds .;;;;;;;;
His abdomen :;;;;;;;;
He did have bowel sounds , soft , nontender , nondistended , no hepatosplenomegaly .;;;;;;;;
Extremities :;;;;;;;;
He had 2+ pulses throughout , no clubbing , cyanosis or edema .;;;;;;;;
His skin :;;;;;;;;
He did have a decubitus ulcer over the sacrum , with no evidence of supra-infection .;;;;;;;;
Neurologically , he was alert and oriented times three , with cranial nerves II / XII grossly intact .;;;;;;;;
Strength was 5/5 throughout , except for left lower extremity , 4/5 weakness secondary to hip pain .;;;;;;;;
His sensory examination was grossly intact .;;;;;;;;
There were no cerebellar deficits .;;;;;;;;
His reflexes were normal , with downgoing toes bilaterally .;;;;;;;;
The patient 's HOSPITAL COURSE was significant for a chest computerized tomography scan , the impression which showed :;;;;;;;;
1. Marked interval progression of metastatic carcinoma of the lung , with chest wall , bony , pulmonary , hepatic , and vertebral metastases , as above .;;;;;;;;
2. Interval development of large bilateral pleural effusions , larger on the right .;;;;;;;;
3. Compression fracture of T12 vertebral body .;;;;;;;;
This may or may not be pathologic .;;;;;;;;
The patient also had a head computerized tomography scan done , which showed the new metastasis , as mentioned above .;;;;;;;;
The patient was begun on palliative X-ray therapy to the brain and to the right pelvis , where he also has metastases .;;;;;;;;
The patient was started on intravenous Dilantin for seizure prophylaxis and Decadron to prevent cerebral edema in the setting of his radiation treatments .;;;;;;;;
At the time of discharge , the patient will require ten more treatments to the left hip , and nine to the brain .;;;;;;;;
Also of note , the patient was empirically treated during this hospitalization for a possible post-destructive pneumonia .;;;;;;;;
The patient was unable to bring up sputum throughout this hospitalization , with an increased white count , with a left shift on admission , and a chest X-ray , suggestive of a partial collapse of the right upper lobe , and it was thought to empirically treat this patient with antibiotics .;;;;;;;;
The patient 's sacral decubitus was followed throughout by Surgery throughout his hospital course .;;;;;;;;
This hospital course was also significant for having a family meeting on the 15th of April to decide what further treatments would maximize the patient 's quality of life .;;;;;;;;
The patient and the family opted for palliative X-ray therapy and home hospice .;;;;;;;;
The patient was discharged with full knowledge of his grave prognosis , to go home with home hospice .;;;;;;;;

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :;;;;;;;;
stable .;;;;;;;;
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :;;;;;;;;
Pauci May is a sixty three year old patient referred by Dr. Laymie Aslinke for significant coronary artery disease .;;;;;;;;
He developed acute pulmonary edema on May 27 , 1993 , and was admitted to Sonpathcermu Jords Hospital , and found to be in rapid atrial fibrillation .;;;;;;;;
He denied any angina .;;;;;;;;
He had a gaited cardiac blood pool scan that showed an ejection fraction of 31% .;;;;;;;;
His pulmonary function tests showed FEV1 of 2.1 , and he was found to have intermittent obstructive sleep apnea .;;;;;;;;
An echocardiogram showed a dilated left atrium with mitral anular calcification .;;;;;;;;
He was discharged home but readmitted on May 21 with recurrent congestive heart failure .;;;;;;;;
A Thallium Stress Test showed equivocal ST segment changes with fixed apical and inferior defects .;;;;;;;;
His coronary risk factors include cigarette smoking , obesity , a family history of coronary disease , and elevated serum cholesterol .;;;;;;;;
He also has a history of atrial fibrillation with sinus pauses during sleep apnea .;;;;;;;;
On June 4 , 1993 , he underwent cardiac catheterization .;;;;;;;;
He was found to have an occluded right coronary artery , 70% distal left main lesion , 80% proximal ramus lesion , and his left ventricular ejection shows preserved function except for akinesis of the inferior wall .;;;;;;;;
His ejection fraction was 50% , a carotid duplex study showed plaqueing but no critical lesions .;;;;;;;;
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :;;;;;;;;
As above .;;;;;;;;
SOCIAL HISTORY :;;;;;;;;
He has a wife Pandeprob and lives in Ashing .;;;;;;;;
He did smoke up to three pack per day .;;;;;;;;
He has three children .;;;;;;;;
He is retired .;;;;;;;;
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :;;;;;;;;
Six foot , 250 pounds .;;;;;;;;
He is a well appearing male , in no distress .;;;;;;;;
HIs blood pressure was 140/70 , pulse 80 and irregular .;;;;;;;;
His neck veins were not distended .;;;;;;;;
His carotids showed bilateral bruits .;;;;;;;;
His lungs are clear .;;;;;;;;
His cardiac exam shows a 1/6 systolic ejection murmur .;;;;;;;;
His abdomen is obese , but benign .;;;;;;;;
His peripheral pulses are intact .;;;;;;;;
He has no peripheral edema .;;;;;;;;
His Neurological exam is nonfocal .;;;;;;;;
LABORATORY DATA :;;;;;;;;
sodium 140 , potassium 4.4 , chloride 104 , CO2 30 , calcium 9.3 , phosphorous 1.2 , BUN 9 , creatinine 1.3 , glucose 183 .;;;;;;;;
Uric acid 8.4 , bilirubin 0.7 , alkaline phosphatase 72 , amylase 46 , SGOT 20 , and his Digoxin level was 1.0 .;;;;;;;;
hematocrit 38% , white blood cell count 7700 , MCV 86 , PT and PTT were normal .;;;;;;;;
urinalysis was unremarkable .;;;;;;;;
His chest X-ray was normal with bilateral pleural thickening .;;;;;;;;
His electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation .;;;;;;;;
There were nonspecific ST and T wave changes .;;;;;;;;
HOSPITAL COURSE :;;;;;;;;
The patient was admitted to Hellworthston Hospital .;;;;;;;;
There , he stabilized , and was seen in consultation by Cardiology and Anesthesiology .;;;;;;;;
There was concern over his sleep apnea , but he appeared to have primarily cardiac disease and therefore because of the left main stenosis , it was reasonable to proceed .;;;;;;;;
On June 24 , 1993 , Dr. Lenni Breutzoln performed triple coronary bypass surgery .;;;;;;;;
He placed a left internal mammary artery graft to the left anterior descending , single saphenous vein to the posterior descending artery with 170 cc. per minute flow and a single saphenous vein to the circumflex with 140 cc. per minute flow .;;;;;;;;
He weaned easily off cardiopulmonary bypass .;;;;;;;;
He had no hemodynamic difficulties .;;;;;;;;
He was able to wean from the ventilator , but he did have marginal oxygenation throughout .;;;;;;;;
He did revert back to atrial fibrillation .;;;;;;;;
He was extubated within forty eight hours .;;;;;;;;
He was transferred out of the Surgical Intensive Care Unit on June 26 .;;;;;;;;
He reverted back to atrial fibrillation that required Digoxin , and Verapamil to control .;;;;;;;;
He could not be converted back to normal sinus rhythm even with a trial of Quinaglute .;;;;;;;;
He also had anemia and he was seen in consultation by the Nutrition Service .;;;;;;;;
He was advised to have an ideal body weight of 178 pounds , and clearly a 2300 calorie diet was appropriate for him .;;;;;;;;
Weight reduction would be important in the long term management of his coronary disease .;;;;;;;;
He was treated with Digoxin and Diuretics along with Ace inhibitors because of his depressed left ventricular function .;;;;;;;;
He was able to ambulate although somewhat slowly because of his rapid atrial fibrillation .;;;;;;;;
It was considered to obtain a pulmonary consultation on a formal basis , but it was then felt that he would do better by healing fully from his surgery , because he really had little in the way of pulmonary complications , despite the history of sleep apnea of an obstructive basis .;;;;;;;;
Primary in his long term management is cardiac rehabilitation with weight reduction .;;;;;;;;
He will be followed closely in 23 Hwy , Hamp by Dr. Laymie Aslinke .;;;;;;;;

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :;;;;;;;;
Biliary obstruction secondary to malignancy .;;;;;;;;
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSES :;;;;;;;;
1 ) Down 's syndrome ,;;;;;;;;
2 ) intestinal malrotation ,;;;;;;;;
3 ) status post Ladd 's procedure ,;;;;;;;;
4 ) status post duodenal jejunostomy as an infant .;;;;;;;;
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :;;;;;;;;
endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with stent placement , performed on 11/25/93 .;;;;;;;;
ASSOCIATED PROCEDURES :;;;;;;;;
1 ) needle biopsy of portal mass , performed on 11/25/93 .;;;;;;;;
2 ) endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography , with temporary stent placement , performed on 11/23/93 .;;;;;;;;
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :;;;;;;;;
Mr. Tauaswatl is a 45 year old gentleman with Down 's syndrome , who presents to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital with jaundice .;;;;;;;;
Mr. Tauaswatl has a history of vague abdominal and back pain over the past several years .;;;;;;;;
A recent workup of his symptoms , which were predominantly right upper quadrant symptoms was done .;;;;;;;;
A right upper quadrant abdominal ultrasound was obtained in May of 1993 .;;;;;;;;
This study showed gall stones , with common bile duct dilatation .;;;;;;;;
Subsequently , an oral cholecystogram was performed , and the gall bladder was not visualized on this study .;;;;;;;;
The patient was therefore diagnosed with chronic cholelithiasis , and possible choledocholithiasis .;;;;;;;;
On Jul 27 , 1993 , the patient underwent a right upper quadrant abdominal exploration at the Nor Chi Gay Hospital .;;;;;;;;
At operation , a phlegmon was noted in the right upper quadrants in the region of the gall bladder .;;;;;;;;
The surgeons were unable to visualize the gall bladder , and the operation was aborted .;;;;;;;;
Since that time , the patient has had increasing jaundice , but no nausea or vomiting .;;;;;;;;
It should be noted that the patient has experienced occasional episodes of vomiting for years , but these symptoms have not changed recently .;;;;;;;;
The patient denies abdominal pain , fevers , chills , or any other complaints , although he was noted to have a fever over the weekend prior to admission .;;;;;;;;
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :;;;;;;;;
1 ) Down 's syndrome ,;;;;;;;;
2 ) intestinal malrotation ,;;;;;;;;
3 ) status post Ladd 's procedure ,;;;;;;;;
4 ) status post duodenojejunostomy as an infant .;;;;;;;;
ALLERGIES :;;;;;;;;
The patient has no known drug allergies .;;;;;;;;
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :;;;;;;;;
1 ) Tagamet 400 mg. po q.day ,;;;;;;;;
2 ) Tetracycline 250 mg. po bid prn ingrown facial hair .;;;;;;;;
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS :;;;;;;;;
Remarkable only for a recent weight loss of 20 lb .;;;;;;;;
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :;;;;;;;;
The patient is a well-nourished but jaundiced male , with Down 's facies , in no acute distress .;;;;;;;;
Vital signs :;;;;;;;;
temperature 97.8 , heart rate 107 , blood pressure 116/77 , respirations 20 .;;;;;;;;
His head , eyes , ears , nose , and throat exam reveals a normocephalic and atraumatic head .;;;;;;;;
His pupils were equal , round , reactive to light and accommodation , positive scleral icterus , intact extra ocular movements , and a supple neck .;;;;;;;;
Examination of the back reveals no costovertebral angle tenderness .;;;;;;;;
Examination of the chest reveals lungs which are clear to auscultation .;;;;;;;;
Cardiovascular exam reveals regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 and S2 , a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur heard best at the upper right sternal border , and a 1/6 decrescendo diastolic murmur heard best at Erb 's point , with no gallop or rub appreciated .;;;;;;;;
The abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended .;;;;;;;;
There are no palpable masses , and there is no shake tenderness .;;;;;;;;
There is a well-healed right subcostal scar , and a well-healed right paramedian scar .;;;;;;;;
Rectal examination is nontender , free of any palpable masses , and guaiac-negative stool .;;;;;;;;
Extremities :;;;;;;;;
no clubbing , cyanosis or edema .;;;;;;;;
Neurological examination is nonfocal .;;;;;;;;
LABORATORY DATA :;;;;;;;;
A panel of serum electrolytes is normal .;;;;;;;;
The white blood cell count is 7.3 , hematocrit 28.4 , platelets 586,000 .;;;;;;;;
Lymphocyte differential count shows 77% PMNs , 13% lymphocytes , 8% monocytes , and 1% basophils .;;;;;;;;
Alkaline phosphatase is 1,342 , lactacte dehydrogenase is 253 , and AST is 221 .;;;;;;;;
Total bilirubin is 10.7 , and direct bilirubin is 8.2 .;;;;;;;;
Total protein is 7.1 , and albumin is 2.1 .;;;;;;;;
Serum amylase is 43 .;;;;;;;;
Calcium is 8.2 , magnesium 1.8 , and phosphorous 3.1 .;;;;;;;;
X-ray examination of the chest reveals clear lungs and a normal heart .;;;;;;;;
KUB and upright abdominal x-rays revealed no obstruction or perforation , focal dilatation of small bowel in the right upper quadrants , and two calcified densities noted in the right upper quadrants , which may represent gall stones .;;;;;;;;
Ultrasonography of the right upper abdominal quadrant reveals a portal mass with calcification and possible invasion of the portal vein , thought to appear suspiciously similar to a hepatocellular carcinoma .;;;;;;;;
Intrahepatic biliary duct dilatation was noted proximal to the mass .;;;;;;;;
Electrocardiography reveals normal sinus rhythm , with non-specific ST and T-wave abnormalities in leads 2 , 3 , and AVF .;;;;;;;;
The axis and intervals are otherwise within normal limits .;;;;;;;;
HOSPITAL COURSE :;;;;;;;;
The patient was admitted to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital to the General Surgery Service of Dr. Lynea Moyduhe .;;;;;;;;
A modified upper GI x-ray series was obtained , which revealed malpositioning of the duodenum and jejunum in the right abdomen , consistent with intestinal malrotation , but no evidence of obstruction in the duodenum or jejunum was identified .;;;;;;;;
Therefore , the patient was prevented from taking anything by mouth and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was performed .;;;;;;;;
This study identified a 5 centimeter narrowed segment in the distal common bile duct , and moderately severe dilatation of the left biliary radicals in the right hepatic duct .;;;;;;;;
A temporary stent was placed , which seemed to function well despite its unsatisfactory positioning .;;;;;;;;
The patient tolerated the procedure well , and there were no complications .;;;;;;;;
He was returned to the Surgical Ward in stable condition .;;;;;;;;
Because of the probable malignant nature of the patient 's biliary obstruction , the patient was returned to the GI lab on 11/25/93 , where repeat endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was performed .;;;;;;;;
This procedure was performed under general anesthesia , and resulted in successful placement of a permanent stent within the distal common bile duct .;;;;;;;;
Additionally , a computer tomography guided needle biopsy was performed of the paraportal mass .;;;;;;;;
These procedures were well tolerated by the patient , and were free of complication .;;;;;;;;
As before , the patient was covered with post-procedure antibiotic therapy .;;;;;;;;
He was returned to the surgical ward in stable condition .;;;;;;;;
Preliminary report on the biopsy specimen at the time of this dictation describes the presence of acute and chronic inflammation , but no malignant cells .;;;;;;;;
However , two cytology specimens were both positive for malignant cells , the histopathologic characteristics of which suggest adenocarcinoma .;;;;;;;;
Following the permanent stent placement , the patient 's diet was slowly advanced .;;;;;;;;
His serum bilirubin levels and other liver function studies continued to normalize .;;;;;;;;
Because of his rapid progress , the resolution of his right upper quadrant pain , and the fact that no surgical therapy was indicated at this time , the patient was discharged to his group home on 11/29/93 .;;;;;;;;

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :;;;;;;;;
Severe blunt abdominal trauma .;;;;;;;;
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :;;;;;;;;
1. Grade II / V laceration of liver ,;;;;;;;;
2. rupture of left renal vein ,;;;;;;;;
3. tear of transverse mesocolon ,;;;;;;;;
4. serosal tear of transverse colon ,;;;;;;;;
5. blunt fracture of the neck of the pancreas .;;;;;;;;
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS AND HOSPITAL COURSE :;;;;;;;;
Mr. Breath was a 32 year old previously healthy unbelted driver whose car was hit at high speed by a vehicle driven by an intoxicated driver .;;;;;;;;
The patient was ejected and his vehicle rolled over , possibly over him .;;;;;;;;
He was found awake at the scene , complaining of abdominal pain .;;;;;;;;
He had a blood pressure of 60 systolic upon arrival of the Giles Min General Hospital crew .;;;;;;;;
Intravenous fluids was given .;;;;;;;;
He was paralyzed and endotracheally intubated , and a 14 gauge catheter was inserted in his left chest because of poor breath sounds .;;;;;;;;
He arrived at the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital at 02:30 with a blood pressure of 86 and a heart rate of 170 .;;;;;;;;
Large bore cannulas were inserted into the femoral veins , bilateral chest tubes were placed , and his blood pressure rose to 110 systolic after two liters of crystalloid .;;;;;;;;
He had an ecchymosis over the medial right costal margin and his abdomen was distended .;;;;;;;;
His hematocrit was 36 , and creatinine 1.6 .;;;;;;;;
The abdominal tap was grossly positive for blood .;;;;;;;;
His blood pressure fell to 60 systolic as he was being transferred to the computerized tomography scan table ; the scan was aborted and he was taken directly to the operating room at 03:00 .;;;;;;;
At laparotomy , there was a liter of blood in the peritoneal cavity .;;;;;;;;
There was a class II laceration of the left liver at the falciform ligament which was actively bleeding , a tear of the transverse mesocolon from its base to the bowel wall with active bleeding , a 7 cm serosal tear of the adjacent transverse colon , and a large central retroperitoneal hematoma .;;;;;;;;
"Control of the super-celiac aorta was obtained , and both left and right sided """" Mattox """" maneuvers were performed .";;;;;;;;
The retroperitoneum was opened , with vigorous bleeding resulting .;;;;;;;;
This was controlled , necessitating ten minutes of aortic clamping and found to have originated from the rupture of the left renal vein one centimeter from its junction with the inferior vena cava .;;;;;;;;
The vein was divided and suture ligated .;;;;;;;;
Bleeding from the liver was controlled with sutures .;;;;;;;;
The tears in the transverse mesocolon and colon serosa were repaired .;;;;;;;;
The examination of the remainder of the abdominal contents revealed no other injury ; in particular , the entire anterior surface and the immediately juxtaduodenal posterior surface of the pancreas were normal .;;;;;;;
The patient was now very stable , and he was taken to the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit .;;;;;;;;
The patient had received ten units of packed red blood cells , five units of fresh frozen plasma , seven units of platelets , and nine liters of Ringer 's lactate .;;;;;;;;
An intracranial pressure monitoring bolt had been placed by the Neurosurgery Service staff during the laparotomy .;;;;;;;;
Intracranial pressures were normal .;;;;;;;;
That day , cranial computerized tomography scan and cervical spine films were normal .;;;;;;;;
An arch aortogram was normal .;;;;;;;;
Over the ensuing twenty-four hours , bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray with poor oxygenation and labile blood pressure requiring PA line guided fluid and pressors developed .;;;;;;;;
The patient had a large fluid requirement with total body capillary leak , decreasing SVR , oliguria unresponsive to Lasix / Mannitol accompanied by a rise in creatinine to 3.2 , worsening ARDS , a rise in temperature to 103 , and a serum amylase of 1265 .;;;;;;;;
He was returned to the operating room on July 4 .;;;;;;;;
Three liters of clear green fluid were found in the abdominal cavity .;;;;;;;;
Exploration of the pancreas revealed a posterior fracture a the superior mesenteric vessels .;;;;;;;;
Because of the intense diffuse inflammatory reaction that had already set in , it was decided that neither distal pancreatic resection nor Roux-en-Y drainage was feasible .;;;;;;;;
Four large flat Jackson-Pratt drains were placed , and gastrostomy , jejunostomy , and cholecystostomy tubes , as well as a right subclavian Quinton catheter were placed .;;;;;;;;
The patient 's hemodynamics had improved markedly with the evacuation of the peritoneal pancreatic fluid , so that he was no longer on pressors .;;;;;;;;
However , upon transfer from the operating room table to the RICU bed , he suffered a cardiac arrest , which upon investigation was a primary respiratory arrest ; the initial arterial blood gas was 32/88/6.92 .;;;;;;;
He was successfully resuscitated after fifteen minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation and he was taken to the RICU .;;;;;;;;
Continuous venovenous hemodialysis was started on July 5 , and continued for most of the remainder of the patient 's course .;;;;;;;;
Vancomycin , Flagyl , and Aztreonam were given for gram negative Coccobacilli ( later identified as Bacteroides ) that had grown in his blood cultures and gram negative rods ( Enterobacter ) in his peritoneal fluid .;;;;;;;;
He was kept sedated and paralyzed because of his severe adult respiratory distress syndrome .;;;;;;;;
Total parenteral nutrition was started on July 5 .;;;;;;;;
Initial improvement was followed by recurrence of low SVR , high cardiac output , ongoing acidosis , requiring norepinephrine infusion in the 30 to 40 mcg per minute range ; drainage from the Jackson-Pratt drains were minimal despite irrigation and manipulation .;;;;;;;
The patient was returned to the operating room on July 10 , where several loculated thin fluid collections were drained and obviously necrotic tissue was debrided .;;;;;;;;
It was decided to place more drains and pack the lesser sac with Adaptic and laparotomy pads .;;;;;;;;
The abdomen was left open , with the wound margins connected by a sheet of Marlex mesh to prevent evisceration .;;;;;;;;
He was returned to the operating room on July 12 , 13 , 16 , 19 , 21 , and 23 for packing change , irrigation and debridement .;;;;;;;;
Tracheostomy was also performed on July 17 .;;;;;;;;
There was severe diffuse peritonitis with intense inflammation , infection , and patchy necrosis of peritoneal surfaces and of the distal pancreas .;;;;;;;;
The subsequent overall course was a slow downhill one , with ongoing extreme hyperdynamic ( cardiac output 12 to 15 liters per minute ) and catabolic state .;;;;;;;;
On July 26 , abdominal irrigation and debridement was performed in the RICU ; this was repeated daily for the next three days .;;;;;;;
On July 29 , the septic state with low SVR and acidosis accelerated beyond the control of maximal support .;;;;;;;;
His blood pressure gradually fell , and he died early on July 30 , 1993 .;;;;;;;;
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :;;;;;;;;
Severe blunt abdominal trauma with rupture of liver , left renal vein , pancreas , and transverse mesocolon .;;;;;;;;
SPECIAL PROCEDURES AND OPERATIONS :;;;;;;;;

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :;;;;;;;;
Mr. Louplardkote is a 70 year old male who was admitted for coronary artery bypass grafting .;;;;;;;;
He has been followed by his local physician for heart block which has progressed and culminated in a DDD pacer being inserted 02/92 .;;;;;;;;
In March , 1993 he noted chest discomfort with exertion .;;;;;;;;
An exercise tolerance test and stress Thallium showed septal and anterior wall ischemia .;;;;;;;;
In October , 1993 the patient developed shortness of breath and orthopnea .;;;;;;;;
An echocardiogram at the time revealed left ventricular dilatation and septal dyskinesis .;;;;;;;;
The patient subsequently developed congestive heart failure which was treated with diuretics .;;;;;;;;
On 12/29 the patient underwent cardiac catheterization which revealed a right coronary artery that had serial stenosis , and left anterior descending artery that had a long complex proximal lesion and a circumflex which had its first obtuse marginal which was stenotic .;;;;;;;;
The left ventriculogram showed global hypokinesis and preserved left ventricular function with mitral valve prolapse without regurgitation .;;;;;;;;
The patient is thus admitted for coronary artery bypass grafting .;;;;;;;;
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :;;;;;;;;
1 ) hypercholesterolemia ,;;;;;;;;
2 ) arthritis ,;;;;;;;;
3 ) history of guaiac-positive stools with a lower gastrointestinal endoscopy negative three years ago ,;;;;;;;;
4 ) status post appendectomy .;;;;;;;;
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :;;;;;;;;
Toprol XL 50 mg. po q.day , Ismo 20 mg. po bid , Lasix 40 mg. d , Lopid 600 mg. po bid , Questran 1 scoop po bid , nitroglycerin spray prn .;;;;;;;;
ALLERGIES :;;;;;;;;
no known drug allergies .;;;;;;;;
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :;;;;;;;;
His head , eyes , ears , nose , and throat exam was benign .;;;;;;;;
Cardiac exam revealed a normal S1 and S2 with a I-II / VI late systolic murmur radiating to the apex .;;;;;;;;
Lungs were clear .;;;;;;;;
Abdomen was benign .;;;;;;;;
Rectal :;;;;;;;;
guaiac negative , no lesions , smooth prostate .;;;;;;;;
Vascular exam ; 2+ pulses throughout bilaterally without bruits .;;;;;;;
LABORATORY DATA :;;;;;;;;
On admission , chest x-ray revealed two nodular opacities that were projected over the left lung , one over the anterior aspect of the left fourth rib and the other over the interspace between the anterior sixth and seventh ribs .;;;;;;;;
These were also seen on previous film .;;;;;;;;
These were felt to be consistent with a granulomata .;;;;;;;;
There was also a bipolar pacemaker present .;;;;;;;;
Creatinine was 0.9 , BUN 13 , hematocrit was 40 .;;;;;;;;
HOSPITAL COURSE :;;;;;;;;
The patient was admitted to the hospital on 01/15/93 and on the following day was taken to the operating room where he underwent a saphenous coronary artery bypass graft to the diagonal , circumflex marginal artery , and acute marginal coronary artery and left internal mammary artery graft to the left anterior descending coronary artery .;;;;;;;;
This operation was performed by Dr. Chitllik Kote .;;;;;;;;
Intraoperative findings were as follows :;;;;;;;;
The pericardium was opened to reveal a heart that appeared essentially normal .;;;;;;;;
The diagonal coronary artery was isolated , opened and probed with a 1.5 millimeter probe .;;;;;;;;
The circumflex marginal artery was small and only took a 1 millimeter probe tightly .;;;;;;;;
The first main was anastomosed side to side to the diagonal and end to end to the circumflex marginal artery .;;;;;;;;
The left anterior descending artery was then isolated , opened , probed with a 1.5 millimeter probe and anastomosed to the left internal mammary artery .;;;;;;;;
The acute marginal branch of the right coronary artery was isolated , opened and probed with a 1.5 millimeter probe tightly and a second main was anastomosed to this .;;;;;;;;
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transported to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit in stable condition on nitroglycerin at 50 mcg. per minute Levophed at 4 mcg. per minute and Lidocaine at 1 mg. r minute .;;;;;;;;
The patient was extubated on postoperative day # 1 and transported to the routine postoperative care floor on postoperative day # 2 in good condition .;;;;;;;;
The only issue of note during the patient 's SICU course was a small right apical pneumothorax which disappeared on repeat chest x-ray .;;;;;;;;
The other issue was that the Pacer Lab was consulted for an atrial sensing problem .;;;;;;;;
The pace setter 2022 Synchrony II was interrogated .;;;;;;;;
It was found to have inadequate atrial sensing , even post re-programming to the maximum sensitivity at 0.5 millivolts .;;;;;;;;
No changes with unipolar ring or tip .;;;;;;;;
The V threshhold was changed from 0.6 millivolts/ 2.0 millivolts to 0.8 millivolts/ 4.0 millivolts .;;;;;;;;
The V sensor was changed from 4 millivolts to 2 millivolts .;;;;;;;;
It was felt that the atrial pacing would improve as the edema resolved .;;;;;;;;
Meanwhile , the patient was AV paced using the epicardial wires .;;;;;;;;
While on the routine postoperative care floor the patient continued to progress well .;;;;;;;;
Of note , he developed a small right apical pneumothorax which was followed on serial films and found to be stable and was not causing the patient any respiratory distress .;;;;;;;;
Also , the Pacer Service re-programmed the patient 's cardiac pacer to a VVIR mode with a rate of 60 beats per minute , an AV delay of 175 , a maximum track of 120 .;;;;;;;;
The ventricular pulse configuration was bipolar with a V-pulse width of .8 , a V-pulse amplitude of 4.0 , a V-sense configuration of bipolar , a V-sensitivity of 2.0 and a V-refractory of 250 .;;;;;;;;
The atrial pulse configuration was bipolar with an A-pulse width of .4 , an A-pulse amplitude of 2.5 , an A-sensed configuration that was bipolar , an A-sensitivity that was .5 , an A-refractory that was 325 .;;;;;;;;
Blanking was set at 38 , AV-safety option was on enable , PVC options were on , PMT options were off , a rate respiratory AV-delay was on enable , a magnet was temporary off .;;;;;;;;
The threshhold was 2.0 .;;;;;;;;
The measured average sensor was 2.0 .;;;;;;;;
The slope was 8 .;;;;;;;;
The maximum sensory rate was 110 .;;;;;;;;
The reaction time was fast , the recovery time was medium .;;;;;;;;
The patient continued to progress well and was ultimately discharged on 01/22/93 in good condition .;;;;;;;;
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :;;;;;;;;

PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :;;;;;;;;
1/13/94 - flexible bronchoscopy with biopsy , mediastinoscopy and biopsy , left pleural biopsy with excision of redundant left lower lobe emphysematous bullae ( reduction pneumoplasty ) .;;;;;;;;
ASSOCIATED PROCEDURES :;;;;;;;;
2/14/94 - tracheostomy .;;;;;;;;
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :;;;;;;;;
Mrs. Scarv is a 70 year old female who presented with a two and a half year history of dyspnea and progressively worsening exercise tolerance .;;;;;;;;
Her work up included a cardiac catheterization which showed moderate disease and pulmonary function tests which showed an FEV1 of .93 and a DLCO of 5.12 .;;;;;;;;
Her x-rays and CT scans showed progressive infiltrate in the left lower lobe .;;;;;;;;
She underwent bronchoscopy on 1/6/94 by the Pulmonary Service .;;;;;;;;
She was admitted post-bronchoscopy because of dyspnea and pain .;;;;;;;;
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :;;;;;;;;
( 1 ) hysterectomy .;;;;;;;;
( 2 ) colonic polypectomy .;;;;;;;;
( 3 ) Bilateral mastectomy treated with radiation therapy and chemotherapy .;;;;;;;;
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :;;;;;;;;
prednisone 10 mg q.d. , atenolol 25 mg q.d. , Cytotec 10 mg q.d. , Zantac 150 mg b.i.d.;;;;;;;;
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION :;;;;;;;;
respirations 22 , pulse 96 , systolic pressure 100 , head , eyes , ears , nose , throat examination :;;;;;;;;
sclerae nonicteric , PERRL , mucous membranes not cyanotic , neck was supple , carotids were 2+ without bruits .;;;;;;;;
The heart exam revealed a normal Sl and S2 regular rate and rhythm , no murmurs .;;;;;;;;
Chest :;;;;;;;;
decreased breath sounds at left base , crackles at both bases .;;;;;;;;
The abdomen was soft and non-tender , no masses .;;;;;;;;
Extremities :;;;;;;;;
slight cyanosis of fingers , no peripheral edema .;;;;;;;;
ADMISSION LABORATORY DATA :;;;;;;;;
Room air blood gas 54/26/7.48 .;;;;;;;;
Electrolytes notable for potassium 4.2 , BUN 28 , creatinine 1.0 , hematocrit 44.4 , white blood count 8.6 , chest X-ray post biopsy :;;;;;;;;
tiny left apical pneumothorax without interval change .;;;;;;;;
HOSPITAL COURSE :;;;;;;;;
Early in through her hospitalization her electrocardiograms remained unchanged and she ruled out for myocardial infarction by enzymes .;;;;;;;;
Her oxygen saturations remained 88-93 percent on four liters of nasal prong oxygen .;;;;;;;;
Upon review of her computerized tomography scan there was demonstration of progressive collapse of her left lower lobe with a mass like effect adjacent to the atelectasis .;;;;;;;;
There were two large mediastinal nodes and needle biopsy of the left lobe lesion was non-diagnostic .;;;;;;;;
She was referred for tissue diagnosis and on 1/13/94 was brought to the operating room .;;;;;;;;
She underwent flexible bronchoscopy with mediastinoscopy .;;;;;;;;
These were negative for tumor and a mini left thoracotomy was performed with pleural biopsy .;;;;;;;;
Intraoperatively there was a large emphysematous portion of the left lung which prohibited her left lower lobe to fully expand .;;;;;;;;
It was decided to perform reduction pneumoplasty .;;;;;;;;
This proceeded uneventfully .;;;;;;;;
She was extubated and stable with a good airway and good oxygen saturation .;;;;;;;;
However , upon transferring her from the operating room bed to the stretcher she had an arrest .;;;;;;;;
This appeared to be respiratory in origin .;;;;;;;;
She was placed back on the operating room table and cardiopulmonary resuscitation was begun .;;;;;;;;
Pressors were given and she quickly responded with a return in blood pressure and heart rate .;;;;;;;;
Her blood pressure remained unstable requiring large amounts of pressors .;;;;;;;;
X-rays showed no pneumothorax and there was no bleeding from her chest tubes .;;;;;;;;
She was therefore transferred up to the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit .;;;;;;;;
Early in her postoperative course her pulmonary artery pressures were quite high , 70/30 .;;;;;;;;
Her wedge pressure was 20 and there were no electrocardiogram changes .;;;;;;;;
She ruled out for myocardial infarction .;;;;;;;;
She developed a picture consistent with right heart failure with pulmonary hypertension and require nitric oxide administration .;;;;;;;;
This improved her right heart function with lower PA pressures .;;;;;;;;
She developed a right pleural effusion which required chest tube placement to remove 1200 ccs of straw-colored fluid .;;;;;;;;
She remained fully ventilated with marginal hemodynamic status on Levophed , dobutamine and nitric oxide .;;;;;;;;
Ultimately she was able to be weaned off of her Levophed as well as her nitric oxide .;;;;;;;;
However , because of persistent episodes of right heart failure , dobutamine was started .;;;;;;;;
This improved her cardiac function .;;;;;;;;
She failed to wean from the ventilator and on 2/14/94 was brought to the operating room for a tracheostomy .;;;;;;;;
She had a complicated course from an Infectious Disease standpoint with multiple positive cultures including sputum positive for Pseudomonas cepacia , blood cultures which were positive for Streptococcus milleri .;;;;;;;;
The right pleural fluid was also positive for Streptococcus milleri .;;;;;;;;
She had Citrobacter from her sinuses with evidence of sinusitis .;;;;;;;;
She was treated with multiple courses of broad spectrum antibiotics .;;;;;;;;
Given her protracted postoperative course the family uniformly decided to withdraw all support and initiate comfort measures only .;;;;;;;;
This was discussed with the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit staff .;;;;;;;;
Her support was withdrawn and she expired on 2/17/94 at 9:00 p.m.;;;;;;;;
The patient 's family was notified .;;;;;;;;

MRI , as discussed , was done at outside hospital and demonstrated large ventricles .;;;;;;;;
HOSPITAL COURSE :;;;;;;;;
The patient was admitted to the Arkzie- Memorial for lumbar puncture .;;;;;;;;
On the night of admission lumbar puncture was attempted on the floor , but we were unable to get cerebral spinal fluid due to difficulty with compliance with the patient who was severely agitated and would not comply with the examination .;;;;;;;;
On hospital day the patient underwent conscious sedation in the operating room where lumbar puncture was performed .;;;;;;;;
Opening pressure was 17 and approximately 20-25 cc of CSF was removed .;;;;;;;;
CSF was notable for sugar level of 65 and total protein level of 56 .;;;;;;;;

Intubation .;;;;;;;;
Hemodialysis .;;;;;;;;
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :;;;;;;;;
This is a 56-year-old man with a history of ischemic disease transferred to the FIH for further care for cardiogenic shock .;;;;;;;;
Mr. Given had an anterior myocardial infarction in 1981 .;;;;;;;;
He had inferior myocardial infarction in February 1992 .;;;;;;;;
His course was complicated at that time by hypertension and an echocardiogram showed an LV ejection fraction of 0.10 to 0.15 .;;;;;;;;
In August , 1993 he had an out of hospital cardiac arrest .;;;;;;;;
He rule in for another myocardial infarction at that time .;;;;;;;;
He was transferred to the FIH where he underwent a work up of both his arrhythmia and his heart failure .;;;;;;;;
An automatic implantable defibrillator was placed .;;;;;;;;
He was thought to be a good candidate for a transplant at that time as coronary arteriography showed diffuse disease in the LAD and right coronary arteries as well as a proximal circumflex stenosis .;;;;;;;;
Because of the diffuse nature of the disease and the left ventricular dysfunction , Mr. Given was thought not to be a revascularization candidate and was listed for a transplant .;;;;;;;;
Mr. Given waited as an outpatient for the availability of a donor heart .;;;;;;;;
He was admitted to the hospital in late April with multiple episodes of bloody diarrhea .;;;;;;;;
Colonoscopy demonstrated severe Crohn 's disease with sparing of the rectum .;;;;;;;;
A perirectal fistula was seen .;;;;;;;;
Treatment with IV corticosteroids led to improvement and Mr. Given was discharged from the hospital ten days ago .;;;;;;;;
On the evening of April 22nd , Mr. Given developed progressively worsening dyspnea .;;;;;;;;
He presented to the Iming Medical Center emergency room on the morning of April 22nd with hypertension and dyspnea .;;;;;;;;
He was given intravenous fluid to support his blood pressure and developed pulmonary edema and was intubated .;;;;;;;;
Hypertension continued and an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed .;;;;;;;;
He is now being transferred to the FIH for further treatment .;;;;;;;;
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :;;;;;;;;
Physical examination on transfer was remarkable for a blood pressure of 80/56 and a heart rate of 124 .;;;;;;;;
His CVP was 16 .;;;;;;;;
He was on the balloon pump at the time .;;;;;;;;
His chest was clear anteriorly .;;;;;;;;
His cardiac exam was remarkable for a summation gallop .;;;;;;;;
No murmur was auscultated but the high heart rate did diminish the possibility of this .;;;;;;;;
His abdomen was soft and he had no extremity edema .;;;;;;;;
His feet were cool but there were pedal pulses bilaterally .;;;;;;;;
LABORATORY DATA :;;;;;;;;
Admission laboratory studies included a hematocrit of 34.3 and a white count of 25,700 .;;;;;;;;
The sodium was 126 , the BUN 80 and a creatinine of 4.6 .;;;;;;;;
Electrocardiogram revealed a sinus tachycardia with an intraventricular conduction defect .;;;;;;;;
There were inferior Q waves consistent with an old infarct .;;;;;;;;
The chest x-ray revealed mild pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly .;;;;;;;;
HOSPITAL COURSE :;;;;;;;;
Mr. Given was admitted to the hospital and it was hoped that his end organ dysfunction would improve with a period of ballooning and improved perfusion such as to allow transplantation to eventually take place .;;;;;;;;
He was maintained on Levophed as a vasopressor as well as dopamine and dobutamine .;;;;;;;;
It was noted that his intra-aortic balloon pump was only a 30 ml pump , and on the day after admission , Mr. Given was taken to the catheterization laboratory where this was exchanged for a 40 ml pump .;;;;;;;;
After replacement of the intra-aortic balloon pump , Mr. Given remained critically ill , although there was some improvement in his augmented diastolic pressure .;;;;;;;;
He did develop atrial fibrillation , however , which led to hemodynamic decompensation with a wedge pressure of 32 and a cardiac index of 1.6 .;;;;;;;;
It was hoped that with continued inotropic support this would improve .;;;;;;;;
He also remained intubated .;;;;;;;;
Mr. Given was seen by Dr. Farstshuff of the GI Service for advice regarding his Crohn 's disease .;;;;;;;;
All of these issues , including his acute renal failure , were thought to be contraindications to transplantation .;;;;;;;;
As Mr. Given did not have any bowel sounds , he did have to remain on nasogastric suction .;;;;;;;;
He was seen in consultation by Dr. Needs of the Renal Unit .;;;;;;;;
Dr. Needs felt that the patient had had ischemic acute tubular necrosis and that we could continue to administer diuretics in a an effort to take off volume , but that we did have to allow time to pass in order to see improvement .;;;;;;;;
Procainamide was begun in an effort to convert Mr. Given to sinus rhythm from atrial fibrillation .;;;;;;;;
Initially he was in and out of sinus rhythm , but paroxysmal atrial fibrillation did occur frequently .;;;;;;;;
As Mr. Given 's renal function did not improve , he was begun on continuous venovenous hemodialysis .;;;;;;;;
This resulted in a reasonable clearance of creatinine .;;;;;;;;
He was able to get some fluid off as well .;;;;;;;;
With getting some volume off , the patient 's ventilation improved , as did many of his other metabolic parameters .;;;;;;;;
His cardiac index had also improved with this to 2.7 , although he was on dobutamine as well .;;;;;;;;
On 6/19 an effort was made to attempt to wean the intra-aortic balloon pump .;;;;;;;;
With a decrease in the counterpulsation ration , he developed atrial flutter with a fall in blood pressure and cardiac index .;;;;;;;;
The balloon pump was restored .;;;;;;;;
He was continued on this as well as on dobutamine and amrinone support .;;;;;;;;
He continued on hemodialysis , but had little urine output .;;;;;;;;
Supportive care continued .;;;;;;;;
Unfortunately , the white blood count began rising , raising the possibility of sepsis .;;;;;;;;
Broad spectrum antibiotics to cover potential sources in the gastrointestinal tract were begun and ciprofloxacin was added .;;;;;;;;
Mr. Given 's blood pressure appeared to stabilize .;;;;;;;;
Another effort was made on 6/22 to attempt to wean the balloon , but this led to an increase in his wedge pressure and a fall in his arterial pressure , and this was stopped and he was restored to full counterpulsation .;;;;;;;;
He had been able to be transiently extubated after dialysis had reduced his lung water , but he had to be reintubated on 6/24 .;;;;;;;;
Hemodialysis continued with maintenance of reasonable metabolic parameters .;;;;;;;;
He did develop worsening metabolic acidosis .;;;;;;;;
His hemodialysis was adjusted in an effort to resolve this .;;;;;;;;
He continued on vancomycin , ciprofloxacin , Zosyn , and fluconazole antibiotics .;;;;;;;;
Another effort was made to attempt to wean the intra-aortic balloon pump on 6/26 .;;;;;;;;
This resulted in a fall in his cardiac index , but his blood pressure and wedge pressure were stable .;;;;;;;;
He did have runs of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia .;;;;;;;;
On 6/29 Mr. Given began developing periods of hypotension .;;;;;;;;
The patient stated that he did not want to be reintubated , as it became quite clear that he would not be a transplant candidate .;;;;;;;;
He began having multiple runs of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia .;;;;;;;;
The patient and his significant friend , Incloztaua , had a long discussion with his physicians and they felt that , given the futility of his situation , supportive care should be ended .;;;;;;;;
Indicative of this , Mr. Given took his oxygen mask and demanded that it not be replaced .;;;;;;;;
He developed progressive hypotension and was pronounced dead early on the morning of 7/1 .;;;;;;;;

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :;;;;;;;;
The patient was a 71 year old white female with a history of carcinoid lung cancer who presented for evaluation of a tracheoesophageal fistula .;;;;;;;;
The patient was initially diagnosed in 1978 with atypical small cell carcinoma of the lung and treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy until 1980 .;;;;;;;;
She did well for approximately twelve years until she was diagnosed with carcinoid cancer of the same right upper lobe .;;;;;;;;
This may have been the initial primary cancer although it is unclear at present .;;;;;;;;
Bronchoscopy at that time showed an endobronchial tumor of the right upper lobe bronchus and it was felt to be unresectable .;;;;;;;;
She underwent four treatments of brachytherapy in March through May of 1993 .;;;;;;;;
She had been doing reasonably well until December of 1993 when she presented with persistent and worsening cough and near strangulation on attempts at eating solids or drinking liquids .;;;;;;;;
A bronchoscopy showed a tracheoesophageal fistula with an opening into the trachea above the carina and no tumor in the right upper lobe .;;;;;;;;
She has been on total parenteral nutrition and has been nothing by mouth since then .;;;;;;;;
A barium swallow prior to admission showed the presence of a tracheoesophageal fistula with entrance into the right mainstem bronchus below the carina .;;;;;;;;
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :;;;;;;;;
Bronchitis , asthma , carcinoid cancer , no history of coronary artery disease or cerebrovascular accident .;;;;;;;;
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :;;;;;;;;
The patient is status post appendectomy , hysterectomy and right salpingo-oophorectomy , bladder suspension and a tumor removal from the right neck .;;;;;;;;
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :;;;;;;;;
Cefuroxime 1.5 grams intravenously q8h , Solu-Medrol 62.5 mg intravenously q8h , Ventolin metered dose inhaler , 2 puffs PO q.i.d. , Pepcid 20 mg intravenously b.i.d.;;;;;;;;
ALLERGIES :;;;;;;;;
The patient is allergic to penicillin , morphine , codeine .;;;;;;;;
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :;;;;;;;;
The patient is a pleasant white female in no acute distress .;;;;;;;;
She is afebrile with stable vital signs .;;;;;;;;
The head , eyes , ears , nose , throat examination was unremarkable .;;;;;;;;
Neck shows a well healed low collar incision without adenopathy or bruit .;;;;;;;;
The lungs showed mild inspiratory wheeze and moderate expiratory wheezes .;;;;;;;;
Breath sounds are present bilaterally .;;;;;;;;
Cardiovascular exam :;;;;;;;;
regular rate and rhythm .;;;;;;;;
The abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended .;;;;;;;;
Extremities :;;;;;;;;
no clubbing , cyanosis or edema .;;;;;;;;
The rectal examination is guaiac negative with a minimal amount of stool .;;;;;;;;
HOSPITAL COURSE :;;;;;;;;
The patient was admitted on February 5 , 1994 and had a central venous line placed in her right subclavian .;;;;;;;;
The patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 6 , 1994 where she underwent rigid and flexible bronchoscopy and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy .;;;;;;;;
Findings included necrotic debris in the distal trachea at the carina and right mainstem bronchus .;;;;;;;;
Esophageal mucosa was visible through the trachea .;;;;;;;;
Her steroids were weaned and the patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 10 , 1994 where she underwent once again flexible bronchoscopy and flexible esophagoscopy , as well as rigid bronchoscopy .;;;;;;;;
She then had a transhiatal esophagectomy which was partial , and a substernal gastric interposition as well as a jejunostomy .;;;;;;;;
The pathology report suggested that the area was involved with radiation esophagitis and focal ulceration .;;;;;;;;
She remained ventilator dependent postoperatively and was taken to the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit .;;;;;;;;
The patient was maintained on triple antibiotics which included Vancomycin , ceftazidime and Gentamicin .;;;;;;;;
On postoperative day two , she had an electroencephalogram which showed no evidence of seizure activity but some generalized slowing .;;;;;;;;
The patient was seen in consultation by the Neurology Service for her apparent postoperative encephalopathy and episodes of shaking .;;;;;;;;
An endoscopy was also performed on postoperative day two which showed clean anastomosis .;;;;;;;;
She received multiple bronchoscopies for pulmonary toilet .;;;;;;;;
The patient was maintained on tube feedings and the ventilator .;;;;;;;;
A repeat echocardiogram on February 18 showed no significant change of her previous echocardiogram on February 11 , which showed only a small pericardial effusion .;;;;;;;;
A pelvic and abdominal computerized tomography scan on February 18 also showed no evidence of a focal collection or abscess .;;;;;;;;
She remained intermittently febrile despite numerous antibiotics .;;;;;;;;
Her chest X-ray showed bilateral air space disease , consistent with pneumonia or adult respiratory distress syndrome .;;;;;;;;
She suffered an episode of renal failure which was felt attributable to aminoglycoside toxicity .;;;;;;;;
Her steroids were weaned .;;;;;;;;
Because of her prolonged intubation and inability to wean , on February 24 , 1994 , she had a tracheostomy placed .;;;;;;;;
She remained in a coma .;;;;;;;;
The blood cultures on February 26 , 1994 grew out Staphylococcus and she was treated for septicemia .;;;;;;;;
Her sputum grew out Pseudomonas aeruginosa as well .;;;;;;;;
The urine contained yeast and she was treated with amphotericin .;;;;;;;;
On March 3 , 1994 , a repeat chest and abdominal and pelvis computerized tomography scan showed no evidence of fluid collections .;;;;;;;;
There was a large left pleural effusion however .;;;;;;;;
This was drained with a left chest tube .;;;;;;;;
Her sputum then grew out Klebsiella and she was treated with amikacin and imipenem .;;;;;;;;
She developed a right pleural effusion and had a right chest tube placed .;;;;;;;;
On March 13 , 1994 , she regained some level of consciousness .;;;;;;;;
She was able to fix and follow with her eyes , respond to commands .;;;;;;;;
On March 14 , 1994 , her right lung was pleurodesed .;;;;;;;;
Attempts were made to facilitate her wean by resting her overnight with a combination of propafol and Fentanyl .;;;;;;;;
This was tried for approximately seven days with no real progress made toward facilitating her vent wean .;;;;;;;;
She continued to require pressor support in the high 30 's .;;;;;;;;
She also fell into a coma once again .;;;;;;;;
On March 31 , 1994 , her pressor support requirement increased and she continued to have tachypneic episodes .;;;;;;;;
On April 2 , 1994 , she had several episodes of bradycardia and asystole , which responded only to manual ventilation .;;;;;;;;
Discussions were held with the patient 's family with regard to her previously expressed wishes not to be maintained on artificial life support for extended period of time with little or no hope for recovery .;;;;;;;;
She had expressed these wishes in writing on several legal forms from the state of Jose Pineston , as well as in discussions with her loved ones .;;;;;;;;
Decision was made in conjunction with the family and Dr. Caslighlourdes to terminate artificial respiratory support .;;;;;;;;
The patient was removed from the ventilator and placed on a T-piece in her trachea only and was made comfortable with narcotics .;;;;;;;;
Her respirations ceased and she died at 10:15 a.m. on April 2 , 1994 .;;;;;;;;
DISPOSITION / PLAN ON DISCHARGE :;;;;;;;;
The family will return the body to Sa for burial .;;;;;;;;
They have declined a post-mortem examination .;;;;;;;;

The patient was placed on suicide precautions , and was hydrated with an infusion of intravenous fluid .;;;;;;;;
The patient was seen in consultation by the Psychiatry Service , who began a battery of testing , which continues at the time of discharge .;;;;;;;;
The Consulting Psychiatrist recommended a minimum of 2 point restraints at all times , and recommended the patient be monitored by a sitter .;;;;;;;;
Allowing the patient to ambulate was not recommended .;;;;;;;;
From a medical standpoint , the patient did well .;;;;;;;;
He was initially admitted to the Neurological Intensive Care Unit where he was closely monitored during the first two days of his hospitalization .;;;;;;;;
The chief obstacle was bringing his blood pressure under control and this was ultimately achieved with a combination of Captopril and Nifedipine .;;;;;;;;
After his blood pressure had stabilized , the patient was transferred to the Neurology Ward .;;;;;;;;
Close monitoring demonstrated his blood pressure to be stable and within an acceptable rang on his dosage regimen .;;;;;;;;

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :;;;;;;;;
AV nodal re-entrant tachycardia ( AVNRT ) .;;;;;;;;
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSES :;;;;;;;;
1. AV conduction tissue disease .;;;;;;;;
2. Coronary artery disease .;;;;;;;;
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :;;;;;;;;
Radiofrequency ablation of the slow pathway and permanent pacemaker implantation .;;;;;;;;
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :;;;;;;;;
Patient is an 82-year-old male with a past medical history significant for coronary artery disease ( status-post PCI of the RCA one week ago ) , history of peripheral vascular disease and preserved LV function with history of nonsustained VT .;;;;;;;;
He was transferred from an outside hospital for further investigation and management of his recent arrhythmic problem .;;;;;;;;
He was noted by the cardiologist to complain of some malaise with no complaints of weakness and malaise .;;;;;;;;
He also complained of mild palpitations and syncope .;;;;;;;;
At the time of his visit to his cardiologist 's office , he was noted to be in tachycardia which was found to be a junctional tachycardia , treated with carotid sinus massage , breaking into sinus bradycardia .;;;;;;;;
In the setting of the sinus bradycardia , he had a very prolonged PR interval and happened to be on sotalol which was subsequently discontinued .;;;;;;;;
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :;;;;;;;;
Ecotrin ; Lipitor ; Cardura ; Plavix ; Lasix ; Cozaar ; Procardia .;;
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :;;;;;;;;
He was comfortable , afebrile with a heart rate of 60 beat / min and a blood pressure of 100/70 , respirations 18 .;;;;;;;;
JVP was not raised .;;;;;;;;
His cardiac exam revealed a fourth heart sounds , normal S1 , S2 and an ejection systolic murmur at the base of the heart .;;;;;;;;
His abdominal examination was benign .;;;;;;;;
Lungs were clear .;;;;;;;;
His EKG at the time of presentation showed evidence of sinus bradycardia , prolonged PR interval at 100-500 ms and evidence of Wenckebach .;;;;;;;;
His EKG also showed evidence of atrial echo beats and evidence of a slow AV nodal re-entrant tachycardia .;;;;;;;;
IMPRESSION :;;;;;;;;
Patient is an 82-year-old gentleman with a history of coronary artery disease and peripheral vascular disease with evidence of intrinsic conduction tissue disease who presented with an AVNRT .;;;;;;;;
He was admitted with the idea of having electrophysiology study to determine the exact mechanism of his tachycardia and subsequently undergo radiofrequency ablation .;;;;;;;;
It was also felt that because of his underlying conduction tissue disease , he would benefit from having a permanent pacemaker implanted .;;;;;;;;
HOSPITAL COURSE :;;;;;;;;
The patient had his electrophysiology study on 12/23/2002 .;;;;;;;;
His baseline tracings showed evidence of a high AV block with AV Wenckebach at 550 ms.;;;;;;;;
He had evidence of AVNRT , typical slow-fast variant which was easily inducible .;;;;;;;;
Two radiofrequency ablations at the slow pathway terminated the tachycardia .;;;;;;;;
The patient was not inducible for tachycardia at the end of the procedure .;;;;;;;;
The procedure was well tolerated , and he was transferred back to the step-down unit for further monitoring .;;;;;;;;
On the next morning of 12/26/2002 , the patient had a dual chamber permanent pacemaker implanted .;;;;;;;;
This was a Medtronic Sigma SDR 303 type pacemaker .;;;;;;;;
His atrial and ventricular lead were both bipolar .;;;;;;;;
The atrial measurements were as follows :;;;;;;;;
amplitude 5.6 to 8 mV , outflow threshold of 0.5 volts at 0.4 ms , evidence for lead impedance of 450 ohm .;;;;;;;;
His ventricular measurements were as follows :;;;;;;;;
RV amplitude of greater than 15.68 , output threshold of 0.5 volts at 0.5 ms and impedance of 680 ohm .;;;;;;;;
The patient was kept overnight for further monitoring .;;;;;;;;
Noninvasive pacemaker evaluation on 12/26/2002 showed optimal sensing and capture thresholds of both the atrial and ventricular leads .;;;;;;;;
A chest x-ray prior to discharge showed adequate position of the atrial and ventricular leads .;;;;;;;;
Of note , there was a coincidental finding of a small solitary pulmonary nodule on his chest x-ray , and the patient has been advised regarding obtaining a CAT scan after discharge to follow up on this .;;;;;;;;
After discussions with the patient and his family , they preferred having the CAT scan performed at the hospital closer to their residence so that it could be sequentially followed up with serial CAT scans if there was a need for the same .;;;;;;;;
The patient will follow up with his cardiologist as well as his primary care physician in the outpatient setting .;;;;;;;;
He has also been given a follow-up appointment with the pacemaker clinic .;;;;;;;;
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :;;;;;;;;
His medications at the time of discharge essentially remain the same .;;;;;;;;
He is being discharged on :;;;;;;;;
1. Lipitor 20 mg p.o. q.d.;;;;;;;;
2. Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d.;;;;;;;;
3. Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.d.;;;;;;;;
4. Cozaar 100 mg p.o. q.d.;;;;;;;;
5. Procardia 60 mg p.o. q.d.;;;;;;;;
6. Cardura 5 mg p.o. q.d.;;;;;;;;
7. Isordil 20 mg p.o. t.i.d.;;;;;;;;

A repeat chest x-ray is advised .;;;;;;;;
There is a large overall density with an air fluid level in the left lower zone posteriorly that is likely a hiatal hernia .;;;;;;;;
There are also displaced fractures of the left 8th , 9th and 10th ribs .;;;;;;;;
Head computer tomogram showed no evidenced of intracerebral hemorrhage , acute large vessel territorial infarction or mass effect .;;;;;;;;
There were nonspecific low attention white matter T2 changes most likely secondary to small vessel disease .;;;;;;;;
There was a possible old lacunar infarct of the left thalamus .;;;;;;;;
His electrocardiogram was normal sinus rhythm at 90 with normal axis and slightly widened QRS at .14 seconds and Qs inferiorly in II , III and aVF .;;;;;;;;
There were no acute ST-T wave changes .;;;;;;;;
SUMMARY :;;;;;;;;
In summary , this an 81 year old gentleman with a significant cardiac history and alcohol history who presented to Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital with loss of consciousness , who had a tox screen and a negative head computer tomogram who likely is suffering from an alcohol related fall versus syncope .;;;;;;;;
HOSPITAL COURSE :;;;;;;;;
He was admitted to Lyjoneshutchepawalt Cleod Exre Hospital for observation .;;;;;;;;
It was felt that he should be ruled out for an myocardial infarction given his cardiac history and was placed in two point restraints .;;;;;;;;
When the patient came to the floor he was angry and upset about admitted to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital instead of the Bridges Hospital and was somewhat combative .;;;;;;;;
He admitted to drinking 1 pint or so of alcohol not every day but the last drink was the night prior to admission to Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital and he had a couple of glasses of wine .;;;;;;;;
He was quite confused in relaying the history and very tangential in his replies .;;;;;;;;
He says he was out to lunch some friends to eat pizza at a restaurant on Valemin .;;;;;;;;
He decided to go to the basemen so they could eat in privacy when he was hit over the head by police with a gun and lost consciousness at the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital Emergency Ward .;;;;;;;;
He was quite paranoid , agitated and delusional during an interview and there is no evidence to support the patient 's history and recall of events leading to the hospitalization .;;;;;;;;
Hospital course by system .;;;;;;;;
1. NEUROLOGICALLY :;;;;;;;;
The patient is completely alert , awake and oriented x 3 .;;;;;;;;
The patient shows no evidence of alcohol withdrawal although he was prophylactically treated with Ativan and was given multivitamins , thiamine and folate .;;;;;;;;
Psychiatry saw the patient and felt that he was suffering from alcohol related syndrome versus some component of pugilist brain given the fact that he was a boxer in the past .;;;;;;;;
They felt that there was no acute psychiatric issue at hand .;;;;;;;;
2. CARDIOVASCULAR :;;;;;;;;
The patient ruled out for an myocardial infarction with peak creatinine phosphokinase of 350 and flat isoenzymes .;;;;;;;;
He deserves a full syncope as an inpatient and is stable for transfer from a cardiovascular standpoint .;;;;;;;;
This will be pursued at the Bridges Hospital .;;;;;;;;
He is maintained on his antihypertensive of Lisinopril and his anti-hyperlipidemic of Gemfibrozil and gets an aspirin .;;;;;;;;

This is a 65 year old lady , chronic smoker is admitted with increasing shortness of breath of six hours duration .;;;;;;;;
The patient recently went to Lafullland Le and on a flight back to Ty in Hercent Avenue , Hisflintpa A , the patient developed increased breathlessness , wanting the airplane to make an emergency landing at Ton-balt airport so that she could get medical assistance .;;;;;;;;
The patient mentions that she had been having a breathing problem for the last two years , which had gradually progressed .;;;;;;;;
The patient had not seen a physician at this time and was not on any medications .;;;;;;;;

White blood count was 11.5 , hematocrit 51.6 .;;;;;;;;
Chest X-ray :;;;;;;;;
subtle increased density in the left middle lung .;;;;;;;;
Electrocardiogram notable for sinus tachycardia with emphysematous pattern , poor R progression V1 through V3 , and P. pulmonale with right axis deviation .;;;;;;;;
HOSPITAL COURSE :;;;;;;;;
The patient was admitted for acute and chronic respiratory distress with likely chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and question of a pulmonary embolus .;;;;;;;;
The patient was ruled out for myocardial infarction with serial CK 's which were normal .;;;;;;;;
Echocardiogram was obtained which showed normal left ventricle , a dilated right ventricle with diffuse hypokinesis .;;;;;;;;
The RVSP was estimated at 35 .;;;;;;;;
Echocardiogram findings with persistent , profound right heart failure .;;;;;;;;
The patient subsequently underwent a pulmonary arteriogram which revealed no pulmonary emboli , but pulmonary artery pressure of 39/22 , wedge pressure of 12 and a right atrial pressure of 10 .;;;;;;;;
The patient also had mild liver function test abnormalities , for which she underwent right upper quadrant ultrasound which showed patent portal vein , patent hepatic vein and artery and bilateral small pleural effusions with a 4 cm. complex cystic lesion with calcified walls on the lateral aspect of the spleen .;;;;;;;;
The patient 's heparin was subsequently discontinued .;;;;;;;;
Pulmonary status stabilized , with the patient 's room air sat hovering around 90% .;;;;;;;;
Microbiologic work up for possible chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare exacerbation was subsequently negative .;;;;;;;;
The patient remained cardiovascularly stable but unclear etiology of her subtle electrocardiogram changes and respiratory distress .;;;;;;;;
It was subsequently felt after full work up with a negative PA gram , plus / minus VQ , negative echocardiogram , negative sero-CK 's and no evolving electrocardiogram that the patient had pulmonary hypertension secondary to chronic lung disease .;;;;;;;;
It was felt that the patient likely had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease of greater severity and duration than initially suspected and by history from the patient , in particular supported by her chronic CO2 retention on subsequent arterial blood gases .;;;;;;;;
The patient was maintained on treatment for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation , including steroid taper and nebs as well as antibiotic coverage .;;;;;;;;
Repeat chest x-ray subsequently showed hyperinflation consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , no signs of pneumonia or pulmonary edema , bilateral blunting of the costophrenic angles , consistent with pleural thickening , and / or small bilateral pleural effusions , consistent with right upper quadrant ultrasound .;;;;;;;;
Pulmonary Service was consulted .;;;;;;;;
They recommendations included smoking cessation , recommendation for O2 use if flying back home to Missouri , continuing antibiotics for a 14 days course , albuterol , Atrovent MDI 's and follow-up of pleural effusions with one month repeat chest x-ray .;;;;;;;;
It was subsequently arranged for the patient to transfer back to Balau for care there with a pulmonologist as well as her primary-care physician .;;;;;;;;
The patient was discharged in good state of health , ambulating .;;;;;;;;
Sats with and without O2 were above 88% .;;;;;;;;
A complete copy of the medical chart was sent with the patient to Lo .;;;;;;;;
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :;;;;;;;;
Cefuroxime 500 mg. PO b.i.d. times 10 days , albuterol inhalers 2 puffs q4 hours , Atrovent inhalers 2 puffs q6 hours , Prednisone 40 mg. PO qday , then taper as directed by primary-care physician in Reveverburg .;;;;;;;;
