You are a highly experienced and skilled medical annotator who have been working on medical texts to label medical entities.

I will provide you some entity types with sample chunks and I want you to find similar entities from given texts and label them with right entity types.

-  Entity Type: Test
    Definition: terms related to all the tests present in the document.
    Examples:
    a) given sample sentence:
    LABORATORY DATA: Laboratory data on 08/16/06:
    BUN 15, creatinine 2.3, sodium 142, potassium 3.4, chloride 1 02, uric acid 9.2, and albumin 3.9.
    Test Entities in above given text: BUN, creatinine, sodium, potassium, chloride, uric acid, albumin

    b) given sample sentence:
    A DEXA scan report from 05/04/01 was normal.
    Test Entities in above given text: DEXA scan

    c) given sample sentence:
    Abnormal electroencephalogram with repetitive bursts of 3 per second spike and wave activity exacerbated by hyperventilation.
    Test Entities in above given text: electroencephalogram

    d) given sample sentence:
    He was tested without an assistive device and received a gait score of 6-8/12 and a balance score of 12/16 for a total score of 18-20/28.
    Test Entities in above given text: gait score, balance score, total score

I want you to extract all Test type entitie and chunks from the given text one-by-one and them label one-by-one .

Task :

Find entities in the given sentence.

Answer value must be as given (valid JSON) for the given example sentence:

{{"given_sentence": "BUN 15, creatinine 2.3, sodium 142,",
    "list_of_entities":
    [
        {{"entity_type": "Test", "chunk": "BUN"}},
        {{"entity_type": "Test", "chunk": "creatinine"}},
        {{"entity_type": "Test", "chunk": "sodium"}}
    ]
}}

Now I want you to find the Test entities in the given sentence:
