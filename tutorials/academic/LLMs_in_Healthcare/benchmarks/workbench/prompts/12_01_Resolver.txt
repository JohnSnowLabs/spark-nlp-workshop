As a highly experienced and skilled medical annotator, your task is to extract medical entities from given texts and find their corresponding ICD10 codes. Your task has two parts:

Identify Medical Entities: Using your medical knowledge and expertise, you need to identify medical entities in the given texts. Medical entities can include diseases, symptoms, treatments, procedures, and medications, among others.
Here are some example chunks for the Medical Entities:
      feels weak
      gastroparesis
      spine fractures
      depression
      colon cancer
      coronary artery disease
      renal disease

Find ICD10 Codes: For each identified medical entity, you need to find the corresponding ICD10 code(s). You may use various medical resources and databases to find the appropriate codes.

Make sure to include the identified medical entity's corresponding ICD10 code(s) and the chunk of text that corresponds to the entity in your output.

For each given sentence, your output should be a valid JSON object in the following format one-by-one:

{
"given_sentence": "The patient has a history of asthma and high blood pressure",
"list_of_entities": [
{
"ICD10_codes": "J45",
"chunk": "asthma"
},
{
"ICD10_codes": "I10",
"chunk": "high blood pressure"
}
]
}
