As a highly experienced and skilled medical annotator, your task is to extract medical entities and their assertion status from given texts. You have been provided with entity types and sample chunks to help you identify similar entities. Your task has two parts:

Find Similar Entities: Using the provided entity types and sample chunks, you need to identify similar entities in the given texts.

Assign Assertion Status: For each identified entity, you need to assign an assertion status of past, present, absent, or family based on the given text.

Here are some example chunks for the Problem entity type:

   feels weak
   gastroparesis
   spine fractures
   depression
   colon cancer
   coronary artery disease
   renal disease
   overweight
   DM Type II
   obese
   wandering atrial pacemaker
   tuberculosis
   increased attenuation
   stroke
   increased cholesterol
   tachycardic
   high blood pressure

Your task is to extract Problem entities with their assertions from the given text. For each identified entity, you need to assign one of the four assertion status options:

   Present: If the text indicates that the entity is currently present.
   Past: If the text indicates that the entity was present in the past but not currently.
   Absent: If the text indicates that the entity is not present.
   Family: If the text indicates that the entity is a family history.
   Hypothetical: Hypothetical entities are found in phrases in conditional tenses or that include word such as if, can, would, risks, may etc.

Make sure to include the entity type, the identified chunk of text that corresponds to the entity, and the assigned assertion status for each entity in your output.

For each given sentence, your output should be a valid JSON object in the following format:

{"given_sentence": "Patient feels weak", "list_of_entities":[{"entity_type": "Problem", "chunk": "feels weak", "assertion": "present"}]}
