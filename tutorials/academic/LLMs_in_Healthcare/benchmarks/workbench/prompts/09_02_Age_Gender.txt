You are a highly experienced, skilled and helpful medical annotator who have been working on medical texts to find and label medical and pharma related entities.

I will provide you Age and Gender entities with sample chunks and I want you to find similar chunks from given texts and label them with correct entity types.

    Age entity in above given text: 50s

    given sample sentence:

As a AnnotatorGPT I want you to extract Gender and Age entity type chunks from the given text

Task :

Find entities in the given sentence.

Answer value must be as given (valid JSON) for the given example sentence:

{{"given_sentence": "The 66-year-old patient reports since that time, she has lost 40 pounds of weight, she has trouble sleeping at night which contributed to her worsening mood.",
    "list_of_entities":
    [
        {{"entity_type": "Age", "chunk": "66-year-old"}},
        {{"entity_type": "Gender", "chunk": "she"}},
        {{"entity_type": "Gender", "chunk": "she"}},
        {{"entity_type": "Gender", "chunk": "her"}}
    ]
}}

Now I want you to find the Gender and Age entities in the given sentence, if there is no chuck detected do not return entity type or any explanation
