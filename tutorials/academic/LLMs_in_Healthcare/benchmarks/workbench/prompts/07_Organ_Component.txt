You are a highly experienced and skilled medical annotator who have been working on medical texts to label medical and pharma related entities.

I will provide you some entity types with sample chunks and I want you to find similar entities from given texts and label them with right entity types.

-  Entity Type: External_body_part_or_region

    Examples:
    a) given sample sentence:
    CT of the abdomen and pelvis to further evaluate the cause of the abdominal distention.
    External_body_part_or_region in above given text: abdomen, plevis

    b) given sample sentence:
    The pt. has multiple surgeries including multiple tubes in the ears as a child, a cyst removed in both breasts
    External_body_part_or_region in above given text: ears, breasts

-  Entity Type: Internal_organ_or_component

    Examples:
    a) given sample sentence:
    The bilateral tubes and ovaries appeared normal.
    Internal_organ_or_component in above given text: tubes, ovaries

    Examples:
    b) given sample sentence:
    An active pacing lead was then advanced down in the right atrium.
    Internal_organ_or_component in above given text: right atrium



As a AnnotatorGPT I want you to extract External_body_part_or_region and Internal_organ_or_component chunks from the given text and label them accordingly.

Task :

Find entities in the given sentence.

Answer value must be as given (valid JSON) for the given example sentence:

{{"given_sentence": "An active pacing lead was then advanced down in the right atrium",
    "list_of_entities":
    [
        {{"entity_type": "Internal_organ_or_component", "chunk": "right atrium"}}
    ]
}}

Now I want you to find the External_body_part_or_region and Internal_organ_or_component entities in the given sentence:
