DISCHARGE DATE :
4-2-94
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Tracheoesophageal fistula .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
Diabetes mellitus , pneumonia , sepsis , respiratory failure , pleural effusion , postoperative encephalopathy , postoperative myocardial infarction , and thrombocytopenia .
SPECIAL PROCEDURES AND OPERATIONS :
February 6 , 1994 , rigid bronchoscopy with biopsy and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy .
ASSOCIATED PROCEDURES :
On February 10 , 1994 , flexible bronchoscopy , flexible esophagoscopy , rigid bronchoscopy , transhiatal esophagectomy ( partial ) , substernal gastric interposition and jejunostomy .
Multiple bronchoscopies , chest tube insertion .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient was a 71 year old white female with a history of carcinoid lung cancer who presented for evaluation of a tracheoesophageal fistula .
The patient was initially diagnosed in 1978 with atypical small cell carcinoma of the lung and treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy until 1980 .
She did well for approximately twelve years until she was diagnosed with carcinoid cancer of the same right upper lobe .
This may have been the initial primary cancer although it is unclear at present .
Bronchoscopy at that time showed an endobronchial tumor of the right upper lobe bronchus and it was felt to be unresectable .
She underwent four treatments of brachytherapy in March through May of 1993 .
She had been doing reasonably well until December of 1993 when she presented with persistent and worsening cough and near strangulation on attempts at eating solids or drinking liquids .
A bronchoscopy showed a tracheoesophageal fistula with an opening into the trachea above the carina and no tumor in the right upper lobe .
She has been on total parenteral nutrition and has been nothing by mouth since then .
A barium swallow prior to admission showed the presence of a tracheoesophageal fistula with entrance into the right mainstem bronchus below the carina .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Bronchitis , asthma , carcinoid cancer , no history of coronary artery disease or cerebrovascular accident .
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :
The patient is status post appendectomy , hysterectomy and right salpingo-oophorectomy , bladder suspension and a tumor removal from the right neck .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Cefuroxime 1.5 grams intravenously q8h , Solu-Medrol 62.5 mg intravenously q8h , Ventolin metered dose inhaler , 2 puffs PO q.i.d. , Pepcid 20 mg intravenously b.i.d.
ALLERGIES :
The patient is allergic to penicillin , morphine , codeine .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient is a pleasant white female in no acute distress .
She is afebrile with stable vital signs .
The head , eyes , ears , nose , throat examination was unremarkable .
Neck shows a well healed low collar incision without adenopathy or bruit .
The lungs showed mild inspiratory wheeze and moderate expiratory wheezes .
Breath sounds are present bilaterally .
Cardiovascular exam :
regular rate and rhythm .
The abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended .
Extremities :
no clubbing , cyanosis or edema .
The rectal examination is guaiac negative with a minimal amount of stool .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted on February 5 , 1994 and had a central venous line placed in her right subclavian .
The patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 6 , 1994 where she underwent rigid and flexible bronchoscopy and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy .
Findings included necrotic debris in the distal trachea at the carina and right mainstem bronchus .
Esophageal mucosa was visible through the trachea .
Her steroids were weaned and the patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 10 , 1994 where she underwent once again flexible bronchoscopy and flexible esophagoscopy , as well as rigid bronchoscopy .
She then had a transhiatal esophagectomy which was partial , and a substernal gastric interposition as well as a jejunostomy .
The pathology report suggested that the area was involved with radiation esophagitis and focal ulceration .
She remained ventilator dependent postoperatively and was taken to the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit .
The patient was maintained on triple antibiotics which included Vancomycin , ceftazidime and Gentamicin .
On postoperative day two , she had an electroencephalogram which showed no evidence of seizure activity but some generalized slowing .
The patient was seen in consultation by the Neurology Service for her apparent postoperative encephalopathy and episodes of shaking .
An endoscopy was also performed on postoperative day two which showed clean anastomosis .
She received multiple bronchoscopies for pulmonary toilet .
The patient was maintained on tube feedings and the ventilator .
A repeat echocardiogram on February 18 showed no significant change of her previous echocardiogram on February 11 , which showed only a small pericardial effusion .
A pelvic and abdominal computerized tomography scan on February 18 also showed no evidence of a focal collection or abscess .
She remained intermittently febrile despite numerous antibiotics .
Her chest X-ray showed bilateral air space disease , consistent with pneumonia or adult respiratory distress syndrome .
She suffered an episode of renal failure which was felt attributable to aminoglycoside toxicity .
Her steroids were weaned .
Because of her prolonged intubation and inability to wean , on February 24 , 1994 , she had a tracheostomy placed .
She remained in a coma .
The blood cultures on February 26 , 1994 grew out Staphylococcus and she was treated for septicemia .
Her sputum grew out Pseudomonas aeruginosa as well .
The urine contained yeast and she was treated with amphotericin .
On March 3 , 1994 , a repeat chest and abdominal and pelvis computerized tomography scan showed no evidence of fluid collections .
There was a large left pleural effusion however .
This was drained with a left chest tube .
Her sputum then grew out Klebsiella and she was treated with amikacin and imipenem .
She developed a right pleural effusion and had a right chest tube placed .
On March 13 , 1994 , she regained some level of consciousness .
She was able to fix and follow with her eyes , respond to commands .
On March 14 , 1994 , her right lung was pleurodesed .
Attempts were made to facilitate her wean by resting her overnight with a combination of propafol and Fentanyl .
This was tried for approximately seven days with no real progress made toward facilitating her vent wean .
She continued to require pressor support in the high 30 's .
She also fell into a coma once again .
On March 31 , 1994 , her pressor support requirement increased and she continued to have tachypneic episodes .
On April 2 , 1994 , she had several episodes of bradycardia and asystole , which responded only to manual ventilation .
Discussions were held with the patient 's family with regard to her previously expressed wishes not to be maintained on artificial life support for extended period of time with little or no hope for recovery .
She had expressed these wishes in writing on several legal forms from the state of Jose Pineston , as well as in discussions with her loved ones .
Decision was made in conjunction with the family and Dr. Caslighlourdes to terminate artificial respiratory support .
The patient was removed from the ventilator and placed on a T-piece in her trachea only and was made comfortable with narcotics .
Her respirations ceased and she died at 10:15 a.m. on April 2 , 1994 .
DISPOSITION / PLAN ON DISCHARGE :
The family will return the body to Sa for burial .
They have declined a post-mortem examination .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Tracheoesophageal fistula .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
Diabetes mellitus , pneumonia , sepsis , respiratory failure , pleural effusion , postoperative encephalopathy , postoperative myocardial infarction , and thrombocytopenia .
SPECIAL PROCEDURES AND OPERATIONS :
February 6 , 1994 , rigid bronchoscopy with biopsy and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy .
ASSOCIATED PROCEDURES :
On February 10 , 1994 , flexible bronchoscopy , flexible esophagoscopy , rigid bronchoscopy , transhiatal esophagectomy ( partial ) , substernal gastric interposition and jejunostomy .
Multiple bronchoscopies , chest tube insertion .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient was a 71 year old white female with a history of carcinoid lung cancer who presented for evaluation of a tracheoesophageal fistula .
The patient was initially diagnosed in 1978 with atypical small cell carcinoma of the lung and treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy until 1980 .
She did well for approximately twelve years until she was diagnosed with carcinoid cancer of the same right upper lobe .
This may have been the initial primary cancer although it is unclear at present .
Bronchoscopy at that time showed an endobronchial tumor of the right upper lobe bronchus and it was felt to be unresectable .
She underwent four treatments of brachytherapy in March through May of 1993 .
She had been doing reasonably well until December of 1993 when she presented with persistent and worsening cough and near strangulation on attempts at eating solids or drinking liquids .
A bronchoscopy showed a tracheoesophageal fistula with an opening into the trachea above the carina and no tumor in the right upper lobe .
She has been on total parenteral nutrition and has been nothing by mouth since then .
A barium swallow prior to admission showed the presence of a tracheoesophageal fistula with entrance into the right mainstem bronchus below the carina .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Bronchitis , asthma , carcinoid cancer , no history of coronary artery disease or cerebrovascular accident .
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :
The patient is status post appendectomy , hysterectomy and right salpingo-oophorectomy , bladder suspension and a tumor removal from the right neck .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Cefuroxime 1.5 grams intravenously q8h , Solu-Medrol 62.5 mg intravenously q8h , Ventolin metered dose inhaler , 2 puffs PO q.i.d. , Pepcid 20 mg intravenously b.i.d.
ALLERGIES :
The patient is allergic to penicillin , morphine , codeine .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient is a pleasant white female in no acute distress .
She is afebrile with stable vital signs .
The head , eyes , ears , nose , throat examination was unremarkable .
Neck shows a well healed low collar incision without adenopathy or bruit .
The lungs showed mild inspiratory wheeze and moderate expiratory wheezes .
Breath sounds are present bilaterally .
Cardiovascular exam :
regular rate and rhythm .
The abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended .
Extremities :
no clubbing , cyanosis or edema .
The rectal examination is guaiac negative with a minimal amount of stool .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted on February 5 , 1994 and had a central venous line placed in her right subclavian .
The patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 6 , 1994 where she underwent rigid and flexible bronchoscopy and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy .
Findings included necrotic debris in the distal trachea at the carina and right mainstem bronchus .
Esophageal mucosa was visible through the trachea .
Her steroids were weaned and the patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 10 , 1994 where she underwent once again flexible bronchoscopy and flexible esophagoscopy , as well as rigid bronchoscopy .
She then had a transhiatal esophagectomy which was partial , and a substernal gastric interposition as well as a jejunostomy .
The pathology report suggested that the area was involved with radiation esophagitis and focal ulceration .
She remained ventilator dependent postoperatively and was taken to the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit .
The patient was maintained on triple antibiotics which included Vancomycin , ceftazidime and Gentamicin .
On postoperative day two , she had an electroencephalogram which showed no evidence of seizure activity but some generalized slowing .
The patient was seen in consultation by the Neurology Service for her apparent postoperative encephalopathy and episodes of shaking .
An endoscopy was also performed on postoperative day two which showed clean anastomosis .
She received multiple bronchoscopies for pulmonary toilet .
The patient was maintained on tube feedings and the ventilator .
A repeat echocardiogram on February 18 showed no significant change of her previous echocardiogram on February 11 , which showed only a small pericardial effusion .
A pelvic and abdominal computerized tomography scan on February 18 also showed no evidence of a focal collection or abscess .
She remained intermittently febrile despite numerous antibiotics .
Her chest X-ray showed bilateral air space disease , consistent with pneumonia or adult respiratory distress syndrome .
She suffered an episode of renal failure which was felt attributable to aminoglycoside toxicity .
Her steroids were weaned .
Because of her prolonged intubation and inability to wean , on February 24 , 1994 , she had a tracheostomy placed .
She remained in a coma .
The blood cultures on February 26 , 1994 grew out Staphylococcus and she was treated for septicemia .
Her sputum grew out Pseudomonas aeruginosa as well .
The urine contained yeast and she was treated with amphotericin .
On March 3 , 1994 , a repeat chest and abdominal and pelvis computerized tomography scan showed no evidence of fluid collections .
There was a large left pleural effusion however .
This was drained with a left chest tube .
Her sputum then grew out Klebsiella and she was treated with amikacin and imipenem .
She developed a right pleural effusion and had a right chest tube placed .
On March 13 , 1994 , she regained some level of consciousness .
She was able to fix and follow with her eyes , respond to commands .
On March 14 , 1994 , her right lung was pleurodesed .
Attempts were made to facilitate her wean by resting her overnight with a combination of propafol and Fentanyl .
This was tried for approximately seven days with no real progress made toward facilitating her vent wean .
She continued to require pressor support in the high 30 's .
She also fell into a coma once again .
On March 31 , 1994 , her pressor support requirement increased and she continued to have tachypneic episodes .
On April 2 , 1994 , she had several episodes of bradycardia and asystole , which responded only to manual ventilation .
Discussions were held with the patient 's family with regard to her previously expressed wishes not to be maintained on artificial life support for extended period of time with little or no hope for recovery .
She had expressed these wishes in writing on several legal forms from the state of Jose Pineston , as well as in discussions with her loved ones .
Decision was made in conjunction with the family and Dr. Caslighlourdes to terminate artificial respiratory support .
The patient was removed from the ventilator and placed on a T-piece in her trachea only and was made comfortable with narcotics .
Her respirations ceased and she died at 10:15 a.m. on April 2 , 1994 .
DISPOSITION / PLAN ON DISCHARGE :
The family will return the body to Sa for burial .
They have declined a post-mortem examination .

February 6 , 1994 , rigid bronchoscopy with biopsy and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy .
ASSOCIATED PROCEDURES :
On February 10 , 1994 , flexible bronchoscopy , flexible esophagoscopy , rigid bronchoscopy , transhiatal esophagectomy ( partial ) , substernal gastric interposition and jejunostomy .
Multiple bronchoscopies , chest tube insertion .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient was a 71 year old white female with a history of carcinoid lung cancer who presented for evaluation of a tracheoesophageal fistula .
The patient was initially diagnosed in 1978 with atypical small cell carcinoma of the lung and treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy until 1980 .
She did well for approximately twelve years until she was diagnosed with carcinoid cancer of the same right upper lobe .
This may have been the initial primary cancer although it is unclear at present .
Bronchoscopy at that time showed an endobronchial tumor of the right upper lobe bronchus and it was felt to be unresectable .
She underwent four treatments of brachytherapy in March through May of 1993 .
She had been doing reasonably well until December of 1993 when she presented with persistent and worsening cough and near strangulation on attempts at eating solids or drinking liquids .
A bronchoscopy showed a tracheoesophageal fistula with an opening into the trachea above the carina and no tumor in the right upper lobe .
She has been on total parenteral nutrition and has been nothing by mouth since then .
A barium swallow prior to admission showed the presence of a tracheoesophageal fistula with entrance into the right mainstem bronchus below the carina .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Bronchitis , asthma , carcinoid cancer , no history of coronary artery disease or cerebrovascular accident .
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :
The patient is status post appendectomy , hysterectomy and right salpingo-oophorectomy , bladder suspension and a tumor removal from the right neck .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Cefuroxime 1.5 grams intravenously q8h , Solu-Medrol 62.5 mg intravenously q8h , Ventolin metered dose inhaler , 2 puffs PO q.i.d. , Pepcid 20 mg intravenously b.i.d.
ALLERGIES :
The patient is allergic to penicillin , morphine , codeine .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient is a pleasant white female in no acute distress .
She is afebrile with stable vital signs .
The head , eyes , ears , nose , throat examination was unremarkable .
Neck shows a well healed low collar incision without adenopathy or bruit .
The lungs showed mild inspiratory wheeze and moderate expiratory wheezes .
Breath sounds are present bilaterally .
Cardiovascular exam :
regular rate and rhythm .
The abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended .
Extremities :
no clubbing , cyanosis or edema .
The rectal examination is guaiac negative with a minimal amount of stool .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted on February 5 , 1994 and had a central venous line placed in her right subclavian .
The patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 6 , 1994 where she underwent rigid and flexible bronchoscopy and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy .
Findings included necrotic debris in the distal trachea at the carina and right mainstem bronchus .
Esophageal mucosa was visible through the trachea .
Her steroids were weaned and the patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 10 , 1994 where she underwent once again flexible bronchoscopy and flexible esophagoscopy , as well as rigid bronchoscopy .
She then had a transhiatal esophagectomy which was partial , and a substernal gastric interposition as well as a jejunostomy .
The pathology report suggested that the area was involved with radiation esophagitis and focal ulceration .
She remained ventilator dependent postoperatively and was taken to the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit .
The patient was maintained on triple antibiotics which included Vancomycin , ceftazidime and Gentamicin .
On postoperative day two , she had an electroencephalogram which showed no evidence of seizure activity but some generalized slowing .
The patient was seen in consultation by the Neurology Service for her apparent postoperative encephalopathy and episodes of shaking .
An endoscopy was also performed on postoperative day two which showed clean anastomosis .
She received multiple bronchoscopies for pulmonary toilet .
The patient was maintained on tube feedings and the ventilator .
A repeat echocardiogram on February 18 showed no significant change of her previous echocardiogram on February 11 , which showed only a small pericardial effusion .
A pelvic and abdominal computerized tomography scan on February 18 also showed no evidence of a focal collection or abscess .
She remained intermittently febrile despite numerous antibiotics .
Her chest X-ray showed bilateral air space disease , consistent with pneumonia or adult respiratory distress syndrome .
She suffered an episode of renal failure which was felt attributable to aminoglycoside toxicity .
Her steroids were weaned .
Because of her prolonged intubation and inability to wean , on February 24 , 1994 , she had a tracheostomy placed .
She remained in a coma .
The blood cultures on February 26 , 1994 grew out Staphylococcus and she was treated for septicemia .
Her sputum grew out Pseudomonas aeruginosa as well .
The urine contained yeast and she was treated with amphotericin .
On March 3 , 1994 , a repeat chest and abdominal and pelvis computerized tomography scan showed no evidence of fluid collections .
There was a large left pleural effusion however .
This was drained with a left chest tube .
Her sputum then grew out Klebsiella and she was treated with amikacin and imipenem .
She developed a right pleural effusion and had a right chest tube placed .
On March 13 , 1994 , she regained some level of consciousness .
She was able to fix and follow with her eyes , respond to commands .
On March 14 , 1994 , her right lung was pleurodesed .
Attempts were made to facilitate her wean by resting her overnight with a combination of propafol and Fentanyl .
This was tried for approximately seven days with no real progress made toward facilitating her vent wean .
She continued to require pressor support in the high 30 's .
She also fell into a coma once again .
On March 31 , 1994 , her pressor support requirement increased and she continued to have tachypneic episodes .
On April 2 , 1994 , she had several episodes of bradycardia and asystole , which responded only to manual ventilation .
Discussions were held with the patient 's family with regard to her previously expressed wishes not to be maintained on artificial life support for extended period of time with little or no hope for recovery .
She had expressed these wishes in writing on several legal forms from the state of Jose Pineston , as well as in discussions with her loved ones .
Decision was made in conjunction with the family and Dr. Caslighlourdes to terminate artificial respiratory support .
The patient was removed from the ventilator and placed on a T-piece in her trachea only and was made comfortable with narcotics .
Her respirations ceased and she died at 10:15 a.m. on April 2 , 1994 .
DISPOSITION / PLAN ON DISCHARGE :
The family will return the body to Sa for burial .
They have declined a post-mortem examination .

On February 10 , 1994 , flexible bronchoscopy , flexible esophagoscopy , rigid bronchoscopy , transhiatal esophagectomy ( partial ) , substernal gastric interposition and jejunostomy .
Multiple bronchoscopies , chest tube insertion .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient was a 71 year old white female with a history of carcinoid lung cancer who presented for evaluation of a tracheoesophageal fistula .
The patient was initially diagnosed in 1978 with atypical small cell carcinoma of the lung and treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy until 1980 .
She did well for approximately twelve years until she was diagnosed with carcinoid cancer of the same right upper lobe .
This may have been the initial primary cancer although it is unclear at present .
Bronchoscopy at that time showed an endobronchial tumor of the right upper lobe bronchus and it was felt to be unresectable .
She underwent four treatments of brachytherapy in March through May of 1993 .
She had been doing reasonably well until December of 1993 when she presented with persistent and worsening cough and near strangulation on attempts at eating solids or drinking liquids .
A bronchoscopy showed a tracheoesophageal fistula with an opening into the trachea above the carina and no tumor in the right upper lobe .
She has been on total parenteral nutrition and has been nothing by mouth since then .
A barium swallow prior to admission showed the presence of a tracheoesophageal fistula with entrance into the right mainstem bronchus below the carina .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Bronchitis , asthma , carcinoid cancer , no history of coronary artery disease or cerebrovascular accident .
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :
The patient is status post appendectomy , hysterectomy and right salpingo-oophorectomy , bladder suspension and a tumor removal from the right neck .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Cefuroxime 1.5 grams intravenously q8h , Solu-Medrol 62.5 mg intravenously q8h , Ventolin metered dose inhaler , 2 puffs PO q.i.d. , Pepcid 20 mg intravenously b.i.d.
ALLERGIES :
The patient is allergic to penicillin , morphine , codeine .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient is a pleasant white female in no acute distress .
She is afebrile with stable vital signs .
The head , eyes , ears , nose , throat examination was unremarkable .
Neck shows a well healed low collar incision without adenopathy or bruit .
The lungs showed mild inspiratory wheeze and moderate expiratory wheezes .
Breath sounds are present bilaterally .
Cardiovascular exam :
regular rate and rhythm .
The abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended .
Extremities :
no clubbing , cyanosis or edema .
The rectal examination is guaiac negative with a minimal amount of stool .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted on February 5 , 1994 and had a central venous line placed in her right subclavian .
The patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 6 , 1994 where she underwent rigid and flexible bronchoscopy and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy .
Findings included necrotic debris in the distal trachea at the carina and right mainstem bronchus .
Esophageal mucosa was visible through the trachea .
Her steroids were weaned and the patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 10 , 1994 where she underwent once again flexible bronchoscopy and flexible esophagoscopy , as well as rigid bronchoscopy .
She then had a transhiatal esophagectomy which was partial , and a substernal gastric interposition as well as a jejunostomy .
The pathology report suggested that the area was involved with radiation esophagitis and focal ulceration .
She remained ventilator dependent postoperatively and was taken to the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit .
The patient was maintained on triple antibiotics which included Vancomycin , ceftazidime and Gentamicin .
On postoperative day two , she had an electroencephalogram which showed no evidence of seizure activity but some generalized slowing .
The patient was seen in consultation by the Neurology Service for her apparent postoperative encephalopathy and episodes of shaking .
An endoscopy was also performed on postoperative day two which showed clean anastomosis .
She received multiple bronchoscopies for pulmonary toilet .
The patient was maintained on tube feedings and the ventilator .
A repeat echocardiogram on February 18 showed no significant change of her previous echocardiogram on February 11 , which showed only a small pericardial effusion .
A pelvic and abdominal computerized tomography scan on February 18 also showed no evidence of a focal collection or abscess .
She remained intermittently febrile despite numerous antibiotics .
Her chest X-ray showed bilateral air space disease , consistent with pneumonia or adult respiratory distress syndrome .
She suffered an episode of renal failure which was felt attributable to aminoglycoside toxicity .
Her steroids were weaned .
Because of her prolonged intubation and inability to wean , on February 24 , 1994 , she had a tracheostomy placed .
She remained in a coma .
The blood cultures on February 26 , 1994 grew out Staphylococcus and she was treated for septicemia .
Her sputum grew out Pseudomonas aeruginosa as well .
The urine contained yeast and she was treated with amphotericin .
On March 3 , 1994 , a repeat chest and abdominal and pelvis computerized tomography scan showed no evidence of fluid collections .
There was a large left pleural effusion however .
This was drained with a left chest tube .
Her sputum then grew out Klebsiella and she was treated with amikacin and imipenem .
She developed a right pleural effusion and had a right chest tube placed .
On March 13 , 1994 , she regained some level of consciousness .
She was able to fix and follow with her eyes , respond to commands .
On March 14 , 1994 , her right lung was pleurodesed .
Attempts were made to facilitate her wean by resting her overnight with a combination of propafol and Fentanyl .
This was tried for approximately seven days with no real progress made toward facilitating her vent wean .
She continued to require pressor support in the high 30 's .
She also fell into a coma once again .
On March 31 , 1994 , her pressor support requirement increased and she continued to have tachypneic episodes .
On April 2 , 1994 , she had several episodes of bradycardia and asystole , which responded only to manual ventilation .
Discussions were held with the patient 's family with regard to her previously expressed wishes not to be maintained on artificial life support for extended period of time with little or no hope for recovery .
She had expressed these wishes in writing on several legal forms from the state of Jose Pineston , as well as in discussions with her loved ones .
Decision was made in conjunction with the family and Dr. Caslighlourdes to terminate artificial respiratory support .
The patient was removed from the ventilator and placed on a T-piece in her trachea only and was made comfortable with narcotics .
Her respirations ceased and she died at 10:15 a.m. on April 2 , 1994 .
DISPOSITION / PLAN ON DISCHARGE :
The family will return the body to Sa for burial .
They have declined a post-mortem examination .

The patient was a 71 year old white female with a history of carcinoid lung cancer who presented for evaluation of a tracheoesophageal fistula .
The patient was initially diagnosed in 1978 with atypical small cell carcinoma of the lung and treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy until 1980 .
She did well for approximately twelve years until she was diagnosed with carcinoid cancer of the same right upper lobe .
This may have been the initial primary cancer although it is unclear at present .
Bronchoscopy at that time showed an endobronchial tumor of the right upper lobe bronchus and it was felt to be unresectable .
She underwent four treatments of brachytherapy in March through May of 1993 .
She had been doing reasonably well until December of 1993 when she presented with persistent and worsening cough and near strangulation on attempts at eating solids or drinking liquids .
A bronchoscopy showed a tracheoesophageal fistula with an opening into the trachea above the carina and no tumor in the right upper lobe .
She has been on total parenteral nutrition and has been nothing by mouth since then .
A barium swallow prior to admission showed the presence of a tracheoesophageal fistula with entrance into the right mainstem bronchus below the carina .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Bronchitis , asthma , carcinoid cancer , no history of coronary artery disease or cerebrovascular accident .
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :
The patient is status post appendectomy , hysterectomy and right salpingo-oophorectomy , bladder suspension and a tumor removal from the right neck .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Cefuroxime 1.5 grams intravenously q8h , Solu-Medrol 62.5 mg intravenously q8h , Ventolin metered dose inhaler , 2 puffs PO q.i.d. , Pepcid 20 mg intravenously b.i.d.
ALLERGIES :
The patient is allergic to penicillin , morphine , codeine .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient is a pleasant white female in no acute distress .
She is afebrile with stable vital signs .
The head , eyes , ears , nose , throat examination was unremarkable .
Neck shows a well healed low collar incision without adenopathy or bruit .
The lungs showed mild inspiratory wheeze and moderate expiratory wheezes .
Breath sounds are present bilaterally .
Cardiovascular exam :
regular rate and rhythm .
The abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended .
Extremities :
no clubbing , cyanosis or edema .
The rectal examination is guaiac negative with a minimal amount of stool .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted on February 5 , 1994 and had a central venous line placed in her right subclavian .
The patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 6 , 1994 where she underwent rigid and flexible bronchoscopy and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy .
Findings included necrotic debris in the distal trachea at the carina and right mainstem bronchus .
Esophageal mucosa was visible through the trachea .
Her steroids were weaned and the patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 10 , 1994 where she underwent once again flexible bronchoscopy and flexible esophagoscopy , as well as rigid bronchoscopy .
She then had a transhiatal esophagectomy which was partial , and a substernal gastric interposition as well as a jejunostomy .
The pathology report suggested that the area was involved with radiation esophagitis and focal ulceration .
She remained ventilator dependent postoperatively and was taken to the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit .
The patient was maintained on triple antibiotics which included Vancomycin , ceftazidime and Gentamicin .
On postoperative day two , she had an electroencephalogram which showed no evidence of seizure activity but some generalized slowing .
The patient was seen in consultation by the Neurology Service for her apparent postoperative encephalopathy and episodes of shaking .
An endoscopy was also performed on postoperative day two which showed clean anastomosis .
She received multiple bronchoscopies for pulmonary toilet .
The patient was maintained on tube feedings and the ventilator .
A repeat echocardiogram on February 18 showed no significant change of her previous echocardiogram on February 11 , which showed only a small pericardial effusion .
A pelvic and abdominal computerized tomography scan on February 18 also showed no evidence of a focal collection or abscess .
She remained intermittently febrile despite numerous antibiotics .
Her chest X-ray showed bilateral air space disease , consistent with pneumonia or adult respiratory distress syndrome .
She suffered an episode of renal failure which was felt attributable to aminoglycoside toxicity .
Her steroids were weaned .
Because of her prolonged intubation and inability to wean , on February 24 , 1994 , she had a tracheostomy placed .
She remained in a coma .
The blood cultures on February 26 , 1994 grew out Staphylococcus and she was treated for septicemia .
Her sputum grew out Pseudomonas aeruginosa as well .
The urine contained yeast and she was treated with amphotericin .
On March 3 , 1994 , a repeat chest and abdominal and pelvis computerized tomography scan showed no evidence of fluid collections .
There was a large left pleural effusion however .
This was drained with a left chest tube .
Her sputum then grew out Klebsiella and she was treated with amikacin and imipenem .
She developed a right pleural effusion and had a right chest tube placed .
On March 13 , 1994 , she regained some level of consciousness .
She was able to fix and follow with her eyes , respond to commands .
On March 14 , 1994 , her right lung was pleurodesed .
Attempts were made to facilitate her wean by resting her overnight with a combination of propafol and Fentanyl .
This was tried for approximately seven days with no real progress made toward facilitating her vent wean .
She continued to require pressor support in the high 30 's .
She also fell into a coma once again .
On March 31 , 1994 , her pressor support requirement increased and she continued to have tachypneic episodes .
On April 2 , 1994 , she had several episodes of bradycardia and asystole , which responded only to manual ventilation .
Discussions were held with the patient 's family with regard to her previously expressed wishes not to be maintained on artificial life support for extended period of time with little or no hope for recovery .
She had expressed these wishes in writing on several legal forms from the state of Jose Pineston , as well as in discussions with her loved ones .
Decision was made in conjunction with the family and Dr. Caslighlourdes to terminate artificial respiratory support .
The patient was removed from the ventilator and placed on a T-piece in her trachea only and was made comfortable with narcotics .
Her respirations ceased and she died at 10:15 a.m. on April 2 , 1994 .
DISPOSITION / PLAN ON DISCHARGE :
The family will return the body to Sa for burial .
They have declined a post-mortem examination .

She did well for approximately twelve years until she was diagnosed with carcinoid cancer of the same right upper lobe .
This may have been the initial primary cancer although it is unclear at present .
Bronchoscopy at that time showed an endobronchial tumor of the right upper lobe bronchus and it was felt to be unresectable .
She underwent four treatments of brachytherapy in March through May of 1993 .
She had been doing reasonably well until December of 1993 when she presented with persistent and worsening cough and near strangulation on attempts at eating solids or drinking liquids .
A bronchoscopy showed a tracheoesophageal fistula with an opening into the trachea above the carina and no tumor in the right upper lobe .
She has been on total parenteral nutrition and has been nothing by mouth since then .
A barium swallow prior to admission showed the presence of a tracheoesophageal fistula with entrance into the right mainstem bronchus below the carina .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Bronchitis , asthma , carcinoid cancer , no history of coronary artery disease or cerebrovascular accident .
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :
The patient is status post appendectomy , hysterectomy and right salpingo-oophorectomy , bladder suspension and a tumor removal from the right neck .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Cefuroxime 1.5 grams intravenously q8h , Solu-Medrol 62.5 mg intravenously q8h , Ventolin metered dose inhaler , 2 puffs PO q.i.d. , Pepcid 20 mg intravenously b.i.d.
ALLERGIES :
The patient is allergic to penicillin , morphine , codeine .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient is a pleasant white female in no acute distress .
She is afebrile with stable vital signs .
The head , eyes , ears , nose , throat examination was unremarkable .
Neck shows a well healed low collar incision without adenopathy or bruit .
The lungs showed mild inspiratory wheeze and moderate expiratory wheezes .
Breath sounds are present bilaterally .
Cardiovascular exam :
regular rate and rhythm .
The abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended .
Extremities :
no clubbing , cyanosis or edema .
The rectal examination is guaiac negative with a minimal amount of stool .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted on February 5 , 1994 and had a central venous line placed in her right subclavian .
The patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 6 , 1994 where she underwent rigid and flexible bronchoscopy and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy .
Findings included necrotic debris in the distal trachea at the carina and right mainstem bronchus .
Esophageal mucosa was visible through the trachea .
Her steroids were weaned and the patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 10 , 1994 where she underwent once again flexible bronchoscopy and flexible esophagoscopy , as well as rigid bronchoscopy .
She then had a transhiatal esophagectomy which was partial , and a substernal gastric interposition as well as a jejunostomy .
The pathology report suggested that the area was involved with radiation esophagitis and focal ulceration .
She remained ventilator dependent postoperatively and was taken to the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit .
The patient was maintained on triple antibiotics which included Vancomycin , ceftazidime and Gentamicin .
On postoperative day two , she had an electroencephalogram which showed no evidence of seizure activity but some generalized slowing .
The patient was seen in consultation by the Neurology Service for her apparent postoperative encephalopathy and episodes of shaking .
An endoscopy was also performed on postoperative day two which showed clean anastomosis .
She received multiple bronchoscopies for pulmonary toilet .
The patient was maintained on tube feedings and the ventilator .
A repeat echocardiogram on February 18 showed no significant change of her previous echocardiogram on February 11 , which showed only a small pericardial effusion .
A pelvic and abdominal computerized tomography scan on February 18 also showed no evidence of a focal collection or abscess .
She remained intermittently febrile despite numerous antibiotics .
Her chest X-ray showed bilateral air space disease , consistent with pneumonia or adult respiratory distress syndrome .
She suffered an episode of renal failure which was felt attributable to aminoglycoside toxicity .
Her steroids were weaned .
Because of her prolonged intubation and inability to wean , on February 24 , 1994 , she had a tracheostomy placed .
She remained in a coma .
The blood cultures on February 26 , 1994 grew out Staphylococcus and she was treated for septicemia .
Her sputum grew out Pseudomonas aeruginosa as well .
The urine contained yeast and she was treated with amphotericin .
On March 3 , 1994 , a repeat chest and abdominal and pelvis computerized tomography scan showed no evidence of fluid collections .
There was a large left pleural effusion however .
This was drained with a left chest tube .
Her sputum then grew out Klebsiella and she was treated with amikacin and imipenem .
She developed a right pleural effusion and had a right chest tube placed .
On March 13 , 1994 , she regained some level of consciousness .
She was able to fix and follow with her eyes , respond to commands .
On March 14 , 1994 , her right lung was pleurodesed .
Attempts were made to facilitate her wean by resting her overnight with a combination of propafol and Fentanyl .
This was tried for approximately seven days with no real progress made toward facilitating her vent wean .
She continued to require pressor support in the high 30 's .
She also fell into a coma once again .
On March 31 , 1994 , her pressor support requirement increased and she continued to have tachypneic episodes .
On April 2 , 1994 , she had several episodes of bradycardia and asystole , which responded only to manual ventilation .
Discussions were held with the patient 's family with regard to her previously expressed wishes not to be maintained on artificial life support for extended period of time with little or no hope for recovery .
She had expressed these wishes in writing on several legal forms from the state of Jose Pineston , as well as in discussions with her loved ones .
Decision was made in conjunction with the family and Dr. Caslighlourdes to terminate artificial respiratory support .
The patient was removed from the ventilator and placed on a T-piece in her trachea only and was made comfortable with narcotics .
Her respirations ceased and she died at 10:15 a.m. on April 2 , 1994 .
DISPOSITION / PLAN ON DISCHARGE :
The family will return the body to Sa for burial .
They have declined a post-mortem examination .

This may have been the initial primary cancer although it is unclear at present .
Bronchoscopy at that time showed an endobronchial tumor of the right upper lobe bronchus and it was felt to be unresectable .
She underwent four treatments of brachytherapy in March through May of 1993 .
She had been doing reasonably well until December of 1993 when she presented with persistent and worsening cough and near strangulation on attempts at eating solids or drinking liquids .
A bronchoscopy showed a tracheoesophageal fistula with an opening into the trachea above the carina and no tumor in the right upper lobe .
She has been on total parenteral nutrition and has been nothing by mouth since then .
A barium swallow prior to admission showed the presence of a tracheoesophageal fistula with entrance into the right mainstem bronchus below the carina .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Bronchitis , asthma , carcinoid cancer , no history of coronary artery disease or cerebrovascular accident .
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :
The patient is status post appendectomy , hysterectomy and right salpingo-oophorectomy , bladder suspension and a tumor removal from the right neck .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Cefuroxime 1.5 grams intravenously q8h , Solu-Medrol 62.5 mg intravenously q8h , Ventolin metered dose inhaler , 2 puffs PO q.i.d. , Pepcid 20 mg intravenously b.i.d.
ALLERGIES :
The patient is allergic to penicillin , morphine , codeine .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient is a pleasant white female in no acute distress .
She is afebrile with stable vital signs .
The head , eyes , ears , nose , throat examination was unremarkable .
Neck shows a well healed low collar incision without adenopathy or bruit .
The lungs showed mild inspiratory wheeze and moderate expiratory wheezes .
Breath sounds are present bilaterally .
Cardiovascular exam :
regular rate and rhythm .
The abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended .
Extremities :
no clubbing , cyanosis or edema .
The rectal examination is guaiac negative with a minimal amount of stool .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted on February 5 , 1994 and had a central venous line placed in her right subclavian .
The patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 6 , 1994 where she underwent rigid and flexible bronchoscopy and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy .
Findings included necrotic debris in the distal trachea at the carina and right mainstem bronchus .
Esophageal mucosa was visible through the trachea .
Her steroids were weaned and the patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 10 , 1994 where she underwent once again flexible bronchoscopy and flexible esophagoscopy , as well as rigid bronchoscopy .
She then had a transhiatal esophagectomy which was partial , and a substernal gastric interposition as well as a jejunostomy .
The pathology report suggested that the area was involved with radiation esophagitis and focal ulceration .
She remained ventilator dependent postoperatively and was taken to the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit .
The patient was maintained on triple antibiotics which included Vancomycin , ceftazidime and Gentamicin .
On postoperative day two , she had an electroencephalogram which showed no evidence of seizure activity but some generalized slowing .
The patient was seen in consultation by the Neurology Service for her apparent postoperative encephalopathy and episodes of shaking .
An endoscopy was also performed on postoperative day two which showed clean anastomosis .
She received multiple bronchoscopies for pulmonary toilet .
The patient was maintained on tube feedings and the ventilator .
A repeat echocardiogram on February 18 showed no significant change of her previous echocardiogram on February 11 , which showed only a small pericardial effusion .
A pelvic and abdominal computerized tomography scan on February 18 also showed no evidence of a focal collection or abscess .
She remained intermittently febrile despite numerous antibiotics .
Her chest X-ray showed bilateral air space disease , consistent with pneumonia or adult respiratory distress syndrome .
She suffered an episode of renal failure which was felt attributable to aminoglycoside toxicity .
Her steroids were weaned .
Because of her prolonged intubation and inability to wean , on February 24 , 1994 , she had a tracheostomy placed .
She remained in a coma .
The blood cultures on February 26 , 1994 grew out Staphylococcus and she was treated for septicemia .
Her sputum grew out Pseudomonas aeruginosa as well .
The urine contained yeast and she was treated with amphotericin .
On March 3 , 1994 , a repeat chest and abdominal and pelvis computerized tomography scan showed no evidence of fluid collections .
There was a large left pleural effusion however .
This was drained with a left chest tube .
Her sputum then grew out Klebsiella and she was treated with amikacin and imipenem .
She developed a right pleural effusion and had a right chest tube placed .
On March 13 , 1994 , she regained some level of consciousness .
She was able to fix and follow with her eyes , respond to commands .
On March 14 , 1994 , her right lung was pleurodesed .
Attempts were made to facilitate her wean by resting her overnight with a combination of propafol and Fentanyl .
This was tried for approximately seven days with no real progress made toward facilitating her vent wean .
She continued to require pressor support in the high 30 's .
She also fell into a coma once again .
On March 31 , 1994 , her pressor support requirement increased and she continued to have tachypneic episodes .
On April 2 , 1994 , she had several episodes of bradycardia and asystole , which responded only to manual ventilation .
Discussions were held with the patient 's family with regard to her previously expressed wishes not to be maintained on artificial life support for extended period of time with little or no hope for recovery .
She had expressed these wishes in writing on several legal forms from the state of Jose Pineston , as well as in discussions with her loved ones .
Decision was made in conjunction with the family and Dr. Caslighlourdes to terminate artificial respiratory support .
The patient was removed from the ventilator and placed on a T-piece in her trachea only and was made comfortable with narcotics .
Her respirations ceased and she died at 10:15 a.m. on April 2 , 1994 .
DISPOSITION / PLAN ON DISCHARGE :
The family will return the body to Sa for burial .
They have declined a post-mortem examination .

Bronchoscopy at that time showed an endobronchial tumor of the right upper lobe bronchus and it was felt to be unresectable .
She underwent four treatments of brachytherapy in March through May of 1993 .
She had been doing reasonably well until December of 1993 when she presented with persistent and worsening cough and near strangulation on attempts at eating solids or drinking liquids .
A bronchoscopy showed a tracheoesophageal fistula with an opening into the trachea above the carina and no tumor in the right upper lobe .
She has been on total parenteral nutrition and has been nothing by mouth since then .
A barium swallow prior to admission showed the presence of a tracheoesophageal fistula with entrance into the right mainstem bronchus below the carina .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Bronchitis , asthma , carcinoid cancer , no history of coronary artery disease or cerebrovascular accident .
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :
The patient is status post appendectomy , hysterectomy and right salpingo-oophorectomy , bladder suspension and a tumor removal from the right neck .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Cefuroxime 1.5 grams intravenously q8h , Solu-Medrol 62.5 mg intravenously q8h , Ventolin metered dose inhaler , 2 puffs PO q.i.d. , Pepcid 20 mg intravenously b.i.d.
ALLERGIES :
The patient is allergic to penicillin , morphine , codeine .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient is a pleasant white female in no acute distress .
She is afebrile with stable vital signs .
The head , eyes , ears , nose , throat examination was unremarkable .
Neck shows a well healed low collar incision without adenopathy or bruit .
The lungs showed mild inspiratory wheeze and moderate expiratory wheezes .
Breath sounds are present bilaterally .
Cardiovascular exam :
regular rate and rhythm .
The abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended .
Extremities :
no clubbing , cyanosis or edema .
The rectal examination is guaiac negative with a minimal amount of stool .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted on February 5 , 1994 and had a central venous line placed in her right subclavian .
The patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 6 , 1994 where she underwent rigid and flexible bronchoscopy and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy .
Findings included necrotic debris in the distal trachea at the carina and right mainstem bronchus .
Esophageal mucosa was visible through the trachea .
Her steroids were weaned and the patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 10 , 1994 where she underwent once again flexible bronchoscopy and flexible esophagoscopy , as well as rigid bronchoscopy .
She then had a transhiatal esophagectomy which was partial , and a substernal gastric interposition as well as a jejunostomy .
The pathology report suggested that the area was involved with radiation esophagitis and focal ulceration .
She remained ventilator dependent postoperatively and was taken to the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit .
The patient was maintained on triple antibiotics which included Vancomycin , ceftazidime and Gentamicin .
On postoperative day two , she had an electroencephalogram which showed no evidence of seizure activity but some generalized slowing .
The patient was seen in consultation by the Neurology Service for her apparent postoperative encephalopathy and episodes of shaking .
An endoscopy was also performed on postoperative day two which showed clean anastomosis .
She received multiple bronchoscopies for pulmonary toilet .
The patient was maintained on tube feedings and the ventilator .
A repeat echocardiogram on February 18 showed no significant change of her previous echocardiogram on February 11 , which showed only a small pericardial effusion .
A pelvic and abdominal computerized tomography scan on February 18 also showed no evidence of a focal collection or abscess .
She remained intermittently febrile despite numerous antibiotics .
Her chest X-ray showed bilateral air space disease , consistent with pneumonia or adult respiratory distress syndrome .
She suffered an episode of renal failure which was felt attributable to aminoglycoside toxicity .
Her steroids were weaned .
Because of her prolonged intubation and inability to wean , on February 24 , 1994 , she had a tracheostomy placed .
She remained in a coma .
The blood cultures on February 26 , 1994 grew out Staphylococcus and she was treated for septicemia .
Her sputum grew out Pseudomonas aeruginosa as well .
The urine contained yeast and she was treated with amphotericin .
On March 3 , 1994 , a repeat chest and abdominal and pelvis computerized tomography scan showed no evidence of fluid collections .
There was a large left pleural effusion however .
This was drained with a left chest tube .
Her sputum then grew out Klebsiella and she was treated with amikacin and imipenem .
She developed a right pleural effusion and had a right chest tube placed .
On March 13 , 1994 , she regained some level of consciousness .
She was able to fix and follow with her eyes , respond to commands .
On March 14 , 1994 , her right lung was pleurodesed .
Attempts were made to facilitate her wean by resting her overnight with a combination of propafol and Fentanyl .
This was tried for approximately seven days with no real progress made toward facilitating her vent wean .
She continued to require pressor support in the high 30 's .
She also fell into a coma once again .
On March 31 , 1994 , her pressor support requirement increased and she continued to have tachypneic episodes .
On April 2 , 1994 , she had several episodes of bradycardia and asystole , which responded only to manual ventilation .
Discussions were held with the patient 's family with regard to her previously expressed wishes not to be maintained on artificial life support for extended period of time with little or no hope for recovery .
She had expressed these wishes in writing on several legal forms from the state of Jose Pineston , as well as in discussions with her loved ones .
Decision was made in conjunction with the family and Dr. Caslighlourdes to terminate artificial respiratory support .
The patient was removed from the ventilator and placed on a T-piece in her trachea only and was made comfortable with narcotics .
Her respirations ceased and she died at 10:15 a.m. on April 2 , 1994 .
DISPOSITION / PLAN ON DISCHARGE :
The family will return the body to Sa for burial .
They have declined a post-mortem examination .

She had been doing reasonably well until December of 1993 when she presented with persistent and worsening cough and near strangulation on attempts at eating solids or drinking liquids .
A bronchoscopy showed a tracheoesophageal fistula with an opening into the trachea above the carina and no tumor in the right upper lobe .
She has been on total parenteral nutrition and has been nothing by mouth since then .
A barium swallow prior to admission showed the presence of a tracheoesophageal fistula with entrance into the right mainstem bronchus below the carina .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Bronchitis , asthma , carcinoid cancer , no history of coronary artery disease or cerebrovascular accident .
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :
The patient is status post appendectomy , hysterectomy and right salpingo-oophorectomy , bladder suspension and a tumor removal from the right neck .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Cefuroxime 1.5 grams intravenously q8h , Solu-Medrol 62.5 mg intravenously q8h , Ventolin metered dose inhaler , 2 puffs PO q.i.d. , Pepcid 20 mg intravenously b.i.d.
ALLERGIES :
The patient is allergic to penicillin , morphine , codeine .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient is a pleasant white female in no acute distress .
She is afebrile with stable vital signs .
The head , eyes , ears , nose , throat examination was unremarkable .
Neck shows a well healed low collar incision without adenopathy or bruit .
The lungs showed mild inspiratory wheeze and moderate expiratory wheezes .
Breath sounds are present bilaterally .
Cardiovascular exam :
regular rate and rhythm .
The abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended .
Extremities :
no clubbing , cyanosis or edema .
The rectal examination is guaiac negative with a minimal amount of stool .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted on February 5 , 1994 and had a central venous line placed in her right subclavian .
The patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 6 , 1994 where she underwent rigid and flexible bronchoscopy and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy .
Findings included necrotic debris in the distal trachea at the carina and right mainstem bronchus .
Esophageal mucosa was visible through the trachea .
Her steroids were weaned and the patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 10 , 1994 where she underwent once again flexible bronchoscopy and flexible esophagoscopy , as well as rigid bronchoscopy .
She then had a transhiatal esophagectomy which was partial , and a substernal gastric interposition as well as a jejunostomy .
The pathology report suggested that the area was involved with radiation esophagitis and focal ulceration .
She remained ventilator dependent postoperatively and was taken to the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit .
The patient was maintained on triple antibiotics which included Vancomycin , ceftazidime and Gentamicin .
On postoperative day two , she had an electroencephalogram which showed no evidence of seizure activity but some generalized slowing .
The patient was seen in consultation by the Neurology Service for her apparent postoperative encephalopathy and episodes of shaking .
An endoscopy was also performed on postoperative day two which showed clean anastomosis .
She received multiple bronchoscopies for pulmonary toilet .
The patient was maintained on tube feedings and the ventilator .
A repeat echocardiogram on February 18 showed no significant change of her previous echocardiogram on February 11 , which showed only a small pericardial effusion .
A pelvic and abdominal computerized tomography scan on February 18 also showed no evidence of a focal collection or abscess .
She remained intermittently febrile despite numerous antibiotics .
Her chest X-ray showed bilateral air space disease , consistent with pneumonia or adult respiratory distress syndrome .
She suffered an episode of renal failure which was felt attributable to aminoglycoside toxicity .
Her steroids were weaned .
Because of her prolonged intubation and inability to wean , on February 24 , 1994 , she had a tracheostomy placed .
She remained in a coma .
The blood cultures on February 26 , 1994 grew out Staphylococcus and she was treated for septicemia .
Her sputum grew out Pseudomonas aeruginosa as well .
The urine contained yeast and she was treated with amphotericin .
On March 3 , 1994 , a repeat chest and abdominal and pelvis computerized tomography scan showed no evidence of fluid collections .
There was a large left pleural effusion however .
This was drained with a left chest tube .
Her sputum then grew out Klebsiella and she was treated with amikacin and imipenem .
She developed a right pleural effusion and had a right chest tube placed .
On March 13 , 1994 , she regained some level of consciousness .
She was able to fix and follow with her eyes , respond to commands .
On March 14 , 1994 , her right lung was pleurodesed .
Attempts were made to facilitate her wean by resting her overnight with a combination of propafol and Fentanyl .
This was tried for approximately seven days with no real progress made toward facilitating her vent wean .
She continued to require pressor support in the high 30 's .
She also fell into a coma once again .
On March 31 , 1994 , her pressor support requirement increased and she continued to have tachypneic episodes .
On April 2 , 1994 , she had several episodes of bradycardia and asystole , which responded only to manual ventilation .
Discussions were held with the patient 's family with regard to her previously expressed wishes not to be maintained on artificial life support for extended period of time with little or no hope for recovery .
She had expressed these wishes in writing on several legal forms from the state of Jose Pineston , as well as in discussions with her loved ones .
Decision was made in conjunction with the family and Dr. Caslighlourdes to terminate artificial respiratory support .
The patient was removed from the ventilator and placed on a T-piece in her trachea only and was made comfortable with narcotics .
Her respirations ceased and she died at 10:15 a.m. on April 2 , 1994 .
DISPOSITION / PLAN ON DISCHARGE :
The family will return the body to Sa for burial .
They have declined a post-mortem examination .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient was a 71 year old white female with a history of carcinoid lung cancer who presented for evaluation of a tracheoesophageal fistula .
The patient was initially diagnosed in 1978 with atypical small cell carcinoma of the lung and treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy until 1980 .
She did well for approximately twelve years until she was diagnosed with carcinoid cancer of the same right upper lobe .
This may have been the initial primary cancer although it is unclear at present .

DISCHARGE DATE :
12-9-93
IDENTIFYING DATA :
This 75 year old female was transferred from Iming Medical Center for angioplasty .
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Unstable angina .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
Hypertension .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
Right and circumflex angioplasty , cardiac catheterization on 12-6-93 .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This 75 year old woman was previously admitted here in November 1993 for chronic angina .
She had mild mitral regurgitation and a slightly diminished ejection fraction .
There was a 90% right coronary stenosis which was reduced to 30 with a balloon angioplasty .
There were three lesions in the circumflex , dilated successfully .
However , the low circumflex marginal vessel could not be crossed with the balloon .
She did well in follow up , being treated for hypertension .
In the end of 1992 , she was feeling well and was taken off Isordil .
During the winter and early parts of 1993 , the patient noticed increasing fatigue , symptoms of breathlessness and recurrent substernal chest pressure which finally led to admission to Xas Tupalmsmodral Hospital on 11-11-93 with documentation of a subendocardial myocardial infarction and a blood pressure of 210/108 .
Cardiac catheterization towards the end of the hospitalization showed recurrent right coronary artery stenosis proximally and high grade new stenosis in the distal circumflex at the area of the origin of the previously untreated low circumflex marginal vessel .

Medications on transfer were Ecotrin , Vasotec 5 mg , Lopressor 25 bid , Isordil 20 tid , Procardia XL once per day , and Lasix 20 q3 days .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On physical examination , the blood pressure was 150 , heart rate 70 , bilateral carotid bruits , grade II systolic ejection murmur , good femoral pulses without bruits , good dorsalis pedis pulses with no posterior tibial pulses felt .
LABORATORY DATA :
The electrocardiogram revealed left bundle branch block .
The electrolytes were normal .
The admission hematocrit was 34 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
On 12-6-93 , angioplasty was performed of the right coronary artery using a 3 mm solo balloon reducing the stenosis from 80 to approximately 20% with a faint diagonal lucency which was not obstructive .
The new distal circumflex lesion was dilated with a 2.0 mm balloon with a good result and minimal persistent stenosis .
But the low circumflex marginal could not be entered with a wire .
The first marginal had a 505 stenosis at its origin , which was not attempted .
The patient did well post procedure .
He developed a grape sized hematoma over the femoral artery with a loud bruit .
The ultrasound on the day of discharge showed no evidence of pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula .
The blood pressure was 150-170 systolic .
The patient was ambulating without symptoms .
ADDENDUM :
The admission hematocrit was 34 .
This fell to 25 after the cardiac catheterization without evidence of bleeding and rose to 29 by the time of discharge .
DOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :
She was discharged with advice by Cardiac Rehabilitation for gradually increasing activity .
She will be followed by her physician at Cean , Dr. Dieseld Pollejesc , for further pressure management and follow up of the femoral hematoma .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
Stable , resolving anemia .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Ecotrin 160 mg per day , Vasotec 5 mg per day , Lopressor 25 bid , Isordil 20 tid , Procardia XL 30 per day , Lasix 20 mg q3 days .

IDENTIFYING DATA :
This 75 year old female was transferred from Iming Medical Center for angioplasty .
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Unstable angina .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
Hypertension .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
Right and circumflex angioplasty , cardiac catheterization on 12-6-93 .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This 75 year old woman was previously admitted here in November 1993 for chronic angina .
She had mild mitral regurgitation and a slightly diminished ejection fraction .
There was a 90% right coronary stenosis which was reduced to 30 with a balloon angioplasty .
There were three lesions in the circumflex , dilated successfully .
However , the low circumflex marginal vessel could not be crossed with the balloon .
She did well in follow up , being treated for hypertension .
In the end of 1992 , she was feeling well and was taken off Isordil .
During the winter and early parts of 1993 , the patient noticed increasing fatigue , symptoms of breathlessness and recurrent substernal chest pressure which finally led to admission to Xas Tupalmsmodral Hospital on 11-11-93 with documentation of a subendocardial myocardial infarction and a blood pressure of 210/108 .

IDENTIFYING DATA :
This 75 year old female was transferred from Iming Medical Center for angioplasty .
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Unstable angina .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
Hypertension .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
Right and circumflex angioplasty , cardiac catheterization on 12-6-93 .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This 75 year old woman was previously admitted here in November 1993 for chronic angina .
She had mild mitral regurgitation and a slightly diminished ejection fraction .
There was a 90% right coronary stenosis which was reduced to 30 with a balloon angioplasty .
There were three lesions in the circumflex , dilated successfully .
However , the low circumflex marginal vessel could not be crossed with the balloon .
She did well in follow up , being treated for hypertension .
In the end of 1992 , she was feeling well and was taken off Isordil .
During the winter and early parts of 1993 , the patient noticed increasing fatigue , symptoms of breathlessness and recurrent substernal chest pressure which finally led to admission to Xas Tupalmsmodral Hospital on 11-11-93 with documentation of a subendocardial myocardial infarction and a blood pressure of 210/108 .
Cardiac catheterization towards the end of the hospitalization showed recurrent right coronary artery stenosis proximally and high grade new stenosis in the distal circumflex at the area of the origin of the previously untreated low circumflex marginal vessel .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Medications on transfer were Ecotrin , Vasotec 5 mg , Lopressor 25 bid , Isordil 20 tid , Procardia XL once per day , and Lasix 20 q3 days .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On physical examination , the blood pressure was 150 , heart rate 70 , bilateral carotid bruits , grade II systolic ejection murmur , good femoral pulses without bruits , good dorsalis pedis pulses with no posterior tibial pulses felt .
LABORATORY DATA :
The electrocardiogram revealed left bundle branch block .
The electrolytes were normal .
The admission hematocrit was 34 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
On 12-6-93 , angioplasty was performed of the right coronary artery using a 3 mm solo balloon reducing the stenosis from 80 to approximately 20% with a faint diagonal lucency which was not obstructive .
The new distal circumflex lesion was dilated with a 2.0 mm balloon with a good result and minimal persistent stenosis .
But the low circumflex marginal could not be entered with a wire .
The first marginal had a 505 stenosis at its origin , which was not attempted .
The patient did well post procedure .
He developed a grape sized hematoma over the femoral artery with a loud bruit .
The ultrasound on the day of discharge showed no evidence of pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula .
The blood pressure was 150-170 systolic .
The patient was ambulating without symptoms .
ADDENDUM :
The admission hematocrit was 34 .
This fell to 25 after the cardiac catheterization without evidence of bleeding and rose to 29 by the time of discharge .
DOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :
She was discharged with advice by Cardiac Rehabilitation for gradually increasing activity .
She will be followed by her physician at Cean , Dr. Dieseld Pollejesc , for further pressure management and follow up of the femoral hematoma .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
Stable , resolving anemia .

During the winter and early parts of 1993 , the patient noticed increasing fatigue , symptoms of breathlessness and recurrent substernal chest pressure which finally led to admission to Xas Tupalmsmodral Hospital on 11-11-93 with documentation of a subendocardial myocardial infarction and a blood pressure of 210/108 .
Cardiac catheterization towards the end of the hospitalization showed recurrent right coronary artery stenosis proximally and high grade new stenosis in the distal circumflex at the area of the origin of the previously untreated low circumflex marginal vessel .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Medications on transfer were Ecotrin , Vasotec 5 mg , Lopressor 25 bid , Isordil 20 tid , Procardia XL once per day , and Lasix 20 q3 days .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On physical examination , the blood pressure was 150 , heart rate 70 , bilateral carotid bruits , grade II systolic ejection murmur , good femoral pulses without bruits , good dorsalis pedis pulses with no posterior tibial pulses felt .
LABORATORY DATA :
The electrocardiogram revealed left bundle branch block .
The electrolytes were normal .
The admission hematocrit was 34 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
On 12-6-93 , angioplasty was performed of the right coronary artery using a 3 mm solo balloon reducing the stenosis from 80 to approximately 20% with a faint diagonal lucency which was not obstructive .
The new distal circumflex lesion was dilated with a 2.0 mm balloon with a good result and minimal persistent stenosis .
But the low circumflex marginal could not be entered with a wire .
The first marginal had a 505 stenosis at its origin , which was not attempted .
The patient did well post procedure .
He developed a grape sized hematoma over the femoral artery with a loud bruit .
The ultrasound on the day of discharge showed no evidence of pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula .
The blood pressure was 150-170 systolic .
The patient was ambulating without symptoms .
ADDENDUM :
The admission hematocrit was 34 .
This fell to 25 after the cardiac catheterization without evidence of bleeding and rose to 29 by the time of discharge .
DOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :
She was discharged with advice by Cardiac Rehabilitation for gradually increasing activity .
She will be followed by her physician at Cean , Dr. Dieseld Pollejesc , for further pressure management and follow up of the femoral hematoma .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
Stable , resolving anemia .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Ecotrin 160 mg per day , Vasotec 5 mg per day , Lopressor 25 bid , Isordil 20 tid , Procardia XL 30 per day , Lasix 20 mg q3 days .

Report Status :
Unsigned
ADMISSION DATE :
12-6-93
DISCHARGE DATE :
12-9-93
IDENTIFYING DATA :
This 75 year old female was transferred from Iming Medical Center for angioplasty .
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Unstable angina .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
Hypertension .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
Right and circumflex angioplasty , cardiac catheterization on 12-6-93 .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This 75 year old woman was previously admitted here in November 1993 for chronic angina .
She had mild mitral regurgitation and a slightly diminished ejection fraction .
There was a 90% right coronary stenosis which was reduced to 30 with a balloon angioplasty .
There were three lesions in the circumflex , dilated successfully .
However , the low circumflex marginal vessel could not be crossed with the balloon .
She did well in follow up , being treated for hypertension .
In the end of 1992 , she was feeling well and was taken off Isordil .
During the winter and early parts of 1993 , the patient noticed increasing fatigue , symptoms of breathlessness and recurrent substernal chest pressure which finally led to admission to Xas Tupalmsmodral Hospital on 11-11-93 with documentation of a subendocardial myocardial infarction and a blood pressure of 210/108 .
Cardiac catheterization towards the end of the hospitalization showed recurrent right coronary artery stenosis proximally and high grade new stenosis in the distal circumflex at the area of the origin of the previously untreated low circumflex marginal vessel .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Medications on transfer were Ecotrin , Vasotec 5 mg , Lopressor 25 bid , Isordil 20 tid , Procardia XL once per day , and Lasix 20 q3 days .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On physical examination , the blood pressure was 150 , heart rate 70 , bilateral carotid bruits , grade II systolic ejection murmur , good femoral pulses without bruits , good dorsalis pedis pulses with no posterior tibial pulses felt .
LABORATORY DATA :
The electrocardiogram revealed left bundle branch block .
The electrolytes were normal .
The admission hematocrit was 34 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
On 12-6-93 , angioplasty was performed of the right coronary artery using a 3 mm solo balloon reducing the stenosis from 80 to approximately 20% with a faint diagonal lucency which was not obstructive .
The new distal circumflex lesion was dilated with a 2.0 mm balloon with a good result and minimal persistent stenosis .
But the low circumflex marginal could not be entered with a wire .
The first marginal had a 505 stenosis at its origin , which was not attempted .
The patient did well post procedure .
He developed a grape sized hematoma over the femoral artery with a loud bruit .
The ultrasound on the day of discharge showed no evidence of pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula .
The blood pressure was 150-170 systolic .
The patient was ambulating without symptoms .
ADDENDUM :
The admission hematocrit was 34 .
This fell to 25 after the cardiac catheterization without evidence of bleeding and rose to 29 by the time of discharge .
DOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :
She was discharged with advice by Cardiac Rehabilitation for gradually increasing activity .
She will be followed by her physician at Cean , Dr. Dieseld Pollejesc , for further pressure management and follow up of the femoral hematoma .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
Stable , resolving anemia .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Ecotrin 160 mg per day , Vasotec 5 mg per day , Lopressor 25 bid , Isordil 20 tid , Procardia XL 30 per day , Lasix 20 mg q3 days .

ADMISSION DATE :

DISCHARGE DATE :
12/17/93
CAUSE OF DEATH :
Cardiogenic shock .
CAUSATIVE FACTORS :
Including cardiomyopathy , aortic stenosis , status post aortic valve replacement , coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass grafting with congestive heart failure and pulmonary edema .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 65 year old male who sustained a small myocardial infarction first in 1978 , with course thereafter including a coronary artery bypass graft by Dr. Wierst ______________at Noughwell Entanbon Health in 1986 .
In 1991 he presented with congestive heart failure and he underwent porcine aortic valve replacement .
In the seven to eight months preceding admission , he developed recurrent angina with dyspnea on exertion .
The patient was admitted for cardiac catheterization in early December , 1993 .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Significant for vertebrobasilar insufficiency , bipolar mood disorder , and hypercholesterolemia , as well as some baseline renal insufficiency .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Procardia sustained release 60 mg. po q.day , Digoxin .25 mg. po q.day , Lasix 30 mg. ( interval unspecified ) , Prozac 40 mg. po q.day , Lovestatin 20 mg. po bid , aspirin q. day and supplemental potassium .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Remarkable for an oriented , alert male in no acute distress with decreased breath sounds at the right base consistent with effusion and a 3/6 systolic murmur consistent with aortic stenosis .
His pulse exam was intact .
Cardiac catheterization demonstrated elevated right and left-sided filling pressures at rest , with pulmonary hypertension and normal cardiac index .
There was severe aortic stenosis of 70 millimeter peak gradient , native three vessel disease with patent left internal mammary artery graft to the left circumflex , dissection of the left main was induced by the catheter tip .
A patent right internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending artery and diagonal was noted , and a patent saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery was present .
Also of note , pulmonary edema was induced by dye and anxiety and treated with Lasix , Morphine , oxygen and nitroglycerin .
Post-procedure he was admitted to the CCU because of the history of left main dissection .
He remained hemodynamically stable but of note , would not tolerate a transesophageal echo because of anxiety-he would not swallow the probe .
Transthoracic echo demonstrated gradients of 100 peak and 65 mean across the aortic valve and there was mild aortic insufficiency and ejection fraction was noted to be 18% with global hypokinesis .
The next several days were remarkable for events in which the patient was quite agitated and was evaluated by Psychiatry and treated with Ativan .
The patient was then evaluated by Cardiac Surgery for probable re-do aortic valve replacement and possible re-do coronary artery bypass grafting .
In the course of preoperative workup , Mr. Has was evaluated completely by Psychiatry with diagnoses including underlying chronic depression well-controlled on Prozac , underlying organ brain vulnerability of unclear etiology , possibly microvascular infarct , acute paranoid and belligerent behavior , possibly due to medications .
On December 12 the patient underwent surgery , including a re-do aortic valve replacement with # 25 St. Jude and re-do coronary artery bypass grafting times one ; saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery as a veno-venous jump graft .
The total bypass time :
2 hours 25 minutes .
Total crossclamp time :
1 hour and 48 minutes .
The patient was admitted to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit postoperatively with stable hemodynamics on Lidocaine at one , Dobutamine at 200 and Nipride .
The patient was extubated by postoperative day # 1 but was noted to be relatively hypoxemic with high oxygen requirement .
Chest x-ray demonstrating pulmonary edema .
Aggressive diuresis was undertaken and the patient responded , albeit sluggishly .
In addition , he remained agitated .
This was attributed to mild hypoxia and / or his underlying psychiatric diagnoses and he was treated with Haldol appropriately .
On day # 2 the patient continued to diurese and this was maintained with the Lasix/ Mannitol infusion .
His urine output remained at 150 to 200 cc. an hour .
Despite this , his chest x-ray continued to show severe pulmonary edema and the clinical picture correlated .
He required anti-hypertensive therapy initially with Nipride which was changed to Hydralazine to avoid shunting .
He received several units of packed red blood cells to increase his hematocrit and oncotic pressure .
Very early in the morning on postoperative day # 3 , the patient became acutely hypoxic after several hours of marginal oxygenation with respiratory rates in the thirties and the patient was urgently intubated , without complication .
With positive pressure ventilation and continued diuresis , his arterial blood gases improved .
Throughout this he remained hemodynamically stable .
Exception was a ten beat run of ventricular tachycardia which was thought to be ischemic in origin and treated with nitrates and Lidocaine .
His chest x-ray blossomed to demonstrate pulmonary infiltrate and the patient began to produce sputum .
Infectious Disease consultation was obtained for evaluation of his purulent sputum and the patient was covered with Vancomycin , Ceftazidime and Gentamicin .
Cardiology evaluation commented on the patient 's increasing ventricular ectopy and suggested that these were due to an R and T phenomenon from his pacer in the setting of prolonged QT interval .
Consequently his Pronestyl was discontinued .
In addition , the patient was given magnesium to bring his level above 2 .
On the evening of the 18th , the patient continued to remain hemodynamically stable , although his oxygenation was clearly deteriorating and more marginal .
On 60% FIO2 his pO2 was 63 .
It was increased to 65% with pO2 of 81 .
At approximately 7:50 a.m. , house officer was called to the room for blood pressure of 70/40 with falling oxygen saturations .
The patient was immediately given 400 mg. of Calcium Chloride i.v. push and ventilator disconnected and the patient manually ventilated .
Within one minute , the patient lost his blood pressure and CPR was initiated and code was called .
The patient initially continued to have rhythm consistent with EMV and he was bolused with Levophed and given some volume while compressions continued .
The patient 's prothrombin time had been 23 early the same morning and tamponade was considered and thoracotomy instruments obtained .
The chest was opened partially and through sub-xyphoid area it was determined that there was no evidence of tamponade .
Compressions were continued and adequate pulse was felt and arterial blood gases demonstrated adequate oxygenation and perfusion .
The patient 's rhythm degenerated to ventricular tachycardia and he was shocked , initially without response but after several doses of Epinephine , one-half mg. of Atropine and a bolus of Lidocaine we were able to obtain a blood pressure and rhythm only briefly , and quickly deteriorated back to ventricular fibrillation .
Further attempts at resuscitation were unsuccessful and the patient was pronounced dead at 8:30 a.m.
The family has been notified and autopsy consent has been obtained .

His chest x-ray blossomed to demonstrate pulmonary infiltrate and the patient began to produce sputum .
Infectious Disease consultation was obtained for evaluation of his purulent sputum and the patient was covered with Vancomycin , Ceftazidime and Gentamicin .
Cardiology evaluation commented on the patient 's increasing ventricular ectopy and suggested that these were due to an R and T phenomenon from his pacer in the setting of prolonged QT interval .
Consequently his Pronestyl was discontinued .
In addition , the patient was given magnesium to bring his level above 2 .
On the evening of the 18th , the patient continued to remain hemodynamically stable , although his oxygenation was clearly deteriorating and more marginal .
On 60% FIO2 his pO2 was 63 .
It was increased to 65% with pO2 of 81 .
At approximately 7:50 a.m. , house officer was called to the room for blood pressure of 70/40 with falling oxygen saturations .
The patient was immediately given 400 mg. of Calcium Chloride i.v. push and ventilator disconnected and the patient manually ventilated .
Within one minute , the patient lost his blood pressure and CPR was initiated and code was called .
The patient initially continued to have rhythm consistent with EMV and he was bolused with Levophed and given some volume while compressions continued .
The patient 's prothrombin time had been 23 early the same morning and tamponade was considered and thoracotomy instruments obtained .
The chest was opened partially and through sub-xyphoid area it was determined that there was no evidence of tamponade .
Compressions were continued and adequate pulse was felt and arterial blood gases demonstrated adequate oxygenation and perfusion .
The patient 's rhythm degenerated to ventricular tachycardia and he was shocked , initially without response but after several doses of Epinephine , one-half mg. of Atropine and a bolus of Lidocaine we were able to obtain a blood pressure and rhythm only briefly , and quickly deteriorated back to ventricular fibrillation .
Further attempts at resuscitation were unsuccessful and the patient was pronounced dead at 8:30 a.m.
The family has been notified and autopsy consent has been obtained .

ADMISSION DATE :

DISCHARGE DATE :

CAUSE OF DEATH :
Cardiogenic shock .
CAUSATIVE FACTORS :
Including cardiomyopathy , aortic stenosis , status post aortic valve replacement , coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass grafting with congestive heart failure and pulmonary edema .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 65 year old male who sustained a small myocardial infarction first in 1978 , with course thereafter including a coronary artery bypass graft by Dr. Wierst ______________at Noughwell Entanbon Health in 1986 .
In 1991 he presented with congestive heart failure and he underwent porcine aortic valve replacement .
In the seven to eight months preceding admission , he developed recurrent angina with dyspnea on exertion .
The patient was admitted for cardiac catheterization in early December , 1993 .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Significant for vertebrobasilar insufficiency , bipolar mood disorder , and hypercholesterolemia , as well as some baseline renal insufficiency .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Procardia sustained release 60 mg. po q.day , Digoxin .25 mg. po q.day , Lasix 30 mg. ( interval unspecified ) , Prozac 40 mg. po q.day , Lovestatin 20 mg. po bid , aspirin q. day and supplemental potassium .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Remarkable for an oriented , alert male in no acute distress with decreased breath sounds at the right base consistent with effusion and a 3/6 systolic murmur consistent with aortic stenosis .
His pulse exam was intact .
Cardiac catheterization demonstrated elevated right and left-sided filling pressures at rest , with pulmonary hypertension and normal cardiac index .
There was severe aortic stenosis of 70 millimeter peak gradient , native three vessel disease with patent left internal mammary artery graft to the left circumflex , dissection of the left main was induced by the catheter tip .
A patent right internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending artery and diagonal was noted , and a patent saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery was present .
Also of note , pulmonary edema was induced by dye and anxiety and treated with Lasix , Morphine , oxygen and nitroglycerin .
Post-procedure he was admitted to the CCU because of the history of left main dissection .
He remained hemodynamically stable but of note , would not tolerate a transesophageal echo because of anxiety-he would not swallow the probe .
Transthoracic echo demonstrated gradients of 100 peak and 65 mean across the aortic valve and there was mild aortic insufficiency and ejection fraction was noted to be 18% with global hypokinesis .
The next several days were remarkable for events in which the patient was quite agitated and was evaluated by Psychiatry and treated with Ativan .
The patient was then evaluated by Cardiac Surgery for probable re-do aortic valve replacement and possible re-do coronary artery bypass grafting .
In the course of preoperative workup , Mr. Has was evaluated completely by Psychiatry with diagnoses including underlying chronic depression well-controlled on Prozac , underlying organ brain vulnerability of unclear etiology , possibly microvascular infarct , acute paranoid and belligerent behavior , possibly due to medications .
On December 12 the patient underwent surgery , including a re-do aortic valve replacement with # 25 St. Jude and re-do coronary artery bypass grafting times one ; saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery as a veno-venous jump graft .
The total bypass time :
2 hours 25 minutes .
Total crossclamp time :
1 hour and 48 minutes .
The patient was admitted to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit postoperatively with stable hemodynamics on Lidocaine at one , Dobutamine at 200 and Nipride .
The patient was extubated by postoperative day # 1 but was noted to be relatively hypoxemic with high oxygen requirement .
Chest x-ray demonstrating pulmonary edema .
Aggressive diuresis was undertaken and the patient responded , albeit sluggishly .
In addition , he remained agitated .
This was attributed to mild hypoxia and / or his underlying psychiatric diagnoses and he was treated with Haldol appropriately .
On day # 2 the patient continued to diurese and this was maintained with the Lasix/ Mannitol infusion .
His urine output remained at 150 to 200 cc. an hour .
Despite this , his chest x-ray continued to show severe pulmonary edema and the clinical picture correlated .
He required anti-hypertensive therapy initially with Nipride which was changed to Hydralazine to avoid shunting .
He received several units of packed red blood cells to increase his hematocrit and oncotic pressure .
Very early in the morning on postoperative day # 3 , the patient became acutely hypoxic after several hours of marginal oxygenation with respiratory rates in the thirties and the patient was urgently intubated , without complication .
With positive pressure ventilation and continued diuresis , his arterial blood gases improved .
Throughout this he remained hemodynamically stable .
Exception was a ten beat run of ventricular tachycardia which was thought to be ischemic in origin and treated with nitrates and Lidocaine .

Cardiogenic shock .
CAUSATIVE FACTORS :
Including cardiomyopathy , aortic stenosis , status post aortic valve replacement , coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass grafting with congestive heart failure and pulmonary edema .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 65 year old male who sustained a small myocardial infarction first in 1978 , with course thereafter including a coronary artery bypass graft by Dr. Wierst ______________at Noughwell Entanbon Health in 1986 .
In 1991 he presented with congestive heart failure and he underwent porcine aortic valve replacement .
In the seven to eight months preceding admission , he developed recurrent angina with dyspnea on exertion .
The patient was admitted for cardiac catheterization in early December , 1993 .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Significant for vertebrobasilar insufficiency , bipolar mood disorder , and hypercholesterolemia , as well as some baseline renal insufficiency .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Procardia sustained release 60 mg. po q.day , Digoxin .25 mg. po q.day , Lasix 30 mg. ( interval unspecified ) , Prozac 40 mg. po q.day , Lovestatin 20 mg. po bid , aspirin q. day and supplemental potassium .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Remarkable for an oriented , alert male in no acute distress with decreased breath sounds at the right base consistent with effusion and a 3/6 systolic murmur consistent with aortic stenosis .
His pulse exam was intact .
Cardiac catheterization demonstrated elevated right and left-sided filling pressures at rest , with pulmonary hypertension and normal cardiac index .
There was severe aortic stenosis of 70 millimeter peak gradient , native three vessel disease with patent left internal mammary artery graft to the left circumflex , dissection of the left main was induced by the catheter tip .
A patent right internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending artery and diagonal was noted , and a patent saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery was present .
Also of note , pulmonary edema was induced by dye and anxiety and treated with Lasix , Morphine , oxygen and nitroglycerin .
Post-procedure he was admitted to the CCU because of the history of left main dissection .
He remained hemodynamically stable but of note , would not tolerate a transesophageal echo because of anxiety-he would not swallow the probe .
Transthoracic echo demonstrated gradients of 100 peak and 65 mean across the aortic valve and there was mild aortic insufficiency and ejection fraction was noted to be 18% with global hypokinesis .
The next several days were remarkable for events in which the patient was quite agitated and was evaluated by Psychiatry and treated with Ativan .
The patient was then evaluated by Cardiac Surgery for probable re-do aortic valve replacement and possible re-do coronary artery bypass grafting .
In the course of preoperative workup , Mr. Has was evaluated completely by Psychiatry with diagnoses including underlying chronic depression well-controlled on Prozac , underlying organ brain vulnerability of unclear etiology , possibly microvascular infarct , acute paranoid and belligerent behavior , possibly due to medications .
On December 12 the patient underwent surgery , including a re-do aortic valve replacement with # 25 St. Jude and re-do coronary artery bypass grafting times one ; saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery as a veno-venous jump graft .
The total bypass time :
2 hours 25 minutes .
Total crossclamp time :
1 hour and 48 minutes .
The patient was admitted to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit postoperatively with stable hemodynamics on Lidocaine at one , Dobutamine at 200 and Nipride .
The patient was extubated by postoperative day # 1 but was noted to be relatively hypoxemic with high oxygen requirement .
Chest x-ray demonstrating pulmonary edema .
Aggressive diuresis was undertaken and the patient responded , albeit sluggishly .
In addition , he remained agitated .
This was attributed to mild hypoxia and / or his underlying psychiatric diagnoses and he was treated with Haldol appropriately .
On day # 2 the patient continued to diurese and this was maintained with the Lasix/ Mannitol infusion .
His urine output remained at 150 to 200 cc. an hour .
Despite this , his chest x-ray continued to show severe pulmonary edema and the clinical picture correlated .
He required anti-hypertensive therapy initially with Nipride which was changed to Hydralazine to avoid shunting .
He received several units of packed red blood cells to increase his hematocrit and oncotic pressure .
Very early in the morning on postoperative day # 3 , the patient became acutely hypoxic after several hours of marginal oxygenation with respiratory rates in the thirties and the patient was urgently intubated , without complication .
With positive pressure ventilation and continued diuresis , his arterial blood gases improved .
Throughout this he remained hemodynamically stable .
Exception was a ten beat run of ventricular tachycardia which was thought to be ischemic in origin and treated with nitrates and Lidocaine .
His chest x-ray blossomed to demonstrate pulmonary infiltrate and the patient began to produce sputum .
Infectious Disease consultation was obtained for evaluation of his purulent sputum and the patient was covered with Vancomycin , Ceftazidime and Gentamicin .
Cardiology evaluation commented on the patient 's increasing ventricular ectopy and suggested that these were due to an R and T phenomenon from his pacer in the setting of prolonged QT interval .
Consequently his Pronestyl was discontinued .
In addition , the patient was given magnesium to bring his level above 2 .
On the evening of the 18th , the patient continued to remain hemodynamically stable , although his oxygenation was clearly deteriorating and more marginal .
On 60% FIO2 his pO2 was 63 .
It was increased to 65% with pO2 of 81 .
At approximately 7:50 a.m. , house officer was called to the room for blood pressure of 70/40 with falling oxygen saturations .
The patient was immediately given 400 mg. of Calcium Chloride i.v. push and ventilator disconnected and the patient manually ventilated .
Within one minute , the patient lost his blood pressure and CPR was initiated and code was called .
The patient initially continued to have rhythm consistent with EMV and he was bolused with Levophed and given some volume while compressions continued .
The patient 's prothrombin time had been 23 early the same morning and tamponade was considered and thoracotomy instruments obtained .
The chest was opened partially and through sub-xyphoid area it was determined that there was no evidence of tamponade .
Compressions were continued and adequate pulse was felt and arterial blood gases demonstrated adequate oxygenation and perfusion .
The patient 's rhythm degenerated to ventricular tachycardia and he was shocked , initially without response but after several doses of Epinephine , one-half mg. of Atropine and a bolus of Lidocaine we were able to obtain a blood pressure and rhythm only briefly , and quickly deteriorated back to ventricular fibrillation .
Further attempts at resuscitation were unsuccessful and the patient was pronounced dead at 8:30 a.m.
The family has been notified and autopsy consent has been obtained .

1 hour and 48 minutes .
The patient was admitted to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit postoperatively with stable hemodynamics on Lidocaine at one , Dobutamine at 200 and Nipride .
The patient was extubated by postoperative day # 1 but was noted to be relatively hypoxemic with high oxygen requirement .
Chest x-ray demonstrating pulmonary edema .
Aggressive diuresis was undertaken and the patient responded , albeit sluggishly .
In addition , he remained agitated .
This was attributed to mild hypoxia and / or his underlying psychiatric diagnoses and he was treated with Haldol appropriately .
On day # 2 the patient continued to diurese and this was maintained with the Lasix/ Mannitol infusion .
His urine output remained at 150 to 200 cc. an hour .
Despite this , his chest x-ray continued to show severe pulmonary edema and the clinical picture correlated .
He required anti-hypertensive therapy initially with Nipride which was changed to Hydralazine to avoid shunting .
He received several units of packed red blood cells to increase his hematocrit and oncotic pressure .
Very early in the morning on postoperative day # 3 , the patient became acutely hypoxic after several hours of marginal oxygenation with respiratory rates in the thirties and the patient was urgently intubated , without complication .
With positive pressure ventilation and continued diuresis , his arterial blood gases improved .
Throughout this he remained hemodynamically stable .
Exception was a ten beat run of ventricular tachycardia which was thought to be ischemic in origin and treated with nitrates and Lidocaine .
His chest x-ray blossomed to demonstrate pulmonary infiltrate and the patient began to produce sputum .
Infectious Disease consultation was obtained for evaluation of his purulent sputum and the patient was covered with Vancomycin , Ceftazidime and Gentamicin .
Cardiology evaluation commented on the patient 's increasing ventricular ectopy and suggested that these were due to an R and T phenomenon from his pacer in the setting of prolonged QT interval .
Consequently his Pronestyl was discontinued .
In addition , the patient was given magnesium to bring his level above 2 .
On the evening of the 18th , the patient continued to remain hemodynamically stable , although his oxygenation was clearly deteriorating and more marginal .
On 60% FIO2 his pO2 was 63 .
It was increased to 65% with pO2 of 81 .
At approximately 7:50 a.m. , house officer was called to the room for blood pressure of 70/40 with falling oxygen saturations .
The patient was immediately given 400 mg. of Calcium Chloride i.v. push and ventilator disconnected and the patient manually ventilated .
Within one minute , the patient lost his blood pressure and CPR was initiated and code was called .
The patient initially continued to have rhythm consistent with EMV and he was bolused with Levophed and given some volume while compressions continued .
The patient 's prothrombin time had been 23 early the same morning and tamponade was considered and thoracotomy instruments obtained .
The chest was opened partially and through sub-xyphoid area it was determined that there was no evidence of tamponade .
Compressions were continued and adequate pulse was felt and arterial blood gases demonstrated adequate oxygenation and perfusion .
The patient 's rhythm degenerated to ventricular tachycardia and he was shocked , initially without response but after several doses of Epinephine , one-half mg. of Atropine and a bolus of Lidocaine we were able to obtain a blood pressure and rhythm only briefly , and quickly deteriorated back to ventricular fibrillation .
Further attempts at resuscitation were unsuccessful and the patient was pronounced dead at 8:30 a.m.
The family has been notified and autopsy consent has been obtained .

CAUSE OF DEATH :
Cardiogenic shock .
CAUSATIVE FACTORS :
Including cardiomyopathy , aortic stenosis , status post aortic valve replacement , coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass grafting with congestive heart failure and pulmonary edema .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 65 year old male who sustained a small myocardial infarction first in 1978 , with course thereafter including a coronary artery bypass graft by Dr. Wierst ______________at Noughwell Entanbon Health in 1986 .
In 1991 he presented with congestive heart failure and he underwent porcine aortic valve replacement .
In the seven to eight months preceding admission , he developed recurrent angina with dyspnea on exertion .
The patient was admitted for cardiac catheterization in early December , 1993 .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Significant for vertebrobasilar insufficiency , bipolar mood disorder , and hypercholesterolemia , as well as some baseline renal insufficiency .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Procardia sustained release 60 mg. po q.day , Digoxin .25 mg. po q.day , Lasix 30 mg. ( interval unspecified ) , Prozac 40 mg. po q.day , Lovestatin 20 mg. po bid , aspirin q. day and supplemental potassium .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Remarkable for an oriented , alert male in no acute distress with decreased breath sounds at the right base consistent with effusion and a 3/6 systolic murmur consistent with aortic stenosis .
His pulse exam was intact .
Cardiac catheterization demonstrated elevated right and left-sided filling pressures at rest , with pulmonary hypertension and normal cardiac index .
There was severe aortic stenosis of 70 millimeter peak gradient , native three vessel disease with patent left internal mammary artery graft to the left circumflex , dissection of the left main was induced by the catheter tip .
A patent right internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending artery and diagonal was noted , and a patent saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery was present .
Also of note , pulmonary edema was induced by dye and anxiety and treated with Lasix , Morphine , oxygen and nitroglycerin .
Post-procedure he was admitted to the CCU because of the history of left main dissection .
He remained hemodynamically stable but of note , would not tolerate a transesophageal echo because of anxiety-he would not swallow the probe .
Transthoracic echo demonstrated gradients of 100 peak and 65 mean across the aortic valve and there was mild aortic insufficiency and ejection fraction was noted to be 18% with global hypokinesis .
The next several days were remarkable for events in which the patient was quite agitated and was evaluated by Psychiatry and treated with Ativan .
The patient was then evaluated by Cardiac Surgery for probable re-do aortic valve replacement and possible re-do coronary artery bypass grafting .
In the course of preoperative workup , Mr. Has was evaluated completely by Psychiatry with diagnoses including underlying chronic depression well-controlled on Prozac , underlying organ brain vulnerability of unclear etiology , possibly microvascular infarct , acute paranoid and belligerent behavior , possibly due to medications .
On December 12 the patient underwent surgery , including a re-do aortic valve replacement with # 25 St. Jude and re-do coronary artery bypass grafting times one ; saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery as a veno-venous jump graft .
The total bypass time :
2 hours 25 minutes .

The patient 's rhythm degenerated to ventricular tachycardia and he was shocked , initially without response but after several doses of Epinephine , one-half mg. of Atropine and a bolus of Lidocaine we were able to obtain a blood pressure and rhythm only briefly , and quickly deteriorated back to ventricular fibrillation .
Further attempts at resuscitation were unsuccessful and the patient was pronounced dead at 8:30 a.m.
The family has been notified and autopsy consent has been obtained .

ADMISSION DATE :

DISCHARGE DATE :

CAUSE OF DEATH :
Cardiogenic shock .
CAUSATIVE FACTORS :
Including cardiomyopathy , aortic stenosis , status post aortic valve replacement , coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass grafting with congestive heart failure and pulmonary edema .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 65 year old male who sustained a small myocardial infarction first in 1978 , with course thereafter including a coronary artery bypass graft by Dr. Wierst ______________at Noughwell Entanbon Health in 1986 .
In 1991 he presented with congestive heart failure and he underwent porcine aortic valve replacement .
In the seven to eight months preceding admission , he developed recurrent angina with dyspnea on exertion .
The patient was admitted for cardiac catheterization in early December , 1993 .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Significant for vertebrobasilar insufficiency , bipolar mood disorder , and hypercholesterolemia , as well as some baseline renal insufficiency .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Procardia sustained release 60 mg. po q.day , Digoxin .25 mg. po q.day , Lasix 30 mg. ( interval unspecified ) , Prozac 40 mg. po q.day , Lovestatin 20 mg. po bid , aspirin q. day and supplemental potassium .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Remarkable for an oriented , alert male in no acute distress with decreased breath sounds at the right base consistent with effusion and a 3/6 systolic murmur consistent with aortic stenosis .
His pulse exam was intact .
Cardiac catheterization demonstrated elevated right and left-sided filling pressures at rest , with pulmonary hypertension and normal cardiac index .
There was severe aortic stenosis of 70 millimeter peak gradient , native three vessel disease with patent left internal mammary artery graft to the left circumflex , dissection of the left main was induced by the catheter tip .
A patent right internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending artery and diagonal was noted , and a patent saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery was present .
Also of note , pulmonary edema was induced by dye and anxiety and treated with Lasix , Morphine , oxygen and nitroglycerin .
Post-procedure he was admitted to the CCU because of the history of left main dissection .
He remained hemodynamically stable but of note , would not tolerate a transesophageal echo because of anxiety-he would not swallow the probe .
Transthoracic echo demonstrated gradients of 100 peak and 65 mean across the aortic valve and there was mild aortic insufficiency and ejection fraction was noted to be 18% with global hypokinesis .
The next several days were remarkable for events in which the patient was quite agitated and was evaluated by Psychiatry and treated with Ativan .
The patient was then evaluated by Cardiac Surgery for probable re-do aortic valve replacement and possible re-do coronary artery bypass grafting .
In the course of preoperative workup , Mr. Has was evaluated completely by Psychiatry with diagnoses including underlying chronic depression well-controlled on Prozac , underlying organ brain vulnerability of unclear etiology , possibly microvascular infarct , acute paranoid and belligerent behavior , possibly due to medications .
On December 12 the patient underwent surgery , including a re-do aortic valve replacement with # 25 St. Jude and re-do coronary artery bypass grafting times one ; saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery as a veno-venous jump graft .
The total bypass time :
2 hours 25 minutes .
Total crossclamp time :
1 hour and 48 minutes .
The patient was admitted to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit postoperatively with stable hemodynamics on Lidocaine at one , Dobutamine at 200 and Nipride .
The patient was extubated by postoperative day # 1 but was noted to be relatively hypoxemic with high oxygen requirement .
Chest x-ray demonstrating pulmonary edema .
Aggressive diuresis was undertaken and the patient responded , albeit sluggishly .
In addition , he remained agitated .
This was attributed to mild hypoxia and / or his underlying psychiatric diagnoses and he was treated with Haldol appropriately .
On day # 2 the patient continued to diurese and this was maintained with the Lasix/ Mannitol infusion .
His urine output remained at 150 to 200 cc. an hour .
Despite this , his chest x-ray continued to show severe pulmonary edema and the clinical picture correlated .
He required anti-hypertensive therapy initially with Nipride which was changed to Hydralazine to avoid shunting .
He received several units of packed red blood cells to increase his hematocrit and oncotic pressure .
Very early in the morning on postoperative day # 3 , the patient became acutely hypoxic after several hours of marginal oxygenation with respiratory rates in the thirties and the patient was urgently intubated , without complication .
With positive pressure ventilation and continued diuresis , his arterial blood gases improved .
Throughout this he remained hemodynamically stable .
Exception was a ten beat run of ventricular tachycardia which was thought to be ischemic in origin and treated with nitrates and Lidocaine .
His chest x-ray blossomed to demonstrate pulmonary infiltrate and the patient began to produce sputum .
Infectious Disease consultation was obtained for evaluation of his purulent sputum and the patient was covered with Vancomycin , Ceftazidime and Gentamicin .
Cardiology evaluation commented on the patient 's increasing ventricular ectopy and suggested that these were due to an R and T phenomenon from his pacer in the setting of prolonged QT interval .
Consequently his Pronestyl was discontinued .
In addition , the patient was given magnesium to bring his level above 2 .
On the evening of the 18th , the patient continued to remain hemodynamically stable , although his oxygenation was clearly deteriorating and more marginal .
On 60% FIO2 his pO2 was 63 .
It was increased to 65% with pO2 of 81 .
At approximately 7:50 a.m. , house officer was called to the room for blood pressure of 70/40 with falling oxygen saturations .
The patient was immediately given 400 mg. of Calcium Chloride i.v. push and ventilator disconnected and the patient manually ventilated .
Within one minute , the patient lost his blood pressure and CPR was initiated and code was called .
The patient initially continued to have rhythm consistent with EMV and he was bolused with Levophed and given some volume while compressions continued .
The patient 's prothrombin time had been 23 early the same morning and tamponade was considered and thoracotomy instruments obtained .
The chest was opened partially and through sub-xyphoid area it was determined that there was no evidence of tamponade .
Compressions were continued and adequate pulse was felt and arterial blood gases demonstrated adequate oxygenation and perfusion .
The patient 's rhythm degenerated to ventricular tachycardia and he was shocked , initially without response but after several doses of Epinephine , one-half mg. of Atropine and a bolus of Lidocaine we were able to obtain a blood pressure and rhythm only briefly , and quickly deteriorated back to ventricular fibrillation .

There was severe aortic stenosis of 70 millimeter peak gradient , native three vessel disease with patent left internal mammary artery graft to the left circumflex , dissection of the left main was induced by the catheter tip .
A patent right internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending artery and diagonal was noted , and a patent saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery was present .
Also of note , pulmonary edema was induced by dye and anxiety and treated with Lasix , Morphine , oxygen and nitroglycerin .
Post-procedure he was admitted to the CCU because of the history of left main dissection .
He remained hemodynamically stable but of note , would not tolerate a transesophageal echo because of anxiety-he would not swallow the probe .
Transthoracic echo demonstrated gradients of 100 peak and 65 mean across the aortic valve and there was mild aortic insufficiency and ejection fraction was noted to be 18% with global hypokinesis .
The next several days were remarkable for events in which the patient was quite agitated and was evaluated by Psychiatry and treated with Ativan .
The patient was then evaluated by Cardiac Surgery for probable re-do aortic valve replacement and possible re-do coronary artery bypass grafting .
In the course of preoperative workup , Mr. Has was evaluated completely by Psychiatry with diagnoses including underlying chronic depression well-controlled on Prozac , underlying organ brain vulnerability of unclear etiology , possibly microvascular infarct , acute paranoid and belligerent behavior , possibly due to medications .
On December 12 the patient underwent surgery , including a re-do aortic valve replacement with # 25 St. Jude and re-do coronary artery bypass grafting times one ; saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery as a veno-venous jump graft .
The total bypass time :
2 hours 25 minutes .
Total crossclamp time :
1 hour and 48 minutes .
The patient was admitted to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit postoperatively with stable hemodynamics on Lidocaine at one , Dobutamine at 200 and Nipride .
The patient was extubated by postoperative day # 1 but was noted to be relatively hypoxemic with high oxygen requirement .
Chest x-ray demonstrating pulmonary edema .
Aggressive diuresis was undertaken and the patient responded , albeit sluggishly .
In addition , he remained agitated .
This was attributed to mild hypoxia and / or his underlying psychiatric diagnoses and he was treated with Haldol appropriately .
On day # 2 the patient continued to diurese and this was maintained with the Lasix/ Mannitol infusion .
His urine output remained at 150 to 200 cc. an hour .
Despite this , his chest x-ray continued to show severe pulmonary edema and the clinical picture correlated .
He required anti-hypertensive therapy initially with Nipride which was changed to Hydralazine to avoid shunting .
He received several units of packed red blood cells to increase his hematocrit and oncotic pressure .
Very early in the morning on postoperative day # 3 , the patient became acutely hypoxic after several hours of marginal oxygenation with respiratory rates in the thirties and the patient was urgently intubated , without complication .
With positive pressure ventilation and continued diuresis , his arterial blood gases improved .
Throughout this he remained hemodynamically stable .
Exception was a ten beat run of ventricular tachycardia which was thought to be ischemic in origin and treated with nitrates and Lidocaine .
His chest x-ray blossomed to demonstrate pulmonary infiltrate and the patient began to produce sputum .
Infectious Disease consultation was obtained for evaluation of his purulent sputum and the patient was covered with Vancomycin , Ceftazidime and Gentamicin .
Cardiology evaluation commented on the patient 's increasing ventricular ectopy and suggested that these were due to an R and T phenomenon from his pacer in the setting of prolonged QT interval .
Consequently his Pronestyl was discontinued .
In addition , the patient was given magnesium to bring his level above 2 .
On the evening of the 18th , the patient continued to remain hemodynamically stable , although his oxygenation was clearly deteriorating and more marginal .
On 60% FIO2 his pO2 was 63 .
It was increased to 65% with pO2 of 81 .
At approximately 7:50 a.m. , house officer was called to the room for blood pressure of 70/40 with falling oxygen saturations .
The patient was immediately given 400 mg. of Calcium Chloride i.v. push and ventilator disconnected and the patient manually ventilated .
Within one minute , the patient lost his blood pressure and CPR was initiated and code was called .
The patient initially continued to have rhythm consistent with EMV and he was bolused with Levophed and given some volume while compressions continued .
The patient 's prothrombin time had been 23 early the same morning and tamponade was considered and thoracotomy instruments obtained .
The chest was opened partially and through sub-xyphoid area it was determined that there was no evidence of tamponade .
Compressions were continued and adequate pulse was felt and arterial blood gases demonstrated adequate oxygenation and perfusion .
The patient 's rhythm degenerated to ventricular tachycardia and he was shocked , initially without response but after several doses of Epinephine , one-half mg. of Atropine and a bolus of Lidocaine we were able to obtain a blood pressure and rhythm only briefly , and quickly deteriorated back to ventricular fibrillation .
Further attempts at resuscitation were unsuccessful and the patient was pronounced dead at 8:30 a.m.
The family has been notified and autopsy consent has been obtained .

UNIT NUMBER :

ADMISSION DATE :
02/02/2003
DISCHARGE DATE :
02/09/2003
CHIEF COMPLAINT :
Left hip pain .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient was seen by Dr. Overall in the office on Aug 22 , 2003 , for follow-up .
She was scheduled to have a total hi p replacement because of progressively worsening pain in the left hip .
Her pain was 8/10 .
She limped .
She did not use a cane .
She did require a bannister going up and down stairs .
She had trouble doing shoes and socks .
She could walk limited distances .
Since seen by Dr. Overall in August , she had had a brain aneurysm .
She had a mastectomy and had recently developed Parkinson 's.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
1. Breast cancer in the right breast , diagnosed in 1995 with negative nodes , treated with excision , recurrence in June , 2001 , further reconstructive surgery .
At the same time , she underwent reduction of t he left breast .
2. History of bipolar disorder , for which she sees Dr. Lettefriscbreun .
She indicates this is stable at this time .
3. History of chronic anxiety .
4. Sleep apnea treated with UPP surgery in 1997 .
She does not use CPAP .
5. History of diverticulitis .
6. Intermittent migraines .
7. History of prior cervical dysplasia , treated with LEEP procedure .
8. Osteoporosis .
9. Obsessive-compulsive disorder .
10. Panic disorder .
11. Aneurysm of the right internal auditory canal , treated with coil insertion .
12. Prior renal surgery .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
1. Eskalith , 300 mg. twice at bedtime .
2. Femara , 2.5 mg. at bedtime .
3. Primidone , 50 mg. PO q.h.s.
4. Diazepam , 1 mg. PO q.h.s.
5. Paxil , 37.5 mg. q.a.m.
6. Synthroid , 100 mcg. q.a.m.
7. Ditropan XL , 10 mg.
8. Imodium , 2 mg. q.a.m.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Examination reveals that the patient is walking with a mild limp .
The left hip is a bit stiff with flexion to 90 degrees .
She has 10 degrees of internal rotation and external rotation .
Pulses are fine .
IMAGING :
X-rays were reviewed .
They showed advanced arthritis of the left hip .
RECOMMENDATIONS :
Dr. Etteme Overall recommended that the patient have a total hip replacement on the left side on February 2 , 2003 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Please refer to the operative note by Dr. Etteme Overall for details of the procedure .
Postoperatively , the patient was transferred to the floor in stable condition for observation , pain control and mobilization .
Initially postoperatively , she was doing quite well , though she did require four liters of oxygen postoperatively to maintain her oxygen saturations .
It was hoped that she would wean off the oxygen over the course of the next few hours .
However , she did require four liters of oxygen all the way through the night to maintain oxygen saturations of 93% .
Without oxygen , she dropped down to the low 80s .
Given the unusual nature of this oxygen requirement , the patient underwent work-up with a chest X-ray , which essentially was normal .
An ABG revealed a normal PCO2 of 32 , but a decrease in PO2- at 62 .
Therefore , given her history of breast cancer , the patient was taken for a spiral CT scan and the Medicine Service was consulted at that time .
They agreed with our plan .
On spiral CT scan , a small pulmonary embolus was seen in the right upper lobe and the left low er lobe .
She was started on heparin at that time to maintain a PTT of 60 t o 80 , and was given doses of Coumadin , in addition to the Coumadin she had been given for DVT prophylaxis .
With the recommendation of the medicine te am , we decided to maintain an INR of 2 to 3 with an overlap of heparin when the patient was therapeutic for two to three days .
She continued to do quite well even though we did keep her on bed rest for three days while she was heparinized .
Her oxygen saturations continued to improve to the point that she was on room air on postoperative day four with oxygen saturation of 95% .
She was given perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis for 48 hours after surgery .
She was mobilized on postoperative day four , getting out of bed , able to do quite well on her new hip with a minimal amount of pain .
She was given posterior hip dislocation precautions at that time , which she understood quite well .
She continued to be followed by the medical team and was watched very closely by the orthopedic team until we felt comfortable that she was breathing quite well and was mobilizing well with physical therapy .
Therefore , it was decided at that time that the patient was ready for discharge to rehabilitation on Coumadin , which would be monitored for six months to maintain an INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
The patient will continue all of her pre-admission medications , though no nonsteroidal analgesics , e.g. , aspirin or ibuprofen , will be given while she is on Coumadin therapy .
1. Colace , 100 mg. PO t.i.d.
2. Percocet , one to two tablets PO q.3 to 4 hours p.r.n. pain .
3. Coumadin with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .
Please prescribe 2 mg. tablets .
The patient will be on Coumadin for six months given her history of pulmonary embolus .
DISCHARGE PLAN :
Coumadin for six months postoperatively with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .
Check INR three times a week until stable .
Please call the results to Dr. Viennee Ester , the patient 's primary-care physician , who has agreed to follow her INR levels for the remainder of the six months .
Dr. Viennee Ester is located in Tlandcousti Lo Vuclark , where the patient is from originally .
The patient will call Dr. Overall 's office to arrange a follow-up appointment six weeks from the day of surgery .
Staples can be removed 10 to 14 days postoperatively .
Please hold removal if the wound is draining .
The patient may shower once the incision is dry , and may bathe and / or swim after the staples have been removed and there is no wound drainage .
Partial weight-bearing with crutches or a walker with posterior hip dislocation precautions for three months following surgery .
These precautions have been explained and demonstrated to the patient .
The patient has been instructed to call Dr. Overall 's office or the orthopedist on call with any questions or concerns about increasing pain , swelling , redness , wound drainage , fevers or chills at 094-897-3231 .

CHIEF COMPLAINT :
Left hip pain .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient was seen by Dr. Overall in the office on Aug 22 , 2003 , for follow-up .
She was scheduled to have a total hi p replacement because of progressively worsening pain in the left hip .
Her pain was 8/10 .
She limped .
She did not use a cane .
She did require a bannister going up and down stairs .
She had trouble doing shoes and socks .
She could walk limited distances .
Since seen by Dr. Overall in August , she had had a brain aneurysm .
She had a mastectomy and had recently developed Parkinson 's.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
1. Breast cancer in the right breast , diagnosed in 1995 with negative nodes , treated with excision , recurrence in June , 2001 , further reconstructive surgery .
At the same time , she underwent reduction of t he left breast .
2. History of bipolar disorder , for which she sees Dr. Lettefriscbreun .
She indicates this is stable at this time .
3. History of chronic anxiety .
4. Sleep apnea treated with UPP surgery in 1997 .
She does not use CPAP .
5. History of diverticulitis .
6. Intermittent migraines .
7. History of prior cervical dysplasia , treated with LEEP procedure .
8. Osteoporosis .
9. Obsessive-compulsive disorder .
10. Panic disorder .
11. Aneurysm of the right internal auditory canal , treated with coil insertion .
12. Prior renal surgery .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
1. Eskalith , 300 mg. twice at bedtime .
2. Femara , 2.5 mg. at bedtime .
3. Primidone , 50 mg. PO q.h.s.
4. Diazepam , 1 mg. PO q.h.s.
5. Paxil , 37.5 mg. q.a.m.
6. Synthroid , 100 mcg. q.a.m.
7. Ditropan XL , 10 mg.
8. Imodium , 2 mg. q.a.m.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Examination reveals that the patient is walking with a mild limp .
The left hip is a bit stiff with flexion to 90 degrees .
She has 10 degrees of internal rotation and external rotation .
Pulses are fine .
IMAGING :
X-rays were reviewed .
They showed advanced arthritis of the left hip .
RECOMMENDATIONS :
Dr. Etteme Overall recommended that the patient have a total hip replacement on the left side on February 2 , 2003 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Please refer to the operative note by Dr. Etteme Overall for details of the procedure .
Postoperatively , the patient was transferred to the floor in stable condition for observation , pain control and mobilization .
Initially postoperatively , she was doing quite well , though she did require four liters of oxygen postoperatively to maintain her oxygen saturations .
It was hoped that she would wean off the oxygen over the course of the next few hours .
However , she did require four liters of oxygen all the way through the night to maintain oxygen saturations of 93% .
Without oxygen , she dropped down to the low 80s .
Given the unusual nature of this oxygen requirement , the patient underwent work-up with a chest X-ray , which essentially was normal .
An ABG revealed a normal PCO2 of 32 , but a decrease in PO2- at 62 .
Therefore , given her history of breast cancer , the patient was taken for a spiral CT scan and the Medicine Service was consulted at that time .
They agreed with our plan .
On spiral CT scan , a small pulmonary embolus was seen in the right upper lobe and the left low er lobe .
She was started on heparin at that time to maintain a PTT of 60 t o 80 , and was given doses of Coumadin , in addition to the Coumadin she had been given for DVT prophylaxis .
With the recommendation of the medicine te am , we decided to maintain an INR of 2 to 3 with an overlap of heparin when the patient was therapeutic for two to three days .
She continued to do quite well even though we did keep her on bed rest for three days while she was heparinized .
Her oxygen saturations continued to improve to the point that she was on room air on postoperative day four with oxygen saturation of 95% .
She was given perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis for 48 hours after surgery .
She was mobilized on postoperative day four , getting out of bed , able to do quite well on her new hip with a minimal amount of pain .
She was given posterior hip dislocation precautions at that time , which she understood quite well .
She continued to be followed by the medical team and was watched very closely by the orthopedic team until we felt comfortable that she was breathing quite well and was mobilizing well with physical therapy .
Therefore , it was decided at that time that the patient was ready for discharge to rehabilitation on Coumadin , which would be monitored for six months to maintain an INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
The patient will continue all of her pre-admission medications , though no nonsteroidal analgesics , e.g. , aspirin or ibuprofen , will be given while she is on Coumadin therapy .
1. Colace , 100 mg. PO t.i.d.

She continued to be followed by the medical team and was watched very closely by the orthopedic team until we felt comfortable that she was breathing quite well and was mobilizing well with physical therapy .
Therefore , it was decided at that time that the patient was ready for discharge to rehabilitation on Coumadin , which would be monitored for six months to maintain an INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
The patient will continue all of her pre-admission medications , though no nonsteroidal analgesics , e.g. , aspirin or ibuprofen , will be given while she is on Coumadin therapy .
1. Colace , 100 mg. PO t.i.d.
2. Percocet , one to two tablets PO q.3 to 4 hours p.r.n. pain .
3. Coumadin with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .
Please prescribe 2 mg. tablets .
The patient will be on Coumadin for six months given her history of pulmonary embolus .
DISCHARGE PLAN :
Coumadin for six months postoperatively with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .
Check INR three times a week until stable .
Please call the results to Dr. Viennee Ester , the patient 's primary-care physician , who has agreed to follow her INR levels for the remainder of the six months .
Dr. Viennee Ester is located in Tlandcousti Lo Vuclark , where the patient is from originally .
The patient will call Dr. Overall 's office to arrange a follow-up appointment six weeks from the day of surgery .
Staples can be removed 10 to 14 days postoperatively .
Please hold removal if the wound is draining .
The patient may shower once the incision is dry , and may bathe and / or swim after the staples have been removed and there is no wound drainage .
Partial weight-bearing with crutches or a walker with posterior hip dislocation precautions for three months following surgery .
These precautions have been explained and demonstrated to the patient .
The patient has been instructed to call Dr. Overall 's office or the orthopedist on call with any questions or concerns about increasing pain , swelling , redness , wound drainage , fevers or chills at 094-897-3231 .

CHIEF COMPLAINT :
Left hip pain .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient was seen by Dr. Overall in the office on Aug 22 , 2003 , for follow-up .
She was scheduled to have a total hi p replacement because of progressively worsening pain in the left hip .
Her pain was 8/10 .
She limped .
She did not use a cane .
She did require a bannister going up and down stairs .
She had trouble doing shoes and socks .
She could walk limited distances .
Since seen by Dr. Overall in August , she had had a brain aneurysm .
She had a mastectomy and had recently developed Parkinson 's.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
1. Breast cancer in the right breast , diagnosed in 1995 with negative nodes , treated with excision , recurrence in June , 2001 , further reconstructive surgery .
At the same time , she underwent reduction of t he left breast .
2. History of bipolar disorder , for which she sees Dr. Lettefriscbreun .
She indicates this is stable at this time .
3. History of chronic anxiety .
4. Sleep apnea treated with UPP surgery in 1997 .
She does not use CPAP .
5. History of diverticulitis .
6. Intermittent migraines .
7. History of prior cervical dysplasia , treated with LEEP procedure .
8. Osteoporosis .
9. Obsessive-compulsive disorder .
10. Panic disorder .
11. Aneurysm of the right internal auditory canal , treated with coil insertion .
12. Prior renal surgery .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
1. Eskalith , 300 mg. twice at bedtime .
2. Femara , 2.5 mg. at bedtime .
3. Primidone , 50 mg. PO q.h.s.
4. Diazepam , 1 mg. PO q.h.s.
5. Paxil , 37.5 mg. q.a.m.
6. Synthroid , 100 mcg. q.a.m.
7. Ditropan XL , 10 mg.
8. Imodium , 2 mg. q.a.m.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Examination reveals that the patient is walking with a mild limp .
The left hip is a bit stiff with flexion to 90 degrees .
She has 10 degrees of internal rotation and external rotation .
Pulses are fine .
IMAGING :
X-rays were reviewed .
They showed advanced arthritis of the left hip .
RECOMMENDATIONS :
Dr. Etteme Overall recommended that the patient have a total hip replacement on the left side on February 2 , 2003 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Please refer to the operative note by Dr. Etteme Overall for details of the procedure .
Postoperatively , the patient was transferred to the floor in stable condition for observation , pain control and mobilization .
Initially postoperatively , she was doing quite well , though she did require four liters of oxygen postoperatively to maintain her oxygen saturations .
It was hoped that she would wean off the oxygen over the course of the next few hours .
However , she did require four liters of oxygen all the way through the night to maintain oxygen saturations of 93% .
Without oxygen , she dropped down to the low 80s .
Given the unusual nature of this oxygen requirement , the patient underwent work-up with a chest X-ray , which essentially was normal .
An ABG revealed a normal PCO2 of 32 , but a decrease in PO2- at 62 .
Therefore , given her history of breast cancer , the patient was taken for a spiral CT scan and the Medicine Service was consulted at that time .
They agreed with our plan .
On spiral CT scan , a small pulmonary embolus was seen in the right upper lobe and the left low er lobe .
She was started on heparin at that time to maintain a PTT of 60 t o 80 , and was given doses of Coumadin , in addition to the Coumadin she had been given for DVT prophylaxis .
With the recommendation of the medicine te am , we decided to maintain an INR of 2 to 3 with an overlap of heparin when the patient was therapeutic for two to three days .
She continued to do quite well even though we did keep her on bed rest for three days while she was heparinized .
Her oxygen saturations continued to improve to the point that she was on room air on postoperative day four with oxygen saturation of 95% .
She was given perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis for 48 hours after surgery .
She was mobilized on postoperative day four , getting out of bed , able to do quite well on her new hip with a minimal amount of pain .
She was given posterior hip dislocation precautions at that time , which she understood quite well .
She continued to be followed by the medical team and was watched very closely by the orthopedic team until we felt comfortable that she was breathing quite well and was mobilizing well with physical therapy .

With the recommendation of the medicine te am , we decided to maintain an INR of 2 to 3 with an overlap of heparin when the patient was therapeutic for two to three days .
She continued to do quite well even though we did keep her on bed rest for three days while she was heparinized .
Her oxygen saturations continued to improve to the point that she was on room air on postoperative day four with oxygen saturation of 95% .
She was given perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis for 48 hours after surgery .
She was mobilized on postoperative day four , getting out of bed , able to do quite well on her new hip with a minimal amount of pain .
She was given posterior hip dislocation precautions at that time , which she understood quite well .
She continued to be followed by the medical team and was watched very closely by the orthopedic team until we felt comfortable that she was breathing quite well and was mobilizing well with physical therapy .
Therefore , it was decided at that time that the patient was ready for discharge to rehabilitation on Coumadin , which would be monitored for six months to maintain an INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
The patient will continue all of her pre-admission medications , though no nonsteroidal analgesics , e.g. , aspirin or ibuprofen , will be given while she is on Coumadin therapy .
1. Colace , 100 mg. PO t.i.d.
2. Percocet , one to two tablets PO q.3 to 4 hours p.r.n. pain .
3. Coumadin with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .
Please prescribe 2 mg. tablets .
The patient will be on Coumadin for six months given her history of pulmonary embolus .
DISCHARGE PLAN :
Coumadin for six months postoperatively with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .
Check INR three times a week until stable .
Please call the results to Dr. Viennee Ester , the patient 's primary-care physician , who has agreed to follow her INR levels for the remainder of the six months .
Dr. Viennee Ester is located in Tlandcousti Lo Vuclark , where the patient is from originally .
The patient will call Dr. Overall 's office to arrange a follow-up appointment six weeks from the day of surgery .
Staples can be removed 10 to 14 days postoperatively .
Please hold removal if the wound is draining .
The patient may shower once the incision is dry , and may bathe and / or swim after the staples have been removed and there is no wound drainage .
Partial weight-bearing with crutches or a walker with posterior hip dislocation precautions for three months following surgery .
These precautions have been explained and demonstrated to the patient .
The patient has been instructed to call Dr. Overall 's office or the orthopedist on call with any questions or concerns about increasing pain , swelling , redness , wound drainage , fevers or chills at 094-897-3231 .

CHIEF COMPLAINT :
Left hip pain .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient was seen by Dr. Overall in the office on Aug 22 , 2003 , for follow-up .
She was scheduled to have a total hi p replacement because of progressively worsening pain in the left hip .
Her pain was 8/10 .
She limped .
She did not use a cane .
She did require a bannister going up and down stairs .
She had trouble doing shoes and socks .
She could walk limited distances .
Since seen by Dr. Overall in August , she had had a brain aneurysm .
She had a mastectomy and had recently developed Parkinson 's.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
1. Breast cancer in the right breast , diagnosed in 1995 with negative nodes , treated with excision , recurrence in June , 2001 , further reconstructive surgery .
At the same time , she underwent reduction of t he left breast .
2. History of bipolar disorder , for which she sees Dr. Lettefriscbreun .
She indicates this is stable at this time .
3. History of chronic anxiety .
4. Sleep apnea treated with UPP surgery in 1997 .
She does not use CPAP .
5. History of diverticulitis .
6. Intermittent migraines .
7. History of prior cervical dysplasia , treated with LEEP procedure .
8. Osteoporosis .
9. Obsessive-compulsive disorder .
10. Panic disorder .
11. Aneurysm of the right internal auditory canal , treated with coil insertion .
12. Prior renal surgery .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
1. Eskalith , 300 mg. twice at bedtime .
2. Femara , 2.5 mg. at bedtime .
3. Primidone , 50 mg. PO q.h.s.
4. Diazepam , 1 mg. PO q.h.s.
5. Paxil , 37.5 mg. q.a.m.
6. Synthroid , 100 mcg. q.a.m.
7. Ditropan XL , 10 mg.
8. Imodium , 2 mg. q.a.m.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Examination reveals that the patient is walking with a mild limp .
The left hip is a bit stiff with flexion to 90 degrees .
She has 10 degrees of internal rotation and external rotation .
Pulses are fine .
IMAGING :
X-rays were reviewed .
They showed advanced arthritis of the left hip .
RECOMMENDATIONS :
Dr. Etteme Overall recommended that the patient have a total hip replacement on the left side on February 2 , 2003 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Please refer to the operative note by Dr. Etteme Overall for details of the procedure .
Postoperatively , the patient was transferred to the floor in stable condition for observation , pain control and mobilization .
Initially postoperatively , she was doing quite well , though she did require four liters of oxygen postoperatively to maintain her oxygen saturations .
It was hoped that she would wean off the oxygen over the course of the next few hours .
However , she did require four liters of oxygen all the way through the night to maintain oxygen saturations of 93% .
Without oxygen , she dropped down to the low 80s .
Given the unusual nature of this oxygen requirement , the patient underwent work-up with a chest X-ray , which essentially was normal .
An ABG revealed a normal PCO2 of 32 , but a decrease in PO2- at 62 .
Therefore , given her history of breast cancer , the patient was taken for a spiral CT scan and the Medicine Service was consulted at that time .
They agreed with our plan .
On spiral CT scan , a small pulmonary embolus was seen in the right upper lobe and the left low er lobe .
She was started on heparin at that time to maintain a PTT of 60 t o 80 , and was given doses of Coumadin , in addition to the Coumadin she had been given for DVT prophylaxis .

Given the unusual nature of this oxygen requirement , the patient underwent work-up with a chest X-ray , which essentially was normal .
An ABG revealed a normal PCO2 of 32 , but a decrease in PO2- at 62 .
Therefore , given her history of breast cancer , the patient was taken for a spiral CT scan and the Medicine Service was consulted at that time .
They agreed with our plan .
On spiral CT scan , a small pulmonary embolus was seen in the right upper lobe and the left low er lobe .
She was started on heparin at that time to maintain a PTT of 60 t o 80 , and was given doses of Coumadin , in addition to the Coumadin she had been given for DVT prophylaxis .
With the recommendation of the medicine te am , we decided to maintain an INR of 2 to 3 with an overlap of heparin when the patient was therapeutic for two to three days .
She continued to do quite well even though we did keep her on bed rest for three days while she was heparinized .
Her oxygen saturations continued to improve to the point that she was on room air on postoperative day four with oxygen saturation of 95% .
She was given perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis for 48 hours after surgery .
She was mobilized on postoperative day four , getting out of bed , able to do quite well on her new hip with a minimal amount of pain .
She was given posterior hip dislocation precautions at that time , which she understood quite well .
She continued to be followed by the medical team and was watched very closely by the orthopedic team until we felt comfortable that she was breathing quite well and was mobilizing well with physical therapy .
Therefore , it was decided at that time that the patient was ready for discharge to rehabilitation on Coumadin , which would be monitored for six months to maintain an INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
The patient will continue all of her pre-admission medications , though no nonsteroidal analgesics , e.g. , aspirin or ibuprofen , will be given while she is on Coumadin therapy .
1. Colace , 100 mg. PO t.i.d.
2. Percocet , one to two tablets PO q.3 to 4 hours p.r.n. pain .
3. Coumadin with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .
Please prescribe 2 mg. tablets .
The patient will be on Coumadin for six months given her history of pulmonary embolus .
DISCHARGE PLAN :
Coumadin for six months postoperatively with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .
Check INR three times a week until stable .
Please call the results to Dr. Viennee Ester , the patient 's primary-care physician , who has agreed to follow her INR levels for the remainder of the six months .
Dr. Viennee Ester is located in Tlandcousti Lo Vuclark , where the patient is from originally .
The patient will call Dr. Overall 's office to arrange a follow-up appointment six weeks from the day of surgery .
Staples can be removed 10 to 14 days postoperatively .
Please hold removal if the wound is draining .
The patient may shower once the incision is dry , and may bathe and / or swim after the staples have been removed and there is no wound drainage .
Partial weight-bearing with crutches or a walker with posterior hip dislocation precautions for three months following surgery .
These precautions have been explained and demonstrated to the patient .
The patient has been instructed to call Dr. Overall 's office or the orthopedist on call with any questions or concerns about increasing pain , swelling , redness , wound drainage , fevers or chills at 094-897-3231 .

Please refer to the operative note by Dr. Etteme Overall for details of the procedure .
Postoperatively , the patient was transferred to the floor in stable condition for observation , pain control and mobilization .
Initially postoperatively , she was doing quite well , though she did require four liters of oxygen postoperatively to maintain her oxygen saturations .
It was hoped that she would wean off the oxygen over the course of the next few hours .
However , she did require four liters of oxygen all the way through the night to maintain oxygen saturations of 93% .
Without oxygen , she dropped down to the low 80s .
Given the unusual nature of this oxygen requirement , the patient underwent work-up with a chest X-ray , which essentially was normal .
An ABG revealed a normal PCO2 of 32 , but a decrease in PO2- at 62 .
Therefore , given her history of breast cancer , the patient was taken for a spiral CT scan and the Medicine Service was consulted at that time .
They agreed with our plan .
On spiral CT scan , a small pulmonary embolus was seen in the right upper lobe and the left low er lobe .
She was started on heparin at that time to maintain a PTT of 60 t o 80 , and was given doses of Coumadin , in addition to the Coumadin she had been given for DVT prophylaxis .
With the recommendation of the medicine te am , we decided to maintain an INR of 2 to 3 with an overlap of heparin when the patient was therapeutic for two to three days .
She continued to do quite well even though we did keep her on bed rest for three days while she was heparinized .
Her oxygen saturations continued to improve to the point that she was on room air on postoperative day four with oxygen saturation of 95% .
She was given perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis for 48 hours after surgery .
She was mobilized on postoperative day four , getting out of bed , able to do quite well on her new hip with a minimal amount of pain .
She was given posterior hip dislocation precautions at that time , which she understood quite well .
She continued to be followed by the medical team and was watched very closely by the orthopedic team until we felt comfortable that she was breathing quite well and was mobilizing well with physical therapy .
Therefore , it was decided at that time that the patient was ready for discharge to rehabilitation on Coumadin , which would be monitored for six months to maintain an INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
The patient will continue all of her pre-admission medications , though no nonsteroidal analgesics , e.g. , aspirin or ibuprofen , will be given while she is on Coumadin therapy .
1. Colace , 100 mg. PO t.i.d.
2. Percocet , one to two tablets PO q.3 to 4 hours p.r.n. pain .
3. Coumadin with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .
Please prescribe 2 mg. tablets .
The patient will be on Coumadin for six months given her history of pulmonary embolus .
DISCHARGE PLAN :
Coumadin for six months postoperatively with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .
Check INR three times a week until stable .
Please call the results to Dr. Viennee Ester , the patient 's primary-care physician , who has agreed to follow her INR levels for the remainder of the six months .
Dr. Viennee Ester is located in Tlandcousti Lo Vuclark , where the patient is from originally .
The patient will call Dr. Overall 's office to arrange a follow-up appointment six weeks from the day of surgery .
Staples can be removed 10 to 14 days postoperatively .
Please hold removal if the wound is draining .
The patient may shower once the incision is dry , and may bathe and / or swim after the staples have been removed and there is no wound drainage .
Partial weight-bearing with crutches or a walker with posterior hip dislocation precautions for three months following surgery .
These precautions have been explained and demonstrated to the patient .
The patient has been instructed to call Dr. Overall 's office or the orthopedist on call with any questions or concerns about increasing pain , swelling , redness , wound drainage , fevers or chills at 094-897-3231 .

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Examination reveals that the patient is walking with a mild limp .
The left hip is a bit stiff with flexion to 90 degrees .
She has 10 degrees of internal rotation and external rotation .
Pulses are fine .
IMAGING :
X-rays were reviewed .
They showed advanced arthritis of the left hip .
RECOMMENDATIONS :
Dr. Etteme Overall recommended that the patient have a total hip replacement on the left side on February 2 , 2003 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Please refer to the operative note by Dr. Etteme Overall for details of the procedure .
Postoperatively , the patient was transferred to the floor in stable condition for observation , pain control and mobilization .
Initially postoperatively , she was doing quite well , though she did require four liters of oxygen postoperatively to maintain her oxygen saturations .
It was hoped that she would wean off the oxygen over the course of the next few hours .
However , she did require four liters of oxygen all the way through the night to maintain oxygen saturations of 93% .
Without oxygen , she dropped down to the low 80s .
Given the unusual nature of this oxygen requirement , the patient underwent work-up with a chest X-ray , which essentially was normal .
An ABG revealed a normal PCO2 of 32 , but a decrease in PO2- at 62 .
Therefore , given her history of breast cancer , the patient was taken for a spiral CT scan and the Medicine Service was consulted at that time .
They agreed with our plan .
On spiral CT scan , a small pulmonary embolus was seen in the right upper lobe and the left low er lobe .
She was started on heparin at that time to maintain a PTT of 60 t o 80 , and was given doses of Coumadin , in addition to the Coumadin she had been given for DVT prophylaxis .
With the recommendation of the medicine te am , we decided to maintain an INR of 2 to 3 with an overlap of heparin when the patient was therapeutic for two to three days .
She continued to do quite well even though we did keep her on bed rest for three days while she was heparinized .
Her oxygen saturations continued to improve to the point that she was on room air on postoperative day four with oxygen saturation of 95% .
She was given perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis for 48 hours after surgery .
She was mobilized on postoperative day four , getting out of bed , able to do quite well on her new hip with a minimal amount of pain .
She was given posterior hip dislocation precautions at that time , which she understood quite well .
She continued to be followed by the medical team and was watched very closely by the orthopedic team until we felt comfortable that she was breathing quite well and was mobilizing well with physical therapy .
Therefore , it was decided at that time that the patient was ready for discharge to rehabilitation on Coumadin , which would be monitored for six months to maintain an INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
The patient will continue all of her pre-admission medications , though no nonsteroidal analgesics , e.g. , aspirin or ibuprofen , will be given while she is on Coumadin therapy .
1. Colace , 100 mg. PO t.i.d.
2. Percocet , one to two tablets PO q.3 to 4 hours p.r.n. pain .
3. Coumadin with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .
Please prescribe 2 mg. tablets .
The patient will be on Coumadin for six months given her history of pulmonary embolus .
DISCHARGE PLAN :
Coumadin for six months postoperatively with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .
Check INR three times a week until stable .
Please call the results to Dr. Viennee Ester , the patient 's primary-care physician , who has agreed to follow her INR levels for the remainder of the six months .
Dr. Viennee Ester is located in Tlandcousti Lo Vuclark , where the patient is from originally .
The patient will call Dr. Overall 's office to arrange a follow-up appointment six weeks from the day of surgery .
Staples can be removed 10 to 14 days postoperatively .
Please hold removal if the wound is draining .
The patient may shower once the incision is dry , and may bathe and / or swim after the staples have been removed and there is no wound drainage .
Partial weight-bearing with crutches or a walker with posterior hip dislocation precautions for three months following surgery .
These precautions have been explained and demonstrated to the patient .
The patient has been instructed to call Dr. Overall 's office or the orthopedist on call with any questions or concerns about increasing pain , swelling , redness , wound drainage , fevers or chills at 094-897-3231 .

3. Primidone , 50 mg. PO q.h.s.
4. Diazepam , 1 mg. PO q.h.s.
5. Paxil , 37.5 mg. q.a.m.
6. Synthroid , 100 mcg. q.a.m.
7. Ditropan XL , 10 mg.
8. Imodium , 2 mg. q.a.m.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Examination reveals that the patient is walking with a mild limp .
The left hip is a bit stiff with flexion to 90 degrees .
She has 10 degrees of internal rotation and external rotation .
Pulses are fine .
IMAGING :
X-rays were reviewed .
They showed advanced arthritis of the left hip .
RECOMMENDATIONS :
Dr. Etteme Overall recommended that the patient have a total hip replacement on the left side on February 2 , 2003 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Please refer to the operative note by Dr. Etteme Overall for details of the procedure .
Postoperatively , the patient was transferred to the floor in stable condition for observation , pain control and mobilization .
Initially postoperatively , she was doing quite well , though she did require four liters of oxygen postoperatively to maintain her oxygen saturations .
It was hoped that she would wean off the oxygen over the course of the next few hours .
However , she did require four liters of oxygen all the way through the night to maintain oxygen saturations of 93% .
Without oxygen , she dropped down to the low 80s .
Given the unusual nature of this oxygen requirement , the patient underwent work-up with a chest X-ray , which essentially was normal .
An ABG revealed a normal PCO2 of 32 , but a decrease in PO2- at 62 .
Therefore , given her history of breast cancer , the patient was taken for a spiral CT scan and the Medicine Service was consulted at that time .
They agreed with our plan .
On spiral CT scan , a small pulmonary embolus was seen in the right upper lobe and the left low er lobe .
She was started on heparin at that time to maintain a PTT of 60 t o 80 , and was given doses of Coumadin , in addition to the Coumadin she had been given for DVT prophylaxis .
With the recommendation of the medicine te am , we decided to maintain an INR of 2 to 3 with an overlap of heparin when the patient was therapeutic for two to three days .
She continued to do quite well even though we did keep her on bed rest for three days while she was heparinized .
Her oxygen saturations continued to improve to the point that she was on room air on postoperative day four with oxygen saturation of 95% .
She was given perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis for 48 hours after surgery .
She was mobilized on postoperative day four , getting out of bed , able to do quite well on her new hip with a minimal amount of pain .
She was given posterior hip dislocation precautions at that time , which she understood quite well .
She continued to be followed by the medical team and was watched very closely by the orthopedic team until we felt comfortable that she was breathing quite well and was mobilizing well with physical therapy .
Therefore , it was decided at that time that the patient was ready for discharge to rehabilitation on Coumadin , which would be monitored for six months to maintain an INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
The patient will continue all of her pre-admission medications , though no nonsteroidal analgesics , e.g. , aspirin or ibuprofen , will be given while she is on Coumadin therapy .
1. Colace , 100 mg. PO t.i.d.
2. Percocet , one to two tablets PO q.3 to 4 hours p.r.n. pain .
3. Coumadin with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .
Please prescribe 2 mg. tablets .
The patient will be on Coumadin for six months given her history of pulmonary embolus .
DISCHARGE PLAN :
Coumadin for six months postoperatively with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .
Check INR three times a week until stable .
Please call the results to Dr. Viennee Ester , the patient 's primary-care physician , who has agreed to follow her INR levels for the remainder of the six months .
Dr. Viennee Ester is located in Tlandcousti Lo Vuclark , where the patient is from originally .
The patient will call Dr. Overall 's office to arrange a follow-up appointment six weeks from the day of surgery .
Staples can be removed 10 to 14 days postoperatively .
Please hold removal if the wound is draining .
The patient may shower once the incision is dry , and may bathe and / or swim after the staples have been removed and there is no wound drainage .
Partial weight-bearing with crutches or a walker with posterior hip dislocation precautions for three months following surgery .
These precautions have been explained and demonstrated to the patient .
The patient has been instructed to call Dr. Overall 's office or the orthopedist on call with any questions or concerns about increasing pain , swelling , redness , wound drainage , fevers or chills at 094-897-3231 .

5. History of diverticulitis .
6. Intermittent migraines .
7. History of prior cervical dysplasia , treated with LEEP procedure .
8. Osteoporosis .
9. Obsessive-compulsive disorder .
10. Panic disorder .
11. Aneurysm of the right internal auditory canal , treated with coil insertion .
12. Prior renal surgery .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
1. Eskalith , 300 mg. twice at bedtime .
2. Femara , 2.5 mg. at bedtime .
3. Primidone , 50 mg. PO q.h.s.
4. Diazepam , 1 mg. PO q.h.s.
5. Paxil , 37.5 mg. q.a.m.
6. Synthroid , 100 mcg. q.a.m.
7. Ditropan XL , 10 mg.
8. Imodium , 2 mg. q.a.m.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Examination reveals that the patient is walking with a mild limp .
The left hip is a bit stiff with flexion to 90 degrees .
She has 10 degrees of internal rotation and external rotation .
Pulses are fine .
IMAGING :
X-rays were reviewed .
They showed advanced arthritis of the left hip .
RECOMMENDATIONS :
Dr. Etteme Overall recommended that the patient have a total hip replacement on the left side on February 2 , 2003 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Please refer to the operative note by Dr. Etteme Overall for details of the procedure .
Postoperatively , the patient was transferred to the floor in stable condition for observation , pain control and mobilization .
Initially postoperatively , she was doing quite well , though she did require four liters of oxygen postoperatively to maintain her oxygen saturations .
It was hoped that she would wean off the oxygen over the course of the next few hours .
However , she did require four liters of oxygen all the way through the night to maintain oxygen saturations of 93% .
Without oxygen , she dropped down to the low 80s .
Given the unusual nature of this oxygen requirement , the patient underwent work-up with a chest X-ray , which essentially was normal .
An ABG revealed a normal PCO2 of 32 , but a decrease in PO2- at 62 .
Therefore , given her history of breast cancer , the patient was taken for a spiral CT scan and the Medicine Service was consulted at that time .
They agreed with our plan .
On spiral CT scan , a small pulmonary embolus was seen in the right upper lobe and the left low er lobe .
She was started on heparin at that time to maintain a PTT of 60 t o 80 , and was given doses of Coumadin , in addition to the Coumadin she had been given for DVT prophylaxis .
With the recommendation of the medicine te am , we decided to maintain an INR of 2 to 3 with an overlap of heparin when the patient was therapeutic for two to three days .
She continued to do quite well even though we did keep her on bed rest for three days while she was heparinized .
Her oxygen saturations continued to improve to the point that she was on room air on postoperative day four with oxygen saturation of 95% .
She was given perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis for 48 hours after surgery .
She was mobilized on postoperative day four , getting out of bed , able to do quite well on her new hip with a minimal amount of pain .
She was given posterior hip dislocation precautions at that time , which she understood quite well .
She continued to be followed by the medical team and was watched very closely by the orthopedic team until we felt comfortable that she was breathing quite well and was mobilizing well with physical therapy .
Therefore , it was decided at that time that the patient was ready for discharge to rehabilitation on Coumadin , which would be monitored for six months to maintain an INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
The patient will continue all of her pre-admission medications , though no nonsteroidal analgesics , e.g. , aspirin or ibuprofen , will be given while she is on Coumadin therapy .
1. Colace , 100 mg. PO t.i.d.
2. Percocet , one to two tablets PO q.3 to 4 hours p.r.n. pain .
3. Coumadin with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .
Please prescribe 2 mg. tablets .
The patient will be on Coumadin for six months given her history of pulmonary embolus .
DISCHARGE PLAN :
Coumadin for six months postoperatively with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .
Check INR three times a week until stable .
Please call the results to Dr. Viennee Ester , the patient 's primary-care physician , who has agreed to follow her INR levels for the remainder of the six months .
Dr. Viennee Ester is located in Tlandcousti Lo Vuclark , where the patient is from originally .
The patient will call Dr. Overall 's office to arrange a follow-up appointment six weeks from the day of surgery .
Staples can be removed 10 to 14 days postoperatively .
Please hold removal if the wound is draining .
The patient may shower once the incision is dry , and may bathe and / or swim after the staples have been removed and there is no wound drainage .
Partial weight-bearing with crutches or a walker with posterior hip dislocation precautions for three months following surgery .
These precautions have been explained and demonstrated to the patient .
The patient has been instructed to call Dr. Overall 's office or the orthopedist on call with any questions or concerns about increasing pain , swelling , redness , wound drainage , fevers or chills at 094-897-3231 .

1. Breast cancer in the right breast , diagnosed in 1995 with negative nodes , treated with excision , recurrence in June , 2001 , further reconstructive surgery .
At the same time , she underwent reduction of t he left breast .
2. History of bipolar disorder , for which she sees Dr. Lettefriscbreun .
She indicates this is stable at this time .
3. History of chronic anxiety .
4. Sleep apnea treated with UPP surgery in 1997 .
She does not use CPAP .
5. History of diverticulitis .
6. Intermittent migraines .
7. History of prior cervical dysplasia , treated with LEEP procedure .
8. Osteoporosis .
9. Obsessive-compulsive disorder .
10. Panic disorder .
11. Aneurysm of the right internal auditory canal , treated with coil insertion .
12. Prior renal surgery .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
1. Eskalith , 300 mg. twice at bedtime .
2. Femara , 2.5 mg. at bedtime .
3. Primidone , 50 mg. PO q.h.s.
4. Diazepam , 1 mg. PO q.h.s.
5. Paxil , 37.5 mg. q.a.m.
6. Synthroid , 100 mcg. q.a.m.
7. Ditropan XL , 10 mg.
8. Imodium , 2 mg. q.a.m.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Examination reveals that the patient is walking with a mild limp .
The left hip is a bit stiff with flexion to 90 degrees .
She has 10 degrees of internal rotation and external rotation .
Pulses are fine .
IMAGING :
X-rays were reviewed .
They showed advanced arthritis of the left hip .
RECOMMENDATIONS :
Dr. Etteme Overall recommended that the patient have a total hip replacement on the left side on February 2 , 2003 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Please refer to the operative note by Dr. Etteme Overall for details of the procedure .
Postoperatively , the patient was transferred to the floor in stable condition for observation , pain control and mobilization .
Initially postoperatively , she was doing quite well , though she did require four liters of oxygen postoperatively to maintain her oxygen saturations .
It was hoped that she would wean off the oxygen over the course of the next few hours .
However , she did require four liters of oxygen all the way through the night to maintain oxygen saturations of 93% .
Without oxygen , she dropped down to the low 80s .
Given the unusual nature of this oxygen requirement , the patient underwent work-up with a chest X-ray , which essentially was normal .
An ABG revealed a normal PCO2 of 32 , but a decrease in PO2- at 62 .
Therefore , given her history of breast cancer , the patient was taken for a spiral CT scan and the Medicine Service was consulted at that time .
They agreed with our plan .
On spiral CT scan , a small pulmonary embolus was seen in the right upper lobe and the left low er lobe .
She was started on heparin at that time to maintain a PTT of 60 t o 80 , and was given doses of Coumadin , in addition to the Coumadin she had been given for DVT prophylaxis .
With the recommendation of the medicine te am , we decided to maintain an INR of 2 to 3 with an overlap of heparin when the patient was therapeutic for two to three days .
She continued to do quite well even though we did keep her on bed rest for three days while she was heparinized .
Her oxygen saturations continued to improve to the point that she was on room air on postoperative day four with oxygen saturation of 95% .
She was given perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis for 48 hours after surgery .
She was mobilized on postoperative day four , getting out of bed , able to do quite well on her new hip with a minimal amount of pain .
She was given posterior hip dislocation precautions at that time , which she understood quite well .
She continued to be followed by the medical team and was watched very closely by the orthopedic team until we felt comfortable that she was breathing quite well and was mobilizing well with physical therapy .
Therefore , it was decided at that time that the patient was ready for discharge to rehabilitation on Coumadin , which would be monitored for six months to maintain an INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
The patient will continue all of her pre-admission medications , though no nonsteroidal analgesics , e.g. , aspirin or ibuprofen , will be given while she is on Coumadin therapy .
1. Colace , 100 mg. PO t.i.d.
2. Percocet , one to two tablets PO q.3 to 4 hours p.r.n. pain .
3. Coumadin with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .
Please prescribe 2 mg. tablets .
The patient will be on Coumadin for six months given her history of pulmonary embolus .
DISCHARGE PLAN :
Coumadin for six months postoperatively with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .
Check INR three times a week until stable .
Please call the results to Dr. Viennee Ester , the patient 's primary-care physician , who has agreed to follow her INR levels for the remainder of the six months .
Dr. Viennee Ester is located in Tlandcousti Lo Vuclark , where the patient is from originally .
The patient will call Dr. Overall 's office to arrange a follow-up appointment six weeks from the day of surgery .
Staples can be removed 10 to 14 days postoperatively .
Please hold removal if the wound is draining .
The patient may shower once the incision is dry , and may bathe and / or swim after the staples have been removed and there is no wound drainage .
Partial weight-bearing with crutches or a walker with posterior hip dislocation precautions for three months following surgery .
These precautions have been explained and demonstrated to the patient .
The patient has been instructed to call Dr. Overall 's office or the orthopedist on call with any questions or concerns about increasing pain , swelling , redness , wound drainage , fevers or chills at 094-897-3231 .

The patient was seen by Dr. Overall in the office on Aug 22 , 2003 , for follow-up .
She was scheduled to have a total hi p replacement because of progressively worsening pain in the left hip .
Her pain was 8/10 .
She limped .
She did not use a cane .
She did require a bannister going up and down stairs .
She had trouble doing shoes and socks .
She could walk limited distances .
Since seen by Dr. Overall in August , she had had a brain aneurysm .
She had a mastectomy and had recently developed Parkinson 's.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
1. Breast cancer in the right breast , diagnosed in 1995 with negative nodes , treated with excision , recurrence in June , 2001 , further reconstructive surgery .
At the same time , she underwent reduction of t he left breast .
2. History of bipolar disorder , for which she sees Dr. Lettefriscbreun .
She indicates this is stable at this time .
3. History of chronic anxiety .
4. Sleep apnea treated with UPP surgery in 1997 .
She does not use CPAP .
5. History of diverticulitis .
6. Intermittent migraines .
7. History of prior cervical dysplasia , treated with LEEP procedure .
8. Osteoporosis .
9. Obsessive-compulsive disorder .
10. Panic disorder .
11. Aneurysm of the right internal auditory canal , treated with coil insertion .
12. Prior renal surgery .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
1. Eskalith , 300 mg. twice at bedtime .
2. Femara , 2.5 mg. at bedtime .
3. Primidone , 50 mg. PO q.h.s.
4. Diazepam , 1 mg. PO q.h.s.
5. Paxil , 37.5 mg. q.a.m.
6. Synthroid , 100 mcg. q.a.m.
7. Ditropan XL , 10 mg.
8. Imodium , 2 mg. q.a.m.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Examination reveals that the patient is walking with a mild limp .
The left hip is a bit stiff with flexion to 90 degrees .
She has 10 degrees of internal rotation and external rotation .
Pulses are fine .
IMAGING :
X-rays were reviewed .
They showed advanced arthritis of the left hip .
RECOMMENDATIONS :
Dr. Etteme Overall recommended that the patient have a total hip replacement on the left side on February 2 , 2003 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Please refer to the operative note by Dr. Etteme Overall for details of the procedure .
Postoperatively , the patient was transferred to the floor in stable condition for observation , pain control and mobilization .
Initially postoperatively , she was doing quite well , though she did require four liters of oxygen postoperatively to maintain her oxygen saturations .
It was hoped that she would wean off the oxygen over the course of the next few hours .
However , she did require four liters of oxygen all the way through the night to maintain oxygen saturations of 93% .
Without oxygen , she dropped down to the low 80s .
Given the unusual nature of this oxygen requirement , the patient underwent work-up with a chest X-ray , which essentially was normal .
An ABG revealed a normal PCO2 of 32 , but a decrease in PO2- at 62 .
Therefore , given her history of breast cancer , the patient was taken for a spiral CT scan and the Medicine Service was consulted at that time .
They agreed with our plan .
On spiral CT scan , a small pulmonary embolus was seen in the right upper lobe and the left low er lobe .
She was started on heparin at that time to maintain a PTT of 60 t o 80 , and was given doses of Coumadin , in addition to the Coumadin she had been given for DVT prophylaxis .
With the recommendation of the medicine te am , we decided to maintain an INR of 2 to 3 with an overlap of heparin when the patient was therapeutic for two to three days .
She continued to do quite well even though we did keep her on bed rest for three days while she was heparinized .
Her oxygen saturations continued to improve to the point that she was on room air on postoperative day four with oxygen saturation of 95% .
She was given perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis for 48 hours after surgery .
She was mobilized on postoperative day four , getting out of bed , able to do quite well on her new hip with a minimal amount of pain .
She was given posterior hip dislocation precautions at that time , which she understood quite well .
She continued to be followed by the medical team and was watched very closely by the orthopedic team until we felt comfortable that she was breathing quite well and was mobilizing well with physical therapy .
Therefore , it was decided at that time that the patient was ready for discharge to rehabilitation on Coumadin , which would be monitored for six months to maintain an INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
The patient will continue all of her pre-admission medications , though no nonsteroidal analgesics , e.g. , aspirin or ibuprofen , will be given while she is on Coumadin therapy .
1. Colace , 100 mg. PO t.i.d.
2. Percocet , one to two tablets PO q.3 to 4 hours p.r.n. pain .
3. Coumadin with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .
Please prescribe 2 mg. tablets .
The patient will be on Coumadin for six months given her history of pulmonary embolus .
DISCHARGE PLAN :
Coumadin for six months postoperatively with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .
Check INR three times a week until stable .
Please call the results to Dr. Viennee Ester , the patient 's primary-care physician , who has agreed to follow her INR levels for the remainder of the six months .
Dr. Viennee Ester is located in Tlandcousti Lo Vuclark , where the patient is from originally .
The patient will call Dr. Overall 's office to arrange a follow-up appointment six weeks from the day of surgery .
Staples can be removed 10 to 14 days postoperatively .
Please hold removal if the wound is draining .
The patient may shower once the incision is dry , and may bathe and / or swim after the staples have been removed and there is no wound drainage .
Partial weight-bearing with crutches or a walker with posterior hip dislocation precautions for three months following surgery .
These precautions have been explained and demonstrated to the patient .
The patient has been instructed to call Dr. Overall 's office or the orthopedist on call with any questions or concerns about increasing pain , swelling , redness , wound drainage , fevers or chills at 094-897-3231 .

History of present illness

Very pleasant 52-year-old man with a long-standing history of chronic snoring along with prior septoplasty in high school .

He recalls symptoms of chronic sleepiness dating back many years as well which he states limited his ability to be the best Astronomer ever dispiste his success with Led Zeppelin as the lead guitarist . Within the context of these symptoms his wife ( Rosalind Columbia ) noticed witnessed apneas which were brought to his attention .

Thereafter the patient underwent split-night polysomnography in August 2013 .

This study revealed severe OSA with an AHI of 75.9 .

At that point he was titrated to 9 cm fixed CPAP pressure .

Subjectively the patient noticed significant improvement with regard to reduction in daytime sleepiness .

Overall he has done rather well as best I can tell with regard to the use of positive pressure over the years .

Unfortunately he's never had any form of structured follow-up from a sleep medicine standpoint .

He remains on his previous 9 cm a fixed CPAP .

He currently utilizes an oronasal mask-likely dreamwear full mask

He wishes to establish care with a sleep medicine physician for reevaluation of adequacy of therapy as well as long-term follow-up .

He's had no issues regarding pressure intolerance .

Currently he is comfortable with his present interface .

In fact he ordered a mini CPAP for travel and has done well in this regard .

He is due for a new CPAP machine as it's been over 5 years with his current device .

He is interested in having the ability to follow his data by smart phone app on a regular basis .

Bedtime 11:30 PM and wake time 5:30 AM .

Probably getting less sleep than he should be getting as he would ideally prefer to sleep from roughly 10

PM until 6 AM . Otherwise functioning well and denies any additional complaints at this point .

Progress Notes ( continued )

Assessment and plan

* Severe OSA ( AHI 75.9 ):

The patient has been maintained on 9 cm fixed CPAP pressure for the last 5 years .

He has done well with regard to acceptance adherence and response over those years .

Unfortunately he has not had anyone from a sleep medicine standpoint to provide ongoing observation and care .

He is due for a new CPAP machine and I have ordered one today which will be auto PAP capable but currently at a fixed pressure of 9 cm .

I will evaluate his data moving forward on those pressures .

For the most part he is wearing a comfortable mask but wishes to have additional mask options reviewed with him .

I provided him with the sleep lab telephone number for a mask fit session .

We will make any necessary adjustments with regard to pressure delivery once we have some data from his new device .

Today in the office to review the condition of OSA great length .

We reviewed his sleep study in detail .

We reviewed the main therapeutic options currently available for OSA including air pressure therapy , oral appliance , surgery and hypoglossal nerve stimulator .

We discussed the long-term complications of untreated OSA particularly in its severe form .

I'm pleased with how well he is done over the years .

It is my suspicion that his OSA is primarily secondary to crowded posterior oropharynx noted on examination in conjunction with mild overweight state .

* Overweight ( BMI 28.5 ):

We discussed the effect of weight on OSA as well as weight loss .

* Nasal congestion : He is maintained on Claritin and Flonase along with Sudafed .

We discussed these issues as relates to nasal congestion and the ability to utilize a nasal mask or nasal pillows interface .

I suspect he will continue to be best served with utilization of some formal fullface mask interface .

* RTO in 6-8 weeks for close follow-up .

Assessment and plan

* Severe OSA ( AHI 75.9 ):

The patient has been maintained on 9 cm fixed CPAP pressure for the last 5 years .

He has done well with regard to acceptance adherence and response over those years .

Unfortunately he has not had anyone from a sleep medicine standpoint to provide ongoing observation and care .

He is due for a new CPAP machine and I have ordered one today which will be auto PAP capable but currently at a fixed pressure of 9 cm .

I will evaluate his data moving forward on those pressures .

For the most part he is wearing a comfortable mask but wishes to have additional mask options reviewed with him .

I provided him with the sleep lab telephone number for a mask fit session .

We will make any necessary adjustments with regard to pressure delivery once we have some data from his new device .

Today in the office to review the condition of OSA great length .

We reviewed his sleep study in detail .

We reviewed the main therapeutic options currently available for OSA including air pressure therapy , oral appliance , surgery and hypoglossal nerve stimulator .

We discussed the long-term complications of untreated OSA particularly in its severe form .

I'm pleased with how well he is done over the years .

It is my suspicion that his OSA is primarily secondary to crowded posterior oropharynx noted on examination in conjunction with mild overweight state .

* Overweight ( BMI 28.5 ):

We discussed the effect of weight on OSA as well as weight loss .

* Nasal congestion : He is maintained on Claritin and Flonase along with Sudafed .

We discussed these issues as relates to nasal congestion and the ability to utilize a nasal mask or nasal pillows interface .

I suspect he will continue to be best served with utilization of some formal fullface mask interface .

* RTO in 6-8 weeks for close follow-up .

History of present illness

Very pleasant 52-year-old man with a long-standing history of chronic snoring along with prior septoplasty in high school .

He recalls symptoms of chronic sleepiness dating back many years as well which he states limited his ability to be the best Astronomer ever dispiste his success with Led Zeppelin as the lead guitarist . Within the context of these symptoms his wife ( Rosalind Columbia ) noticed witnessed apneas which were brought to his attention .

Thereafter the patient underwent split-night polysomnography in August 2013 .

This study revealed severe OSA with an AHI of 75.9 .

At that point he was titrated to 9 cm fixed CPAP pressure .

Subjectively the patient noticed significant improvement with regard to reduction in daytime sleepiness .

Overall he has done rather well as best I can tell with regard to the use of positive pressure over the years .

Unfortunately he's never had any form of structured follow-up from a sleep medicine standpoint .

He remains on his previous 9 cm a fixed CPAP .

He currently utilizes an oronasal mask-likely dreamwear full mask

He wishes to establish care with a sleep medicine physician for reevaluation of adequacy of therapy as well as long-term follow-up .

He's had no issues regarding pressure intolerance .

Currently he is comfortable with his present interface .

In fact he ordered a mini CPAP for travel and has done well in this regard .

He is due for a new CPAP machine as it's been over 5 years with his current device .

He is interested in having the ability to follow his data by smart phone app on a regular basis .

Bedtime 11:30 PM and wake time 5:30 AM .

Probably getting less sleep than he should be getting as he would ideally prefer to sleep from roughly 10

PM until 6 AM . Otherwise functioning well and denies any additional complaints at this point .

Assessment and plan

* Severe OSA ( AHI 75.9 ):

The patient has been maintained on 9 cm fixed CPAP pressure for the last 5 years .

He has done well with regard to acceptance adherence and response over those years .

Unfortunately he has not had anyone from a sleep medicine standpoint to provide ongoing observation and care .

He is due for a new CPAP machine and I have ordered one today which will be auto PAP capable but currently at a fixed pressure of 9 cm .

I will evaluate his data moving forward on those pressures .

For the most part he is wearing a comfortable mask but wishes to have additional mask options reviewed with him .

I provided him with the sleep lab telephone number for a mask fit session .

We will make any necessary adjustments with regard to pressure delivery once we have some data from his new device .

History of present illness

Very pleasant 52-year-old man with a long-standing history of chronic snoring along with prior septoplasty in high school .

He recalls symptoms of chronic sleepiness dating back many years as well which he states limited his ability to be the best Astronomer ever dispiste his success with Led Zeppelin as the lead guitarist . Within the context of these symptoms his wife ( Rosalind Columbia ) noticed witnessed apneas which were brought to his attention .

Thereafter the patient underwent split-night polysomnography in August 2013 .

This study revealed severe OSA with an AHI of 75.9 .

At that point he was titrated to 9 cm fixed CPAP pressure .

Subjectively the patient noticed significant improvement with regard to reduction in daytime sleepiness .

Overall he has done rather well as best I can tell with regard to the use of positive pressure over the years .

Unfortunately he's never had any form of structured follow-up from a sleep medicine standpoint .

He remains on his previous 9 cm a fixed CPAP .

He currently utilizes an oronasal mask-likely dreamwear full mask

He wishes to establish care with a sleep medicine physician for reevaluation of adequacy of therapy as well as long-term follow-up .

He's had no issues regarding pressure intolerance .

Currently he is comfortable with his present interface .

In fact he ordered a mini CPAP for travel and has done well in this regard .

He is due for a new CPAP machine as it's been over 5 years with his current device .

He is interested in having the ability to follow his data by smart phone app on a regular basis .

Bedtime 11:30 PM and wake time 5:30 AM .

Probably getting less sleep than he should be getting as he would ideally prefer to sleep from roughly 10

PM until 6 AM . Otherwise functioning well and denies any additional complaints at this point .

Progress Notes ( continued )

Assessment and plan

* Severe OSA ( AHI 75.9 ):

The patient has been maintained on 9 cm fixed CPAP pressure for the last 5 years .

He has done well with regard to acceptance adherence and response over those years .

Unfortunately he has not had anyone from a sleep medicine standpoint to provide ongoing observation and care .

He is due for a new CPAP machine and I have ordered one today which will be auto PAP capable but currently at a fixed pressure of 9 cm .

I will evaluate his data moving forward on those pressures .

For the most part he is wearing a comfortable mask but wishes to have additional mask options reviewed with him .

I provided him with the sleep lab telephone number for a mask fit session .

We will make any necessary adjustments with regard to pressure delivery once we have some data from his new device .

Today in the office to review the condition of OSA great length .

We reviewed his sleep study in detail .

We reviewed the main therapeutic options currently available for OSA including air pressure therapy , oral appliance , surgery and hypoglossal nerve stimulator .

We discussed the long-term complications of untreated OSA particularly in its severe form .

I'm pleased with how well he is done over the years .

It is my suspicion that his OSA is primarily secondary to crowded posterior oropharynx noted on examination in conjunction with mild overweight state .

* Overweight ( BMI 28.5 ):

We discussed the effect of weight on OSA as well as weight loss .

* Nasal congestion : He is maintained on Claritin and Flonase along with Sudafed .

We discussed these issues as relates to nasal congestion and the ability to utilize a nasal mask or nasal pillows interface .

I suspect he will continue to be best served with utilization of some formal fullface mask interface .

* RTO in 6-8 weeks for close follow-up .

Assessment and plan

* Severe OSA ( AHI 75.9 ):

The patient has been maintained on 9 cm fixed CPAP pressure for the last 5 years .

He has done well with regard to acceptance adherence and response over those years .

Unfortunately he has not had anyone from a sleep medicine standpoint to provide ongoing observation and care .

He is due for a new CPAP machine and I have ordered one today which will be auto PAP capable but currently at a fixed pressure of 9 cm .

I will evaluate his data moving forward on those pressures .

For the most part he is wearing a comfortable mask but wishes to have additional mask options reviewed with him .

I provided him with the sleep lab telephone number for a mask fit session .

We will make any necessary adjustments with regard to pressure delivery once we have some data from his new device .

Today in the office to review the condition of OSA great length .

We reviewed his sleep study in detail .

We reviewed the main therapeutic options currently available for OSA including air pressure therapy , oral appliance , surgery and hypoglossal nerve stimulator .

We discussed the long-term complications of untreated OSA particularly in its severe form .

I'm pleased with how well he is done over the years .

It is my suspicion that his OSA is primarily secondary to crowded posterior oropharynx noted on examination in conjunction with mild overweight state .

* Overweight ( BMI 28.5 ):

We discussed the effect of weight on OSA as well as weight loss .

* Nasal congestion : He is maintained on Claritin and Flonase along with Sudafed .

We discussed these issues as relates to nasal congestion and the ability to utilize a nasal mask or nasal pillows interface .

I suspect he will continue to be best served with utilization of some formal fullface mask interface .

* RTO in 6-8 weeks for close follow-up .

History of present illness

Very pleasant 52-year-old man with a long-standing history of chronic snoring along with prior septoplasty in high school .

He recalls symptoms of chronic sleepiness dating back many years as well which he states limited his ability to be the best Astronomer ever dispiste his success with Led Zeppelin as the lead guitarist . Within the context of these symptoms his wife ( Rosalind Columbia ) noticed witnessed apneas which were brought to his attention .

Thereafter the patient underwent split-night polysomnography in August 2013 .

This study revealed severe OSA with an AHI of 75.9 .

At that point he was titrated to 9 cm fixed CPAP pressure .

Subjectively the patient noticed significant improvement with regard to reduction in daytime sleepiness .

Overall he has done rather well as best I can tell with regard to the use of positive pressure over the years .

Unfortunately he's never had any form of structured follow-up from a sleep medicine standpoint .

He remains on his previous 9 cm a fixed CPAP .

He currently utilizes an oronasal mask-likely dreamwear full mask

He wishes to establish care with a sleep medicine physician for reevaluation of adequacy of therapy as well as long-term follow-up .

He's had no issues regarding pressure intolerance .

Currently he is comfortable with his present interface .

In fact he ordered a mini CPAP for travel and has done well in this regard .

He is due for a new CPAP machine as it's been over 5 years with his current device .

He is interested in having the ability to follow his data by smart phone app on a regular basis .

Bedtime 11:30 PM and wake time 5:30 AM .

Probably getting less sleep than he should be getting as he would ideally prefer to sleep from roughly 10

PM until 6 AM . Otherwise functioning well and denies any additional complaints at this point .

History of present illness

Very pleasant 52-year-old man with a long-standing history of chronic snoring along with prior septoplasty in high school .

He recalls symptoms of chronic sleepiness dating back many years as well which he states limited his ability to be the best Astronomer ever dispiste his success with Led Zeppelin as the lead guitarist . Within the context of these symptoms his wife ( Rosalind Columbia ) noticed witnessed apneas which were brought to his attention .

Thereafter the patient underwent split-night polysomnography in August 2013 .

This study revealed severe OSA with an AHI of 75.9 .

At that point he was titrated to 9 cm fixed CPAP pressure .

Subjectively the patient noticed significant improvement with regard to reduction in daytime sleepiness .

Overall he has done rather well as best I can tell with regard to the use of positive pressure over the years .

Unfortunately he's never had any form of structured follow-up from a sleep medicine standpoint .

He remains on his previous 9 cm a fixed CPAP .

He currently utilizes an oronasal mask-likely dreamwear full mask

He wishes to establish care with a sleep medicine physician for reevaluation of adequacy of therapy as well as long-term follow-up .

He's had no issues regarding pressure intolerance .

Currently he is comfortable with his present interface .

In fact he ordered a mini CPAP for travel and has done well in this regard .

He is due for a new CPAP machine as it's been over 5 years with his current device .

He is interested in having the ability to follow his data by smart phone app on a regular basis .

Bedtime 11:30 PM and wake time 5:30 AM .

Probably getting less sleep than he should be getting as he would ideally prefer to sleep from roughly 10

PM until 6 AM . Otherwise functioning well and denies any additional complaints at this point .

Progress Notes ( continued )

Assessment and plan

* Severe OSA ( AHI 75.9 ):

The patient has been maintained on 9 cm fixed CPAP pressure for the last 5 years .

He has done well with regard to acceptance adherence and response over those years .

Unfortunately he has not had anyone from a sleep medicine standpoint to provide ongoing observation and care .

He is due for a new CPAP machine and I have ordered one today which will be auto PAP capable but currently at a fixed pressure of 9 cm .

I will evaluate his data moving forward on those pressures .

For the most part he is wearing a comfortable mask but wishes to have additional mask options reviewed with him .

I provided him with the sleep lab telephone number for a mask fit session .

We will make any necessary adjustments with regard to pressure delivery once we have some data from his new device .

Today in the office to review the condition of OSA great length .

We reviewed his sleep study in detail .

We reviewed the main therapeutic options currently available for OSA including air pressure therapy , oral appliance , surgery and hypoglossal nerve stimulator .

We discussed the long-term complications of untreated OSA particularly in its severe form .

I'm pleased with how well he is done over the years .

It is my suspicion that his OSA is primarily secondary to crowded posterior oropharynx noted on examination in conjunction with mild overweight state .

* Overweight ( BMI 28.5 ):

We discussed the effect of weight on OSA as well as weight loss .

* Nasal congestion : He is maintained on Claritin and Flonase along with Sudafed .

We discussed these issues as relates to nasal congestion and the ability to utilize a nasal mask or nasal pillows interface .

I suspect he will continue to be best served with utilization of some formal fullface mask interface .

* RTO in 6-8 weeks for close follow-up .

Progress Notes ( continued )

Assessment and plan

* Severe OSA ( AHI 75.9 ):

The patient has been maintained on 9 cm fixed CPAP pressure for the last 5 years .

He has done well with regard to acceptance adherence and response over those years .

Unfortunately he has not had anyone from a sleep medicine standpoint to provide ongoing observation and care .

He is due for a new CPAP machine and I have ordered one today which will be auto PAP capable but currently at a fixed pressure of 9 cm .

I will evaluate his data moving forward on those pressures .

For the most part he is wearing a comfortable mask but wishes to have additional mask options reviewed with him .

I provided him with the sleep lab telephone number for a mask fit session .

We will make any necessary adjustments with regard to pressure delivery once we have some data from his new device .

Today in the office to review the condition of OSA great length .

We reviewed his sleep study in detail .

We reviewed the main therapeutic options currently available for OSA including air pressure therapy , oral appliance , surgery and hypoglossal nerve stimulator .

We discussed the long-term complications of untreated OSA particularly in its severe form .

I'm pleased with how well he is done over the years .

It is my suspicion that his OSA is primarily secondary to crowded posterior oropharynx noted on examination in conjunction with mild overweight state .

* Overweight ( BMI 28.5 ):

We discussed the effect of weight on OSA as well as weight loss .

* Nasal congestion : He is maintained on Claritin and Flonase along with Sudafed .

We discussed these issues as relates to nasal congestion and the ability to utilize a nasal mask or nasal pillows interface .

I suspect he will continue to be best served with utilization of some formal fullface mask interface .

* RTO in 6-8 weeks for close follow-up .

History of present illness

Very pleasant 52-year-old man with a long-standing history of chronic snoring along with prior septoplasty in high school .

He recalls symptoms of chronic sleepiness dating back many years as well which he states limited his ability to be the best Astronomer ever dispiste his success with Led Zeppelin as the lead guitarist . Within the context of these symptoms his wife ( Rosalind Columbia ) noticed witnessed apneas which were brought to his attention .

Thereafter the patient underwent split-night polysomnography in August 2013 .

This study revealed severe OSA with an AHI of 75.9 .

At that point he was titrated to 9 cm fixed CPAP pressure .

Subjectively the patient noticed significant improvement with regard to reduction in daytime sleepiness .

Overall he has done rather well as best I can tell with regard to the use of positive pressure over the years .

Unfortunately he's never had any form of structured follow-up from a sleep medicine standpoint .

He remains on his previous 9 cm a fixed CPAP .

He currently utilizes an oronasal mask-likely dreamwear full mask

He wishes to establish care with a sleep medicine physician for reevaluation of adequacy of therapy as well as long-term follow-up .

He's had no issues regarding pressure intolerance .

Currently he is comfortable with his present interface .

In fact he ordered a mini CPAP for travel and has done well in this regard .

He is due for a new CPAP machine as it's been over 5 years with his current device .

He is interested in having the ability to follow his data by smart phone app on a regular basis .

Bedtime 11:30 PM and wake time 5:30 AM .

Probably getting less sleep than he should be getting as he would ideally prefer to sleep from roughly 10

PM until 6 AM . Otherwise functioning well and denies any additional complaints at this point .

History of present illness

Very pleasant 52-year-old man with a long-standing history of chronic snoring along with prior septoplasty in high school .

He recalls symptoms of chronic sleepiness dating back many years as well which he states limited his ability to be the best Astronomer ever dispiste his success with Led Zeppelin as the lead guitarist . Within the context of these symptoms his wife ( Rosalind Columbia ) noticed witnessed apneas which were brought to his attention .

Thereafter the patient underwent split-night polysomnography in August 2013 .

This study revealed severe OSA with an AHI of 75.9 .

At that point he was titrated to 9 cm fixed CPAP pressure .

Subjectively the patient noticed significant improvement with regard to reduction in daytime sleepiness .

Overall he has done rather well as best I can tell with regard to the use of positive pressure over the years .

Unfortunately he's never had any form of structured follow-up from a sleep medicine standpoint .

He remains on his previous 9 cm a fixed CPAP .

He currently utilizes an oronasal mask-likely dreamwear full mask

He wishes to establish care with a sleep medicine physician for reevaluation of adequacy of therapy as well as long-term follow-up .

He's had no issues regarding pressure intolerance .

Currently he is comfortable with his present interface .

In fact he ordered a mini CPAP for travel and has done well in this regard .

He is due for a new CPAP machine as it's been over 5 years with his current device .

He is interested in having the ability to follow his data by smart phone app on a regular basis .

Bedtime 11:30 PM and wake time 5:30 AM .

Probably getting less sleep than he should be getting as he would ideally prefer to sleep from roughly 10

PM until 6 AM . Otherwise functioning well and denies any additional complaints at this point .

Progress Notes ( continued )

Assessment and plan

* Severe OSA ( AHI 75.9 ):

The patient has been maintained on 9 cm fixed CPAP pressure for the last 5 years .

He has done well with regard to acceptance adherence and response over those years .

Unfortunately he has not had anyone from a sleep medicine standpoint to provide ongoing observation and care .

He is due for a new CPAP machine and I have ordered one today which will be auto PAP capable but currently at a fixed pressure of 9 cm .

I will evaluate his data moving forward on those pressures .

For the most part he is wearing a comfortable mask but wishes to have additional mask options reviewed with him .

I provided him with the sleep lab telephone number for a mask fit session .

We will make any necessary adjustments with regard to pressure delivery once we have some data from his new device .

Today in the office to review the condition of OSA great length .

We reviewed his sleep study in detail .

We reviewed the main therapeutic options currently available for OSA including air pressure therapy , oral appliance , surgery and hypoglossal nerve stimulator .

We discussed the long-term complications of untreated OSA particularly in its severe form .

I'm pleased with how well he is done over the years .

It is my suspicion that his OSA is primarily secondary to crowded posterior oropharynx noted on examination in conjunction with mild overweight state .

* Overweight ( BMI 28.5 ):

We discussed the effect of weight on OSA as well as weight loss .

* Nasal congestion : He is maintained on Claritin and Flonase along with Sudafed .

We discussed these issues as relates to nasal congestion and the ability to utilize a nasal mask or nasal pillows interface .

I suspect he will continue to be best served with utilization of some formal fullface mask interface .

* RTO in 6-8 weeks for close follow-up .

Assessment and plan

* Severe OSA ( AHI 75.9 ):

The patient has been maintained on 9 cm fixed CPAP pressure for the last 5 years .

He has done well with regard to acceptance adherence and response over those years .

Unfortunately he has not had anyone from a sleep medicine standpoint to provide ongoing observation and care .

He is due for a new CPAP machine and I have ordered one today which will be auto PAP capable but currently at a fixed pressure of 9 cm .

I will evaluate his data moving forward on those pressures .

For the most part he is wearing a comfortable mask but wishes to have additional mask options reviewed with him .

I provided him with the sleep lab telephone number for a mask fit session .

We will make any necessary adjustments with regard to pressure delivery once we have some data from his new device .

Today in the office to review the condition of OSA great length .

We reviewed his sleep study in detail .

We reviewed the main therapeutic options currently available for OSA including air pressure therapy , oral appliance , surgery and hypoglossal nerve stimulator .

We discussed the long-term complications of untreated OSA particularly in its severe form .

I'm pleased with how well he is done over the years .

It is my suspicion that his OSA is primarily secondary to crowded posterior oropharynx noted on examination in conjunction with mild overweight state .

* Overweight ( BMI 28.5 ):

We discussed the effect of weight on OSA as well as weight loss .

* Nasal congestion : He is maintained on Claritin and Flonase along with Sudafed .

We discussed these issues as relates to nasal congestion and the ability to utilize a nasal mask or nasal pillows interface .

I suspect he will continue to be best served with utilization of some formal fullface mask interface .

* RTO in 6-8 weeks for close follow-up .

History of present illness

Very pleasant 52-year-old man with a long-standing history of chronic snoring along with prior septoplasty in high school .

He recalls symptoms of chronic sleepiness dating back many years as well which he states limited his ability to be the best Astronomer ever dispiste his success with Led Zeppelin as the lead guitarist . Within the context of these symptoms his wife ( Rosalind Columbia ) noticed witnessed apneas which were brought to his attention .

Thereafter the patient underwent split-night polysomnography in August 2013 .

This study revealed severe OSA with an AHI of 75.9 .

At that point he was titrated to 9 cm fixed CPAP pressure .

Subjectively the patient noticed significant improvement with regard to reduction in daytime sleepiness .

Overall he has done rather well as best I can tell with regard to the use of positive pressure over the years .

Unfortunately he's never had any form of structured follow-up from a sleep medicine standpoint .

He remains on his previous 9 cm a fixed CPAP .

He currently utilizes an oronasal mask-likely dreamwear full mask

He wishes to establish care with a sleep medicine physician for reevaluation of adequacy of therapy as well as long-term follow-up .

He's had no issues regarding pressure intolerance .

Currently he is comfortable with his present interface .

In fact he ordered a mini CPAP for travel and has done well in this regard .

He is due for a new CPAP machine as it's been over 5 years with his current device .

He is interested in having the ability to follow his data by smart phone app on a regular basis .

Bedtime 11:30 PM and wake time 5:30 AM .

Probably getting less sleep than he should be getting as he would ideally prefer to sleep from roughly 10

PM until 6 AM . Otherwise functioning well and denies any additional complaints at this point .

History of present illness

Very pleasant 52-year-old man with a long-standing history of chronic snoring along with prior septoplasty in high school .

He recalls symptoms of chronic sleepiness dating back many years as well which he states limited his ability to be the best Astronomer ever dispiste his success with Led Zeppelin as the lead guitarist . Within the context of these symptoms his wife ( Rosalind Columbia ) noticed witnessed apneas which were brought to his attention .

Thereafter the patient underwent split-night polysomnography in August 2013 .

This study revealed severe OSA with an AHI of 75.9 .

At that point he was titrated to 9 cm fixed CPAP pressure .

Subjectively the patient noticed significant improvement with regard to reduction in daytime sleepiness .

Overall he has done rather well as best I can tell with regard to the use of positive pressure over the years .

Unfortunately he's never had any form of structured follow-up from a sleep medicine standpoint .

He remains on his previous 9 cm a fixed CPAP .

He currently utilizes an oronasal mask-likely dreamwear full mask

He wishes to establish care with a sleep medicine physician for reevaluation of adequacy of therapy as well as long-term follow-up .

He's had no issues regarding pressure intolerance .

Currently he is comfortable with his present interface .

In fact he ordered a mini CPAP for travel and has done well in this regard .

He is due for a new CPAP machine as it's been over 5 years with his current device .

He is interested in having the ability to follow his data by smart phone app on a regular basis .

Bedtime 11:30 PM and wake time 5:30 AM .

Probably getting less sleep than he should be getting as he would ideally prefer to sleep from roughly 10

PM until 6 AM . Otherwise functioning well and denies any additional complaints at this point .

Progress Notes ( continued )

Assessment and plan

* Severe OSA ( AHI 75.9 ):

The patient has been maintained on 9 cm fixed CPAP pressure for the last 5 years .

He has done well with regard to acceptance adherence and response over those years .

Unfortunately he has not had anyone from a sleep medicine standpoint to provide ongoing observation and care .

He is due for a new CPAP machine and I have ordered one today which will be auto PAP capable but currently at a fixed pressure of 9 cm .

I will evaluate his data moving forward on those pressures .

For the most part he is wearing a comfortable mask but wishes to have additional mask options reviewed with him .

I provided him with the sleep lab telephone number for a mask fit session .

We will make any necessary adjustments with regard to pressure delivery once we have some data from his new device .

Today in the office to review the condition of OSA great length .

We reviewed his sleep study in detail .

We reviewed the main therapeutic options currently available for OSA including air pressure therapy , oral appliance , surgery and hypoglossal nerve stimulator .

We discussed the long-term complications of untreated OSA particularly in its severe form .

I'm pleased with how well he is done over the years .

It is my suspicion that his OSA is primarily secondary to crowded posterior oropharynx noted on examination in conjunction with mild overweight state .

* Overweight ( BMI 28.5 ):

We discussed the effect of weight on OSA as well as weight loss .

* Nasal congestion : He is maintained on Claritin and Flonase along with Sudafed .

We discussed these issues as relates to nasal congestion and the ability to utilize a nasal mask or nasal pillows interface .

I suspect he will continue to be best served with utilization of some formal fullface mask interface .

* RTO in 6-8 weeks for close follow-up .

Assessment and plan

* Severe OSA ( AHI 75.9 ):

The patient has been maintained on 9 cm fixed CPAP pressure for the last 5 years .

He has done well with regard to acceptance adherence and response over those years .

Unfortunately he has not had anyone from a sleep medicine standpoint to provide ongoing observation and care .

He is due for a new CPAP machine and I have ordered one today which will be auto PAP capable but currently at a fixed pressure of 9 cm .

I will evaluate his data moving forward on those pressures .

For the most part he is wearing a comfortable mask but wishes to have additional mask options reviewed with him .

I provided him with the sleep lab telephone number for a mask fit session .

We will make any necessary adjustments with regard to pressure delivery once we have some data from his new device .

Today in the office to review the condition of OSA great length .

We reviewed his sleep study in detail .

We reviewed the main therapeutic options currently available for OSA including air pressure therapy , oral appliance , surgery and hypoglossal nerve stimulator .

We discussed the long-term complications of untreated OSA particularly in its severe form .

I'm pleased with how well he is done over the years .

It is my suspicion that his OSA is primarily secondary to crowded posterior oropharynx noted on examination in conjunction with mild overweight state .

* Overweight ( BMI 28.5 ):

We discussed the effect of weight on OSA as well as weight loss .

* Nasal congestion : He is maintained on Claritin and Flonase along with Sudafed .

We discussed these issues as relates to nasal congestion and the ability to utilize a nasal mask or nasal pillows interface .

I suspect he will continue to be best served with utilization of some formal fullface mask interface .

* RTO in 6-8 weeks for close follow-up .

History of present illness

Very pleasant 52-year-old man with a long-standing history of chronic snoring along with prior septoplasty in high school .

He recalls symptoms of chronic sleepiness dating back many years as well which he states limited his ability to be the best Astronomer ever dispiste his success with Led Zeppelin as the lead guitarist . Within the context of these symptoms his wife ( Rosalind Columbia ) noticed witnessed apneas which were brought to his attention .

Thereafter the patient underwent split-night polysomnography in August 2013 .

This study revealed severe OSA with an AHI of 75.9 .

At that point he was titrated to 9 cm fixed CPAP pressure .

Subjectively the patient noticed significant improvement with regard to reduction in daytime sleepiness .

Overall he has done rather well as best I can tell with regard to the use of positive pressure over the years .

Unfortunately he's never had any form of structured follow-up from a sleep medicine standpoint .

He remains on his previous 9 cm a fixed CPAP .

He currently utilizes an oronasal mask-likely dreamwear full mask

He wishes to establish care with a sleep medicine physician for reevaluation of adequacy of therapy as well as long-term follow-up .

He's had no issues regarding pressure intolerance .

Currently he is comfortable with his present interface .

In fact he ordered a mini CPAP for travel and has done well in this regard .

He is due for a new CPAP machine as it's been over 5 years with his current device .

He is interested in having the ability to follow his data by smart phone app on a regular basis .

Bedtime 11:30 PM and wake time 5:30 AM .

Probably getting less sleep than he should be getting as he would ideally prefer to sleep from roughly 10

PM until 6 AM . Otherwise functioning well and denies any additional complaints at this point .

History of present illness

Very pleasant 52-year-old man with a long-standing history of chronic snoring along with prior septoplasty in high school .

He recalls symptoms of chronic sleepiness dating back many years as well which he states limited his ability to be the best Astronomer ever dispiste his success with Led Zeppelin as the lead guitarist . Within the context of these symptoms his wife ( Rosalind Columbia ) noticed witnessed apneas which were brought to his attention .

Thereafter the patient underwent split-night polysomnography in August 2013 .

This study revealed severe OSA with an AHI of 75.9 .

At that point he was titrated to 9 cm fixed CPAP pressure .

Subjectively the patient noticed significant improvement with regard to reduction in daytime sleepiness .

Overall he has done rather well as best I can tell with regard to the use of positive pressure over the years .

Unfortunately he's never had any form of structured follow-up from a sleep medicine standpoint .

He remains on his previous 9 cm a fixed CPAP .

He currently utilizes an oronasal mask-likely dreamwear full mask

He wishes to establish care with a sleep medicine physician for reevaluation of adequacy of therapy as well as long-term follow-up .

He's had no issues regarding pressure intolerance .

Currently he is comfortable with his present interface .

In fact he ordered a mini CPAP for travel and has done well in this regard .

He is due for a new CPAP machine as it's been over 5 years with his current device .

He is interested in having the ability to follow his data by smart phone app on a regular basis .

Bedtime 11:30 PM and wake time 5:30 AM .

Probably getting less sleep than he should be getting as he would ideally prefer to sleep from roughly 10

PM until 6 AM . Otherwise functioning well and denies any additional complaints at this point .

Progress Notes ( continued )

Assessment and plan

* Severe OSA ( AHI 75.9 ):

The patient has been maintained on 9 cm fixed CPAP pressure for the last 5 years .

He has done well with regard to acceptance adherence and response over those years .

Unfortunately he has not had anyone from a sleep medicine standpoint to provide ongoing observation and care .

He is due for a new CPAP machine and I have ordered one today which will be auto PAP capable but currently at a fixed pressure of 9 cm .

I will evaluate his data moving forward on those pressures .

For the most part he is wearing a comfortable mask but wishes to have additional mask options reviewed with him .

I provided him with the sleep lab telephone number for a mask fit session .

We will make any necessary adjustments with regard to pressure delivery once we have some data from his new device .

Today in the office to review the condition of OSA great length .

We reviewed his sleep study in detail .

We reviewed the main therapeutic options currently available for OSA including air pressure therapy , oral appliance , surgery and hypoglossal nerve stimulator .

We discussed the long-term complications of untreated OSA particularly in its severe form .

I'm pleased with how well he is done over the years .

It is my suspicion that his OSA is primarily secondary to crowded posterior oropharynx noted on examination in conjunction with mild overweight state .

* Overweight ( BMI 28.5 ):

We discussed the effect of weight on OSA as well as weight loss .

* Nasal congestion : He is maintained on Claritin and Flonase along with Sudafed .

We discussed these issues as relates to nasal congestion and the ability to utilize a nasal mask or nasal pillows interface .

I suspect he will continue to be best served with utilization of some formal fullface mask interface .

* RTO in 6-8 weeks for close follow-up .

Assessment and plan

* Severe OSA ( AHI 75.9 ):

The patient has been maintained on 9 cm fixed CPAP pressure for the last 5 years .

He has done well with regard to acceptance adherence and response over those years .

Unfortunately he has not had anyone from a sleep medicine standpoint to provide ongoing observation and care .

He is due for a new CPAP machine and I have ordered one today which will be auto PAP capable but currently at a fixed pressure of 9 cm .

I will evaluate his data moving forward on those pressures .

For the most part he is wearing a comfortable mask but wishes to have additional mask options reviewed with him .

I provided him with the sleep lab telephone number for a mask fit session .

We will make any necessary adjustments with regard to pressure delivery once we have some data from his new device .

Today in the office to review the condition of OSA great length .

We reviewed his sleep study in detail .

We reviewed the main therapeutic options currently available for OSA including air pressure therapy , oral appliance , surgery and hypoglossal nerve stimulator .

We discussed the long-term complications of untreated OSA particularly in its severe form .

I'm pleased with how well he is done over the years .

It is my suspicion that his OSA is primarily secondary to crowded posterior oropharynx noted on examination in conjunction with mild overweight state .

* Overweight ( BMI 28.5 ):

We discussed the effect of weight on OSA as well as weight loss .

* Nasal congestion : He is maintained on Claritin and Flonase along with Sudafed .

We discussed these issues as relates to nasal congestion and the ability to utilize a nasal mask or nasal pillows interface .

I suspect he will continue to be best served with utilization of some formal fullface mask interface .

* RTO in 6-8 weeks for close follow-up .

History of present illness

Very pleasant 52-year-old man with a long-standing history of chronic snoring along with prior septoplasty in high school .

He recalls symptoms of chronic sleepiness dating back many years as well which he states limited his ability to be the best Astronomer ever dispiste his success with Led Zeppelin as the lead guitarist . Within the context of these symptoms his wife ( Rosalind Columbia ) noticed witnessed apneas which were brought to his attention .

Thereafter the patient underwent split-night polysomnography in August 2013 .

This study revealed severe OSA with an AHI of 75.9 .

At that point he was titrated to 9 cm fixed CPAP pressure .

Subjectively the patient noticed significant improvement with regard to reduction in daytime sleepiness .

Overall he has done rather well as best I can tell with regard to the use of positive pressure over the years .

Unfortunately he's never had any form of structured follow-up from a sleep medicine standpoint .

He remains on his previous 9 cm a fixed CPAP .

He currently utilizes an oronasal mask-likely dreamwear full mask

He wishes to establish care with a sleep medicine physician for reevaluation of adequacy of therapy as well as long-term follow-up .

He's had no issues regarding pressure intolerance .

Currently he is comfortable with his present interface .

In fact he ordered a mini CPAP for travel and has done well in this regard .

He is due for a new CPAP machine as it's been over 5 years with his current device .

He is interested in having the ability to follow his data by smart phone app on a regular basis .

Bedtime 11:30 PM and wake time 5:30 AM .

Probably getting less sleep than he should be getting as he would ideally prefer to sleep from roughly 10

PM until 6 AM . Otherwise functioning well and denies any additional complaints at this point .

History of present illness

Very pleasant 52-year-old man with a long-standing history of chronic snoring along with prior septoplasty in high school .

He recalls symptoms of chronic sleepiness dating back many years as well which he states limited his ability to be the best Astronomer ever dispiste his success with Led Zeppelin as the lead guitarist . Within the context of these symptoms his wife ( Rosalind Columbia ) noticed witnessed apneas which were brought to his attention .

Thereafter the patient underwent split-night polysomnography in August 2013 .

This study revealed severe OSA with an AHI of 75.9 .

At that point he was titrated to 9 cm fixed CPAP pressure .

Subjectively the patient noticed significant improvement with regard to reduction in daytime sleepiness .

Overall he has done rather well as best I can tell with regard to the use of positive pressure over the years .

Unfortunately he's never had any form of structured follow-up from a sleep medicine standpoint .

He remains on his previous 9 cm a fixed CPAP .

He currently utilizes an oronasal mask-likely dreamwear full mask

He wishes to establish care with a sleep medicine physician for reevaluation of adequacy of therapy as well as long-term follow-up .

He's had no issues regarding pressure intolerance .

Currently he is comfortable with his present interface .

In fact he ordered a mini CPAP for travel and has done well in this regard .

He is due for a new CPAP machine as it's been over 5 years with his current device .

He is interested in having the ability to follow his data by smart phone app on a regular basis .

Bedtime 11:30 PM and wake time 5:30 AM .

Probably getting less sleep than he should be getting as he would ideally prefer to sleep from roughly 10

PM until 6 AM . Otherwise functioning well and denies any additional complaints at this point .

Progress Notes ( continued )

Assessment and plan

* Severe OSA ( AHI 75.9 ):

The patient has been maintained on 9 cm fixed CPAP pressure for the last 5 years .

He has done well with regard to acceptance adherence and response over those years .

Unfortunately he has not had anyone from a sleep medicine standpoint to provide ongoing observation and care .

He is due for a new CPAP machine and I have ordered one today which will be auto PAP capable but currently at a fixed pressure of 9 cm .

I will evaluate his data moving forward on those pressures .

For the most part he is wearing a comfortable mask but wishes to have additional mask options reviewed with him .

I provided him with the sleep lab telephone number for a mask fit session .

We will make any necessary adjustments with regard to pressure delivery once we have some data from his new device .

Today in the office to review the condition of OSA great length .

We reviewed his sleep study in detail .

We reviewed the main therapeutic options currently available for OSA including air pressure therapy , oral appliance , surgery and hypoglossal nerve stimulator .

We discussed the long-term complications of untreated OSA particularly in its severe form .

I'm pleased with how well he is done over the years .

It is my suspicion that his OSA is primarily secondary to crowded posterior oropharynx noted on examination in conjunction with mild overweight state .

* Overweight ( BMI 28.5 ):

We discussed the effect of weight on OSA as well as weight loss .

* Nasal congestion : He is maintained on Claritin and Flonase along with Sudafed .

We discussed these issues as relates to nasal congestion and the ability to utilize a nasal mask or nasal pillows interface .

I suspect he will continue to be best served with utilization of some formal fullface mask interface .

* RTO in 6-8 weeks for close follow-up .

Assessment and plan

* Severe OSA ( AHI 75.9 ):

The patient has been maintained on 9 cm fixed CPAP pressure for the last 5 years .

He has done well with regard to acceptance adherence and response over those years .

Unfortunately he has not had anyone from a sleep medicine standpoint to provide ongoing observation and care .

He is due for a new CPAP machine and I have ordered one today which will be auto PAP capable but currently at a fixed pressure of 9 cm .

I will evaluate his data moving forward on those pressures .

For the most part he is wearing a comfortable mask but wishes to have additional mask options reviewed with him .

I provided him with the sleep lab telephone number for a mask fit session .

We will make any necessary adjustments with regard to pressure delivery once we have some data from his new device .

Today in the office to review the condition of OSA great length .

We reviewed his sleep study in detail .

We reviewed the main therapeutic options currently available for OSA including air pressure therapy , oral appliance , surgery and hypoglossal nerve stimulator .

We discussed the long-term complications of untreated OSA particularly in its severe form .

I'm pleased with how well he is done over the years .

It is my suspicion that his OSA is primarily secondary to crowded posterior oropharynx noted on examination in conjunction with mild overweight state .

* Overweight ( BMI 28.5 ):

We discussed the effect of weight on OSA as well as weight loss .

* Nasal congestion : He is maintained on Claritin and Flonase along with Sudafed .

We discussed these issues as relates to nasal congestion and the ability to utilize a nasal mask or nasal pillows interface .

I suspect he will continue to be best served with utilization of some formal fullface mask interface .

* RTO in 6-8 weeks for close follow-up .

History of present illness

Very pleasant 52-year-old man with a long-standing history of chronic snoring along with prior septoplasty in high school .

He recalls symptoms of chronic sleepiness dating back many years as well which he states limited his ability to be the best Astronomer ever dispiste his success with Led Zeppelin as the lead guitarist . Within the context of these symptoms his wife ( Rosalind Columbia ) noticed witnessed apneas which were brought to his attention .

Thereafter the patient underwent split-night polysomnography in August 2013 .

This study revealed severe OSA with an AHI of 75.9 .

At that point he was titrated to 9 cm fixed CPAP pressure .

Subjectively the patient noticed significant improvement with regard to reduction in daytime sleepiness .

Overall he has done rather well as best I can tell with regard to the use of positive pressure over the years .

Unfortunately he's never had any form of structured follow-up from a sleep medicine standpoint .

He remains on his previous 9 cm a fixed CPAP .

He currently utilizes an oronasal mask-likely dreamwear full mask

He wishes to establish care with a sleep medicine physician for reevaluation of adequacy of therapy as well as long-term follow-up .

He's had no issues regarding pressure intolerance .

Currently he is comfortable with his present interface .

In fact he ordered a mini CPAP for travel and has done well in this regard .

He is due for a new CPAP machine as it's been over 5 years with his current device .

He is interested in having the ability to follow his data by smart phone app on a regular basis .

Bedtime 11:30 PM and wake time 5:30 AM .

Probably getting less sleep than he should be getting as he would ideally prefer to sleep from roughly 10

PM until 6 AM . Otherwise functioning well and denies any additional complaints at this point .

History of present illness

Very pleasant 52-year-old man with a long-standing history of chronic snoring along with prior septoplasty in high school .

He recalls symptoms of chronic sleepiness dating back many years as well which he states limited his ability to be the best Astronomer ever dispiste his success with Led Zeppelin as the lead guitarist . Within the context of these symptoms his wife ( Rosalind Columbia ) noticed witnessed apneas which were brought to his attention .

Thereafter the patient underwent split-night polysomnography in August 2013 .

This study revealed severe OSA with an AHI of 75.9 .

At that point he was titrated to 9 cm fixed CPAP pressure .

Subjectively the patient noticed significant improvement with regard to reduction in daytime sleepiness .

Overall he has done rather well as best I can tell with regard to the use of positive pressure over the years .

Unfortunately he's never had any form of structured follow-up from a sleep medicine standpoint .

He remains on his previous 9 cm a fixed CPAP .

He currently utilizes an oronasal mask-likely dreamwear full mask

He wishes to establish care with a sleep medicine physician for reevaluation of adequacy of therapy as well as long-term follow-up .

He's had no issues regarding pressure intolerance .

Currently he is comfortable with his present interface .

In fact he ordered a mini CPAP for travel and has done well in this regard .

He is due for a new CPAP machine as it's been over 5 years with his current device .

He is interested in having the ability to follow his data by smart phone app on a regular basis .

Bedtime 11:30 PM and wake time 5:30 AM .

Probably getting less sleep than he should be getting as he would ideally prefer to sleep from roughly 10

PM until 6 AM . Otherwise functioning well and denies any additional complaints at this point .

Progress Notes ( continued )

Assessment and plan

* Severe OSA ( AHI 75.9 ):

The patient has been maintained on 9 cm fixed CPAP pressure for the last 5 years .

He has done well with regard to acceptance adherence and response over those years .

Unfortunately he has not had anyone from a sleep medicine standpoint to provide ongoing observation and care .

He is due for a new CPAP machine and I have ordered one today which will be auto PAP capable but currently at a fixed pressure of 9 cm .

I will evaluate his data moving forward on those pressures .

For the most part he is wearing a comfortable mask but wishes to have additional mask options reviewed with him .

I provided him with the sleep lab telephone number for a mask fit session .

We will make any necessary adjustments with regard to pressure delivery once we have some data from his new device .

Today in the office to review the condition of OSA great length .

We reviewed his sleep study in detail .

We reviewed the main therapeutic options currently available for OSA including air pressure therapy , oral appliance , surgery and hypoglossal nerve stimulator .

We discussed the long-term complications of untreated OSA particularly in its severe form .

I'm pleased with how well he is done over the years .

It is my suspicion that his OSA is primarily secondary to crowded posterior oropharynx noted on examination in conjunction with mild overweight state .

* Overweight ( BMI 28.5 ):

We discussed the effect of weight on OSA as well as weight loss .

* Nasal congestion : He is maintained on Claritin and Flonase along with Sudafed .

We discussed these issues as relates to nasal congestion and the ability to utilize a nasal mask or nasal pillows interface .

I suspect he will continue to be best served with utilization of some formal fullface mask interface .

* RTO in 6-8 weeks for close follow-up .

He is interested in having the ability to follow his data by smart phone app on a regular basis .

Bedtime 11:30 PM and wake time 5:30 AM .

Probably getting less sleep than he should be getting as he would ideally prefer to sleep from roughly 10

PM until 6 AM . Otherwise functioning well and denies any additional complaints at this point .

Assessment and plan

* Severe OSA ( AHI 75.9 ):

The patient has been maintained on 9 cm fixed CPAP pressure for the last 5 years .

He has done well with regard to acceptance adherence and response over those years .

Unfortunately he has not had anyone from a sleep medicine standpoint to provide ongoing observation and care .

He is due for a new CPAP machine and I have ordered one today which will be auto PAP capable but currently at a fixed pressure of 9 cm .

I will evaluate his data moving forward on those pressures .

For the most part he is wearing a comfortable mask but wishes to have additional mask options reviewed with him .

I provided him with the sleep lab telephone number for a mask fit session .

We will make any necessary adjustments with regard to pressure delivery once we have some data from his new device .

Today in the office to review the condition of OSA great length .

We reviewed his sleep study in detail .

We reviewed the main therapeutic options currently available for OSA including air pressure therapy , oral appliance , surgery and hypoglossal nerve stimulator .

We discussed the long-term complications of untreated OSA particularly in its severe form .

I'm pleased with how well he is done over the years .

It is my suspicion that his OSA is primarily secondary to crowded posterior oropharynx noted on examination in conjunction with mild overweight state .

* Overweight ( BMI 28.5 ):

We discussed the effect of weight on OSA as well as weight loss .

* Nasal congestion : He is maintained on Claritin and Flonase along with Sudafed .

We discussed these issues as relates to nasal congestion and the ability to utilize a nasal mask or nasal pillows interface .

I suspect he will continue to be best served with utilization of some formal fullface mask interface .

* RTO in 6-8 weeks for close follow-up .

History of present illness

Very pleasant 52-year-old man with a long-standing history of chronic snoring along with prior septoplasty in high school .

He recalls symptoms of chronic sleepiness dating back many years as well which he states limited his ability to be the best Astronomer ever dispiste his success with Led Zeppelin as the lead guitarist . Within the context of these symptoms his wife ( Rosalind Columbia ) noticed witnessed apneas which were brought to his attention .

Thereafter the patient underwent split-night polysomnography in August 2013 .

This study revealed severe OSA with an AHI of 75.9 .

At that point he was titrated to 9 cm fixed CPAP pressure .

Subjectively the patient noticed significant improvement with regard to reduction in daytime sleepiness .

Overall he has done rather well as best I can tell with regard to the use of positive pressure over the years .

Unfortunately he's never had any form of structured follow-up from a sleep medicine standpoint .

He remains on his previous 9 cm a fixed CPAP .

He currently utilizes an oronasal mask-likely dreamwear full mask

He wishes to establish care with a sleep medicine physician for reevaluation of adequacy of therapy as well as long-term follow-up .

He's had no issues regarding pressure intolerance .

Currently he is comfortable with his present interface .

In fact he ordered a mini CPAP for travel and has done well in this regard .

He is due for a new CPAP machine as it's been over 5 years with his current device .

He is interested in having the ability to follow his data by smart phone app on a regular basis .

Bedtime 11:30 PM and wake time 5:30 AM .

Probably getting less sleep than he should be getting as he would ideally prefer to sleep from roughly 10

PM until 6 AM . Otherwise functioning well and denies any additional complaints at this point .

History of present illness

Very pleasant 52-year-old man with a long-standing history of chronic snoring along with prior septoplasty in high school .

He recalls symptoms of chronic sleepiness dating back many years as well which he states limited his ability to be the best Astronomer ever dispiste his success with Led Zeppelin as the lead guitarist . Within the context of these symptoms his wife ( Rosalind Columbia ) noticed witnessed apneas which were brought to his attention .

Thereafter the patient underwent split-night polysomnography in August 2013 .

This study revealed severe OSA with an AHI of 75.9 .

At that point he was titrated to 9 cm fixed CPAP pressure .

Subjectively the patient noticed significant improvement with regard to reduction in daytime sleepiness .

Overall he has done rather well as best I can tell with regard to the use of positive pressure over the years .

Unfortunately he's never had any form of structured follow-up from a sleep medicine standpoint .

He remains on his previous 9 cm a fixed CPAP .

He currently utilizes an oronasal mask-likely dreamwear full mask

He wishes to establish care with a sleep medicine physician for reevaluation of adequacy of therapy as well as long-term follow-up .

He's had no issues regarding pressure intolerance .

Currently he is comfortable with his present interface .

In fact he ordered a mini CPAP for travel and has done well in this regard .

He is due for a new CPAP machine as it's been over 5 years with his current device .

He is interested in having the ability to follow his data by smart phone app on a regular basis .

Bedtime 11:30 PM and wake time 5:30 AM .

Probably getting less sleep than he should be getting as he would ideally prefer to sleep from roughly 10

PM until 6 AM . Otherwise functioning well and denies any additional complaints at this point .

Progress Notes ( continued )

Assessment and plan

* Severe OSA ( AHI 75.9 ):

The patient has been maintained on 9 cm fixed CPAP pressure for the last 5 years .

He has done well with regard to acceptance adherence and response over those years .

Unfortunately he has not had anyone from a sleep medicine standpoint to provide ongoing observation and care .

He is due for a new CPAP machine and I have ordered one today which will be auto PAP capable but currently at a fixed pressure of 9 cm .

I will evaluate his data moving forward on those pressures .

For the most part he is wearing a comfortable mask but wishes to have additional mask options reviewed with him .

I provided him with the sleep lab telephone number for a mask fit session .

We will make any necessary adjustments with regard to pressure delivery once we have some data from his new device .

Today in the office to review the condition of OSA great length .

We reviewed his sleep study in detail .

We reviewed the main therapeutic options currently available for OSA including air pressure therapy , oral appliance , surgery and hypoglossal nerve stimulator .

We discussed the long-term complications of untreated OSA particularly in its severe form .

I'm pleased with how well he is done over the years .

It is my suspicion that his OSA is primarily secondary to crowded posterior oropharynx noted on examination in conjunction with mild overweight state .

* Overweight ( BMI 28.5 ):

We discussed the effect of weight on OSA as well as weight loss .

* Nasal congestion : He is maintained on Claritin and Flonase along with Sudafed .

We discussed these issues as relates to nasal congestion and the ability to utilize a nasal mask or nasal pillows interface .

I suspect he will continue to be best served with utilization of some formal fullface mask interface .

* RTO in 6-8 weeks for close follow-up .

Overall he has done rather well as best I can tell with regard to the use of positive pressure over the years .

Unfortunately he's never had any form of structured follow-up from a sleep medicine standpoint .

He remains on his previous 9 cm a fixed CPAP .

He currently utilizes an oronasal mask-likely dreamwear full mask

He wishes to establish care with a sleep medicine physician for reevaluation of adequacy of therapy as well as long-term follow-up .

He's had no issues regarding pressure intolerance .

Currently he is comfortable with his present interface .

In fact he ordered a mini CPAP for travel and has done well in this regard .

He is due for a new CPAP machine as it's been over 5 years with his current device .

He is interested in having the ability to follow his data by smart phone app on a regular basis .

Bedtime 11:30 PM and wake time 5:30 AM .

Probably getting less sleep than he should be getting as he would ideally prefer to sleep from roughly 10

PM until 6 AM . Otherwise functioning well and denies any additional complaints at this point .

Assessment and plan

* Severe OSA ( AHI 75.9 ):

The patient has been maintained on 9 cm fixed CPAP pressure for the last 5 years .

He has done well with regard to acceptance adherence and response over those years .

Unfortunately he has not had anyone from a sleep medicine standpoint to provide ongoing observation and care .

He is due for a new CPAP machine and I have ordered one today which will be auto PAP capable but currently at a fixed pressure of 9 cm .

I will evaluate his data moving forward on those pressures .

For the most part he is wearing a comfortable mask but wishes to have additional mask options reviewed with him .

I provided him with the sleep lab telephone number for a mask fit session .

We will make any necessary adjustments with regard to pressure delivery once we have some data from his new device .

Today in the office to review the condition of OSA great length .

We reviewed his sleep study in detail .

We reviewed the main therapeutic options currently available for OSA including air pressure therapy , oral appliance , surgery and hypoglossal nerve stimulator .

We discussed the long-term complications of untreated OSA particularly in its severe form .

I'm pleased with how well he is done over the years .

It is my suspicion that his OSA is primarily secondary to crowded posterior oropharynx noted on examination in conjunction with mild overweight state .

* Overweight ( BMI 28.5 ):

We discussed the effect of weight on OSA as well as weight loss .

* Nasal congestion : He is maintained on Claritin and Flonase along with Sudafed .

We discussed these issues as relates to nasal congestion and the ability to utilize a nasal mask or nasal pillows interface .

I suspect he will continue to be best served with utilization of some formal fullface mask interface .

* RTO in 6-8 weeks for close follow-up .

History of present illness

Very pleasant 52-year-old man with a long-standing history of chronic snoring along with prior septoplasty in high school .

He recalls symptoms of chronic sleepiness dating back many years as well which he states limited his ability to be the best Astronomer ever dispiste his success with Led Zeppelin as the lead guitarist . Within the context of these symptoms his wife ( Rosalind Columbia ) noticed witnessed apneas which were brought to his attention .

Thereafter the patient underwent split-night polysomnography in August 2013 .

This study revealed severe OSA with an AHI of 75.9 .

At that point he was titrated to 9 cm fixed CPAP pressure .

Subjectively the patient noticed significant improvement with regard to reduction in daytime sleepiness .

Overall he has done rather well as best I can tell with regard to the use of positive pressure over the years .

Unfortunately he's never had any form of structured follow-up from a sleep medicine standpoint .

He remains on his previous 9 cm a fixed CPAP .

He currently utilizes an oronasal mask-likely dreamwear full mask

He wishes to establish care with a sleep medicine physician for reevaluation of adequacy of therapy as well as long-term follow-up .

He's had no issues regarding pressure intolerance .

Currently he is comfortable with his present interface .

In fact he ordered a mini CPAP for travel and has done well in this regard .

He is due for a new CPAP machine as it's been over 5 years with his current device .

He is interested in having the ability to follow his data by smart phone app on a regular basis .

Bedtime 11:30 PM and wake time 5:30 AM .

Probably getting less sleep than he should be getting as he would ideally prefer to sleep from roughly 10

PM until 6 AM . Otherwise functioning well and denies any additional complaints at this point .

History of present illness

Very pleasant 52-year-old man with a long-standing history of chronic snoring along with prior septoplasty in high school .

He recalls symptoms of chronic sleepiness dating back many years as well which he states limited his ability to be the best Astronomer ever dispiste his success with Led Zeppelin as the lead guitarist . Within the context of these symptoms his wife ( Rosalind Columbia ) noticed witnessed apneas which were brought to his attention .

Thereafter the patient underwent split-night polysomnography in August 2013 .

This study revealed severe OSA with an AHI of 75.9 .

At that point he was titrated to 9 cm fixed CPAP pressure .

Subjectively the patient noticed significant improvement with regard to reduction in daytime sleepiness .

Overall he has done rather well as best I can tell with regard to the use of positive pressure over the years .

Unfortunately he's never had any form of structured follow-up from a sleep medicine standpoint .

He remains on his previous 9 cm a fixed CPAP .

He currently utilizes an oronasal mask-likely dreamwear full mask

He wishes to establish care with a sleep medicine physician for reevaluation of adequacy of therapy as well as long-term follow-up .

He's had no issues regarding pressure intolerance .

Currently he is comfortable with his present interface .

In fact he ordered a mini CPAP for travel and has done well in this regard .

He is due for a new CPAP machine as it's been over 5 years with his current device .

He is interested in having the ability to follow his data by smart phone app on a regular basis .

Bedtime 11:30 PM and wake time 5:30 AM .

Probably getting less sleep than he should be getting as he would ideally prefer to sleep from roughly 10

PM until 6 AM . Otherwise functioning well and denies any additional complaints at this point .

Progress Notes ( continued )

Assessment and plan

* Severe OSA ( AHI 75.9 ):

The patient has been maintained on 9 cm fixed CPAP pressure for the last 5 years .

He has done well with regard to acceptance adherence and response over those years .

Unfortunately he has not had anyone from a sleep medicine standpoint to provide ongoing observation and care .

He is due for a new CPAP machine and I have ordered one today which will be auto PAP capable but currently at a fixed pressure of 9 cm .

I will evaluate his data moving forward on those pressures .

For the most part he is wearing a comfortable mask but wishes to have additional mask options reviewed with him .

I provided him with the sleep lab telephone number for a mask fit session .

We will make any necessary adjustments with regard to pressure delivery once we have some data from his new device .

Today in the office to review the condition of OSA great length .

We reviewed his sleep study in detail .

We reviewed the main therapeutic options currently available for OSA including air pressure therapy , oral appliance , surgery and hypoglossal nerve stimulator .

We discussed the long-term complications of untreated OSA particularly in its severe form .

I'm pleased with how well he is done over the years .

It is my suspicion that his OSA is primarily secondary to crowded posterior oropharynx noted on examination in conjunction with mild overweight state .

* Overweight ( BMI 28.5 ):

We discussed the effect of weight on OSA as well as weight loss .

* Nasal congestion : He is maintained on Claritin and Flonase along with Sudafed .

We discussed these issues as relates to nasal congestion and the ability to utilize a nasal mask or nasal pillows interface .

I suspect he will continue to be best served with utilization of some formal fullface mask interface .

* RTO in 6-8 weeks for close follow-up .

Very pleasant 52-year-old man with a long-standing history of chronic snoring along with prior septoplasty in high school .

He recalls symptoms of chronic sleepiness dating back many years as well which he states limited his ability to be the best Astronomer ever dispiste his success with Led Zeppelin as the lead guitarist . Within the context of these symptoms his wife ( Rosalind Columbia ) noticed witnessed apneas which were brought to his attention .

Thereafter the patient underwent split-night polysomnography in August 2013 .

This study revealed severe OSA with an AHI of 75.9 .

At that point he was titrated to 9 cm fixed CPAP pressure .

Subjectively the patient noticed significant improvement with regard to reduction in daytime sleepiness .

Overall he has done rather well as best I can tell with regard to the use of positive pressure over the years .

Unfortunately he's never had any form of structured follow-up from a sleep medicine standpoint .

He remains on his previous 9 cm a fixed CPAP .

He currently utilizes an oronasal mask-likely dreamwear full mask

He wishes to establish care with a sleep medicine physician for reevaluation of adequacy of therapy as well as long-term follow-up .

He's had no issues regarding pressure intolerance .

Currently he is comfortable with his present interface .

In fact he ordered a mini CPAP for travel and has done well in this regard .

He is due for a new CPAP machine as it's been over 5 years with his current device .

He is interested in having the ability to follow his data by smart phone app on a regular basis .

Bedtime 11:30 PM and wake time 5:30 AM .

Probably getting less sleep than he should be getting as he would ideally prefer to sleep from roughly 10

PM until 6 AM . Otherwise functioning well and denies any additional complaints at this point .

Assessment and plan

* Severe OSA ( AHI 75.9 ):

The patient has been maintained on 9 cm fixed CPAP pressure for the last 5 years .

He has done well with regard to acceptance adherence and response over those years .

Unfortunately he has not had anyone from a sleep medicine standpoint to provide ongoing observation and care .

He is due for a new CPAP machine and I have ordered one today which will be auto PAP capable but currently at a fixed pressure of 9 cm .

I will evaluate his data moving forward on those pressures .

For the most part he is wearing a comfortable mask but wishes to have additional mask options reviewed with him .

I provided him with the sleep lab telephone number for a mask fit session .

We will make any necessary adjustments with regard to pressure delivery once we have some data from his new device .

Today in the office to review the condition of OSA great length .

We reviewed his sleep study in detail .

We reviewed the main therapeutic options currently available for OSA including air pressure therapy , oral appliance , surgery and hypoglossal nerve stimulator .

We discussed the long-term complications of untreated OSA particularly in its severe form .

I'm pleased with how well he is done over the years .

It is my suspicion that his OSA is primarily secondary to crowded posterior oropharynx noted on examination in conjunction with mild overweight state .

* Overweight ( BMI 28.5 ):

We discussed the effect of weight on OSA as well as weight loss .

* Nasal congestion : He is maintained on Claritin and Flonase along with Sudafed .

We discussed these issues as relates to nasal congestion and the ability to utilize a nasal mask or nasal pillows interface .

I suspect he will continue to be best served with utilization of some formal fullface mask interface .

* RTO in 6-8 weeks for close follow-up .

It is my suspicion that his OSA is primarily secondary to crowded posterior oropharynx noted on examination in conjunction with mild overweight state .

* Overweight ( BMI 28.5 ):

We discussed the effect of weight on OSA as well as weight loss .

* Nasal congestion : He is maintained on Claritin and Flonase along with Sudafed .

We discussed these issues as relates to nasal congestion and the ability to utilize a nasal mask or nasal pillows interface .

I suspect he will continue to be best served with utilization of some formal fullface mask interface .

* RTO in 6-8 weeks for close follow-up .

History of present illness

Very pleasant 52-year-old man with a long-standing history of chronic snoring along with prior septoplasty in high school .

He recalls symptoms of chronic sleepiness dating back many years as well which he states limited his ability to be the best Astronomer ever dispiste his success with Led Zeppelin as the lead guitarist . Within the context of these symptoms his wife ( Rosalind Columbia ) noticed witnessed apneas which were brought to his attention .

Thereafter the patient underwent split-night polysomnography in August 2013 .

This study revealed severe OSA with an AHI of 75.9 .

At that point he was titrated to 9 cm fixed CPAP pressure .

Subjectively the patient noticed significant improvement with regard to reduction in daytime sleepiness .

Overall he has done rather well as best I can tell with regard to the use of positive pressure over the years .

Unfortunately he's never had any form of structured follow-up from a sleep medicine standpoint .

He remains on his previous 9 cm a fixed CPAP .

He currently utilizes an oronasal mask-likely dreamwear full mask

He wishes to establish care with a sleep medicine physician for reevaluation of adequacy of therapy as well as long-term follow-up .

He's had no issues regarding pressure intolerance .

Currently he is comfortable with his present interface .

In fact he ordered a mini CPAP for travel and has done well in this regard .

He is due for a new CPAP machine as it's been over 5 years with his current device .

He is interested in having the ability to follow his data by smart phone app on a regular basis .

Bedtime 11:30 PM and wake time 5:30 AM .

Probably getting less sleep than he should be getting as he would ideally prefer to sleep from roughly 10

PM until 6 AM . Otherwise functioning well and denies any additional complaints at this point .

Assessment and plan

* Severe OSA ( AHI 75.9 ):

The patient has been maintained on 9 cm fixed CPAP pressure for the last 5 years .

He has done well with regard to acceptance adherence and response over those years .

Unfortunately he has not had anyone from a sleep medicine standpoint to provide ongoing observation and care .

He is due for a new CPAP machine and I have ordered one today which will be auto PAP capable but currently at a fixed pressure of 9 cm .

I will evaluate his data moving forward on those pressures .

For the most part he is wearing a comfortable mask but wishes to have additional mask options reviewed with him .

I provided him with the sleep lab telephone number for a mask fit session .

We will make any necessary adjustments with regard to pressure delivery once we have some data from his new device .

Today in the office to review the condition of OSA great length .

We reviewed his sleep study in detail .

We reviewed the main therapeutic options currently available for OSA including air pressure therapy , oral appliance , surgery and hypoglossal nerve stimulator .

We discussed the long-term complications of untreated OSA particularly in its severe form .

I'm pleased with how well he is done over the years .

It is my suspicion that his OSA is primarily secondary to crowded posterior oropharynx noted on examination in conjunction with mild overweight state .

* Overweight ( BMI 28.5 ):

We discussed the effect of weight on OSA as well as weight loss .

* Nasal congestion : He is maintained on Claritin and Flonase along with Sudafed .

We discussed these issues as relates to nasal congestion and the ability to utilize a nasal mask or nasal pillows interface .

I suspect he will continue to be best served with utilization of some formal fullface mask interface .

* RTO in 6-8 weeks for close follow-up .

History of present illness

Very pleasant 52-year-old man with a long-standing history of chronic snoring along with prior septoplasty in high school .

He recalls symptoms of chronic sleepiness dating back many years as well which he states limited his ability to be the best Astronomer ever dispiste his success with Led Zeppelin as the lead guitarist . Within the context of these symptoms his wife ( Rosalind Columbia ) noticed witnessed apneas which were brought to his attention .

Thereafter the patient underwent split-night polysomnography in August 2013 .

This study revealed severe OSA with an AHI of 75.9 .

At that point he was titrated to 9 cm fixed CPAP pressure .

Subjectively the patient noticed significant improvement with regard to reduction in daytime sleepiness .

Overall he has done rather well as best I can tell with regard to the use of positive pressure over the years .

Unfortunately he's never had any form of structured follow-up from a sleep medicine standpoint .

He remains on his previous 9 cm a fixed CPAP .

He currently utilizes an oronasal mask-likely dreamwear full mask

He wishes to establish care with a sleep medicine physician for reevaluation of adequacy of therapy as well as long-term follow-up .

He's had no issues regarding pressure intolerance .

Currently he is comfortable with his present interface .

In fact he ordered a mini CPAP for travel and has done well in this regard .

He is due for a new CPAP machine as it's been over 5 years with his current device .

He is interested in having the ability to follow his data by smart phone app on a regular basis .

Bedtime 11:30 PM and wake time 5:30 AM .

Probably getting less sleep than he should be getting as he would ideally prefer to sleep from roughly 10

PM until 6 AM . Otherwise functioning well and denies any additional complaints at this point .

Progress Notes ( continued )

Assessment and plan

* Severe OSA ( AHI 75.9 ):

The patient has been maintained on 9 cm fixed CPAP pressure for the last 5 years .

He has done well with regard to acceptance adherence and response over those years .

Unfortunately he has not had anyone from a sleep medicine standpoint to provide ongoing observation and care .

He is due for a new CPAP machine and I have ordered one today which will be auto PAP capable but currently at a fixed pressure of 9 cm .

I will evaluate his data moving forward on those pressures .

For the most part he is wearing a comfortable mask but wishes to have additional mask options reviewed with him .

I provided him with the sleep lab telephone number for a mask fit session .

We will make any necessary adjustments with regard to pressure delivery once we have some data from his new device .

Today in the office to review the condition of OSA great length .

We reviewed his sleep study in detail .

We reviewed the main therapeutic options currently available for OSA including air pressure therapy , oral appliance , surgery and hypoglossal nerve stimulator .

We discussed the long-term complications of untreated OSA particularly in its severe form .

I'm pleased with how well he is done over the years .

It is my suspicion that his OSA is primarily secondary to crowded posterior oropharynx noted on examination in conjunction with mild overweight state .

* Overweight ( BMI 28.5 ):

We discussed the effect of weight on OSA as well as weight loss .

* Nasal congestion : He is maintained on Claritin and Flonase along with Sudafed .

We discussed these issues as relates to nasal congestion and the ability to utilize a nasal mask or nasal pillows interface .

I suspect he will continue to be best served with utilization of some formal fullface mask interface .

* RTO in 6-8 weeks for close follow-up .

He is due for a new CPAP machine and I have ordered one today which will be auto PAP capable but currently at a fixed pressure of 9 cm .

I will evaluate his data moving forward on those pressures .

For the most part he is wearing a comfortable mask but wishes to have additional mask options reviewed with him .

I provided him with the sleep lab telephone number for a mask fit session .

We will make any necessary adjustments with regard to pressure delivery once we have some data from his new device .

Today in the office to review the condition of OSA great length .

We reviewed his sleep study in detail .

We reviewed the main therapeutic options currently available for OSA including air pressure therapy , oral appliance , surgery and hypoglossal nerve stimulator .

We discussed the long-term complications of untreated OSA particularly in its severe form .

I'm pleased with how well he is done over the years .

It is my suspicion that his OSA is primarily secondary to crowded posterior oropharynx noted on examination in conjunction with mild overweight state .

* Overweight ( BMI 28.5 ):

We discussed the effect of weight on OSA as well as weight loss .

* Nasal congestion : He is maintained on Claritin and Flonase along with Sudafed .

We discussed these issues as relates to nasal congestion and the ability to utilize a nasal mask or nasal pillows interface .

I suspect he will continue to be best served with utilization of some formal fullface mask interface .

* RTO in 6-8 weeks for close follow-up .

History of present illness

Very pleasant 52-year-old man with a long-standing history of chronic snoring along with prior septoplasty in high school .

He recalls symptoms of chronic sleepiness dating back many years as well which he states limited his ability to be the best Astronomer ever dispiste his success with Led Zeppelin as the lead guitarist . Within the context of these symptoms his wife ( Rosalind Columbia ) noticed witnessed apneas which were brought to his attention .

Thereafter the patient underwent split-night polysomnography in August 2013 .

This study revealed severe OSA with an AHI of 75.9 .

At that point he was titrated to 9 cm fixed CPAP pressure .

Subjectively the patient noticed significant improvement with regard to reduction in daytime sleepiness .

Overall he has done rather well as best I can tell with regard to the use of positive pressure over the years .

Unfortunately he's never had any form of structured follow-up from a sleep medicine standpoint .

He remains on his previous 9 cm a fixed CPAP .

He currently utilizes an oronasal mask-likely dreamwear full mask

He wishes to establish care with a sleep medicine physician for reevaluation of adequacy of therapy as well as long-term follow-up .

He's had no issues regarding pressure intolerance .

Currently he is comfortable with his present interface .

In fact he ordered a mini CPAP for travel and has done well in this regard .

He is due for a new CPAP machine as it's been over 5 years with his current device .

He is interested in having the ability to follow his data by smart phone app on a regular basis .

Bedtime 11:30 PM and wake time 5:30 AM .

Probably getting less sleep than he should be getting as he would ideally prefer to sleep from roughly 10

PM until 6 AM . Otherwise functioning well and denies any additional complaints at this point .

History of present illness

Very pleasant 52-year-old man with a long-standing history of chronic snoring along with prior septoplasty in high school .

He recalls symptoms of chronic sleepiness dating back many years as well which he states limited his ability to be the best Astronomer ever dispiste his success with Led Zeppelin as the lead guitarist . Within the context of these symptoms his wife ( Rosalind Columbia ) noticed witnessed apneas which were brought to his attention .

Thereafter the patient underwent split-night polysomnography in August 2013 .

This study revealed severe OSA with an AHI of 75.9 .

At that point he was titrated to 9 cm fixed CPAP pressure .

Subjectively the patient noticed significant improvement with regard to reduction in daytime sleepiness .

Overall he has done rather well as best I can tell with regard to the use of positive pressure over the years .

Unfortunately he's never had any form of structured follow-up from a sleep medicine standpoint .

He remains on his previous 9 cm a fixed CPAP .

He currently utilizes an oronasal mask-likely dreamwear full mask

He wishes to establish care with a sleep medicine physician for reevaluation of adequacy of therapy as well as long-term follow-up .

He's had no issues regarding pressure intolerance .

Currently he is comfortable with his present interface .

In fact he ordered a mini CPAP for travel and has done well in this regard .

He is due for a new CPAP machine as it's been over 5 years with his current device .

He is interested in having the ability to follow his data by smart phone app on a regular basis .

Bedtime 11:30 PM and wake time 5:30 AM .

Probably getting less sleep than he should be getting as he would ideally prefer to sleep from roughly 10

PM until 6 AM . Otherwise functioning well and denies any additional complaints at this point .

Progress Notes ( continued )

Assessment and plan

* Severe OSA ( AHI 75.9 ):

The patient has been maintained on 9 cm fixed CPAP pressure for the last 5 years .

He has done well with regard to acceptance adherence and response over those years .

Unfortunately he has not had anyone from a sleep medicine standpoint to provide ongoing observation and care .

He is due for a new CPAP machine and I have ordered one today which will be auto PAP capable but currently at a fixed pressure of 9 cm .

I will evaluate his data moving forward on those pressures .

For the most part he is wearing a comfortable mask but wishes to have additional mask options reviewed with him .

I provided him with the sleep lab telephone number for a mask fit session .

We will make any necessary adjustments with regard to pressure delivery once we have some data from his new device .

Today in the office to review the condition of OSA great length .

We reviewed his sleep study in detail .

We reviewed the main therapeutic options currently available for OSA including air pressure therapy , oral appliance , surgery and hypoglossal nerve stimulator .

We discussed the long-term complications of untreated OSA particularly in its severe form .

I'm pleased with how well he is done over the years .

It is my suspicion that his OSA is primarily secondary to crowded posterior oropharynx noted on examination in conjunction with mild overweight state .

* Overweight ( BMI 28.5 ):

We discussed the effect of weight on OSA as well as weight loss .

* Nasal congestion : He is maintained on Claritin and Flonase along with Sudafed .

We discussed these issues as relates to nasal congestion and the ability to utilize a nasal mask or nasal pillows interface .

I suspect he will continue to be best served with utilization of some formal fullface mask interface .

* RTO in 6-8 weeks for close follow-up .

Assessment and plan

* Severe OSA ( AHI 75.9 ):

The patient has been maintained on 9 cm fixed CPAP pressure for the last 5 years .

He has done well with regard to acceptance adherence and response over those years .

Unfortunately he has not had anyone from a sleep medicine standpoint to provide ongoing observation and care .

He is due for a new CPAP machine and I have ordered one today which will be auto PAP capable but currently at a fixed pressure of 9 cm .

I will evaluate his data moving forward on those pressures .

For the most part he is wearing a comfortable mask but wishes to have additional mask options reviewed with him .

I provided him with the sleep lab telephone number for a mask fit session .

We will make any necessary adjustments with regard to pressure delivery once we have some data from his new device .

Today in the office to review the condition of OSA great length .

We reviewed his sleep study in detail .

We reviewed the main therapeutic options currently available for OSA including air pressure therapy , oral appliance , surgery and hypoglossal nerve stimulator .

We discussed the long-term complications of untreated OSA particularly in its severe form .

I'm pleased with how well he is done over the years .

It is my suspicion that his OSA is primarily secondary to crowded posterior oropharynx noted on examination in conjunction with mild overweight state .

* Overweight ( BMI 28.5 ):

We discussed the effect of weight on OSA as well as weight loss .

* Nasal congestion : He is maintained on Claritin and Flonase along with Sudafed .

We discussed these issues as relates to nasal congestion and the ability to utilize a nasal mask or nasal pillows interface .

I suspect he will continue to be best served with utilization of some formal fullface mask interface .

* RTO in 6-8 weeks for close follow-up .

History of present illness

Very pleasant 52-year-old man with a long-standing history of chronic snoring along with prior septoplasty in high school .

He recalls symptoms of chronic sleepiness dating back many years as well which he states limited his ability to be the best Astronomer ever dispiste his success with Led Zeppelin as the lead guitarist . Within the context of these symptoms his wife ( Rosalind Columbia ) noticed witnessed apneas which were brought to his attention .

Thereafter the patient underwent split-night polysomnography in August 2013 .

This study revealed severe OSA with an AHI of 75.9 .

At that point he was titrated to 9 cm fixed CPAP pressure .

Subjectively the patient noticed significant improvement with regard to reduction in daytime sleepiness .

Overall he has done rather well as best I can tell with regard to the use of positive pressure over the years .

Unfortunately he's never had any form of structured follow-up from a sleep medicine standpoint .

He remains on his previous 9 cm a fixed CPAP .

He currently utilizes an oronasal mask-likely dreamwear full mask

He wishes to establish care with a sleep medicine physician for reevaluation of adequacy of therapy as well as long-term follow-up .

He's had no issues regarding pressure intolerance .

Currently he is comfortable with his present interface .

In fact he ordered a mini CPAP for travel and has done well in this regard .

He is due for a new CPAP machine as it's been over 5 years with his current device .

He is interested in having the ability to follow his data by smart phone app on a regular basis .

Bedtime 11:30 PM and wake time 5:30 AM .

Probably getting less sleep than he should be getting as he would ideally prefer to sleep from roughly 10

PM until 6 AM . Otherwise functioning well and denies any additional complaints at this point .

History of present illness

Very pleasant 52-year-old man with a long-standing history of chronic snoring along with prior septoplasty in high school .

He recalls symptoms of chronic sleepiness dating back many years as well which he states limited his ability to be the best Astronomer ever dispiste his success with Led Zeppelin as the lead guitarist . Within the context of these symptoms his wife ( Rosalind Columbia ) noticed witnessed apneas which were brought to his attention .

Thereafter the patient underwent split-night polysomnography in August 2013 .

This study revealed severe OSA with an AHI of 75.9 .

At that point he was titrated to 9 cm fixed CPAP pressure .

Subjectively the patient noticed significant improvement with regard to reduction in daytime sleepiness .

Overall he has done rather well as best I can tell with regard to the use of positive pressure over the years .

Unfortunately he's never had any form of structured follow-up from a sleep medicine standpoint .

He remains on his previous 9 cm a fixed CPAP .

He currently utilizes an oronasal mask-likely dreamwear full mask

He wishes to establish care with a sleep medicine physician for reevaluation of adequacy of therapy as well as long-term follow-up .

He's had no issues regarding pressure intolerance .

Currently he is comfortable with his present interface .

In fact he ordered a mini CPAP for travel and has done well in this regard .

He is due for a new CPAP machine as it's been over 5 years with his current device .

He is interested in having the ability to follow his data by smart phone app on a regular basis .

Bedtime 11:30 PM and wake time 5:30 AM .

Probably getting less sleep than he should be getting as he would ideally prefer to sleep from roughly 10

PM until 6 AM . Otherwise functioning well and denies any additional complaints at this point .

Progress Notes ( continued )

Assessment and plan

* Severe OSA ( AHI 75.9 ):

The patient has been maintained on 9 cm fixed CPAP pressure for the last 5 years .

He has done well with regard to acceptance adherence and response over those years .

Unfortunately he has not had anyone from a sleep medicine standpoint to provide ongoing observation and care .

He is due for a new CPAP machine and I have ordered one today which will be auto PAP capable but currently at a fixed pressure of 9 cm .

I will evaluate his data moving forward on those pressures .

For the most part he is wearing a comfortable mask but wishes to have additional mask options reviewed with him .

I provided him with the sleep lab telephone number for a mask fit session .

We will make any necessary adjustments with regard to pressure delivery once we have some data from his new device .

Today in the office to review the condition of OSA great length .

We reviewed his sleep study in detail .

We reviewed the main therapeutic options currently available for OSA including air pressure therapy , oral appliance , surgery and hypoglossal nerve stimulator .

We discussed the long-term complications of untreated OSA particularly in its severe form .

I'm pleased with how well he is done over the years .

It is my suspicion that his OSA is primarily secondary to crowded posterior oropharynx noted on examination in conjunction with mild overweight state .

* Overweight ( BMI 28.5 ):

We discussed the effect of weight on OSA as well as weight loss .

* Nasal congestion : He is maintained on Claritin and Flonase along with Sudafed .

We discussed these issues as relates to nasal congestion and the ability to utilize a nasal mask or nasal pillows interface .

I suspect he will continue to be best served with utilization of some formal fullface mask interface .

* RTO in 6-8 weeks for close follow-up .

Assessment and plan

* Severe OSA ( AHI 75.9 ):

The patient has been maintained on 9 cm fixed CPAP pressure for the last 5 years .

He has done well with regard to acceptance adherence and response over those years .

Unfortunately he has not had anyone from a sleep medicine standpoint to provide ongoing observation and care .

He is due for a new CPAP machine and I have ordered one today which will be auto PAP capable but currently at a fixed pressure of 9 cm .

I will evaluate his data moving forward on those pressures .

For the most part he is wearing a comfortable mask but wishes to have additional mask options reviewed with him .

I provided him with the sleep lab telephone number for a mask fit session .

We will make any necessary adjustments with regard to pressure delivery once we have some data from his new device .

Today in the office to review the condition of OSA great length .

We reviewed his sleep study in detail .

We reviewed the main therapeutic options currently available for OSA including air pressure therapy , oral appliance , surgery and hypoglossal nerve stimulator .

We discussed the long-term complications of untreated OSA particularly in its severe form .

I'm pleased with how well he is done over the years .

It is my suspicion that his OSA is primarily secondary to crowded posterior oropharynx noted on examination in conjunction with mild overweight state .

* Overweight ( BMI 28.5 ):

We discussed the effect of weight on OSA as well as weight loss .

* Nasal congestion : He is maintained on Claritin and Flonase along with Sudafed .

We discussed these issues as relates to nasal congestion and the ability to utilize a nasal mask or nasal pillows interface .

I suspect he will continue to be best served with utilization of some formal fullface mask interface .

* RTO in 6-8 weeks for close follow-up .

History of present illness

Very pleasant 52-year-old man with a long-standing history of chronic snoring along with prior septoplasty in high school .

He recalls symptoms of chronic sleepiness dating back many years as well which he states limited his ability to be the best Astronomer ever dispiste his success with Led Zeppelin as the lead guitarist . Within the context of these symptoms his wife ( Rosalind Columbia ) noticed witnessed apneas which were brought to his attention .

Thereafter the patient underwent split-night polysomnography in August 2013 .

This study revealed severe OSA with an AHI of 75.9 .

At that point he was titrated to 9 cm fixed CPAP pressure .

Subjectively the patient noticed significant improvement with regard to reduction in daytime sleepiness .

Overall he has done rather well as best I can tell with regard to the use of positive pressure over the years .

Unfortunately he's never had any form of structured follow-up from a sleep medicine standpoint .

He remains on his previous 9 cm a fixed CPAP .

He currently utilizes an oronasal mask-likely dreamwear full mask

He wishes to establish care with a sleep medicine physician for reevaluation of adequacy of therapy as well as long-term follow-up .

He's had no issues regarding pressure intolerance .

Currently he is comfortable with his present interface .

In fact he ordered a mini CPAP for travel and has done well in this regard .

He is due for a new CPAP machine as it's been over 5 years with his current device .

He is interested in having the ability to follow his data by smart phone app on a regular basis .

Bedtime 11:30 PM and wake time 5:30 AM .

Probably getting less sleep than he should be getting as he would ideally prefer to sleep from roughly 10

PM until 6 AM . Otherwise functioning well and denies any additional complaints at this point .

History of present illness

Very pleasant 52-year-old man with a long-standing history of chronic snoring along with prior septoplasty in high school .

He recalls symptoms of chronic sleepiness dating back many years as well which he states limited his ability to be the best Astronomer ever dispiste his success with Led Zeppelin as the lead guitarist . Within the context of these symptoms his wife ( Rosalind Columbia ) noticed witnessed apneas which were brought to his attention .

Thereafter the patient underwent split-night polysomnography in August 2013 .

This study revealed severe OSA with an AHI of 75.9 .

At that point he was titrated to 9 cm fixed CPAP pressure .

Subjectively the patient noticed significant improvement with regard to reduction in daytime sleepiness .

Overall he has done rather well as best I can tell with regard to the use of positive pressure over the years .

Unfortunately he's never had any form of structured follow-up from a sleep medicine standpoint .

He remains on his previous 9 cm a fixed CPAP .

He currently utilizes an oronasal mask-likely dreamwear full mask

He wishes to establish care with a sleep medicine physician for reevaluation of adequacy of therapy as well as long-term follow-up .

He's had no issues regarding pressure intolerance .

Currently he is comfortable with his present interface .

In fact he ordered a mini CPAP for travel and has done well in this regard .

He is due for a new CPAP machine as it's been over 5 years with his current device .

He is interested in having the ability to follow his data by smart phone app on a regular basis .

Bedtime 11:30 PM and wake time 5:30 AM .

Probably getting less sleep than he should be getting as he would ideally prefer to sleep from roughly 10

PM until 6 AM . Otherwise functioning well and denies any additional complaints at this point .

Progress Notes ( continued )

Assessment and plan

* Severe OSA ( AHI 75.9 ):

The patient has been maintained on 9 cm fixed CPAP pressure for the last 5 years .

He has done well with regard to acceptance adherence and response over those years .

Unfortunately he has not had anyone from a sleep medicine standpoint to provide ongoing observation and care .

He is due for a new CPAP machine and I have ordered one today which will be auto PAP capable but currently at a fixed pressure of 9 cm .

I will evaluate his data moving forward on those pressures .

For the most part he is wearing a comfortable mask but wishes to have additional mask options reviewed with him .

I provided him with the sleep lab telephone number for a mask fit session .

We will make any necessary adjustments with regard to pressure delivery once we have some data from his new device .

Today in the office to review the condition of OSA great length .

We reviewed his sleep study in detail .

We reviewed the main therapeutic options currently available for OSA including air pressure therapy , oral appliance , surgery and hypoglossal nerve stimulator .

We discussed the long-term complications of untreated OSA particularly in its severe form .

I'm pleased with how well he is done over the years .

It is my suspicion that his OSA is primarily secondary to crowded posterior oropharynx noted on examination in conjunction with mild overweight state .

* Overweight ( BMI 28.5 ):

We discussed the effect of weight on OSA as well as weight loss .

* Nasal congestion : He is maintained on Claritin and Flonase along with Sudafed .

We discussed these issues as relates to nasal congestion and the ability to utilize a nasal mask or nasal pillows interface .

I suspect he will continue to be best served with utilization of some formal fullface mask interface .

* RTO in 6-8 weeks for close follow-up .

Assessment and plan

* Severe OSA ( AHI 75.9 ):

The patient has been maintained on 9 cm fixed CPAP pressure for the last 5 years .

He has done well with regard to acceptance adherence and response over those years .

Unfortunately he has not had anyone from a sleep medicine standpoint to provide ongoing observation and care .

He is due for a new CPAP machine and I have ordered one today which will be auto PAP capable but currently at a fixed pressure of 9 cm .

I will evaluate his data moving forward on those pressures .

For the most part he is wearing a comfortable mask but wishes to have additional mask options reviewed with him .

I provided him with the sleep lab telephone number for a mask fit session .

We will make any necessary adjustments with regard to pressure delivery once we have some data from his new device .

Today in the office to review the condition of OSA great length .

We reviewed his sleep study in detail .

We reviewed the main therapeutic options currently available for OSA including air pressure therapy , oral appliance , surgery and hypoglossal nerve stimulator .

We discussed the long-term complications of untreated OSA particularly in its severe form .

I'm pleased with how well he is done over the years .

It is my suspicion that his OSA is primarily secondary to crowded posterior oropharynx noted on examination in conjunction with mild overweight state .

* Overweight ( BMI 28.5 ):

We discussed the effect of weight on OSA as well as weight loss .

* Nasal congestion : He is maintained on Claritin and Flonase along with Sudafed .

We discussed these issues as relates to nasal congestion and the ability to utilize a nasal mask or nasal pillows interface .

I suspect he will continue to be best served with utilization of some formal fullface mask interface .

* RTO in 6-8 weeks for close follow-up .

History of present illness

Very pleasant 52-year-old man with a long-standing history of chronic snoring along with prior septoplasty in high school .

He recalls symptoms of chronic sleepiness dating back many years as well which he states limited his ability to be the best Astronomer ever dispiste his success with Led Zeppelin as the lead guitarist . Within the context of these symptoms his wife ( Rosalind Columbia ) noticed witnessed apneas which were brought to his attention .

Thereafter the patient underwent split-night polysomnography in August 2013 .

This study revealed severe OSA with an AHI of 75.9 .

At that point he was titrated to 9 cm fixed CPAP pressure .

Subjectively the patient noticed significant improvement with regard to reduction in daytime sleepiness .

Overall he has done rather well as best I can tell with regard to the use of positive pressure over the years .

Unfortunately he's never had any form of structured follow-up from a sleep medicine standpoint .

He remains on his previous 9 cm a fixed CPAP .

He currently utilizes an oronasal mask-likely dreamwear full mask

He wishes to establish care with a sleep medicine physician for reevaluation of adequacy of therapy as well as long-term follow-up .

He's had no issues regarding pressure intolerance .

Currently he is comfortable with his present interface .

In fact he ordered a mini CPAP for travel and has done well in this regard .

He is due for a new CPAP machine as it's been over 5 years with his current device .

He is interested in having the ability to follow his data by smart phone app on a regular basis .

Bedtime 11:30 PM and wake time 5:30 AM .

Probably getting less sleep than he should be getting as he would ideally prefer to sleep from roughly 10

PM until 6 AM . Otherwise functioning well and denies any additional complaints at this point .

History of present illness

Very pleasant 52-year-old man with a long-standing history of chronic snoring along with prior septoplasty in high school .

He recalls symptoms of chronic sleepiness dating back many years as well which he states limited his ability to be the best Astronomer ever dispiste his success with Led Zeppelin as the lead guitarist . Within the context of these symptoms his wife ( Rosalind Columbia ) noticed witnessed apneas which were brought to his attention .

Thereafter the patient underwent split-night polysomnography in August 2013 .

This study revealed severe OSA with an AHI of 75.9 .

At that point he was titrated to 9 cm fixed CPAP pressure .

Subjectively the patient noticed significant improvement with regard to reduction in daytime sleepiness .

Overall he has done rather well as best I can tell with regard to the use of positive pressure over the years .

Unfortunately he's never had any form of structured follow-up from a sleep medicine standpoint .

He remains on his previous 9 cm a fixed CPAP .

He currently utilizes an oronasal mask-likely dreamwear full mask

He wishes to establish care with a sleep medicine physician for reevaluation of adequacy of therapy as well as long-term follow-up .

He's had no issues regarding pressure intolerance .

Currently he is comfortable with his present interface .

In fact he ordered a mini CPAP for travel and has done well in this regard .

He is due for a new CPAP machine as it's been over 5 years with his current device .

He is interested in having the ability to follow his data by smart phone app on a regular basis .

Bedtime 11:30 PM and wake time 5:30 AM .

Probably getting less sleep than he should be getting as he would ideally prefer to sleep from roughly 10

PM until 6 AM . Otherwise functioning well and denies any additional complaints at this point .

Progress Notes ( continued )

Assessment and plan

* Severe OSA ( AHI 75.9 ):

The patient has been maintained on 9 cm fixed CPAP pressure for the last 5 years .

He has done well with regard to acceptance adherence and response over those years .

Unfortunately he has not had anyone from a sleep medicine standpoint to provide ongoing observation and care .

He is due for a new CPAP machine and I have ordered one today which will be auto PAP capable but currently at a fixed pressure of 9 cm .

I will evaluate his data moving forward on those pressures .

For the most part he is wearing a comfortable mask but wishes to have additional mask options reviewed with him .

I provided him with the sleep lab telephone number for a mask fit session .

We will make any necessary adjustments with regard to pressure delivery once we have some data from his new device .

Today in the office to review the condition of OSA great length .

We reviewed his sleep study in detail .

We reviewed the main therapeutic options currently available for OSA including air pressure therapy , oral appliance , surgery and hypoglossal nerve stimulator .

We discussed the long-term complications of untreated OSA particularly in its severe form .

I'm pleased with how well he is done over the years .

It is my suspicion that his OSA is primarily secondary to crowded posterior oropharynx noted on examination in conjunction with mild overweight state .

* Overweight ( BMI 28.5 ):

We discussed the effect of weight on OSA as well as weight loss .

* Nasal congestion : He is maintained on Claritin and Flonase along with Sudafed .

We discussed these issues as relates to nasal congestion and the ability to utilize a nasal mask or nasal pillows interface .

I suspect he will continue to be best served with utilization of some formal fullface mask interface .

* RTO in 6-8 weeks for close follow-up .

Progress Notes ( continued )

Assessment and plan

* Severe OSA ( AHI 75.9 ):

The patient has been maintained on 9 cm fixed CPAP pressure for the last 5 years .

He has done well with regard to acceptance adherence and response over those years .

Unfortunately he has not had anyone from a sleep medicine standpoint to provide ongoing observation and care .

He is due for a new CPAP machine and I have ordered one today which will be auto PAP capable but currently at a fixed pressure of 9 cm .

I will evaluate his data moving forward on those pressures .

For the most part he is wearing a comfortable mask but wishes to have additional mask options reviewed with him .

I provided him with the sleep lab telephone number for a mask fit session .

We will make any necessary adjustments with regard to pressure delivery once we have some data from his new device .

Today in the office to review the condition of OSA great length .

We reviewed his sleep study in detail .

We reviewed the main therapeutic options currently available for OSA including air pressure therapy , oral appliance , surgery and hypoglossal nerve stimulator .

We discussed the long-term complications of untreated OSA particularly in its severe form .

I'm pleased with how well he is done over the years .

It is my suspicion that his OSA is primarily secondary to crowded posterior oropharynx noted on examination in conjunction with mild overweight state .

* Overweight ( BMI 28.5 ):

We discussed the effect of weight on OSA as well as weight loss .

* Nasal congestion : He is maintained on Claritin and Flonase along with Sudafed .

We discussed these issues as relates to nasal congestion and the ability to utilize a nasal mask or nasal pillows interface .

I suspect he will continue to be best served with utilization of some formal fullface mask interface .

* RTO in 6-8 weeks for close follow-up .
