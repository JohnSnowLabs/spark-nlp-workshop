placement , performed on 11/23/93 .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nMr. Tauaswatl is a 45 year old gentleman with Down 's syndrome , who presents to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital with jaundice .\\nMr. Tauaswatl has a history of vague abdominal and back pain over the past several years .\\nA recent workup of his symptoms , which were predominantly right upper quadrant symptoms was done .\\nA right upper quadrant abdominal ultrasound was obtained in May of 1993 .\\nThis study showed gall stones , with common bile duct dilatation .\\nSubsequently , an oral cholecystogram was performed , and the gall bladder was not visualized on this study .\\nThe patient was therefore diagnosed with chronic cholelithiasis , and possible choledocholithiasis .\\nOn Jul 27 , 1993 , the patient underwent a right upper quadrant abdominal exploration at the Nor Chi Gay Hospital .\\nAt operation , a phlegmon was noted in the right upper quadrants in the region of the gall bladder .\\nThe surgeons were unable to visualize the gall bladder , and the operation was aborted .\\nSince that time , the patient has had increasing jaundice , but no nausea or vomiting .\\nIt should be noted that the patient has experienced occasional episodes of vomiting for years , but these symptoms have not changed recently .\\nThe patient denies abdominal pain , fevers , chills , or any other complaints , although he was noted to have a fever over the weekend prior to admission .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\n1 ) Down 's syndrome ,\\n2 ) intestinal malrotation ,\\n3 ) status post Ladd 's procedure ,\\n4 ) status post duodenojejunostomy as an infant .\\nALLERGIES :\\nThe patient has no known drug allergies .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\n1 ) Tagamet 400 mg. po q.day ,\\n2 ) Tetracycline 250 mg. po bid prn ingrown facial hair .\\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS :\\nRemarkable only for a recent weight loss of 20 lb .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nThe patient is a well-nourished but jaundiced male , with Down 's facies , in no acute distress .\\nVital signs :\\ntemperature 97.8 , heart rate 107 , blood pressure 116/77 , respirations 20 .\\nHis head , eyes , ears , nose , and throat exam reveals a normocephalic and atraumatic head .\\nHis pupils were equal , round , reactive to light and accommodation , positive scleral icterus , intact extra ocular movements , and a supple neck .\\nExamination of the back reveals no costovertebral angle tenderness .\\nExamination of the chest reveals lungs which are clear to auscultation .\\nCardiovascular exam reveals regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 and S2 , a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur heard best at the upper right sternal border , and a 1/6 decrescendo diastolic murmur heard best at Erb 's point , with no gallop or rub appreciated .\\nThe abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended .\\nThere are no palpable masses , and there is no shake tenderness .\\nThere is a well-healed right subcostal scar , and a well-healed right paramedian scar .\\nRectal examination is nontender , free of any palpable masses , and guaiac-negative stool .\\nExtremities :\\nno clubbing , cyanosis or edema .\\nNeurological examination is nonfocal .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nA panel of serum electrolytes is normal .\\nThe white blood cell count is 7.3 , hematocrit 28.4 , platelets 586,000 .\\nLymphocyte differential count shows 77% PMNs , 13% lymphocytes , 8% monocytes , and 1% basophils .\\nAlkaline phosphatase is 1,342 , lactacte dehydrogenase is 253 , and AST is 221 .\\nTotal bilirubin is 10.7 , and direct bilirubin is 8.2 .\\nTotal protein is 7.1 , and albumin is 2.1 .\\nSerum amylase is 43 .\\nCalcium is 8.2 , magnesium 1.8 , and phosphorous 3.1 .\\nX-ray examination of the chest reveals clear lungs and a normal heart .\\nKUB and upright abdominal x-rays revealed no obstruction or perforation , focal dilatation of small bowel in the right upper quadrants , and two calcified densities noted in the right upper quadrants , which may represent gall stones .\\nUltrasonography of the right upper abdominal quadrant reveals a portal mass with calcification and possible invasion of the portal vein , thought to appear suspiciously similar to a hepatocellular carcinoma .\\nIntrahepatic biliary duct dilatation was noted proximal to the mass .\\nElectrocardiography reveals normal sinus rhythm , with non-specific ST and T-wave abnormalities in leads 2 , 3 , and AVF .\\nThe axis and intervals are otherwise within normal limits .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was admitted to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital to the General Surgery Service of Dr. Lynea Moyduhe .\\nA modified upper GI x-ray series was obtained , which revealed malpositioning of the duodenum and jejunum in the right abdomen , consistent with intestinal malrotation , but no evidence of obstruction in the duodenum or jejunum was identified .\\nTherefore , the patient was prevented from taking anything by mouth and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was performed .\\nThis study identified a 5 centimeter narrowed segment in the distal common bile duct , and moderately severe dilatation of the left biliary radicals in the right hepatic duct .\\nA temporary stent was placed , which seemed to function well despite its unsatisfactory positioning .\\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well , and there were no complications .\\nHe was returned to the Surgical Ward in stable condition .\\nBecause of the probable malignant nature of the patient 's biliary obstruction , the patient was returned to the GI lab on 11/25/93 , where repeat endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was performed .\\nThis procedure was performed under general anesthesia , and resulted in successful placement of a permanent stent within the distal common bile duct .\\nAdditionally , a computer tomography guided needle biopsy was performed of the paraportal mass .\\nThese procedures were well tolerated by the patient , and were free of complication .\\nAs before , the patient was covered with post-procedure antibiotic therapy .\\nHe was returned to the surgical ward in stable condition .\\nPreliminary report on the biopsy specimen at the time of this dictation describes the presence of acute and chronic inflammation , but no malignant cells .\\nHowever , two cytology specimens were both positive for malignant cells , the histopathologic characteristics of which suggest adenocarcinoma .\\nFollowing the permanent stent placement , the patient 's diet was slowly advanced .\\nHis serum bilirubin levels and other liver function studies continued to normalize .\\nBecause of his rapid progress , the resolution of his right upper quadrant pain , and the fact that no surgical therapy was indicated at this time , the patient was discharged to his group home on 11/29/93 .\\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE :\\nImproved .\\nDOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :\\n1 ) Discharged to group home ,\\n2 ) diet as tolerated ,\\n3 ) activity ad lib ,\\n4 ) followup with Dr. Moyduhe ,\\n5 )\\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :\\nTagamet 400 mg. po q.day , Tetracycline 250 mg. po bid prn ingrown hair .\\nLUPEVICKETTE L.

placement , performed on 11/23/93 .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nMr. Tauaswatl is a 45 year old gentleman with Down 's syndrome , who presents to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital with jaundice .\\nMr. Tauaswatl has a history of vague abdominal and back pain over the past several years .\\nA recent workup of his symptoms , which were predominantly right upper quadrant symptoms was done .\\nA right upper quadrant abdominal ultrasound was obtained in May of 1993 .\\nThis study showed gall stones , with common bile duct dilatation .\\nSubsequently , an oral cholecystogram was performed , and the gall bladder was not visualized on this study .\\nThe patient was therefore diagnosed with chronic cholelithiasis , and possible choledocholithiasis .\\nOn Jul 27 , 1993 , the patient underwent a right upper quadrant abdominal exploration at the Nor Chi Gay Hospital .\\nAt operation , a phlegmon was noted in the right upper quadrants in the region of the gall bladder .\\nThe surgeons were unable to visualize the gall bladder , and the operation was aborted .\\nSince that time , the patient has had increasing jaundice , but no nausea or vomiting .\\nIt should be noted that the patient has experienced occasional episodes of vomiting for years , but these symptoms have not changed recently .\\nThe patient denies abdominal pain , fevers , chills , or any other complaints , although he was noted to have a fever over the weekend prior to admission .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\n1 ) Down 's syndrome ,\\n2 ) intestinal malrotation ,\\n3 ) status post Ladd 's procedure ,\\n4 ) status post duodenojejunostomy as an infant .\\nALLERGIES :\\nThe patient has no known drug allergies .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\n1 ) Tagamet 400 mg. po q.day ,\\n2 ) Tetracycline 250 mg. po bid prn ingrown facial hair .\\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS :\\nRemarkable only for a recent weight loss of 20 lb .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nThe patient is a well-nourished but jaundiced male , with Down 's facies , in no acute distress .\\nVital signs :\\ntemperature 97.8 , heart rate 107 , blood pressure 116/77 , respirations 20 .\\nHis head , eyes , ears , nose , and throat exam reveals a normocephalic and atraumatic head .\\nHis pupils were equal , round , reactive to light and accommodation , positive scleral icterus , intact extra ocular movements , and a supple neck .\\nExamination of the back reveals no costovertebral angle tenderness .\\nExamination of the chest reveals lungs which are clear to auscultation .\\nCardiovascular exam reveals regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 and S2 , a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur heard best at the upper right sternal border , and a 1/6 decrescendo diastolic murmur heard best at Erb 's point , with no gallop or rub appreciated .\\nThe abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended .\\nThere are no palpable masses , and there is no shake tenderness .\\nThere is a well-healed right subcostal scar , and a well-healed right paramedian scar .\\nRectal examination is nontender , free of any palpable masses , and guaiac-negative stool .\\nExtremities :\\nno clubbing , cyanosis or edema .\\nNeurological examination is nonfocal .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nA panel of serum electrolytes is normal .\\nThe white blood cell count is 7.3 , hematocrit 28.4 , platelets 586,000 .\\nLymphocyte differential count shows 77% PMNs , 13% lymphocytes , 8% monocytes , and 1% basophils .\\nAlkaline phosphatase is 1,342 , lactacte dehydrogenase is 253 , and AST is 221 .\\nTotal bilirubin is 10.7 , and direct bilirubin is 8.2 .\\nTotal protein is 7.1 , and albumin is 2.1 .\\nSerum amylase is 43 .\\nCalcium is 8.2 , magnesium 1.8 , and phosphorous 3.1 .\\nX-ray examination of the chest reveals clear lungs and a normal heart .\\nKUB and upright abdominal x-rays revealed no obstruction or perforation , focal dilatation of small bowel in the right upper quadrants , and two calcified densities noted in the right upper quadrants , which may represent gall stones .\\nUltrasonography of the right upper abdominal quadrant reveals a portal mass with calcification and possible invasion of the portal vein , thought to appear suspiciously similar to a hepatocellular carcinoma .\\nIntrahepatic biliary duct dilatation was noted proximal to the mass .\\nElectrocardiography reveals normal sinus rhythm , with non-specific ST and T-wave abnormalities in leads 2 , 3 , and AVF .\\nThe axis and intervals are otherwise within normal limits .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was admitted to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital to the General Surgery Service of Dr. Lynea Moyduhe .\\nA modified upper GI x-ray series was obtained , which revealed malpositioning of the duodenum and jejunum in the right abdomen , consistent with intestinal malrotation , but no evidence of obstruction in the duodenum or jejunum was identified .\\nTherefore , the patient was prevented from taking anything by mouth and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was performed .\\nThis study identified a 5 centimeter narrowed segment in the distal common bile duct , and moderately severe dilatation of the left biliary radicals in the right hepatic duct .\\nA temporary stent was placed , which seemed to function well despite its unsatisfactory positioning .\\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well , and there were no complications .\\nHe was returned to the Surgical Ward in stable condition .\\nBecause of the probable malignant nature of the patient 's biliary obstruction , the patient was returned to the GI lab on 11/25/93 , where repeat endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was performed .\\nThis procedure was performed under general anesthesia , and resulted in successful placement of a permanent stent within the distal common bile duct .\\nAdditionally , a computer tomography guided needle biopsy was performed of the paraportal mass .\\nThese procedures were well tolerated by the patient , and were free of complication .\\nAs before , the patient was covered with post-procedure antibiotic therapy .\\nHe was returned to the surgical ward in stable condition .\\nPreliminary report on the biopsy specimen at the time of this dictation describes the presence of acute and chronic inflammation , but no malignant cells .\\nHowever , two cytology specimens were both positive for malignant cells , the histopathologic characteristics of which suggest adenocarcinoma .\\nFollowing the permanent stent placement , the patient 's diet was slowly advanced .\\nHis serum bilirubin levels and other liver function studies continued to normalize .\\nBecause of his rapid progress , the resolution of his right upper quadrant pain , and the fact that no surgical therapy was indicated at this time , the patient was discharged to his group home on 11/29/93 .\\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE :\\nImproved .\\nDOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :\\n1 ) Discharged to group home ,\\n2 ) diet as tolerated ,\\n3 ) activity ad lib ,\\n4 ) followup with Dr. Moyduhe ,\\n5 )\\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :\\nTagamet 400 mg. po q.day , Tetracycline 250 mg. po bid prn ingrown hair .\\nLUPEVICKETTE L.

:\\nUnsigned\\nADMISSION DATE :\\n11/18/93\\nDISCHARGE DATE :\\n11/29/93\\nPRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :\\nBiliary obstruction secondary to malignancy .\\nASSOCIATED DIAGNOSES :\\n1 ) Down 's syndrome ,\\n2 ) intestinal malrotation ,\\n3 ) status post Ladd 's procedure ,\\n4 ) status post duodenal jejunostomy as an infant .\\nPRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :\\nendoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with stent placement , performed on 11/25/93 .\\nASSOCIATED PROCEDURES :\\n1 ) needle biopsy of portal mass , performed on 11/25/93 .\\n2 ) endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography , with temporary stent placement , performed on 11/23/93 .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nMr. Tauaswatl is a 45 year old gentleman with Down 's syndrome , who presents to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital with jaundice .\\nMr. Tauaswatl has a history of vague abdominal and back pain over the past several years .\\nA recent workup of his symptoms , which were predominantly right upper quadrant symptoms was done .\\nA right upper quadrant abdominal ultrasound was obtained in May of 1993 .\\nThis study showed gall stones , with common bile duct dilatation .\\nSubsequently , an oral cholecystogram was performed , and the gall bladder was not visualized on this study .\\nThe patient was therefore diagnosed with chronic cholelithiasis , and possible choledocholithiasis .\\nOn Jul 27 , 1993 , the patient underwent a right upper quadrant abdominal exploration at the Nor Chi Gay Hospital .\\nAt operation , a phlegmon was noted in the right upper quadrants in the region of the gall bladder .\\nThe surgeons were unable to visualize the gall bladder , and the operation was aborted .\\nSince that time , the patient has had increasing jaundice , but no nausea or vomiting .\\nIt should be noted that the patient has experienced occasional episodes of vomiting for years , but these symptoms have not changed recently .\\nThe patient denies abdominal pain , fevers , chills , or any other complaints , although he was noted to have a fever over the weekend prior to admission .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\n1 ) Down 's syndrome ,\\n2 ) intestinal malrotation ,\\n3 ) status post Ladd 's procedure ,\\n4 ) status post duodenojejunostomy as an infant .\\nALLERGIES :\\nThe patient has no known drug allergies .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\n1 ) Tagamet 400 mg. po q.day ,\\n2 ) Tetracycline 250 mg. po bid prn ingrown facial hair .\\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS :\\nRemarkable only for a recent weight loss of 20 lb .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nThe patient is a well-nourished but jaundiced male , with Down 's facies , in no acute distress .\\nVital signs :\\ntemperature 97.8 , heart rate 107 , blood pressure 116/77 , respirations 20 .\\nHis head , eyes , ears , nose , and throat exam reveals a normocephalic and atraumatic head .\\nHis pupils were equal , round , reactive to light and accommodation , positive scleral icterus , intact extra ocular movements , and a supple neck .\\nExamination of the back reveals no costovertebral angle tenderness .\\nExamination of the chest reveals lungs which are clear to auscultation .\\nCardiovascular exam reveals regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 and S2 , a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur heard best at the upper right sternal border , and a 1/6 decrescendo diastolic murmur heard best at Erb 's point , with no gallop or rub appreciated .\\nThe abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended .\\nThere are no palpable masses , and there is no shake tenderness .\\nThere is a well-healed right subcostal scar , and a well-healed right paramedian scar .\\nRectal examination is nontender , free of any palpable masses , and guaiac-negative stool .\\nExtremities :\\nno clubbing , cyanosis or edema .\\nNeurological examination is nonfocal .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nA panel of serum electrolytes is normal .\\nThe white blood cell count is 7.3 , hematocrit 28.4 , platelets 586,000 .\\nLymphocyte differential count shows 77% PMNs , 13% lymphocytes , 8% monocytes , and 1% basophils .\\nAlkaline phosphatase is 1,342 , lactacte dehydrogenase is 253 , and AST is 221 .\\nTotal bilirubin is 10.7 , and direct bilirubin is 8.2 .\\nTotal protein is 7.1 , and albumin is 2.1 .\\nSerum amylase is 43 .\\nCalcium is 8.2 , magnesium 1.8 , and phosphorous 3.1 .\\nX-ray examination of the chest reveals clear lungs and a normal heart .\\nKUB and upright abdominal x-rays revealed no obstruction or perforation , focal dilatation of small bowel in the right upper quadrants , and two calcified densities noted in the right upper quadrants , which may represent gall stones .\\nUltrasonography of the right upper abdominal quadrant reveals a portal mass with calcification and possible invasion of the portal vein , thought to appear suspiciously similar to a hepatocellular carcinoma .\\nIntrahepatic biliary duct dilatation was noted proximal to the mass .\\nElectrocardiography reveals normal sinus rhythm , with non-specific ST and T-wave abnormalities in leads 2 , 3 , and AVF .\\nThe axis and intervals are otherwise within normal limits .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was admitted to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital to the General Surgery Service of Dr. Lynea Moyduhe .\\nA modified upper GI x-ray series was obtained , which revealed malpositioning of the duodenum and jejunum in the right abdomen , consistent with intestinal malrotation , but no evidence of obstruction in the duodenum or jejunum was identified .\\nTherefore , the patient was prevented from taking anything by mouth and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was performed .\\nThis study identified a 5 centimeter narrowed segment in the distal common bile duct , and moderately severe dilatation of the left biliary radicals in the right hepatic duct .\\nA temporary stent was placed , which seemed to function well despite its unsatisfactory positioning .\\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well , and there were no complications .\\nHe was returned to the Surgical Ward in stable condition .\\nBecause of the probable malignant nature of the patient 's biliary obstruction , the patient was returned to the GI lab on 11/25/93 , where repeat endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was performed .\\nThis procedure was performed under general anesthesia , and resulted in successful placement of a permanent stent within the distal common bile duct .\\nAdditionally , a computer tomography guided needle biopsy was performed of the paraportal mass .\\nThese procedures were well tolerated by the patient , and were free of complication .\\nAs before , the patient was covered with post-procedure antibiotic therapy .\\nHe was returned to the surgical ward in stable condition .\\nPreliminary report on the biopsy specimen at the time of this dictation describes the presence of acute and chronic inflammation , but no malignant cells .\\nHowever , two cytology specimens were both positive for malignant cells , the histopathologic characteristics of which suggest adenocarcinoma .\\nFollowing the permanent stent placement , the patient 's diet was slowly advanced .\\nHis serum bilirubin levels and other liver function studies continued to normalize .\\nBecause of his rapid progress , the resolution of his right upper quadrant pain , and the fact that no surgical therapy was indicated at this time , the patient was discharged to his group home on 11/29/93 .\\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE :\\nImproved .\\nDOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :\\n1 ) Discharged to group home ,\\n2 ) diet as tolerated ,\\n3 ) activity ad lib ,\\n4 ) followup with Dr. Moyduhe ,\\n5 )\\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :\\nTagamet 400 mg. po q.day , Tetracycline 250 mg. po bid prn ingrown hair .\\nLUPEVICKETTE L.

:\\nUnsigned\\nADMISSION DATE :\\n11/18/93\\nDISCHARGE DATE :\\n11/29/93\\nPRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :\\nBiliary obstruction secondary to malignancy .\\nASSOCIATED DIAGNOSES :\\n1 ) Down 's syndrome ,\\n2 ) intestinal malrotation ,\\n3 ) status post Ladd 's procedure ,\\n4 ) status post duodenal jejunostomy as an infant .\\nPRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :\\nendoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with stent placement , performed on 11/25/93 .\\nASSOCIATED PROCEDURES :\\n1 ) needle biopsy of portal mass , performed on 11/25/93 .\\n2 ) endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography , with temporary stent placement , performed on 11/23/93 .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nMr. Tauaswatl is a 45 year old gentleman with Down 's syndrome , who presents to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital with jaundice .\\nMr. Tauaswatl has a history of vague abdominal and back pain over the past several years .\\nA recent workup of his symptoms , which were predominantly right upper quadrant symptoms was done .\\nA right upper quadrant abdominal ultrasound was obtained in May of 1993 .\\nThis study showed gall stones , with common bile duct dilatation .\\nSubsequently , an oral cholecystogram was performed , and the gall bladder was not visualized on this study .\\nThe patient was therefore diagnosed with chronic cholelithiasis , and possible choledocholithiasis .\\nOn Jul 27 , 1993 , the patient underwent a right upper quadrant abdominal exploration at the Nor Chi Gay Hospital .\\nAt operation , a phlegmon was noted in the right upper quadrants in the region of the gall bladder .\\nThe surgeons were unable to visualize the gall bladder , and the operation was aborted .\\nSince that time , the patient has had increasing jaundice , but no nausea or vomiting .\\nIt should be noted that the patient has experienced occasional episodes of vomiting for years , but these symptoms have not changed recently .\\nThe patient denies abdominal pain , fevers , chills , or any other complaints , although he was noted to have a fever over the weekend prior to admission .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\n1 ) Down 's syndrome ,\\n2 ) intestinal malrotation ,\\n3 ) status post Ladd 's procedure ,\\n4 ) status post duodenojejunostomy as an infant .\\nALLERGIES :\\nThe patient has no known drug allergies .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\n1 ) Tagamet 400 mg. po q.day ,\\n2 ) Tetracycline 250 mg. po bid prn ingrown facial hair .\\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS :\\nRemarkable only for a recent weight loss of 20 lb .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nThe patient is a well-nourished but jaundiced male , with Down 's facies , in no acute distress .\\nVital signs :\\ntemperature 97.8 , heart rate 107 , blood pressure 116/77 , respirations 20 .\\nHis head , eyes , ears , nose , and throat exam reveals a normocephalic and atraumatic head .\\nHis pupils were equal , round , reactive to light and accommodation , positive scleral icterus , intact extra ocular movements , and a supple neck .\\nExamination of the back reveals no costovertebral angle tenderness .\\nExamination of the chest reveals lungs which are clear to auscultation .\\nCardiovascular exam reveals regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 and S2 , a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur heard best at the upper right sternal border , and a 1/6 decrescendo diastolic murmur heard best at Erb 's point , with no gallop or rub appreciated .\\nThe abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended .\\nThere are no palpable masses , and there is no shake tenderness .\\nThere is a well-healed right subcostal scar , and a well-healed right paramedian scar .\\nRectal examination is nontender , free of any palpable masses , and guaiac-negative stool .\\nExtremities :\\nno clubbing , cyanosis or edema .\\nNeurological examination is nonfocal .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nA panel of serum electrolytes is normal .\\nThe white blood cell count is 7.3 , hematocrit 28.4 , platelets 586,000 .\\nLymphocyte differential count shows 77% PMNs , 13% lymphocytes , 8% monocytes , and 1% basophils .\\nAlkaline phosphatase is 1,342 , lactacte dehydrogenase is 253 , and AST is 221 .\\nTotal bilirubin is 10.7 , and direct bilirubin is 8.2 .\\nTotal protein is 7.1 , and albumin is 2.1 .\\nSerum amylase is 43 .\\nCalcium is 8.2 , magnesium 1.8 , and phosphorous 3.1 .\\nX-ray examination of the chest reveals clear lungs and a normal heart .\\nKUB and upright abdominal x-rays revealed no obstruction or perforation , focal dilatation of small bowel in the right upper quadrants , and two calcified densities noted in the right upper quadrants , which may represent gall stones .\\nUltrasonography of the right upper abdominal quadrant reveals a portal mass with calcification and possible invasion of the portal vein , thought to appear suspiciously similar to a hepatocellular carcinoma .\\nIntrahepatic biliary duct dilatation was noted proximal to the mass .\\nElectrocardiography reveals normal sinus rhythm , with non-specific ST and T-wave abnormalities in leads 2 , 3 , and AVF .\\nThe axis and intervals are otherwise within normal limits .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was admitted to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital to the General Surgery Service of Dr. Lynea Moyduhe .\\nA modified upper GI x-ray series was obtained , which revealed malpositioning of the duodenum and jejunum in the right abdomen , consistent with intestinal malrotation , but no evidence of obstruction in the duodenum or jejunum was identified .\\nTherefore , the patient was prevented from taking anything by mouth and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was performed .\\nThis study identified a 5 centimeter narrowed segment in the distal common bile duct , and moderately severe dilatation of the left biliary radicals in the right hepatic duct .\\nA temporary stent was placed , which seemed to function well despite its unsatisfactory positioning .\\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well , and there were no complications .\\nHe was returned to the Surgical Ward in stable condition .\\nBecause of the probable malignant nature of the patient 's biliary obstruction , the patient was returned to the GI lab on 11/25/93 , where repeat endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was performed .\\nThis procedure was performed under general anesthesia , and resulted in successful placement of a permanent stent within the distal common bile duct .\\nAdditionally , a computer tomography guided needle biopsy was performed of the paraportal mass .\\nThese procedures were well tolerated by the patient , and were free of complication .\\nAs before , the patient was covered with post-procedure antibiotic therapy .\\nHe was returned to the surgical ward in stable condition .\\nPreliminary report on the biopsy specimen at the time of this dictation describes the presence of acute and chronic inflammation , but no malignant cells .\\nHowever , two cytology specimens were both positive for malignant cells , the histopathologic characteristics of which suggest adenocarcinoma .\\nFollowing the permanent stent placement , the patient 's diet was slowly advanced .\\nHis serum bilirubin levels and other liver function studies continued to normalize .\\nBecause of his rapid progress , the resolution of his right upper quadrant pain , and the fact that no surgical therapy was indicated at this time , the patient was discharged to his group home on 11/29/93 .\\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE :\\nImproved .\\nDOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :\\n1 ) Discharged to group home ,\\n2 ) diet as tolerated ,\\n3 ) activity ad lib ,\\n4 )

:\\nUnsigned\\nADMISSION DATE :\\n11/18/93\\nDISCHARGE DATE :\\n11/29/93\\nPRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :\\nBiliary obstruction secondary to malignancy .\\nASSOCIATED DIAGNOSES :\\n1 ) Down 's syndrome ,\\n2 ) intestinal malrotation ,\\n3 ) status post Ladd 's procedure ,\\n4 ) status post duodenal jejunostomy as an infant .\\nPRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :\\nendoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with stent placement , performed on 11/25/93 .\\nASSOCIATED PROCEDURES :\\n1 ) needle biopsy of portal mass , performed on 11/25/93 .\\n2 ) endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography , with temporary stent placement , performed on 11/23/93 .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nMr. Tauaswatl is a 45 year old gentleman with Down 's syndrome , who presents to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital with jaundice .\\nMr. Tauaswatl has a history of vague abdominal and back pain over the past several years .\\nA recent workup of his symptoms , which were predominantly right upper quadrant symptoms was done .\\nA right upper quadrant abdominal ultrasound was obtained in May of 1993 .\\nThis study showed gall stones , with common bile duct dilatation .\\nSubsequently , an oral cholecystogram was performed , and the gall bladder was not visualized on this study .\\nThe patient was therefore diagnosed with chronic cholelithiasis , and possible choledocholithiasis .\\nOn Jul 27 , 1993 , the patient underwent a right upper quadrant abdominal exploration at the Nor Chi Gay Hospital .\\nAt operation , a phlegmon was noted in the right upper quadrants in the region of the gall bladder .\\nThe surgeons were unable to visualize the gall bladder , and the operation was aborted .\\nSince that time , the patient has had increasing jaundice , but no nausea or vomiting .\\nIt should be noted that the patient has experienced occasional episodes of vomiting for years , but these symptoms have not changed recently .\\nThe patient denies abdominal pain , fevers , chills , or any other complaints , although he was noted to have a fever over the weekend prior to admission .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\n1 ) Down 's syndrome ,\\n2 ) intestinal malrotation ,\\n3 ) status post Ladd 's procedure ,\\n4 ) status post duodenojejunostomy as an infant .\\nALLERGIES :\\nThe patient has no known drug allergies .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\n1 ) Tagamet 400 mg. po q.day ,\\n2 ) Tetracycline 250 mg. po bid prn ingrown facial hair .\\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS :\\nRemarkable only for a recent weight loss of 20 lb .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nThe patient is a well-nourished but jaundiced male , with Down 's facies , in no acute distress .\\nVital signs :\\ntemperature 97.8 , heart rate 107 , blood pressure 116/77 , respirations 20 .\\nHis head , eyes , ears , nose , and throat exam reveals a normocephalic and atraumatic head .\\nHis pupils were equal , round , reactive to light and accommodation , positive scleral icterus , intact extra ocular movements , and a supple neck .\\nExamination of the back reveals no costovertebral angle tenderness .\\nExamination of the chest reveals lungs which are clear to auscultation .\\nCardiovascular exam reveals regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 and S2 , a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur heard best at the upper right sternal border , and a 1/6 decrescendo diastolic murmur heard best at Erb 's point , with no gallop or rub appreciated .\\nThe abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended .\\nThere are no palpable masses , and there is no shake tenderness .\\nThere is a well-healed right subcostal scar , and a well-healed right paramedian scar .\\nRectal examination is nontender , free of any palpable masses , and guaiac-negative stool .\\nExtremities :\\nno clubbing , cyanosis or edema .\\nNeurological examination is nonfocal .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nA panel of serum electrolytes is normal .\\nThe white blood cell count is 7.3 , hematocrit 28.4 , platelets 586,000 .\\nLymphocyte differential count shows 77% PMNs , 13% lymphocytes , 8% monocytes , and 1% basophils .\\nAlkaline phosphatase is 1,342 , lactacte dehydrogenase is 253 , and AST is 221 .\\nTotal bilirubin is 10.7 , and direct bilirubin is 8.2 .\\nTotal protein is 7.1 , and albumin is 2.1 .\\nSerum amylase is 43 .\\nCalcium is 8.2 , magnesium 1.8 , and phosphorous 3.1 .\\nX-ray examination of the chest reveals clear lungs and a normal heart .\\nKUB and upright abdominal x-rays revealed no obstruction or perforation , focal dilatation of small bowel in the right upper quadrants , and two calcified densities noted in the right upper quadrants , which may represent gall stones .\\nUltrasonography of the right upper abdominal quadrant reveals a portal mass with calcification and possible invasion of the portal vein , thought to appear suspiciously similar to a hepatocellular carcinoma .\\nIntrahepatic biliary duct dilatation was noted proximal to the mass .\\nElectrocardiography reveals normal sinus rhythm , with non-specific ST and T-wave abnormalities in leads 2 , 3 , and AVF .\\nThe axis and intervals are otherwise within normal limits .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was admitted to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital to the General Surgery Service of Dr. Lynea Moyduhe .\\nA modified upper GI x-ray series was obtained , which revealed malpositioning of the duodenum and jejunum in the right abdomen , consistent with intestinal malrotation , but no evidence of obstruction in the duodenum or jejunum was identified .\\nTherefore , the patient was prevented from taking anything by mouth and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was performed .\\nThis study identified a 5 centimeter narrowed segment in the distal common bile duct , and moderately severe dilatation of the left biliary radicals in the right hepatic duct .\\nA temporary stent was placed , which seemed to function well despite its unsatisfactory positioning .\\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well , and there were no complications .\\nHe was returned to the Surgical Ward in stable condition .\\nBecause of the probable malignant nature of the patient 's biliary obstruction , the patient was returned to the GI lab on 11/25/93 , where repeat endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was performed .\\nThis procedure was performed under general anesthesia , and resulted in successful placement of a permanent stent within the distal common bile

intestinal malrotation ,\\n3 ) status post Ladd 's procedure ,\\n4 ) status post duodenal jejunostomy as an infant .\\nPRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :\\nendoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with stent placement , performed on 11/25/93 .\\nASSOCIATED PROCEDURES :\\n1 ) needle biopsy of portal mass , performed on 11/25/93 .\\n2 ) endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography , with temporary stent placement , performed on 11/23/93 .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nMr. Tauaswatl is a 45 year old gentleman with Down 's syndrome , who presents to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital with jaundice .\\nMr. Tauaswatl has a history of vague abdominal and back pain over the past several years .\\nA recent workup of his symptoms , which were predominantly right upper quadrant symptoms was done .\\nA right upper quadrant abdominal ultrasound was obtained in May of 1993 .\\nThis study showed gall stones , with common bile duct dilatation .\\nSubsequently , an oral cholecystogram was performed , and the gall bladder was not visualized on this study .\\nThe patient was therefore diagnosed with chronic cholelithiasis , and possible choledocholithiasis .\\nOn Jul 27 , 1993 , the patient underwent a right upper quadrant abdominal exploration at the Nor Chi Gay Hospital .\\nAt operation , a phlegmon was noted in the right upper quadrants in the region of the gall bladder .\\nThe surgeons were unable to visualize the gall bladder , and the operation was aborted .\\nSince that time , the patient has had increasing jaundice , but no nausea or vomiting .\\nIt should be noted that the patient has experienced occasional episodes of vomiting for years , but these symptoms have not changed recently .\\nThe patient denies abdominal pain , fevers , chills , or any other complaints , although he was noted to have a fever over the weekend prior to admission .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\n1 ) Down 's syndrome ,\\n2 ) intestinal malrotation ,\\n3 ) status post Ladd 's procedure ,\\n4 ) status post duodenojejunostomy as an infant .\\nALLERGIES :\\nThe patient has no known drug allergies .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\n1 ) Tagamet 400 mg. po q.day ,\\n2 ) Tetracycline 250 mg. po bid prn ingrown facial hair .\\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS :\\nRemarkable only for a recent weight loss of 20 lb .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nThe patient is a well-nourished but jaundiced male , with Down 's facies , in no acute distress .\\nVital signs :\\ntemperature 97.8 , heart rate 107 , blood pressure 116/77 , respirations 20 .\\nHis head , eyes , ears , nose , and throat exam reveals a normocephalic and atraumatic head .\\nHis pupils were equal , round , reactive to light and accommodation , positive scleral icterus , intact extra ocular movements , and a supple neck .\\nExamination of the back reveals no costovertebral angle tenderness .\\nExamination of the chest reveals lungs which are clear to auscultation .\\nCardiovascular exam reveals regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 and S2 , a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur heard best at the upper right sternal border , and a 1/6 decrescendo diastolic murmur heard best at Erb 's point , with no gallop or rub appreciated .\\nThe abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended .\\nThere are no palpable masses , and there is no shake tenderness .\\nThere is a well-healed right subcostal scar , and a well-healed right paramedian scar .\\nRectal examination is nontender , free of any palpable masses , and guaiac-negative stool .\\nExtremities :\\nno clubbing , cyanosis or edema .\\nNeurological examination is nonfocal .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nA panel of serum electrolytes is normal .\\nThe white blood cell count is 7.3 , hematocrit 28.4 , platelets 586,000 .\\nLymphocyte differential count shows 77% PMNs , 13% lymphocytes , 8% monocytes , and 1% basophils .\\nAlkaline phosphatase is 1,342 , lactacte dehydrogenase is 253 , and AST is 221 .\\nTotal bilirubin is 10.7 , and direct bilirubin is 8.2 .\\nTotal protein is 7.1 , and albumin is 2.1 .\\nSerum amylase is 43 .\\nCalcium is 8.2 , magnesium 1.8 , and phosphorous 3.1 .\\nX-ray examination of the chest reveals clear lungs and a normal heart .\\nKUB and upright abdominal x-rays revealed no obstruction or perforation , focal dilatation of small bowel in the right upper quadrants , and two calcified densities noted in the right upper quadrants , which may represent gall stones .\\nUltrasonography of the right upper abdominal quadrant reveals a portal mass with calcification and possible invasion of the portal vein , thought to appear suspiciously similar to a hepatocellular carcinoma .\\nIntrahepatic biliary duct dilatation was noted proximal to the mass .\\nElectrocardiography reveals normal sinus rhythm , with non-specific ST and T-wave abnormalities in leads 2 , 3 , and AVF .\\nThe axis and intervals are otherwise within normal limits .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was admitted to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital to the General Surgery Service of Dr. Lynea Moyduhe .\\nA modified upper GI x-ray series was obtained , which revealed malpositioning of the duodenum and jejunum in the right abdomen , consistent with intestinal malrotation , but no evidence of obstruction in the duodenum or jejunum was identified .\\nTherefore , the patient was prevented from taking anything by mouth and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was performed .\\nThis study identified a 5 centimeter narrowed segment in the distal common bile duct , and moderately severe dilatation of the left biliary radicals in the right hepatic duct .\\nA temporary stent was placed , which seemed to function well despite its unsatisfactory positioning .\\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well , and there were no complications .\\nHe was returned to the Surgical Ward in stable condition .\\nBecause of the probable malignant nature of the patient 's biliary obstruction , the patient was returned to the GI lab on 11/25/93 , where repeat endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was performed .\\nThis procedure was performed under general anesthesia , and resulted in successful placement of a permanent stent within the distal common bile duct .\\nAdditionally , a computer tomography guided needle biopsy was performed of the paraportal mass .\\nThese procedures were well tolerated by the patient , and were free of complication .\\nAs before , the patient was covered with post-procedure antibiotic therapy .\\nHe was returned to the surgical ward in stable condition .\\nPreliminary report on the biopsy specimen at the time of this dictation describes the presence of acute and chronic inflammation , but no malignant cells .\\nHowever , two cytology specimens were both positive for malignant cells , the histopathologic characteristics of which suggest adenocarcinoma .\\nFollowing the permanent stent placement , the patient 's diet was slowly advanced .\\nHis serum bilirubin levels and other liver function studies continued to normalize .\\nBecause of his rapid progress , the resolution of his right upper quadrant pain , and the fact that no surgical therapy was indicated at this time , the patient was discharged to his group home on 11/29/93 .\\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE :\\nImproved .\\nDOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :\\n1 ) Discharged to group home ,\\n2 ) diet as tolerated ,\\n3 ) activity ad lib ,\\n4 ) followup with Dr. Moyduhe ,\\n5 )\\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :\\nTagamet 400 mg. po q.day , Tetracycline 250 mg. po bid prn ingrown hair .\\nLUPEVICKETTE L.

placement , performed on 11/23/93 .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nMr. Tauaswatl is a 45 year old gentleman with Down 's syndrome , who presents to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital with jaundice .\\nMr. Tauaswatl has a history of vague abdominal and back pain over the past several years .\\nA recent workup of his symptoms , which were predominantly right upper quadrant symptoms was done .\\nA right upper quadrant abdominal ultrasound was obtained in May of 1993 .\\nThis study showed gall stones , with common bile duct dilatation .\\nSubsequently , an oral cholecystogram was performed , and the gall bladder was not visualized on this study .\\nThe patient was therefore diagnosed with chronic cholelithiasis , and possible choledocholithiasis .\\nOn Jul 27 , 1993 , the patient underwent a right upper quadrant abdominal exploration at the Nor Chi Gay Hospital .\\nAt operation , a phlegmon was noted in the right upper quadrants in the region of the gall bladder .\\nThe surgeons were unable to visualize the gall bladder , and the operation was aborted .\\nSince that time , the patient has had increasing jaundice , but no nausea or vomiting .\\nIt should be noted that the patient has experienced occasional episodes of vomiting for years , but these symptoms have not changed recently .\\nThe patient denies abdominal pain , fevers , chills , or any other complaints , although he was noted to have a fever over the weekend prior to admission .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\n1 ) Down 's syndrome ,\\n2 ) intestinal malrotation ,\\n3 ) status post Ladd 's procedure ,\\n4 ) status post duodenojejunostomy as an infant .\\nALLERGIES :\\nThe patient has no known drug allergies .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\n1 ) Tagamet 400 mg. po q.day ,\\n2 ) Tetracycline 250 mg. po bid prn ingrown facial hair .\\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS :\\nRemarkable only for a recent weight loss of 20 lb .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nThe patient is a well-nourished but jaundiced male , with Down 's facies , in no acute distress .\\nVital signs :\\ntemperature 97.8 , heart rate 107 , blood pressure 116/77 , respirations 20 .\\nHis head , eyes , ears , nose , and throat exam reveals a normocephalic and atraumatic head .\\nHis pupils were equal , round , reactive to light and accommodation , positive scleral icterus , intact extra ocular movements , and a supple neck .\\nExamination of the back reveals no costovertebral angle tenderness .\\nExamination of the chest reveals lungs which are clear to auscultation .\\nCardiovascular exam reveals regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 and S2 , a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur heard best at the upper right sternal border , and a 1/6 decrescendo diastolic murmur heard best at Erb 's point , with no gallop or rub appreciated .\\nThe abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended .\\nThere are no palpable masses , and there is no shake tenderness .\\nThere is a well-healed right subcostal scar , and a well-healed right paramedian scar .\\nRectal examination is nontender , free of any palpable masses , and guaiac-negative stool .\\nExtremities :\\nno clubbing , cyanosis or edema .\\nNeurological examination is nonfocal .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nA panel of serum electrolytes is normal .\\nThe white blood cell count is 7.3 , hematocrit 28.4 , platelets 586,000 .\\nLymphocyte differential count shows 77% PMNs , 13% lymphocytes , 8% monocytes , and 1% basophils .\\nAlkaline phosphatase is 1,342 , lactacte dehydrogenase is 253 , and AST is 221 .\\nTotal bilirubin is 10.7 , and direct bilirubin is 8.2 .\\nTotal protein is 7.1 , and albumin is 2.1 .\\nSerum amylase is 43 .\\nCalcium is 8.2 , magnesium 1.8 , and phosphorous 3.1 .\\nX-ray examination of the chest reveals clear lungs and a normal heart .\\nKUB and upright abdominal x-rays revealed no obstruction or perforation , focal dilatation of small bowel in the right upper quadrants , and two calcified densities noted in the right upper quadrants , which may represent gall stones .\\nUltrasonography of the right upper abdominal quadrant reveals a portal mass with calcification and possible invasion of the portal vein , thought to appear suspiciously similar to a hepatocellular carcinoma .\\nIntrahepatic biliary duct dilatation was noted proximal to the mass .\\nElectrocardiography reveals normal sinus rhythm , with non-specific ST and T-wave abnormalities in leads 2 , 3 , and AVF .\\nThe axis and intervals are otherwise within normal limits .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was admitted to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital to the General Surgery Service of Dr. Lynea Moyduhe .\\nA modified upper GI x-ray series was obtained , which revealed malpositioning of the duodenum and jejunum in the right abdomen , consistent with intestinal malrotation , but no evidence of obstruction in the duodenum or jejunum was identified .\\nTherefore , the patient was prevented from taking anything by mouth and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was performed .\\nThis study identified a 5 centimeter narrowed segment in the distal common bile duct , and moderately severe dilatation of the left biliary radicals in the right hepatic duct .\\nA temporary stent was placed , which seemed to function well despite its unsatisfactory positioning .\\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well , and there were no complications .\\nHe was returned to the Surgical Ward in stable condition .\\nBecause of the probable malignant nature of the patient 's biliary obstruction , the patient was returned to the GI lab on 11/25/93 , where repeat endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was performed .\\nThis procedure was performed under general anesthesia , and resulted in successful placement of a permanent stent within the distal common bile duct .\\nAdditionally , a computer tomography guided needle biopsy was performed of the paraportal mass .\\nThese procedures were well tolerated by the patient , and were free of complication .\\nAs before , the patient was covered with post-procedure antibiotic therapy .\\nHe was returned to the surgical ward in stable condition .\\nPreliminary report on the biopsy specimen at the time of this dictation describes the presence of acute and chronic inflammation , but no malignant cells .\\nHowever , two cytology specimens were both positive for malignant cells , the histopathologic characteristics of which suggest adenocarcinoma .\\nFollowing the permanent stent placement , the patient 's diet was slowly advanced .\\nHis serum bilirubin levels and other liver function studies continued to normalize .\\nBecause of his rapid progress , the resolution of his right upper quadrant pain , and the fact that no surgical therapy was indicated at this time , the patient was discharged to his group home on 11/29/93 .\\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE :\\nImproved .\\nDOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :\\n1 ) Discharged to group home ,\\n2 ) diet as tolerated ,\\n3 ) activity ad lib ,\\n4 ) followup with Dr. Moyduhe ,\\n5 )\\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :\\nTagamet 400 mg. po q.day , Tetracycline 250 mg. po bid prn ingrown hair .\\nLUPEVICKETTE L.

Breast cancer in the right breast , diagnosed in 1995 with negative nodes , treated with excision , recurrence in June , 2001 , further reconstructive surgery .\\nAt the same time , she underwent reduction of t he left breast .\\n2. History of bipolar disorder , for which she sees Dr. Lettefriscbreun .\\nShe indicates this is stable at this time .\\n3. History of chronic anxiety .\\n4.

Imodium , 2 mg. q.a.m.\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nExamination reveals that the patient is walking with a mild limp .\\nThe left hip is a bit stiff with flexion to 90 degrees .\\nShe has 10 degrees of internal rotation and external rotation .\\nPulses are fine .\\nIMAGING :\\nX-rays were reviewed .\\nThey showed advanced arthritis of the left hip .\\nRECOMMENDATIONS :\\nDr. Etteme Overall recommended that the patient have a total hip replacement on the left side on February 2 , 2003 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nPlease refer to the operative note by Dr. Etteme Overall for details of the procedure .\\nPostoperatively , the patient was transferred to the floor in stable condition for observation , pain control and mobilization .\\nInitially postoperatively , she was doing quite well , though she did require four liters of oxygen postoperatively to maintain her oxygen saturations .\\nIt was hoped that she would wean off the oxygen over the course of the next few hours .\\nHowever , she did require four liters of oxygen all the way through the night to maintain oxygen saturations of 93% .\\nWithout oxygen , she dropped down to the low 80s .\\nGiven the unusual nature of this oxygen requirement , the patient underwent work-up with a chest X-ray , which essentially was normal .\\nAn ABG revealed a normal PCO2 of 32 , but a decrease in PO2- at 62 .\\nTherefore , given her history of breast cancer , the patient was taken for a spiral CT scan and the Medicine Service was consulted at that time .\\nThey agreed with our plan .\\nOn spiral CT scan , a small pulmonary embolus was seen in the right upper lobe and the left low er lobe .\\nShe was started on heparin at that time to maintain a PTT of 60 t o 80 , and was given doses of Coumadin , in addition to the Coumadin she had been given for DVT prophylaxis .\\nWith the recommendation of the medicine te am , we decided to maintain an INR of 2 to 3 with an overlap of heparin when the patient was therapeutic for two to three days .\\nShe continued to do quite well even though we did keep her on bed rest for three days while she was heparinized .\\nHer oxygen saturations continued to improve to the point that she was on room air on postoperative day four with oxygen saturation of 95% .\\nShe was given perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis for 48 hours after surgery .\\nShe was mobilized on postoperative day four , getting out of bed , able to do quite well on her new hip with a minimal amount of pain .\\nShe was given posterior hip dislocation precautions at that time , which she understood quite well .\\nShe continued to be followed by the medical team and was watched very closely by the orthopedic team until we felt comfortable that she was breathing quite well and was mobilizing well with physical therapy .\\nTherefore , it was decided at that time that the patient was ready for discharge to rehabilitation on Coumadin , which would be monitored for six months to maintain an INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nThe patient will continue all of her pre-admission medications , though no nonsteroidal analgesics , e.g. , aspirin or ibuprofen , will be given while she is on Coumadin therapy .\\n1. Colace , 100 mg. PO t.i.d.\\n2. Percocet , one to two tablets PO q.3 to 4 hours p.r.n. pain .\\n3. Coumadin with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nPlease prescribe 2 mg. tablets .\\nThe patient will be on Coumadin for six months given her history of pulmonary embolus .\\nDISCHARGE PLAN :\\nCoumadin for six months postoperatively with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nCheck INR three times a week until stable .\\nPlease call the results to Dr. Viennee Ester , the patient 's primary-care physician , who has agreed to follow her INR levels for the remainder of the six months .\\nDr. Viennee Ester is located in Tlandcousti Lo Vuclark , where the patient is from originally .\\nThe patient will call Dr. Overall 's office to arrange a follow-up appointment six weeks from the day of surgery .\\nStaples can be removed 10 to 14 days postoperatively .\\nPlease hold removal if the wound is draining .\\nThe patient may shower once the incision is dry , and may bathe and / or swim after the staples have been removed and there is no wound drainage .\\nPartial weight-bearing with crutches or a walker with posterior hip dislocation precautions for three months following surgery .\\nThese precautions have been explained and demonstrated to the patient .\\nThe patient has been instructed to call Dr. Overall 's office or the orthopedist on call with any questions or concerns about increasing pain , swelling , redness , wound drainage , fevers or chills at 094-897-3231 .\\nKEMA ESTER ,\\nMD DICTATING FOR :\\nElectronically Signed ETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D. 02/22/2003 07:01\\n_____________________________ ETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D.\\nTR :\\npe\\nDD :\\n02/08/2003\\nTD :\\n02/08/2003 6:34 P 737058\\ncc :\\nETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D. ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY ALLMID HEALTH CENTER KEMA ESTER , MILD VIENNEE C.

        "When handling large volumes of clinical notes, cost becomes a key consideration. Since such small datasets are rare in real-world applications, we estimated the expenses for these tools based on processing 1 million unstructured clinical notes, with each document averaging around 5,250 characters.\n",
        "\n",
        "**[Amazon Comprehend Medical Pricing:](https://aws.amazon.com/comprehend/medical/pricing/)** According to the price calculator, obtaining PHI predictions for 1M documents, with an average of 5,250 characters per document, costs \\$14,525.\n",

Based on this, processing 1M documents and de-identifying the PHI entities would take about 13680 minutes (228 hours (approximately 9.5 days), but with proper scaling, it can be completed in just one day), costing \\$273 for infrastructure and \\$2145 for the license (considering a 1-month license price of \\$7,000).

        "# Conclusion\n",
        "\n",
        "In this study, we compared the performance of Healthcare NLP, Amazon Comprehend Medical, Azure Health Data Services, OpenAI GPT-4o, and Anthropic Claude 3.7 Sonnet tools on a ground truth dataset annotated by medical experts. The results were evaluated from two perspectives: chunk-level and token-level.\n",
        "\n",
        "- The **chunk-level evaluation** showed that **Healthcare NLP outperformed the others in terms of accurately capturing entities and minimizing missed entities**. After Healthcare NLP, Azure Health Data Services ranked second, followed by Claude 3.7 Sonnet model in third, Amazon Comprehend Medical in fourth, and GPT-4o model in fifth.\n",
        "- The **token-level evaluation** revealed that **Healthcare NLP achieved the best results in terms of precision, recall, and F1 score**, with Azure Health Data Services, Amazon Comprehend Medical, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and GPT-4o trailing behind in that order.\n",
        "- **Adaptability of Tools:** One of the key differences among these tools is their level of adaptability. While Azure Health Data Services, Amazon Comprehend Medical, OpenAI GPT-4o, and Anthropic Claude 3.7 Sonnet model are API-based, black-box cloud solutions that do not allow modifications or customization of results, the **Healthcare NLP library offers a highly flexible approach**. Its de-identification pipeline can be implemented with just **two lines of code**, and users can easily customize outputs by modifying the pipeline's stages to suit specific requirements.\n",
        "- **Cost-Effectiveness:** Healthcare NLP emerges as **the most cost-effective solution** when comparing the cost of de-identification tools (excluding Azure, as its pricing could not be verified) for processing large-scale clinical notes. Unlike API-based services such as Azure and Amazon, which charge per request and can become expensive at scale, **Healthcare NLP offers a flexible, local deployment option that significantly reduces costs.** Additionally, even if you process **1 billion clinical notes**, **the cost remains fixed for the same time period**. Unlike API-based solutions, which charge per request and scale in cost as volume increases, **the Healthcare NLP library offers consistent pricing.**\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, the **Healthcare NLP** library consistently **outperformed** Azure Health Data Services, Amazon Comprehend Medical, OpenAI GPT-4o , and Anthropic Claude 3.7 Sonnet models **in both chunk-level and token-level evaluations**, achieving **the highest precision, recall, and F1 scores** while minimizing missed entities. Beyond accuracy, its **adaptability** sets it apart, unlike Azure, Amazon, GPT-4o, and Claude 3.7 Sonnet, which are black-box API solutions with no customization options, **Healthcare NLP allows users to modify its deidentification pipeline to meet specific needs**. Additionally, it proves to be **the most cost-effective solution**, offering substantial savings compared to cloud-based alternatives that charge per request.\n",
