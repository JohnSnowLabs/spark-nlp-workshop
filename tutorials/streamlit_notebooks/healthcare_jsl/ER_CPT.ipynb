Currently, he has a fistula from his anterior abdominal wall out.   CT scans show thickened terminal ileum, which suggest that we are dealing with Crohn's disease.,MEDICATIONS:  ,General anesthesia.,INSTRUMENT:,  Olympus GIF-160 and PCF-160.,COMPLICATIONS: , None.,FINDINGS: , With the patient in the supine position, intubated under general anesthesia. The endoscope was inserted without difficulty into the hypopharynx.  The scope was advanced down the esophagus, which had normal mucosal coloration and vascular pattern.  It appeared normal and appeared to function normally.  The endoscope was advanced into the stomach, which was distended with excess air.  Rugal folds were flattened completely.  There were multiple superficial erosions scattered throughout the fundus, body, and antral portions consistent with Crohn's involvement of the stomach. Biopsies were obtained x2 in the second portion of the duodenum, antrum, body, and distal esophagus from the central incisors for histology.  Two additional biopsies were obtained in the antrum for CLO testing.  Excess air was evacuated from the stomach.  The scope was removed from the patient who tolerated that part of the procedure well.,The cecal area had multiple ulcers with exudate.  The ileocecal valve was markedly distorted.  Biopsies were obtained x2 in the cecal area and then the scope was withdrawn through the ascending, transverse, descending, sigmoid, and rectum.  The colonic mucosa in these areas was well seen and there were a few scattered aphthous ulcers in the ascending and descending colon.  Biopsies were obtained in the cecum at 65 cm, transverse colon 50 cm and rectosigmoid 20 cmNo fistulas were noted in the colon.  Excess air was evacuated from the colon.  The scope was removed.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to recovery in satisfactory condition.\"\"\",\n","\"\"\"Right lower quadrant abdominal pain, rule out acute appendicitis.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:,  Acute suppurative appendicitis.,PROCEDURE PERFORMED:,1.

She admits to some nausea associated with it.  There have been no fevers, chills, and/or genitourinary symptoms.  The patient had right lower quadrant tenderness with rebound and percussion tenderness in the right lower quadrant.
