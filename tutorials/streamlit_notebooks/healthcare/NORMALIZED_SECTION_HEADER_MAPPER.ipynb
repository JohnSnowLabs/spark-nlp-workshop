This involved cough, post-tussive emesis, questionable fever, but only 99.7.  Their usual doctor prescribed amoxicillin over the phone.  The coughing persisted and worsened.  She went to the ER, where sats were normal at baseline, but dropped into the 80s with coughing spells.  They did witness some apnea.  They gave some Rocephin, did some labs, and the patient was transferred to hospital.\n",

            "RADIOGRAPHIC STUDIES She had a CBC done Garberville, which showed a white count of 12.4, with a differential of 10 segs, 82 lymphs, 8 monos, hemoglobin of 15, hematocrit 42, platelets 296,000, and a normal BMP.  An x-ray was done and I do not have an official interpretation, but to the admitting physician, Dr. X it showed no significant infiltrate.  Well at hospital, she had a rapid influenza swab done, which was negative.  She had a rapid RSV done, which is still not in the chart, but I believe I was told that it was negative.  She also had a pertussis PCR swab done and a pertussis culture done, neither of which has result in the chart.  I do know that the pertussis culture proved to be negative.\n",
