In addition, there may be contribution from large doses of opiates and standing doses of gabapentin.,2.  Severe central sleep apnea, on CPAP at 10 cmH2O and supplemental oxygen at 8 liters per minute.  The breathing pattern is that of cluster or Biot's breathing throughout sleep.  The primary etiology is probably opiate use, with contribution with further exacerbation by severe obesity which acts to lower the baseline oxyhemoglobin saturation, and worsen desaturations during apneic episodes.\"\"\"\n","]"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":7,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":6644,"status":"ok","timestamp":1675810063729,"user":{"displayName":"Damla","userId":"03285166568766987047"},"user_tz":-60},"id":"qvCvj1hBI_09","outputId":"669615b3-b939-40b0-c9b2-1dac76d2cf32"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n","|                                                                                                text|\n","+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n","|Two weeks prior to presentation , she was treated with a five-day course of amoxicillin for a res...|\n","|This 48-year-old woman returns in followup after a full-night sleep study performed to evaluate h...|\n","|The patient returns to the Pulmonary Medicine Clinic for followup evaluation of interstitial dise...|\n","|CHIEF COMPLAINT:,  Leg pain.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:,  This is a 56-year-old female who has p...|\n","|This is an extremely pleasant 64-year-old gentleman who I am following for essential thrombocytos...|\n","|The patient is a 40-year-old white male who presents with a chief complaint of \"chest pain\".
