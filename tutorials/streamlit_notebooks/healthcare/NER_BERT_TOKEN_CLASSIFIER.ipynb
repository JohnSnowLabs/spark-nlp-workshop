(GIRK) channel family. Here we describe the genomic organization of the KCNJ9 locus on chromosome 1q21-23 as a candidate gene for type II diabetes mellitus in the Pima Indian population. The gene spans approximately 7.6 kb and contains one noncoding and two coding exons separated by approximately 2.2 and approximately 2.6 kb introns, respectively. We identified14 single </span><span class=\"spark-nlp-display-entity-wrapper\" style=\"background-color: #5A92A9\"><span class=\"spark-nlp-display-entity-name\">nucleotide </span><span class=\"spark-nlp-display-entity-type\">DrugChem</span></span><span class=\"spark-nlp-display-others\" style=\"background-color: white\"> polymorphisms (SNPs), including one that predicts aVal366Ala substitution, and an 8 base-pair (bp) insertion/deletion. Our expression studies revealed the presence of the transcript in various human tissues including the pancreas, and two major insulin-responsive tissues: fat and skeletal muscle. The characterization of the KCNJ9 gene should facilitate further studies on the function of the KCNJ9 protein and allow evaluation of the potential role of the locus in Type II diabetes.BACKGROUND: At present, it is one of the most important issues for the treatment of breast cancer to develop the standard therapy for patients previously treated with anthracyclines and taxanes. With the objective of determining the usefulness of vinorelbine monotherapy in patients with advanced or recurrent breast cancer after standard therapy, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of vinorelbine in patients previously treated with anthracyclines and taxanes.</span></div>"]},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["bert_token_classifier_ner_deid download started this may take some time.\n","[OK!]\n","<----------------- MODEL NAME: \u001b[1mbert_token_classifier_ner_deid\u001b[0m  ----------------- >\n","+------------+---------+\n","|chunk       |ner_label|\n","+------------+---------+\n","|Smith       |PATIENT  |\n","|60-year-old |AGE      |\n","|VA Hospital |HOSPITAL |\n","|Day Hospital|HOSPITAL |\n","|02/04/2003  |DATE     |\n","|Smith       |PATIENT  |\n","|Day Hospital|HOSPITAL |\n","+------------+---------+\n","\n"]},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.HTML object>"],"text/html":["\n","<style>\n","    @import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Montserrat:wght@300;400;500;600;700&display=swap');\n","    @import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Vistol Regular:wght@300;400;500;600;700&display=swap');\n","    \n","    .spark-nlp-display-scroll-entities {\n","        border: 1px solid #E7EDF0;\n","        border-radius: 3px;\n","        text-align: justify;\n","        \n","    }\n","    .spark-nlp-display-scroll-entities span {  \n","        font-size: 14px;\n","        line-height: 24px;\n","        color: #536B76;\n","        font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif !important;\n","    }\n","    \n","    .spark-nlp-display-entity-wrapper{\n","    \n","        display: inline-grid;\n","        text-align: center;\n","        border-radius: 4px;\n","        margin: 0 2px 5px 2px;\n","        padding: 1px\n","    }\n","    .spark-nlp-display-entity-name{\n","        font-size: 14px;\n","        line-height: 24px;\n","        font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif !important;\n","        \n","        background: #f1f2f3;\n","        border-width: medium;\n","        text-align: center;\n","        \n","        font-weight: 400;\n","        \n","        border-radius: 5px;\n","        padding: 2px 5px;\n","        display: block;\n","        margin: 3px 2px;\n","    \n","    }\n","    .spark-nlp-display-entity-type{\n","        font-size: 14px;\n","        line-height: 24px;\n","        color: #ffffff;\n","        font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif !important;\n","        \n","        text-transform: uppercase;\n","        \n","        font-weight: 500;\n","\n","        display: block;\n","        padding: 3px 5px;\n","    }\n","    \n","    .spark-nlp-display-entity-resolution{\n","        font-size: 14px;\n","        line-height: 24px;\n","        color: #ffffff;\n","        font-family: 'Vistol Regular', sans-serif !important;\n","        \n","        text-transform: uppercase;\n","        \n","        font-weight: 500;\n","\n","        display: block;\n","        padding: 3px 5px;\n","    }\n","    \n","    .spark-nlp-display-others{\n","        font-size: 14px;\n","        line-height: 24px;\n","        font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif !important;\n","        \n","        font-weight: 400;\n","    }\n","\n","</style>\n"," <span class=\"spark-nlp-display-others\" style=\"background-color: white\">HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. </span><span class=\"spark-nlp-display-entity-wrapper\" style=\"background-color: #2213BE\"><span class=\"spark-nlp-display-entity-name\">Smith </span><span class=\"spark-nlp-display-entity-type\">PATIENT</span></span><span class=\"spark-nlp-display-others\" style=\"background-color: white\"> is a </span><span class=\"spark-nlp-display-entity-wrapper\" style=\"background-color: #ffe0ac\"><span class=\"spark-nlp-display-entity-name\">60-year-old </span><span class=\"spark-nlp-display-entity-type\">AGE</span></span><span class=\"spark-nlp-display-others\" style=\"background-color: white\"> white male veteran with multiple comorbidities, who has a history of bladder cancer diagnosed approximately two years ago by the </span><span class=\"spark-nlp-display-entity-wrapper\" style=\"background-color: #C15E23\"><span class=\"spark-nlp-display-entity-name\">VA Hospital </span><span class=\"spark-nlp-display-entity-type\">HOSPITAL</span></span><span class=\"spark-nlp-display-others\" style=\"background-color: white\">.
