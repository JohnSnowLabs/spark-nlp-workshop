Conclusion:Health care professionals can use these recommendations as the basis of their advice to parents.\"\"\",\n","\"\"\"Abstract:Over the past decade there has been a significant shift to the use of murine models for investigations into the molecular basis of respiratory diseases, including asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. These models offer the exciting prospect of dissecting the complex interaction between cytokines, chemokines and growth related peptides in disease pathogenesis. Furthermore, the receptors and the intracellular signalling pathways that are subsequently activated are amenable for study because of the availability of monoclonal antibodies and techniques for targeted gene disruption and gene incorporation for individual mediators, receptors and proteins. However, it is clear that extrapolation from these models to the human condition is not straightforward, as reflected by some recent clinical disappointments. This is not necessarily a problem with the use of mice itself, but results from our continued ignorance of the disease process and how to improve the modelling of complex interactions between different inflammatory mediators that underlie clinical pathology. This review highlights some of the strengths and weaknesses of murine models of respiratory disease.\"\"\"\n","]"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":14,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":43419,"status":"ok","timestamp":1675799150783,"user":{"displayName":"Damla","userId":"03285166568766987047"},"user_tz":-60},"id":"kTJM1PxCm-Qp","outputId":"46f87b46-2f6a-4649-8bd3-89eee393f582"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["bert_sequence_classifier_binary_rct_biobert download started this may take some time.\n","[OK!]\n"]}],"source":["document_assembler = DocumentAssembler() \\\n","    .setInputCol(\"text\") \\\n","    .setOutputCol(\"document\")\n","\n","\n","tokenizer = Tokenizer() \\\n","    .setInputCols([\"document\"]) \\\n","    .setOutputCol(\"token\")\n","\n","\n","sequenceClassifier_loaded = MedicalBertForSequenceClassification.pretrained(\"bert_sequence_classifier_binary_rct_biobert\", \"en\", \"clinical/models\")\\\n","  .setInputCols([\"document\",'token'])\\\n","  .setOutputCol(\"class_\")\n","\n","\n","pipeline = Pipeline(stages=[\n","                document_assembler, \n","                tokenizer,\n","                sequenceClassifier_loaded   \n","            ])\n","\n","\n","df = spark.createDataFrame(sample_texts, StringType()).toDF(\"text\")\n","results = pipeline.fit(df).transform(df)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":15,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":12601,"status":"ok","timestamp":1675799163372,"user":{"displayName":"Damla","userId":"03285166568766987047"},"user_tz":-60},"id":"XhLCxp3w2Hhs","outputId":"57e81c28-3f70-493d-fc23-3ce1612896e0"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["+----------+----------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n","|prediction|confidence|                                                                                            sentence|\n","+----------+----------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n","|      True| 0.9999721|Background:European roundtable meeting recommendations on bathing and cleansing of infants were p...|\n","|     False| 0.9999644|Abstract:Over the past decade there has been a significant shift to the use of murine models for ...|\n","+----------+----------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n","\n"]}],"source":["res = results.select(F.explode(F.arrays_zip(results.document.result, \n","                                            results.class_.result,\n","                                            results.class_.metadata)).alias(\"col\"))\\\n","              .select(F.expr(\"col['1']\").alias(\"prediction\"),\n","                      F.expr(\"col['2']\").alias(\"confidence\"),\n","                      F.expr(\"col['0']\").alias(\"sentence\"))\n","if res.count()>1:\n","    udf_func = F.udf(lambda x,y:  x[\"Some(\"+str(y)+\")\"])\n","    res.withColumn('confidence', udf_func(res.confidence, res.prediction)).show(truncate=100)"]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3.9.2 64-bit ('3.9.2')","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.9.2"},"vscode":{"interpreter":{"hash":"a6cfde16737151ae49a327430a5fbb48432a976136d1f3391213c81bbed9fca8"}}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
