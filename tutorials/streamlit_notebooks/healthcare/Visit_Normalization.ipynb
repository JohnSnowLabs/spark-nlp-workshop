The patient's neck, chest, and shoulders were prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion. An incision was made on the left shoulder area. The left subclavian vein was cannulated. The wire was passed, which was in good position under fluoro, using Seldinger Technique. Near wire incision site made a pocket above the fascia and sutured in a size 7.5-French single-lumen MediPort into the pocket in 4 places using 3-0 Nurolon. I then sized the catheter under fluoro and placed introducer and dilator over the wire, removed the wire and dilator, placed the catheter through the introducer and removed the introducer. The line tip was in good position under fluoro. It withdrew and flushed well. I then closed the incision using 4-0 Vicryl, 5-0 Monocryl for the skin, and dressed with Steri-Strips. Accessed the ports with a 1-inch 20-gauge Huber needle, and it withdrew and flushed well with final heparin flush. We secured this with Tegaderm.

History of pulmonary embolism. Upon admission, the patient reported an approximate two-week history of dyspnea on exertion and some mild chest pain. She underwent a CTA, which showed no evidence of pulmonary embolism and the patient was started on prophylactic doses of Lovenox at 40 mg a day. She had no further complaints throughout the hospitalization with any shortness of breath or chest pain.3. History of subdural hematoma, also on admission the patient noted some mild intermittent headaches that were fleeting in nature, several a day that would resolve on their own. Her headaches were not responding to pain medication and so on 07/24/2008, we obtained a head CT that showed no evidence of acute intracranial abnormalities. The patient also had a history of sinusitis and so a sinus CT scan was obtained, which was normal.4. Pancytopenia. On admission, the patient's white blood count was 3.4, hemoglobin 11.3, platelet count 82, and ANC of 2400. The patient's counts were followed throughout admission. She did not require transfusion of red blood cells or platelets; however, on 07/26/2008 her ANC did dip to 900 and she was placed on neutropenic diet.

We have decided to recommend to the patient breast conservation surgery with left breast lumpectomy with preoperative sentinel lymph node injection and mapping and left axillary dissection. The possibility of further surgery requiring wider lumpectomy or even completion mastectomy was explained to the patient. The procedure and risks of the surgery were explained to include, but not limited to extra bleeding, infection, unsightly scar formation, the possibility of local recurrence, the possibility of left upper extremity lymphedema was explained. Local numbness, paresthesias or chronic pain was explained. The patient was given an educational brochure and several brochures about the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancers. She was certainly encouraged to obtain further surgical medical opinions prior to proceeding. I believe the patient has given full informed consent and desires to proceed with the above.\"\"\"]"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":6,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":84185,"status":"ok","timestamp":1675724536263,"user":{"displayName":"Damla","userId":"03285166568766987047"},"user_tz":-60},"id":"EPF7EV4tUGNI","outputId":"7c6c5350-27de-48ee-9a89-e61f730bdb63"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["sentence_detector_dl download started this may take some time.\n","Approximate size to download 354.6 KB\n","[OK!]\n","embeddings_clinical download started this may take some time.\n","Approximate size to download 1.6 GB\n","[OK!]\n","ner_jsl_slim download started this may take some time.\n","[OK!]\n"]}],"source":["documentAssembler = DocumentAssembler()\\\n","      .setInputCol(\"text\")\\\n","      .setOutputCol(\"document\")\n"," \n","sentenceDetector = SentenceDetectorDLModel.pretrained()\\\n","      .setInputCols([\"document\"])\\\n","      .setOutputCol(\"sentence\")\n"," \n","tokenizer = Tokenizer()\\\n","      .setInputCols([\"sentence\"])\\\n","      .setOutputCol(\"token\")\\\n"," \n","word_embeddings = WordEmbeddingsModel.pretrained(\"embeddings_clinical\", \"en\", \"clinical/models\")\\\n","      .setInputCols([\"sentence\", \"token\"])\\\n","      .setOutputCol(\"embeddings\")\n"," \n","c2doc = Chunk2Doc()\\\n","      .setInputCols(\"ner_chunk\")\\\n","      .setOutputCol(\"ner_chunk_doc\") \n"," \n","clinical_ner = MedicalNerModel.pretrained(\"ner_jsl_slim\", \"en\", \"clinical/models\") \\\n","      .setInputCols([\"sentence\", \"token\", \"embeddings\"]) \\\n","      .setOutputCol(\"ner\")\n"," \n","ner_converter = NerConverter() \\\n","      .setInputCols([\"sentence\", \"token\", \"ner\"]) \\\n","      .setOutputCol(\"ner_chunk\")\\\n","      .setWhiteList([\"Header\"])\n","\n","\n","pipeline = Pipeline(\n","    stages = [\n","        documentAssembler,\n","        sentenceDetector,\n","        tokenizer,\n","        word_embeddings,\n","        clinical_ner,\n","        ner_converter\n","        ])\n"," \n","empty_df = spark.createDataFrame([[\"\"]]).toDF('text')\n","pipeline_model = pipeline.fit(empty_df)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":8,"metadata":{"id":"ZRxv2WKjUGNJ","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1675724799634,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":312,"user":{"displayName":"Damla","userId":"03285166568766987047"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["import pandas as pd\n","\n","df = spark.createDataFrame(pd.DataFrame({'text': input_list}))"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"XjgpBmXmUGNK"},"source":["## 3.

The patient's neck, chest, and shoulders were prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion. An incision was made on the left shoulder area. The left subclavian vein was cannulated. The wire was passed, which was in good position under fluoro, using Seldinger Technique. Near wire incision site made a pocket above the fascia and sutured in a size 7.5-French single-lumen MediPort into the pocket in 4 places using 3-0 Nurolon. I then sized the catheter under fluoro and placed introducer and dilator over the wire, removed the wire and dilator, placed the catheter through the introducer and removed the introducer. The line tip was in good position under fluoro. It withdrew and flushed well. I then closed the incision using 4-0 Vicryl, 5-0 Monocryl for the skin, and dressed with Steri-Strips. Accessed the ports with a 1-inch 20-gauge Huber needle, and it withdrew and flushed well with final heparin flush. We secured this with Tegaderm. The patient is then to undergo bilateral bone marrow biopsy and lumbar puncture by Oncology.</span></div>"]},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["******************************\n","3\n","******************************\n"]},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.HTML object>"],"text/html":["\n","<style>\n","    @import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Montserrat:wght@300;400;500;600;700&display=swap');\n","    @import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Vistol Regular:wght@300;400;500;600;700&display=swap');\n","    \n","    .spark-nlp-display-scroll-entities {\n","        border: 1px solid #E7EDF0;\n","        border-radius: 3px;\n","        text-align: justify;\n","        \n","    }\n","    .spark-nlp-display-scroll-entities span {  \n","        font-size: 14px;\n","        line-height: 24px;\n","        color: #536B76;\n","        font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif !important;\n","    }\n","    \n","    .spark-nlp-display-entity-wrapper{\n","    \n","        display: inline-grid;\n","        text-align: center;\n","        border-radius: 4px;\n","        margin: 0 2px 5px 2px;\n","        padding: 1px\n","    }\n","    .spark-nlp-display-entity-name{\n","        font-size: 14px;\n","        line-height: 24px;\n","        font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif !important;\n","        \n","        background: #f1f2f3;\n","        border-width: medium;\n","        text-align: center;\n","        \n","        font-weight: 400;\n","        \n","        border-radius: 5px;\n","        padding: 2px 5px;\n","        display: block;\n","        margin: 3px 2px;\n","    \n","    }\n","    .spark-nlp-display-entity-type{\n","        font-size: 14px;\n","        line-height: 24px;\n","        color: #ffffff;\n","        font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif !important;\n","        \n","        text-transform: uppercase;\n","        \n","        font-weight: 500;\n","\n","        display: block;\n","        padding: 3px 5px;\n","    }\n","    \n","    .spark-nlp-display-entity-resolution{\n","        font-size: 14px;\n","        line-height: 24px;\n","        color: #ffffff;\n","        font-family: 'Vistol Regular', sans-serif !important;\n","        \n","        text-transform: uppercase;\n","        \n","        font-weight: 500;\n","\n","        display: block;\n","        padding: 3px 5px;\n","    }\n","    \n","    .spark-nlp-display-others{\n","        font-size: 14px;\n","        line-height: 24px;\n","        font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif !important;\n","        \n","        font-weight: 400;\n","    }\n","\n","</style>\n"," <span class=\"spark-nlp-display-others\" style=\"background-color: white\">Sample Name: Leiomyosarcoma<br></span><span class=\"spark-nlp-display-entity-wrapper\" style=\"background-color: #073015\"><span class=\"spark-nlp-display-entity-name\">Description: </span><span class=\"spark-nlp-display-entity-type\">Header</span></span><span class=\"spark-nlp-display-others\" style=\"background-color: white\"> Discharge summary of patient with leiomyosarcoma and history of pulmonary embolism, subdural hematoma, pancytopenia, and pneumonia.

Leiomyosarcoma, the patient was admitted to Hem/Onco B Service under attending Dr. XYZ for cycle six of continuous IV infusion Cytoxan, Adriamycin, and DTIC, which she tolerated well.2. History of pulmonary embolism. Upon admission, the patient reported an approximate two-week history of dyspnea on exertion and some mild chest pain. She underwent a CTA, which showed no evidence of pulmonary embolism and the patient was started on prophylactic doses of Lovenox at 40 mg a day. She had no further complaints throughout the hospitalization with any shortness of breath or chest pain.3. History of subdural hematoma, also on admission the patient noted some mild intermittent headaches that were fleeting in nature, several a day that would resolve on their own. Her headaches were not responding to pain medication and so on 07/24/2008, we obtained a head CT that showed no evidence of acute intracranial abnormalities. The patient also had a history of sinusitis and so a sinus CT scan was obtained, which was normal.4. Pancytopenia. On admission, the patient's white blood count was 3.4, hemoglobin 11.3, platelet count 82, and ANC of 2400. The patient's counts were followed throughout admission. She did not require transfusion of red blood cells or platelets; however, on 07/26/2008 her ANC did dip to 900 and she was placed on neutropenic diet. At discharge her ANC is back up to 1100 and she is taken off neutropenic diet. Her white blood cell count at discharge was 1.4 and her hemoglobin was 11.2 with a platelet count of 140.<br>5.

We have decided to recommend to the patient breast conservation surgery with left breast lumpectomy with preoperative sentinel lymph node injection and mapping and left axillary dissection. The possibility of further surgery requiring wider lumpectomy or even completion mastectomy was explained to the patient. The procedure and risks of the surgery were explained to include, but not limited to extra bleeding, infection, unsightly scar formation, the possibility of local recurrence, the possibility of left upper extremity lymphedema was explained. Local numbness, paresthesias or chronic pain was explained. The patient was given an educational brochure and several brochures about the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancers. She was certainly encouraged to obtain further surgical medical opinions prior to proceeding. I believe the patient has given full informed consent and desires to proceed with the above.</span></div>"]},"metadata":{}}],"source":["from sparknlp_display import NerVisualizer\n","\n","for i, sample in enumerate(input_list):\n","    \n","    print(\"*\"*30)\n","    print(i+1)\n","    print(\"*\"*30)\n","    \n","    light_result = light_pipeline.fullAnnotate(sample)\n","    \n","    visualiser = NerVisualizer()\n","\n","    visualiser.display(light_result[0], label_col='ner_chunk', document_col='document')"]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[]},"interpreter":{"hash":"45150093197569bb3a58481dcd32cd1adb45462fa3448719e8ac38ada6166aca"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Environment (conda_tensorflow_p36)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.6.10"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
