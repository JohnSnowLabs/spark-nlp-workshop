The patient has received prior intravenous chemotherapy. Due to some increasing renal insufficiency and difficulties with hydration, it was elected to change her to intraperitoneal therapy. She had her first course with intraperitoneal cisplatin, which was very difficultly tolerated by her. Therefore, on the last hospitalization for IP chemo, she was switched to Taxol. The patient since her last visit has done relatively well. She had no acute problems and has basically only chronic difficulties. She has had some decrease in her appetite, although her weight has been stable. She has had no fever, chills, or sweats. Activity remains good and she has continued difficulty with depression associated with type 1 bipolar disease. She had a recent CT scan of the chest and abdomen. The report showed the following findings. In the chest, there was a small hiatal hernia and a calcification in the region of the mitral valve. There was one mildly enlarged mediastinal lymph node. Several areas of ground-glass opacity were noted in the lower lungs, which were subtle and nonspecific. No pulmonary masses were noted. In the abdomen, there were no abnormalities of the liver, pancreas, spleen, and left adrenal gland. On the right adrenal gland, a 17 x 13 mm right adrenal adenoma was noted. There were some bilateral renal masses present, which were not optimally evaluated due to noncontrast study. A hyperdense focus in the lower pole of the left kidney was felt to most probably represent a hemorrhagic renal cyst. It was unchanged from February and measured 9 mm. There was again minimal left pelvic/iliac _______ with right and left peritoneal catheters noted and were unremarkable. Mesenteric nodes were seen, which were similar in appearance to the previous study that was felt somewhat more conspicuous due to opacified bowel adjacent to them. There was a conglomerate omental mass, which had decreased in volume when compared to previous study, now measuring 8.4 x 1.6 cm. In the pelvis, there was a small amount of ascites in the right pelvis extending from the inferior right paracolic gutter. No suspicious osseous lesions were noted.\"\"\",\n","]"],"execution_count":10,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"1gmrjqHSGcJx","colab_type":"text"},"source":["# 4.
