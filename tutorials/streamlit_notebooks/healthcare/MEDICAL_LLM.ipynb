We present results of per-oral transgastric splenectomy in a porcine model. The goal of this study was to determine the technical feasibility of per-oral transgastric splenectomy using a flexible endoscope. We performed acute experiments on 50-kg pigs. All animals were fed liquids for 3 days prior to procedure. The procedures were performed under general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation. The flexible endoscope was passed per orally into the stomach and puncture of the gastric wall was performed with a needle knife. The puncture was extended to create a 1.5-cm incision using a pull-type sphincterotome, and a double-channel endoscope was advanced into the peritoneal cavity. The peritoneal cavity was insufflated with air through the endoscope. The spleen was visualized. The splenic vessels were ligated with endoscopic loops and clips, and then mesentery was dissected using electrocautery. Endoscopic splenectomy was performed on six pigs. There were no complications during gastric incision and entrance into the peritoneal cavity. Visualization of the spleen and other intraperitoneal organs was very good. Ligation of the splenic vessels and mobilization of the spleen were achieved using commercially available devices and endoscopic accessories.\",\n",

A retrospective review was performed on 52 cases with a histologic diagnosis of acute chorioamnionitis from 2,051 deliveries at University Hospital, Newark, from January 2003 to July 2003. Third-trimester placentas without histologic chorioamnionitis (n = 52) served as controls. Cases and controls were selected sequentially. Maternal medical records were reviewed for indicators of maternal infection. Histologic chorioamnionitis was significantly associated with the usage of antibiotics (p = 0.0095) and a higher mean white blood cell count (p = 0.018). The presence of 1 or more clinical indicators was significantly associated with the presence of histologic chorioamnionitis (p = 0.019).\",\n",

Post hoc analysis of data from a proof-of-concept, double-blind, randomized study of 134 adult patients treated with esomeprazole (10 or 40 mg od for 4 weeks) for LA grade C or D oesophagitis. A curve was fitted to pooled 24-h intragastric pH (day 5) and endoscopically assessed healing (4 weeks) data using piecewise quadratic logistic regression. Maximal reflux oesophagitis healing rates were achieved when intragastric pH>4 was achieved for approximately 50-70% (12-17 h) of the 24-h period. Acid suppression above this threshold did not yield further increases in healing rates.\"\n",

The peritoneal cavity was insufflated with air through the endoscope. The spleen was visualized. The splenic vessels were ligated with endoscopic loops and clips, and then mesentery was dissected using electrocautery. Endoscopic splenectomy was performed on six pigs. There were no complications during gastric incision and entrance into the peritoneal cavity. Visualization of the spleen and other intraperitoneal organs was very good.

Ninety infants, with birth weights of 600 to 1250 gm, were entered into a prospective, randomized, controlled trial to receive either indomethacin, 0.1 mg/kg per dose, or placebo less than 24 hours and again every 24 hours for six doses. Echocardiography was performed on day 1 before treatment and on day 7, 24 hours after treatment. A hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) was confirmed with an out-of-study echocardiogram, and the nonresponders were treated with standard indomethacin or ligation. Forty-three infants received indomethacin (birth weight, 915 +/- 209 gm; gestational age, 26.4 +/- 1.6 weeks; 25 boys), and 47 received placebo (birth weight, 879 +/- 202 gm; gestational age, 26.4 +/- 1.8 weeks; 22 boys) (P = not significant). Of 90 infants, 77 (86%) had a PDA by echocardiogram on the first day of life before study treatment; 84% of these PDAs were moderate or large in size in the indomethacin-treated group compared with 93% in the placebo group. Nine of forty indomethacin-treated infants (21%) were study-dose nonresponders compared with 22 (47%) of 47 placebo-treated infants (p < 0.018). There were no significant differences between both groups in any of the long-term outcome variables, including intraventricular hemorrhage, duration of oxygen therapy, endotracheal intubation, duration of stay in neonatal intensive care unit, time to regain birth weight or reach full caloric intake, incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and survival. No significant differences were noted in the incidence of oliguria, elevated plasma creatinine concentration, thrombocytopenia, pulmonary hemorrhage, or necrotizing enterocolitis. The prophylactic use of low doses of indomethacin, when initiated in the first 24 hours of life in low birth weight infants who receive prophylactic surfactant in the delivery room, decreases the incidence of left-to-right shunting at the level of the ductus arteriosus.\"\"\"\n",

Alpha agonists ( like albuterol or albuterol / levosalbutamol ) are used to treat symptoms of shortness of breath ( SOB ) and tightness in the chest ( tightness in chest ). These meds cause a mild to moderate increase in heart rate ( tachycardia ). 2. Beta blockers ( like propranolol or metoprolol ) are used to treat or to prevent symptoms of heart failure ( ejection fraction is 20 % or less ). These medications cause or worsen shortness of breath, tightness in chest, heart rate. You can take a combination of these medications. The combination that you will work best is a two - pill combination of albuterol and propranolol ( half tablet twice a day ).

High cholesterol levels are responsible for the development of coronary artery disease. The other factors are blood pressure and smoking. The goal of treatment is to reduce the total and low - density lipoprotein ( LDL ) cholesterol levels. Statins are good cholesterol lowering medications. They help reduce the risk of coronary artery disease by preventing the formation of blood clots. The goal of blood pressure treatment is to reduce the average blood pressure. Regular exercises, weight loss, fruits, vegetables, fish once or twice a week, avoid smoking. The goal of the cholesterol treatment is to bring the LDL level to normal ( less than 100 mg / DL ). The goal of the smoking treatment is to bring the smoking cessation to a significant extent. You should also get your cholesterol and LDL levels checked once a year to monitor the progress of the disease.']"
