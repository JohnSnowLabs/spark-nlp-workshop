Upon examination, patient was found to have a high-grade fever and increased respiratory rate. Lab results showed a high white blood cell count and chest X-ray revealed pneumonia. The patient was immediately started on intravenous antibiotics and oxygen therapy. Due to the severity of the infection, the treatment was continued for several days until the patient's fever subsided and oxygen saturation levels improved. The patient was also given nebulized bronchodilators to ease breathing difficulties. After a week, patient was discharged from the hospital with a prescription for oral antibiotics, which was continued at home for a few more days. The patient's parents were counseled on proper hygiene measures such as handwashing and avoiding close contact with sick individuals to prevent future infections.\"\"\",\n",

Upon examination, the child is found to have an elevated heart rate and low oxygen saturation levels. The child is diagnosed with pneumonia and is started on oral antibiotics immediately. Additionally, the child is given a nebulizer treatment with albuterol, a bronchodilator, to help with breathing. The family is told to monitor the child's condition closely and bring them back to the hospital if the symptoms worsen or do not improve within a few days.\"\"\",\n",

Upon further discussion, it is discovered that the patient has been regularly abusing prescription drugs, specifically benzodiazepines and opioids. The patient is referred to a specialist to address their substance abuse and provided with therapy and medication for their mental health issues.\"\"\"\n",
