Resveratrol (trans - 3, 5, 4  - trihydroxystilbene ; RSV) , a natural polyphenol, exerts a beneficial effect on health and diseases. RSV targets and activates the NAD(+) - dependent protein deacetylase SIRT1; in turn, SIRT1 induces an intracellular antioxidative mechanism by inducing mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (SOD2). Most RSV found in plants is glycosylated, and the effect of these glycosylated forms on SIRT1 has not been studied.\"\"\",\n","\n","\"\"\"In this study, the mechanisms of TRG prevention of oxidative stress were determined by measuring erythrocyte and liver antioxidant enzyme activities, and expressions of genes associated with reactive oxygen species production, and carbohydrate and lipid metabolisms by DNA microarray. Erythrocyte and liver glutathione peroxidase, and liver catalase activities in the GK rats fed with TRG were significantly lower than those of the GK control rats. TRG downregulated the gene expressions involved with NADPH oxidase and mitochondrial electron transfer system when compared with those of the GK control group. These results suggested that mitigation of diabetes by TRG is mediated by its ameliorating effects on oxidative stress.
