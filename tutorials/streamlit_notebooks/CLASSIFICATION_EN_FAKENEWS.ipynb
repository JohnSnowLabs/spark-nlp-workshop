Soon after McConnell's remarks, 42 Democrats again filibustered the resolution, preventing it from getting the 60 votes needed to advance.\"My strong preference is for Democrats to simply allow an up-or-down vote on the president's Iran deal.\" McConnell said. \"But if they're determined to make that impossible, then at the very least we should be able to provide some protection to Israel and long-overdue relief to Americans who've languished in Iranian custody for years.

Soon after McConnell's remarks, 42 Democrats again filibustered the resolution, preventing it from getting the 60 votes needed to advance.\"My strong preference is for Democrats to simply allow an up-or-down vote on the president's Iran deal.\" McConnell said. \"But if they're determined to make that impossible, then at the very least we should be able to provide some protection to Israel and long-overdue relief to Americans who've languished in Iranian custody for years.
