Carbon monoxide poisoning, gas gangrene, and decompression sickness (the ‚Äôbends‚Äô) are sometimes treated using these devices. Increased O 2 concentration in the lungs helps to displace carbon monoxide from the heme group of hemoglobin. Oxygen gas is poisonous to the anaerobic bacteria that cause gas gangrene, so increasing its partial pressure helps kill them. Decompression sickness occurs in divers who decompress too quickly after a dive, resulting in bubbles of inert gas, mostly nitrogen and helium, forming in their blood. Increasing the pressure of O 2 as soon as possible is part of the treatment.\"\"\"],\n","    [\"\"\"What category of game is Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess?\"\"\" \"\"\"context: The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess (Japanese: „Çº„É´„ÉÄ„ÅÆ‰ºùË™¨ „Éà„ÉØ„Ç§„É©„Ç§„Éà„Éó„É™„É≥„Çª„Çπ, Hepburn: Zeruda no Densetsu: Towairaito Purinsesu?) is an action-adventure game developed and published by Nintendo for the GameCube and Wii home video game consoles. It is the thirteenth installment in the The Legend of Zelda series. Originally planned for release on the GameCube in November 2005, Twilight Princess was delayed by Nintendo to allow its developers to refine the game, add more content, and port it to the Wii. The Wii version was released alongside the console in North America in November 2006, and in Japan, Europe, and Australia the following month. The GameCube version was released worldwide in December 2006.\"\"\"],\n","    [\"\"\"Who is founder of Alibaba Group?\"\"\" \"\"\"context: Alibaba Group founder Jack Ma has made his first appearance since Chinese regulators cracked down on his business empire.

In this protein, a post-translational modification by fatty acids covalently attached to cysteine, termed S-palmitoylation, plays a crucial role for the antiviral activity. IFITM3 possesses three cysteine residues for the S-palmitoylation in the first transmembrane (TM1) domain and in the cytoplasmic (CP) loop. Because these cysteines are well conserved in the mammalian IFITM family proteins, the S-palmitoylation on these cysteines is significant for their functions. IFITM5 is another IFITM family protein and interacts with the FK506-binding protein 11 (FKBP11) to form a higher-order complex in osteoblast cells, which induces the expression of immunologically relevant genes.\"\"\"],\n","[\"What kinds of viruses are Japanese encephalitis virus(JEV), tick-borne encephalitis virus(TBEV), eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV), sindbis virus(SV), and dengue virus(DV)?\",\"\"\"The developed ELISA-array proved to have similar specificity and higher sensitivity compared with the conventional ELISAs. This method was validated by different viral cultures and three chicken eggs inoculated with infected patient serum. The results demonstrated that the developed ELISA-array is sensitive and easy to use, which would have potential for clinical use. Japanese encephalitis virus(JEV), tick-borne encephalitis virus(TBEV), eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV), sindbis virus(SV), and dengue virus(DV) are arboviruses. Establishment of an accurate and easy method for detection of these viruses is essential for the prevention and treatment of associated infectious diseases. \"\"\"],\n","[\"What method is useful in administering small molecules for systemic delivery to the body?\", \"\"\"In many studies, in vivo success has been demonstrated in delivering siRNAs to the lungs intranasally . An experimental setup of intranasal delivery by spray or droplet is simple and painless for the animal. Although the success in delivering siRNAs intranasally in rodents cannot be completely extrapolated to human use because of the significant differences in lung anatomy , this approach has potential for the clinical application of siRNAs. Phase II clinical trials have been initiated for the treatment of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, making use of intranasal application of naked chemically modified siRNA molecules that target viral gene products. Intranasal entry has long been used to administer small molecules, such as proteins, for systemic delivery. Because the nasal mucosa is highly vascularized, delivery of a thin epithelium of medication across the surface area can result in rapid absorption of the medication into the blood. Therefore, siRNAs administered intranasally might be deposited in the nose, and some of them may be unable to reach the lower respiratory tract. In fact, it has been reported that intranasal application of unformulated siRNAs resulted in lower delivery efficiency and homogeneous pulmonary distribution than that achieved with intratracheal application.\"\"\"],\n","[\"When did the last Director General of the WHO resign?\", \"\"\"In this month 2019s editorial, the PLOS Medicine Editors propose ideal qualities for the World Health Organization's next Director General, for whom the selection process is now underway.

Factoring in the many influential stakeholders in the process of appointing Chan's successor, however, transparency of the selection process may be one area unlikely to attract plaudits.

Except in the unborn fetus, the digestive system is the first system involved[vague]. Digestive juices break chemical bonds in ingested molecules, and modify their conformations and energy states. Though some molecules are absorbed into the bloodstream unchanged, digestive processes release them from the matrix of foods. Unabsorbed matter, along with some waste products of metabolism, is eliminated from the body in the feces.\"\"\"],\n","    [\"What type of flight decks are aircraft carriers equipped with?\", \"\"\"An aircraft carrier is a warship that serves as a seagoing airbase, equipped with a full-length flight deck and facilities for carrying, arming, deploying, and recovering aircraft.\"\"\"]    \n","]\n","\n","df = spark.createDataFrame(sample_texts).toDF(\"question\", \"context\")"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":18,"metadata":{"id":"nB3ilGSGBpP_","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1666193499642,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":6,"user":{"displayName":"Merve Ertas Uslu","userId":"01451729557099986551"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["model = pipeline.fit(df).transform(df)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":19,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"svwFrSZ7B_zy","outputId":"7a14cd2c-9806-427e-e365-75b69545e30e","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1666193506750,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":7113,"user":{"displayName":"Merve Ertas Uslu","userId":"01451729557099986551"}}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["+----------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------+\n","|question                                                              |result                    |\n","+----------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------+\n","|When was the first nutrition experiment performed?
