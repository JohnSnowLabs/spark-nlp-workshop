Knute Rockne became head coach in 1918. Under Rockne, the Irish would post a record of 105 wins, 12 losses, and five ties. During his 13 years the Irish won three national championships, had five undefeated seasons, won the Rose Bowl in 1925, and produced players such as George Gipp and the 'Four Horsemen'. Knute Rockne has the highest winning percentage (.881) in NCAA Division I/FBS football history. Rockne's offenses employed the Notre Dame Box and his defenses ran a 7–2–2 scheme. The last game Rockne coached was on December 14, 1930 when he led a group of Notre Dame all-stars against the New York Giants in New York City.\",\n","    \"In 1919 Father James Burns became president of Notre Dame, and in three years he produced an academic revolution that brought the school up to national standards by adopting the elective system and moving away from the university's traditional scholastic and classical emphasis. By contrast, the Jesuit colleges, bastions of academic conservatism, were reluctant to move to a system of electives. Their graduates were shut out of Harvard Law School for that reason. Notre Dame continued to grow over the years, adding more colleges, programs, and sports teams. By 1921, with the addition of the College of Commerce, Notre Dame had grown from a small college to a university with five colleges and a professional law school. The university continued to expand and add new residence halls and buildings with each subsequent president.\",\n","    \"This Main Building, and the library collection, was entirely destroyed by a fire in April 1879, and the school closed immediately and students were sent home. The university founder, Fr. Sorin and the president at the time, the Rev. William Corby, immediately planned for the rebuilding of the structure that had housed virtually the entire University. Construction was started on the 17th of May and by the incredible zeal of administrator and workers the building was completed before the fall semester of 1879. The library collection was also rebuilt and stayed housed in the new Main Building for years afterwards. Around the time of the fire, a music hall was opened. Eventually becoming known as Washington Hall, it hosted plays and musical acts put on by the school. By 1880, a science program was established at the university, and a Science Hall (today LaFortune Student Center) was built in 1883. The hall housed multiple classrooms and science labs needed for early research at the university.\",\n","    \"The university is affiliated with the Congregation of Holy Cross (Latin: Congregatio a Sancta Cruce, abbreviated postnominals: 'CSC'). While religious affiliation is not a criterion for admission, more than 93% of students identify as Christian, with over 80% of the total being Catholic. Collectively, Catholic Mass is celebrated over 100 times per week on campus, and a large campus ministry program provides for the faith needs of the community. There are multitudes of religious statues and artwork around campus, most prominent of which are the statue of Mary on the Main Building, the Notre Dame Grotto, and the Word of Life mural on Hesburgh Library depicting Christ as a teacher. Additionally, every classroom displays a crucifix. There are many religious clubs (catholic and non-Catholic) at the school, including Council #1477 of the Knights of Columbus (KOC), Baptist Collegiate Ministry (BCM), Jewish Club, Muslim Student Association, Orthodox Christian Fellowship, The Mormon Club, and many more. The Notre Dame KofC are known for being the first collegiate council of KofC, operating a charitable concession stand during every home football game and owning their own building on campus which can be used as a cigar lounge. Fifty-seven chapels are located throughout the campus.\",\n","    \"About 80% of undergraduates and 20% of graduate students live on campus. The majority of the graduate students on campus live in one of four graduate housing complexes on campus, while all on-campus undergraduates live in one of the 29 residence halls. Because of the religious affiliation of the university, all residence halls are single-sex, with 15 male dorms and 14 female dorms. The university maintains a visiting policy (known as parietal hours) for those students who live in dormitories, specifying times when members of the opposite sex are allowed to visit other students' dorm rooms; however, all residence halls have 24-hour social spaces for students regardless of gender. Many residence halls have at least one nun and/or priest as a resident. There are no traditional social fraternities or sororities at the university, but a majority of students live in the same residence hall for all four years. Some intramural sports are based on residence hall teams, where the university offers the only non-military academy program of full-contact intramural American football. At the end of the intramural season, the championship game is played on the field in Notre Dame Stadium.\"\n","]"],"metadata":{"id":"kHrpR719ntbi","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1675542851800,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":11,"user":{"displayName":"Damla","userId":"03285166568766987047"}}},"execution_count":7,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["document_assembler = DocumentAssembler() \\\n","    .setInputCol(\"text\") \\\n","    .setOutputCol(\"documents\")\n","\n","t5 = T5Transformer() \\\n","    .pretrained(\"t5_question_generation_small\") \\\n","    .setTask(\"\")\\\n","    .setMaxOutputLength(200)\\\n","    .setInputCols([\"documents\"]) \\\n","    .setOutputCol(\"question\")\n","\n","pipeline = Pipeline().setStages([document_assembler, t5])\n","\n","from pyspark.sql.types import StructType, StringType\n","df = spark.createDataFrame(text_list, StringType()).toDF(\"text\")\n","results = pipeline.fit(df).transform(df)"],"metadata":{"id":"8rWQncZHoBpS","outputId":"f9cdc259-fb66-4a1f-f2ac-55396da636df","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1675542908146,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":56354,"user":{"displayName":"Damla","userId":"03285166568766987047"}}},"execution_count":8,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["t5_question_generation_small download started this may take some time.\n","Approximate size to download 141.1 MB\n","[OK!]\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["results.select('text', 'question.result').show(truncate=100)"],"metadata":{"id":"5DPePz3E6AyF","outputId":"a0b859eb-22cb-42b6-ba47-8eef6a20cabb","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1675542935912,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":27503,"user":{"displayName":"Damla","userId":"03285166568766987047"}}},"execution_count":9,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n","|                                                                                                text|                                                                                              result|\n","+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n","|One of the main driving forces in the growth of the University was its football team, the Notre D...|                                                            [What was the last game Rockne coached?]|\n","|In 1919 Father James Burns became president of Notre Dame, and in three years he produced an acad...|[What was the name of the college of commerce that Notre Dame had grown from a small college to a...|\n","|This Main Building, and the library collection, was entirely destroyed by a fire in April 1879, a...|                                                            [What was the name of the Science Hall?]|\n","|The university is affiliated with the Congregation of Holy Cross (Latin: Congregatio a Sancta Cru...|                               [How many chapels are located throughout the Notre Dame KofC campus?]|\n","|About 80% of undergraduates and 20% of graduate students live on campus.
