Macau Airport heading for mainland China or visiting Macau itself and accounting for 80 % of passengers using the airport. Around 1000 of Macau 's civil servants have studied in Taiwan and every year some 30 people travel from Macau to Taiwan for business or work along with more than 400 students. But against the backdrop of continued proclamations from the PRC about how Macau's 'one country two systems' arrangement sets an example for solving the Taiwan problem these figures along with the Taiwan - Macau exchanges that they represent have been willfully neglected by Macau's mainstream media. Macau and Taiwan: so near and yet so far. What are the connections that bind these two places and what are the opportunities for new developments in the wake of the 1999 handover? On December 19 1999 the eve of Macau's transfer of sovereignty the China Times in Taiwan published a survey on the Taiwanese public's views about Macau's return to Chinese control. According to the survey 31 % of people in Taiwan weren't even aware that Macau was about to be handed back to China while 53 % answered that they didn't know whether the handover would be beneficial or harmful for Macau's development. But when asked whether the one country two systems formula as used for Hong Kong and Macau was acceptable for Taiwan 59 % responded No   while 27 % said that they didn't know.  As these results clearly indicate the people of Taiwan still know little about Macau in spite of existing exchanges and more than half of them flatly reject Beijing's one country two systems formula - so readily taken up in Macau - as a solution to the Taiwan question.\"\"\"]\n","\n","get_entities(model,

Around 1000 of Macau 's civil servants have studied in Taiwan and every year some 30 people travel from Macau to Taiwan for business or work along with more than 400 students. But against the backdrop of continued proclamations from the PRC about how Macau's 'one country two systems' arrangement sets an example for solving the Taiwan problem these figures along with the Taiwan - Macau exchanges that they represent have been willfully neglected by Macau's mainstream media. Macau and Taiwan: so near and yet so far. What are the connections that bind these two places and what are the opportunities for new developments in the wake of the 1999 handover? On December 19 1999 the eve of Macau's transfer of sovereignty the China Times in Taiwan published a survey on the Taiwanese public's views about Macau's return to Chinese control. According to the survey 31 % of people in Taiwan weren't even aware that Macau was about to be handed back to China while 53 % answered that they didn't know whether the handover would be beneficial or harmful for Macau's development. But when asked whether the one country two systems formula as used for Hong Kong and Macau was acceptable for Taiwan 59 % responded No   while 27 % said that they didn't know.

Hij is vooral bekend als medeoprichter van Microsoft Corporation. Tijdens zijn carrière bij Microsoft bekleedde Gates de functies van voorzitter, chief executive officer (CEO), president en chief software architect, terwijl hij ook de grootste individuele aandeelhouder was tot mei 2014. Hij is een van de bekendste ondernemers en pioniers van de microcomputerrevolutie van de jaren 70 en 80. Gates, geboren en getogen in Seattle, Washington, richtte in 1975 samen met jeugdvriend Paul Allen Microsoft op in Albuquerque, New Mexico; het werd \"s werelds grootste personal computer softwarebedrijf. Gates leidde het bedrijf als voorzitter en CEO totdat hij in januari 2000 aftrad als CEO, maar hij bleef voorzitter en werd chief software architect. Eind jaren negentig kreeg Gates kritiek vanwege zijn zakelijke tactieken, die als concurrentiebeperkend werden beschouwd. Deze mening is bevestigd door tal van gerechtelijke uitspraken. In juni 2006 kondigde Gates aan dat hij zou overgaan naar een parttime functie bij Microsoft en fulltime gaan werken bij de Bill&Melinda Gates Foundation, de particuliere liefdadigheidsstichting die hij en zijn vrouw, Melinda Gates, in 2000 hebben opgericht. Hij droeg geleidelijk zijn taken over aan Ray Ozzie en Craig Mundie. Hij trad in februari 2014 af als voorzitter van Microsoft en nam een nieuwe functie aan als technologieadviseur ter ondersteuning van de nieuw aangestelde CEO Satya Nadella.\"\"\"]\n","\n","get_entities(model, text,

amerikansk affärsmagnat, mjukvaruutvecklare, investerare och filantrop. Han är mest känd som medgrundare av Microsoft Corporation. Under sin karriär på Microsoft innehade Gates befattningar som styrelseordförande, verkställande direktör (VD), VD och programvaruarkitekt samtidigt som han var den största enskilda aktieägaren fram till maj 2014. Han är en av de mest kända företagarna och pionjärerna inom mikrodatorrevolutionen på 1970- och 1980-talet. Född och uppvuxen i Seattle, Washington, grundade Gates Microsoft tillsammans med barndomsvän Paul Allen 1975 i Albuquerque, New Mexico; det blev vidare världens största datorprogramföretag. Gates ledde företaget som styrelseordförande och VD tills han avgick som VD i januari 2000, men han förblev ordförande och blev chef för programvaruarkitekt. Under slutet av 1990-talet hade Gates kritiserats för sin affärstaktik, som har ansetts konkurrensbegränsande. Detta yttrande har upprätthållits genom många domstolsbeslut. I juni 2006 meddelade Gates att han skulle gå över till en deltidsroll på Microsoft och heltid på Bill&Melinda Gates Foundation, den privata välgörenhetsstiftelsen som han och hans fru, Melinda Gates, grundade 2000. Han överförde gradvis sina uppgifter till Ray Ozzie och Craig Mundie. Han avgick som styrelseordförande i Microsoft i februari 2014 och tillträdde en ny tjänst som teknologrådgivare för att stödja den nyutnämnda VD Satya Nadella.\"\"\"]\n","get_entities(model, text, lang=\"sv\", case = False)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":1000},"id":"eDS34jFyTU55","outputId":"857befee-a76f-4174-f1be-930330441ac0","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1666191567011,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":47791,"user":{"displayName":"Merve Ertas Uslu","userId":"01451729557099986551"}}},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["sentence_detector_dl download started this may take some time.\n","Approximate size to download 514.9 KB\n","[OK!]\n","bert_token_classifier_swedish_ner download started this may take some time.\n","Approximate size to download 444.1 MB\n","[OK!]\n","+-----------------------+---------+\n","|chunk                  |ner_label|\n","+-----------------------+---------+\n","|William Henry Gates III|PER      |\n","|amerikansk             |NAT      |\n","|Microsoft              |ORG      |\n","|Microsoft              |ORG      |\n","|direktör               |TIT      |\n","|VD                     |TIT      |\n","|VD                     |TIT      |\n","|programvaruarkitekt    |TIT      |\n","|Seattle,               |LOC      |\n","|Washington             |LOC      |\n","|Microsoft              |ORG      |\n","|Allen                  |ORG      |\n","|Albuquerque            |LOC      |\n","|New Mexico             |LOC      |\n","|Gates                  |PER      |\n","|VD                     |TIT      |\n","|VD                     |TIT      |\n","|Gates                  |ORG      |\n","|Gates                  |ORG      |\n","|Microsoft              |ORG      |\n","+-----------------------+---------+\n","only showing top 20 rows\n","\n"]},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.HTML object>"],"text/html":["\n","<style>\n","    @import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Montserrat:wght@300;400;500;600;700&display=swap');\n","    @import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Vistol Regular:wght@300;400;500;600;700&display=swap');\n","    \n","    .spark-nlp-display-scroll-entities {\n","        border: 1px solid #E7EDF0;\n","        border-radius: 3px;\n","        text-align: justify;\n","        \n","    }\n","    .spark-nlp-display-scroll-entities span {  \n","        font-size: 14px;\n","        line-height: 24px;\n","        color: #536B76;\n","        font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif !important;\n","    }\n","    \n","    .spark-nlp-display-entity-wrapper{\n","    \n","        display: inline-grid;\n","        text-align: center;\n","        border-radius: 4px;\n","        margin: 0 2px 5px 2px;\n","        padding: 1px\n","    }\n","    .spark-nlp-display-entity-name{\n","        font-size: 14px;\n","        line-height: 24px;\n","        font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif !important;\n","        \n","        background: #f1f2f3;\n","        border-width: medium;\n","        text-align: center;\n","        \n","        font-weight: 400;\n","        \n","        border-radius: 5px;\n","        padding: 2px 5px;\n","        display: block;\n","        margin: 3px 2px;\n","    \n","    }\n","    .spark-nlp-display-entity-type{\n","        font-size: 14px;\n","        line-height: 24px;\n","        color: #ffffff;\n","        font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif !important;\n","        \n","        text-transform: uppercase;\n","        \n","        font-weight: 500;\n","\n","        display: block;\n","        padding: 3px 5px;\n","    }\n","    \n","    .spark-nlp-display-entity-resolution{\n","        font-size: 14px;\n","        line-height: 24px;\n","        color: #ffffff;\n","        font-family: 'Vistol Regular', sans-serif !important;\n","        \n","        text-transform: uppercase;\n","        \n","        font-weight: 500;\n","\n","        display: block;\n","        padding: 3px 5px;\n","    }\n","    \n","    .spark-nlp-display-others{\n","        font-size: 14px;\n","        line-height: 24px;\n","        font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif !important;\n","        \n","        font-weight: 400;\n","    }\n","\n","</style>\n"," <span class=\"spark-nlp-display-entity-wrapper\" style=\"background-color: #6F33B9\"><span class=\"spark-nlp-display-entity-name\">William Henry Gates III </span><span class=\"spark-nlp-display-entity-type\">PER</span></span><span class=\"spark-nlp-display-others\" style=\"background-color: white\"> (född 28 oktober 1955) är en </span><span class=\"spark-nlp-display-entity-wrapper\" style=\"background-color: #17A039\"><span class=\"spark-nlp-display-entity-name\">amerikansk </span><span class=\"spark-nlp-display-entity-type\">NAT</span></span><span class=\"spark-nlp-display-others\" style=\"background-color: white\"> affärsmagnat, mjukvaruutvecklare, investerare och filantrop.
