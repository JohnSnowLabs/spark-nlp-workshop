The main abstraction Spark provides is a resilient distributed dataset (RDD), which is a collection of elements partitioned across the nodes of the cluster that can be operated on in parallel. RDDs are created by starting with a file in the Hadoop file system (or any other Hadoop-supported file system), or an existing Scala collection in the driver program, and transforming it. Users may also ask Spark to persist an RDD in memory, allowing it to be reused efficiently across parallel operations. Finally, RDDs automatically recover from node failures.\n","\n","A second abstraction in Spark is shared variables that can be used in parallel operations. By default, when Spark runs a function in parallel as a set of tasks on different nodes, it ships a copy of each variable used in the function to each task. Sometimes, a variable needs to be shared across tasks, or between tasks and the driver program. Spark supports two types of shared variables: broadcast variables, which can be used to cache a value in memory on all nodes, and accumulators, which are variables that are only “added” to, such as counters and sums.\n","\n","This guide shows each of these features in each of Spark’s supported languages. It is easiest to follow along with if you launch Spark’s interactive shell – either bin/spark-shell for the Scala shell or bin/pyspark for the Python one.\n","[source](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/rdd-programming-guide.html)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"HGdS4JP_RGtA"},"source":["### Install PySpark"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"D3pnMpGRQE2q"},"outputs":[],"source":["# install PySpark\n","! pip install pyspark==3.2.0"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"JTgVVz1xu2B4"},"source":["### Initializing Spark"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":196},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":9302,"status":"ok","timestamp":1644777103133,"user":{"displayName":"Monster C","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/default-user=s64","userId":"08787989274818793476"},"user_tz":-180},"id":"54fC7hk3QeH8","outputId":"531247b0-9b7f-47c4-b4e7-08107a3dc60d"},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/html":["\n","        <div>\n","            <p><b>SparkContext</b></p>\n","\n","            <p><a href=\"http://ecf20ad08b64:4040\">Spark UI</a></p>\n","\n","            <dl>\n","              <dt>Version</dt>\n","                <dd><code>v3.2.0</code></dd>\n","              <dt>Master</dt>\n","                <dd><code>local[*]</code></dd>\n","              <dt>AppName</dt>\n","                <dd><code>PySparkTutorial</code></dd>\n","            </dl>\n","        </div>\n","        "],"text/plain":["<SparkContext master=local[*] appName=PySparkTutorial>"]},"execution_count":2,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["from pyspark import SparkContext\n","\n","\"\"\"\n","try:\n","    # create SparkContext on all CPUs available: in my case I have 6 CPUs on my laptop\n","    sc = SparkContext(appName=\"SDDM\", master='local[*]')\n","    print(\"Just created a SparkContext\")\n","    sqlContext = SQLContext(sc)\n","    print(\"Just created a SQLContext\")\n","except ValueError:\n","    warnings.warn(\"SparkContext already exists in this scope\")\n","\"\"\"\n","\n","sc = SparkContext(appName=\"PySparkTutorial\", master= \"local[*]\")\n","\n","sc = SparkContext.getOrCreate()\n","\n","sc"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"7p-XaEE_5WmC"},"outputs":[],"source":["# ==>> DO NOT FORGET WHEN YOU'RE DONE>> sc.stop()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":6,"status":"ok","timestamp":1644511067770,"user":{"displayName":"Monster C","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/default-user=s64","userId":"08787989274818793476"},"user_tz":-180},"id":"zm1PV6B0Q0Ub","outputId":"2ce15df7-768d-4267-cea8-d89e8e8a93bd"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["PySpark version:  3.2.0\n","Python version:   3.7\n","local[*]\n"]}],"source":["print(\"PySpark version: \", sc.version)\n","#3.2.0\n","\n","# Python Version: To retrieve Python version of SparkContext\n","print(\"Python version:  \", sc.pythonVer)\n","\n","# Master: URL of the cluster or “local” string to run in local mode of SparkContext\n","print (sc.master)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Y7jJTGnMUB5p"},"source":["# Spark RDD (Resillient Distributed Datasets)\n","Spark revolves around the concept of a resilient distributed dataset (RDD), which is a fault-tolerant collection of elements that can be operated on in parallel.

For example, map is a transformation that passes each dataset element through a function and returns a new RDD representing the results. On the other hand, reduce is an action that aggregates all the elements of the RDD using some function and returns the final result to the driver program (although there is also a parallel reduceByKey that returns a distributed dataset).\n","\n","All transformations in Spark are lazy, in that they do not compute their results right away. Instead, they just remember the transformations applied to some base dataset (e.g. a file). The transformations are only computed when an action requires a result to be returned to the driver program. This design enables Spark to run more efficiently. For example, we can realize that a dataset created through map will be used in a reduce and return only the result of the reduce to the driver, rather than the larger mapped dataset.\n","\n","By default, each transformed RDD may be recomputed each time you run an action on it. However, you may also persist an RDD in memory using the persist (or cache) method, in which case Spark will keep the elements around on the cluster for much faster access the next time you query it.
