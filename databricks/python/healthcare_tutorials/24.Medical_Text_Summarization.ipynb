He has lost about 200 pounds and was otherwise doing well until yesterday evening around 7:00-8:00 when he developed nausea and right upper quadrant pain, which apparently wrapped around toward his right side and back. He feels like he was on it but has not done so. He has overall malaise and a low-grade temperature of 100.3. He denies any prior similar or lesser symptoms. His last normal bowel movement was yesterday. He denies any outright chills or blood per rectum.\n",

    "PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: His temperature is 100.3, blood pressure 129/59, respirations 16, heart rate 84. He is drowsy, but easily arousable and appropriate with conversation. He is oriented to person, place, and situation. He is normocephalic, atraumatic. His sclerae are anicteric. His mucous membranes are somewhat tacky. His neck is supple and symmetric. His respirations are unlabored and clear. He has a regular rate and rhythm. His abdomen is soft. He has diffuse right upper quadrant tenderness, worse focally, but no rebound or guarding. He otherwise has no organomegaly, masses, or abdominal hernias evident. His extremities are symmetrical with no edema. His posterior tibial pulses are palpable and symmetric.

    "We are excited to announce the integration of new parameters into our `MedicalSummarizer` annotator, empowering users to overcome token limitations and attain heightened flexibility in their medical summarization endeavors. These advanced parameters significantly augment the annotator's functionality, enabling users to generate more accurate and comprehensive summaries of medical documents. By employing a map-reduce approach, the `MedicalSummarizer` efficiently condenses distinct text segments until the desired length is achieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following parameters have been introduced:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `setRefineSummary`: Set to True for refined summarization with increased computational cost.\n",
    "- `setRefineSummaryTargetLength`: Define the target length of summarizations in tokens (delimited by whitespace). Effective only when setRefineSummary=True.\n",
    "- `setRefineChunkSize`: Specify the desired size of refined chunks. Should correspond to the LLM context window size in tokens. Effective only when - `setRefineSummary=True`.\n",
    "- `setRefineMaxAttempts`: Determine the number of attempts for re-summarizing chunks exceeding the setRefineSummaryTargetLength before discontinuing. Effective only when `setRefineSummary=True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "These enhancements to the MedicalSummarizer annotator represent our ongoing commitment to providing state-of-the-art tools for healthcare professionals and researchers, facilitating more efficient and accurate medical text analysis."

Ninety infants, with birth weights of 600 to 1250 gm, were entered into a prospective, randomized, controlled trial to receive either indomethacin, 0.1 mg/kg per dose, or placebo less than 24 hours and again every 24 hours for six doses. Echocardiography was performed on day 1 before treatment and on day 7, 24 hours after treatment. A hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) was confirmed with an out-of-study echocardiogram, and the nonresponders were treated with standard indomethacin or ligation. Forty-three infants received indomethacin (birth weight, 915 +/- 209 gm; gestational age, 26.4 +/- 1.6 weeks; 25 boys), and 47 received placebo (birth weight, 879 +/- 202 gm; gestational age, 26.4 +/- 1.8 weeks; 22 boys) (P = not significant). Of 90 infants, 77 (86%) had a PDA by echocardiogram on the first day of life before study treatment; 84% of these PDAs were moderate or large in size in the indomethacin-treated group compared with 93% in the placebo group. Nine of forty indomethacin-treated infants (21%) were study-dose nonresponders compared with 22 (47%) of 47 placebo-treated infants (p < 0.018). There were no significant differences between both groups in any of the long-term outcome variables, including intraventricular hemorrhage, duration of oxygen therapy, endotracheal intubation, duration of stay in neonatal intensive care unit, time to regain birth weight or reach full caloric intake, incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and survival. No significant differences were noted in the incidence of oliguria, elevated plasma creatinine concentration, thrombocytopenia, pulmonary hemorrhage, or necrotizing enterocolitis. The prophylactic use of low doses of indomethacin, when initiated in the first 24 hours of life in low birth weight infants who receive prophylactic surfactant in the delivery room, decreases the incidence of left-to-right shunting at the level of the ductus arteriosus.\"\"\"\n",

The main outcome measures were residual disease after cytoreduction, frequency of radical surgical resection, and 5-year disease-specific survival.\\\\n The study comprised 194 patients, including 144 with carcinomatosis. The mean patient age and follow-up time were 64.4 and 3.5 years, respectively. After surgery, 131 (67.5%) of the 194 patients had less than 1 cm of residual disease (definition of optimal cytoreduction). Considering all patients, residual disease was the only independent predictor of survival; the need to perform radical procedures to achieve optimal cytoreduction was not associated with a decrease in survival. For the subgroup of patients with carcinomatosis, residual disease and the performance of radical surgical procedures were the only independent predictors. Disease-specific survival was markedly improved for patients with carcinomatosis operated on by surgeons who most frequently used radical procedures compared with those least likely to use radical procedures (44% versus 17%, P < .001).\\\\n Overall, residual disease was the only independent predictor of survival. Minimizing residual disease through aggressive surgical resection was beneficial, especially in patients with carcinomatosis.\"\"\"\n",

I was feeling weak, light headed,poor digestion, panic attacks, depression, left chest pain, increased heart rate, rapidly weight loss, from 4 months. Because of this, I stayed in the hospital and just discharged from hospital. I had many other blood tests, brain mri, ultrasound scan, endoscopy because of some dumb doctors bcs they were not able to diagnose actual problem. Finally I got an appointment with a homeopathy doctor finally he find that i was suffering from hyperthyroid and my TSH was 0.15 T3 and T4 is normal . Also i have b12 deficiency and vitamin D deficiency so I&#39;m taking weekly supplement of vitamin D and 1000 mcg b12 daily. I&#39;m taking homeopathy medicine for 40 days and took 2nd test after 30 days. My TSH is 0.5 now. I feel a little bit relief from weakness and depression but I&#39;m facing with 2 new problem from last week that is breathtaking problem and very rapid heartrate. I just want to know if i should start allopathy medicine or homeopathy is okay? Bcs i heard that thyroid take time to start recover. So please let me know if both of medicines take same time. Because some of my friends advising me to start allopathy and never take a chance as i can develop some serious problems.Sorry for my poor englishüòêThank you.\n",

       " Olivia Smith was seen in my office for evaluation for elective surgical weight loss on October 6, 2008. Olivia Smith is a 34-year-old female with a BMI of 43. She is 5&#39;6&#34; tall and weighs 267 pounds. She is motivated to attempt surgical weight loss because she has been overweight for over 20 years and wants to have more energy and improve her self-image. She is not only affected physically, but also socially by her weight. When she loses weight she always regains it and she always gains back more weight than she has lost. At one time, she lost 100 pounds and gained the weight back within a year. She has tried numerous commercial weight loss programs including Weight Watcher&#39;s for four months in 1992 with 15-pound weight loss, RS for two months in 1990 with six-pound weight loss, Slim Fast for six weeks in 2004 with eight-pound weight loss, an exercise program for two months in 2007 with a five-pound weight loss, Atkin&#39;s Diet for three months in 2008 with a ten-pound weight loss, and Dexatrim for one month in 2005 with a five-pound weight loss. She has also tried numerous fat reduction or fad diets. She was on Redux for nine months with a 100-pound weight loss.\n",
       "PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: She has a history of hypertension and shortness of breath.\n",
       "PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Pertinent for cholecystectomy.\n",
       "PSYCHOLOGICAL HISTORY: Negative.\n",
       "SOCIAL HISTORY: She is single. She drinks alcohol once a week. She does not smoke.\n",

    "**Extractive summarization** is a technique used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that aims to generate a concise summary by extracting the most important information from a given text. Unlike ***abstractive summarization***, which involves generating new sentences to capture the essence of the content, ***extractive summarization*** directly selects and concatenates existing sentences or phrases from the original text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Extractive summarization  focuses on extracting the most relevant information rather than generating new content. The process typically includes preprocessing the text, identifying important sentences using various criteria, ranking them based on their importance, and selecting the top-ranked sentences for the final summary. Extractive summarization is favored for its objectivity, preserving the factual accuracy of the original text.\n",

    "‚úîÔ∏é When working with extensive texts, our primary objective is to extract the most pertinent and significant information embedded within. To achieve this, we initially employ the 'ExtractiveSummarization' approach, which selects the most important sentences while preserving the original context and factual accuracy of the text. This step effectively strips the text of superfluous details while retaining key information. Subsequently, this condensed text, distilled to its most vital sentences, is input into our 'Medical Summarizer' model. This model further abbreviates the text within a medical context, enabling us to generate a manageable and contextually accurate summarization of extensive medical documents. This two-tier approach facilitates maximum information extraction from texts and captures the essence of medical texts more efficiently and swiftly."

On our most recent visit to our clinic, she has her perineal stitches removed and presents today for followup of her perineal wound. She describes no drainage or erythema from her bottom. She is having good ostomy output. She does not describe any fevers, chills, nausea, or vomiting. The patient does describe some intermittent pain beneath the upper portion of the incision as well as in the right lower quadrant below her ostomy. She has been taking Percocet for this pain and it does work. She has since run out has been trying extra strength Tylenol, which will occasionally help this intermittent pain. She is requesting additional pain medications for this occasional abdominal pain, which she still experiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Temperature 95.8, pulse 68, blood pressure 132/73, and weight 159 pounds. This is a pleasant female in no acute distress. The patient's abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended with a well-healed midline scar. There is an ileostomy in the right hemiabdomen, which is pink, patent, productive, and protuberant. There are no signs of masses or hernias over the patient's abdomen.\n",
    "\n",
    "ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: This is a pleasant 50-year-old female who has undergone an APR secondary to refractory ulcerative colitis. Overall, her quality of life has significantly improved since she had her APR. She is functioning well with her ileostomy. She did have concerns or questions about her diet and we discussed the BRAT diet, which consisted of foods that would slow down the digestive tract such as bananas, rice, toast, cheese, and peanut butter. I discussed the need to monitor her ileostomy output and preferential amount of daily output is 2 liters or less. I have counseled her on refraining from soft drinks and fruit drinks. I have also discussed with her that this diet is moreover a trial and error and that she may try certain foods that did not agree with her ileostomy, however others may and that this is something she will just have to perform trials with over the next several months until she finds what foods that she can and cannot eat with her ileostomy. She also had questions about her occasional abdominal pain. I told her that this was probably continue to improve as months went by and I gave her a refill of her Percocet for the continued occasional pain. I told her that this would the last time I would refill the Percocet and if she has continued pain after she finishes this bottle then she would need to start ibuprofen or Tylenol if she had continued pain. The patient then brought up some right hand and arm numbness, which has been there postsurgically and was thought to be from positioning during surgery. This is all primarily gone away except for a little bit of numbness at the tip of the third digit as well as some occasional forearm muscle cramping. I told her that I felt that this would continue to improve as it has done over the past two months since her surgery. I told her to continue doing hand exercises as she has been doing and this seems to be working for her. Overall, I think she has healed from her surgery and is doing very well. Again, her quality of life is significantly improved. She is happy with her performance. We will see her back in six months just for a general routine checkup and see how she is doing at that time.\"\"\""
