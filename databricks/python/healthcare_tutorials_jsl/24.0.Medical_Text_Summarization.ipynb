His respirations are unlabored and clear. He has a regular rate and rhythm. His abdomen is soft. He has diffuse right upper quadrant tenderness, worse focally, but no rebound or guarding.

These advanced parameters significantly augment the annotator's functionality, enabling users to generate more accurate and comprehensive summaries of medical documents. By employing a map-reduce approach, the `MedicalSummarizer` efficiently condenses distinct text segments until the desired length is achieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following parameters have been introduced:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `setRefineSummary`: Set to True for refined summarization with increased computational cost.\n",
    "- `setRefineSummaryTargetLength`: Define the target length of summarizations in tokens (delimited by whitespace). Effective only when setRefineSummary=True.\n",
    "- `setRefineChunkSize`: Specify the desired size of refined chunks. Should correspond to the LLM context window size in tokens. Effective only when - `setRefineSummary=True`.\n",
    "- `setRefineMaxAttempts`: Determine the number of attempts for re-summarizing chunks exceeding the setRefineSummaryTargetLength before discontinuing. Effective only when `setRefineSummary=True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "These enhancements to the MedicalSummarizer annotator represent our ongoing commitment to providing state-of-the-art tools for healthcare professionals and researchers, facilitating more efficient and accurate medical text analysis."

Because of this, I stayed in the hospital and just discharged from hospital. I had many other blood tests, brain mri, ultrasound scan, endoscopy because of some dumb doctors bcs they were not able to diagnose actual problem. Finally I got an appointment with a homeopathy doctor finally he find that i was suffering from hyperthyroid and my TSH was 0.15 T3 and T4 is normal . Also i have b12 deficiency and vitamin D deficiency so I&#39;m taking weekly supplement of vitamin D and 1000 mcg b12 daily. I&#39;m taking homeopathy medicine for 40 days and took 2nd test after 30 days. My TSH is 0.5 now. I feel a little bit relief from weakness and depression but I&#39;m facing with 2 new problem from last week that is breathtaking problem and very rapid heartrate. I just want to know if i should start allopathy medicine or homeopathy is okay? Bcs i heard that thyroid take time to start recover. So please let me know if both of medicines take same time.

    "Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer among women. It occurs when the cells in the breast start growing abnormally, forming a lump or mass. This can result in the spread of cancerous cells to other parts of the body. Breast cancer may occur in both men and women but is more prevalent in women.\n",
    "The exact cause of breast cancer is unknown. However, several risk factors can increase your likelihood of developing breast cancer, such as:\n",
    "- A personal or family history of breast cancer\n",
    "- A genetic mutation, such as BRCA1 or BRCA2\n",
    "- Exposure to radiation\n",
    "- Age (most commonly occurring in women over 50)\n",
    "- Early onset of menstruation or late menopause\n",
    "- Obesity\n",
    "- Hormonal factors, such as taking hormone replacement therapy\n",
    "Breast cancer may not present symptoms during its early stages. Symptoms typically manifest as the disease progresses. Some notable symptoms include:\n",
    "- A lump or thickening in the breast or underarm area\n",
    "- Changes in the size or shape of the breast\n",
    "- Nipple discharge\n",
    "- Nipple changes in appearance, such as inversion or flattening\n",
    "- Redness or swelling in the breast\n",
    "Treatment for breast cancer depends on several factors, including the stage of the cancer, the location of the tumor, and the individual's overall health. Common treatment options include:\n",
    "- Surgery (such as lumpectomy or mastectomy)\n",
    "- Radiation therapy\n",
    "- Chemotherapy\n",
    "- Hormone therapy\n",
    "- Targeted therapy\n",
    "Early detection is crucial for the successful treatment of breast cancer. Women are advised to routinely perform self-examinations and undergo regular mammogram testing starting at age 40. If you notice any changes in your breast tissue, consult with your healthcare provider immediately.\"\"\" \n",
