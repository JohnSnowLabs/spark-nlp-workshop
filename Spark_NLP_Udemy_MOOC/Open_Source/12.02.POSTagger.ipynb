**📜 Background**\n","`Part-of-speech (POS) tagging` is the process of labeling each word in a text with its corresponding part of speech, such as noun, verb, adjective, etc. `POS tagging` is a fundamental task in natural language processing, and it is used in many downstream applications such as  and named entity recognition, relation extraction, and dependency parser."]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"X26HwMdwf-nJ"},"source":["## **🎬 Colab
