For each word, these vectors are concatenated and fed to the BLSTM network and then to the output layers. They employed a stacked bi-directional recurrent neural network with long short-term memory units to transform word features into named entity tag scores. The extracted features of each word are fed into a forward LSTM network and a backward LSTM network. The output of each network at each time step is decoded by a linear layer and a log-softmax layer into log-probabilities for each tag category. These two vectors are then simply added together to produce the final output. In the architecture of the proposed framework in the original paper, 50-dimensional pretrained word embeddings is used for word features, 25-dimension character embeddings is used for char features, and capitalization features (allCaps, upperInitial, lowercase, mixedCaps, noinfo) are used for case features. <br/>\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"TjDKOoZ4Fc8G"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"MfkkKkbVF309"},"source":["## **üé¨ Colab Setup**"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"iMkMQtZNF2n-"},"outputs":[],"source":["!pip install -q johnsnowlabs"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from google.colab import files\n","print('Please Upload your John Snow Labs License using the button below')\n","license_keys = files.upload()"],"metadata":{"id":"R7CfxWMkEzIX"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from johnsnowlabs import nlp, medical, visual\n","\n","# After uploading your license run this to install all licensed Python Wheels and pre-download Jars the Spark Session JVM\n","nlp.install()"],"metadata":{"id":"NulWi4_f4GN5"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from johnsnowlabs import nlp, medical\n","\n","spark = nlp.start()"],"metadata":{"id":"2GLXxe1Q0Iln","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1686130128374,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":10530,"user":{"displayName":"Ahmet Emin Tek","userId":"14855809472179427810"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"outputId":"849ee378-2841-4e72-b974-2f80e5ecd3cd"},"execution_count":4,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["üëå Detected license file /content/4.4.3.json\n","üëå Launched \u001b[92mcpu optimized\u001b[39m session with with: üöÄSpark-NLP==4.4.1, üíäSpark-Healthcare==4.4.3, running on ‚ö° PySpark==3.1.2\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from pyspark.sql import DataFrame\n","import pyspark.sql.functions as F\n","import pyspark.sql.types as T\n","import pyspark.sql as SQL\n","from pyspark import keyword_only"],"metadata":{"id":"DRAgk0aVNREB","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1686130466568,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":409,"user":{"displayName":"Ahmet Emin Tek","userId":"14855809472179427810"}}},"execution_count":9,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## **üñ®Ô∏è Input/Output Annotation Types**"],"metadata":{"id":"9Fbbk1bqcuA5"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["- Input: `DOCUMENT`, `TOKEN`, `WORD_EMBEDDINGS`\n","\n","- Output: `NAMED_ENTITY`"],"metadata":{"id":"0yFIrr5acsiU"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## **üìÇ Training Data**"],"metadata":{"id":"dt9KfxnM5Pz6"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["The training data should be a labeled Spark Dataset, in the format of CoNLL 2003 IOB with Annotation type columns.
