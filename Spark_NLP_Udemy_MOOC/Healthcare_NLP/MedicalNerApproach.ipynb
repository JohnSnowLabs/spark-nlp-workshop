For each word, these vectors are concatenated and fed to the BLSTM network and then to the output layers. They employed a stacked bi-directional recurrent neural network with long short-term memory units to transform word features into named entity tag scores. The extracted features of each word are fed into a forward LSTM network and a backward LSTM network. The output of each network at each time step is decoded by a linear layer and a log-softmax layer into log-probabilities for each tag category. These two vectors are then simply added together to produce the final output. In the architecture of the proposed framework in the original paper, 50-dimensional pretrained word embeddings is used for word features, 25-dimension character embeddings is used for char features, and capitalization features (allCaps, upperInitial, lowercase, mixedCaps, noinfo) are used for case features. <br/>\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"TjDKOoZ4Fc8G"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"MfkkKkbVF309"},"source":["## **🎬 Colab Setup**"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["###!!!

Setting this parameter to True will add the confidence score to the metadata of the NAMED_ENTITY annotation. In addition, if includeAllConfidenceScores is set to True, then the confidence scores of all the tags will be added to the metadata, otherwise only for the predicted tag (the one with maximum score) (Default: False).\n","\n","- `includeAllConfidenceScores`: (Bool) Whether to include confidence scores for all tags in annotation metadata or just the score of the predicted tag, by default False.\n","Needs the includeConfidence parameter to be set to True. Enabling this may slow down the inference speed (Default: False).\n","\n","- `labelColumn`: (Str) Column with one label per document.\n","\n","- `lr`: (Float) Learning rate for the optimization process (Default: 0.001).\n","\n","- `outputLogsPath`: (Str) Folder path to save training logs. If no path is specified, the logs won’t be stored in disk. The path can be a local file path, a distributed file path (HDFS, DBFS), or a cloud storage (S3).\n","\n","- `testDataset`: (Str) Path to test dataset in parquet format. If set, the dataset will be used to calculate statistic on it during training.\n","\n","- `validationSplit`: (Float) Choose the proportion of training dataset to be validated against the model on each Epoch. The value should be between 0.0 and 1.0 and by default it is 0.0 and off. <br/>\n","The validation dataset is randomly extracted from the training dataset before training starts.

For example, if the map is set to [“OLDTAG,NEWTAG”, “B-PER,B-VIP”, “I-PER, I-VIP”], then all occurrences of “OLDTAG” will be mapped to “NEWTAG”, all occurrences of “B-PER” will be mapped to “B-VIP”, and all occurrences of “I-PER” will be mapped to “I-VIP”.

A value of True (default) will override existing tags.\n","\n","- `logPrefix`: (Str) A prefix that will be appended to every log, default value is empty.\n","\n","- `useBestModel`: (Bool) Whether to restore and use the model from the epoch that has achieved the best performance at the end of the training.
