It is a supervised learning algorithm that learns to classify documents (or text) into predefined categories or classes based on the content of the text.\n","\n","`Logistic Regression` is a statistical model that models the probability of a binary (or multi-class) outcome based on one or more predictor variables. In the context of text classification, the predictor variables are typically the features extracted from the text, such as the presence or absence of certain words, n-grams, or other text-based features.\n","\n","The `Logistic Regression` model learns a set of weights (coefficients) for each feature during the training process, which determines the importance of that feature in predicting the class label. During inference or prediction, the learned model takes a new text document as input, extracts the relevant features, and computes the probability of the document belonging to each class using the learned weights and a logistic function."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"E8qy2MI2XySv"},"source":["## **🎬 Colab Setup**"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":37733,"status":"ok","timestamp":1718531451401,"user":{"displayName":"Bugra","userId":"12474083375271086689"},"user_tz":-180},"id":"HuLFt0OdBkuo","outputId":"cf1617b1-2bef-46f2-b28c-9782726a7530"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["\u001b[2K     \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m265.2/265.2 kB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m7.1 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[2K     \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m310.8/310.8 MB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m3.6 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[?25h  Preparing metadata (setup.py) ... \u001b[?25l\u001b[?25hdone\n","\u001b[2K     \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m565.0/565.0 kB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m30.5 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[2K     \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m676.2/676.2 kB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m47.3 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[2K     \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m95.6/95.6 kB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m12.2 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[2K     \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m3.1/3.1 MB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m63.7 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[2K     \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m139.2/139.2 kB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m346.2 kB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[2K     \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m66.9/66.9 kB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m8.7 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[2K     \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m12.3/12.3 MB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m114.8 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[2K     \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m82.2/82.2 kB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m11.9 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[2K     \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m150.3/150.3 kB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m19.4 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[2K     \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m1.6/1.6 MB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m81.0 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[?25h  Building wheel for pyspark (setup.py) ... \u001b[?25l\u001b[?25hdone\n"]}],"source":["! pip install -q johnsnowlabs"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":88},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":7357,"status":"ok","timestamp":1718531458738,"user":{"displayName":"Bugra","userId":"12474083375271086689"},"user_tz":-180},"id":"HJGAUiIqBI94","outputId":"8a383f1f-4eb7-4a67-b154-5bf916d61f28"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Please Upload your John Snow Labs License using the button below\n"]},{"data":{"text/html":["\n","     <input type=\"file\" id=\"files-5cd963fa-e50e-4c21-960e-2af0692f23a7\" name=\"files[]\" multiple disabled\n","        style=\"border:none\" />\n","     <output id=\"result-5cd963fa-e50e-4c21-960e-2af0692f23a7\">\n","      Upload widget is only available when the cell has been executed in the\n","      current browser session.
