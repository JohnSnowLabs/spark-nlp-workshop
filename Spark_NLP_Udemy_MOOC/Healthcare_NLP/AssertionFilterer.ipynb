The typical example of assertion status detection is negation identification: in the sentence ‚Äúthe patient has no history of diabetes‚Äù, the chunk ‚Äúdiabetes‚Äù -extracted by a clinical NER model as a Disease- would be classified as Absent by an assertion model due to the word \"no\" in its context. A more complex assertion model can include other labels such as Hypothetical, Past, Planned, Possible, Family, etc.\n","\n","The deep neural network architecture for assertion status detection in Spark NLP is based on a Bi-LSTM framework, and is a modified version of the architecture proposed by Federico Fancellu, Adam Lopez and Bonnie Webber (Neural Networks For Negation Scope Detection.\n","\n","\n","**AssertionFilterer** will allow you to filter out the named entities by the list of acceptable assertion statuses.
