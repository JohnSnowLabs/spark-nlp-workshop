This approach is utilized for associating specific patterns within text data with predetermined entities, such as dates, mentioned within the text.\n","\n","The class allows users to define rules using regular expressions paired with entities, offering flexibility in customization. These rules can either be directly set using the `setRules` method, with a specified delimiter, or loaded from an external file using the `setExternalRules` method.\n","\n","Additionally, users can specify parameters such as the matching strategy (`MATCH_FIRST`, `MATCH_ALL`, or `MATCH_COMPLETE`) to control how matches are handled. The output annotation type is `CHUNK`, with input annotation types supporting `DOCUMENT`. This class provides a versatile tool for implementing entity recognition based on user-defined patterns within text data.\n","\n","\n","A rule consists of a regex pattern and an identifier, delimited by a character of choice. An example could be `\"\\\\d{4}\\\\/\\\\d\\\\d\\\\/\\\\d\\\\d,date\"` which will match strings like `\"1970/01/01\"` to the identifier `\"date\"`."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"8LHkP98LZGeu"},"source":["## **🎬 Colab Setup**"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":54357,"status":"ok","timestamp":1718192385768,"user":{"displayName":"Bugra","userId":"12474083375271086689"},"user_tz":-180},"id":"kMNBNYJF7t-S","outputId":"ae0843e4-12be-4356-ab9d-ccb82c8062c7"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["\u001b[2K     \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m265.2/265.2 kB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m1.7 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[2K     \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m310.8/310.8 MB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m3.1 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[?25h  Preparing metadata (setup.py) ... \u001b[?25l\u001b[?25hdone\n","\u001b[2K     \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m565.0/565.0 kB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m29.6 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[2K     \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m676.2/676.2 kB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m29.9 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[2K     \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m95.6/95.6 kB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m8.0 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[2K     \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m3.1/3.1 MB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m50.6 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[2K     \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m139.2/139.2 kB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m6.5 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[2K     \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m66.9/66.9 kB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m7.0 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[2K     \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m12.3/12.3 MB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m14.9 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[2K     \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m82.2/82.2 kB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m8.0 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[2K     \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m150.3/150.3 kB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m16.2 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[2K     \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m1.6/1.6 MB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m49.6 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[?25h  Building wheel for pyspark (setup.py) ... \u001b[?25l\u001b[?25hdone\n"]}],"source":["! pip install -q johnsnowlabs"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":88},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":155613,"status":"ok","timestamp":1718192541363,"user":{"displayName":"Bugra","userId":"12474083375271086689"},"user_tz":-180},"id":"H2TdLIxi7v7Z","outputId":"c4252a83-d971-407f-fadc-dce6b3a4684b"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Please Upload your John Snow Labs License using the button below\n"]},{"data":{"text/html":["\n","     <input type=\"file\" id=\"files-9bb6ff7c-9f89-403f-896f-49203c145504\" name=\"files[]\" multiple disabled\n","        style=\"border:none\" />\n","     <output id=\"result-9bb6ff7c-9f89-403f-896f-49203c145504\">\n","      Upload widget is only available when the cell has been executed in the\n","      current browser session.
