        "**Extractive summarization** is a technique used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that aims to generate a concise summary by extracting the most important information from a given text. Unlike ***abstractive summarization***, which involves generating new sentences to capture the essence of the content, ***extractive summarization*** directly selects and concatenates existing sentences or phrases from the original text.\n",

The process typically includes preprocessing the text, identifying important sentences using various criteria, ranking them based on their importance, and selecting the top-ranked sentences for the final summary. Extractive summarization is favored for its objectivity, preserving the factual accuracy of the original text."

Extremities show no edema, clubbing or cyanosis.\\n\\nASSESSMENT/PLAN: This is a 34-year-old female with a BMI of 43 who is interested in surgical weight via the gastric bypass as opposed to Lap-Band. Olivia Smith will be asking for a letter of medical necessity from Dr. Andrew Johnson. She will also see my nutritionist and social worker and have an upper endoscopy.
