These models provide embeddings for each token in the text. One option is to extract the embedding vector of the CLS token, which represents the overall meaning of the text. Another option is to average the embeddings of all tokens.\n","\n","Alternatively, we can use fine-tuned Siamese network variants like SBERT, which are specifically designed to generate embeddings that bring similar sentences or documents closer together in the embedding space while separating dissimilar ones. These embeddings can be applied in \"Sentence Entity Resolver Models\" to perform entity mapping.\n","\n","However, for a more straightforward approach, we can use a chunk mapper method to extract entities from the text.
