Another option is to average the embeddings of all tokens.\n","\n","Alternatively, we can use fine-tuned Siamese network variants like SBERT, which are specifically designed to generate embeddings that bring similar sentences or documents closer together in the embedding space while separating dissimilar ones. These embeddings can be applied in \"Sentence Entity Resolver Models\" to perform entity mapping.\n","\n","However, for a more straightforward approach, we can use a chunk mapper method to extract entities from the text.
