The typical example of assertion status detection is negation identification: in the sentence “the patient has no history of diabetes”, the chunk “diabetes” -extracted by a clinical NER model as a Disease- would be classified as Absent by an assertion model due to the word \"no\" in its context. A more complex assertion model can include other labels such as Hypothetical, Past, Planned, Possible, Family, etc.\n","\n","\n","The deep neural network architecture for assertion status detection in Spark NLP is based on a Bi-LSTM framework, and is a modified version of the architecture proposed by Federico Fancellu, Adam Lopez and Bonnie Webber (Neural Networks For Negation Scope Detection.\n","\n","\n","AssertionChunkConverter creates a CHUNK column with metadata useful for training an Assertion Status Detection model."],"metadata":{"id":"rlHsEmCBkn5c"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"MfkkKkbVF309"},"source":["## **🎬 Colab Setup**"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"iMkMQtZNF2n-"},"outputs":[],"source":["!pip install -q johnsnowlabs"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from google.colab import files\n","print('Please Upload your John Snow Labs License using the button below')\n","license_keys = files.upload()"],"metadata":{"id":"nwJyFUMXkSIm"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from johnsnowlabs import nlp\n","\n","nlp.install()"],"metadata":{"id":"NulWi4_f4GN5"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from johnsnowlabs import nlp, medical\n","import pyspark.sql.functions as F\n","import pandas as pd\n","\n","spark = nlp.start()"],"metadata":{"id":"2GLXxe1Q0Iln"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## **🖨️ Input/Output Annotation Types**"],"metadata":{"id":"9Fbbk1bqcuA5"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["- Input: `DOCUMENT`, `TOKEN`, `NAMED_ENTITY`\n","\n","- Output: `CHUNK`"],"metadata":{"id":"0yFIrr5acsiU"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## **🔎 AssertionChunkConverter Parameters**\n"],"metadata":{"id":"b2YJehUKMhb0"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["- `chunkBeginCol`: (Str) The column containing the start index of the chunk.\n","\n","- `chunkEndCol`: (Str) The column containing the end index of the chunk.\n","\n","- `chunkTextCol`: (Str) The column containing the text chunk.\n","\n","- `outputTokenBeginCol`: (Str)  The column containing selected token start.\n","\n","- `outputTokenEndCol`: (Str) The column containing selected token end index.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"7ttYzdjwm65k"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["In some cases, there may be issues while creating the chunk column by using token indices and losing some data while training and testing the assertion status model if there are issues in these token indices.
