poor appetite, and vomiting. Two weeks prior to presentation, she was treated with a five-day course of amoxicillin for a respiratory tract infection. She was on metformin, glipizide, and dapagliflozin for T2DM and atorvastatin and gemfibrozil for HTG. She had been on dapagliflozin for six months at the time of presentation. Physical examination on presentation was significant for dry oral mucosa; significantly, her abdominal examination was benign with no tenderness, guarding, or rigidity. Pertinent laboratory findings on admission were: serum glucose 111 mg/dl, bicarbonate 18 mmol/l, anion gap 20, creatinine 0.4 mg/dL, triglycerides 508 mg/dL, total cholesterol 122 mg/dL, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) 10%, and venous pH 7.27. Serum lipase was normal at 43 U/L. Serum acetone levels could not be assessed as blood samples kept hemolyzing due to significant lipemia. The patient was initially admitted for starvation ketosis, as she reported poor oral intake for three days prior to admission. However, serum chemistry obtained six hours after presentation revealed her glucose was 186 mg/dL, the anion gap was still elevated at 21, serum bicarbonate was 16 mmol/L, triglyceride level peaked at 2050 mg/dL, and lipase was 52 U/L. The β-hydroxybutyrate level was obtained and found to be elevated at 5.29 mmol/L - the original sample was centrifuged and the chylomicron layer removed prior to analysis due to interference from turbidity caused by lipemia again. The patient was treated with an insulin drip for euDKA and HTG with a reduction in the anion gap to 13 and triglycerides to 1400 mg/dL, within 24 hours. Her euDKA was thought to be precipitated by her respiratory tract infection in the setting of SGLT2 inhibitor use. The patient was seen by the endocrinology service and she was discharged on 40 units of insulin glargine at night, 12 units of insulin lispro with meals, and metformin 1000 mg two times a day. It was determined that all SGLT2 inhibitors should be discontinued indefinitely.
