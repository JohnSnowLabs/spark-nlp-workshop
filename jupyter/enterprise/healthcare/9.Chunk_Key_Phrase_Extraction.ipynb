This annotator can be fed by either the output of NER model, NGramGenerator or YAKE, and could be used to generate similarity scores for each NER chunk that is coming out of any (clinical) NER model. That is, you can now sort your clinical entities by the importance of them with respect to document or sentence that they live in. Additionally, you can also use this new annotator to grab new clinical chunks that are missed by a pretrained NER model as well as summarizing the whole document into a few important sentences or phrases."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"A7Y6D0OpYxLH"},"outputs":[],"source":["import sys\n","import json\n","import os\n","with open('license.json') as f:\n","    license_keys = json.load(f)\n","    \n","import os\n","locals().update(license_keys)\n","os.environ.update(license_keys)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"w2tnzJIgYk2K"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Installing pyspark and spark-nlp\n","! pip install --upgrade -q pyspark==3.1.2 spark-nlp==$PUBLIC_VERSION\n","\n","# Installing Spark NLP Healthcare\n","! pip install --upgrade -q spark-nlp-jsl==$JSL_VERSION  --extra-index-url https://pypi.johnsnowlabs.com/$SECRET"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":3,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":314},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":27694,"status":"ok","timestamp":1649591848866,"user":{"displayName":"Damla","userId":"03285166568766987047"},"user_tz":-120},"id":"CZeDZ-FqYk2M","outputId":"79be21db-cea9-487a-b0a2-75c4cdb3e2fc"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Spark NLP Version : 3.4.2\n","Spark NLP_JSL Version : 3.5.0\n"]},{"data":{"text/html":["\n","            <div>\n","                <p><b>SparkSession - in-memory</b></p>\n","                \n","        <div>\n","            <p><b>SparkContext</b></p>\n","\n","            <p><a href=\"http://9090a96fd397:4040\">Spark UI</a></p>\n","\n","            <dl>\n","              <dt>Version</dt>\n","                <dd><code>v3.1.2</code></dd>\n","              <dt>Master</dt>\n","                <dd><code>local[*]</code></dd>\n","              <dt>AppName</dt>\n","                <dd><code>Spark NLP Licensed</code></dd>\n","            </dl>\n","        </div>\n","        \n","            </div>\n","        "],"text/plain":["<pyspark.sql.session.SparkSession at 0x7f10a7fa6790>"]},"execution_count":3,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["import json\n","import os\n","\n","from pyspark.ml import Pipeline,PipelineModel\n","from pyspark.sql import SparkSession\n","from pyspark.sql import functions as F\n","\n","import sparknlp_jsl\n","import sparknlp\n","\n","from sparknlp.annotator import *\n","from sparknlp_jsl.annotator import *\n","from sparknlp.base import *\n","\n","import warnings\n","warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\n","\n","params = {\"spark.driver.memory\":\"16G\", \n","          \"spark.kryoserializer.buffer.max\":\"2000M\", \n","          \"spark.driver.maxResultSize\":\"2000M\"} \n","\n","print(\"Spark NLP Version :\", sparknlp.version())\n","print(\"Spark NLP_JSL Version :\", sparknlp_jsl.version())\n","\n","spark = sparknlp_jsl.start(license_keys['SECRET'],params=params)\n","\n","spark"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"94ZsJV2qYk2X"},"source":["**Lets start with creating a spark dataframe.**"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":4,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":7917,"status":"ok","timestamp":1649591861644,"user":{"displayName":"Damla","userId":"03285166568766987047"},"user_tz":-120},"id":"Uba40MK_Yk2Y"},"outputs":[],"source":["text = \"\"\"\n","A 28-year-old female with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus diagnosed eight \n","years prior to presentation and subsequent type two diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ), one prior \n","episode of HTG-induced pancreatitis three years prior to presentation , associated with an acute \n","hepatitis , and obesity with a body mass index ( BMI ) of 33.5 kg/m2 , presented with a one-week \n","history of polyuria , polydipsia , poor appetite , and vomiting .
