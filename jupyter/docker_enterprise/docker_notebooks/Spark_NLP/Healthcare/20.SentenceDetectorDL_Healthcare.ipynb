    "`SentenceDetectorDL` (SDDL) is based on a general-purpose neural network model for sentence boundary detection.  The task of sentence boundary detection is to identify sentences within a text. Many natural language processing tasks take a sentence as an input unit, such as part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing, named entity recognition or machine translation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this model, we treated the sentence boundary detection task as a classification problem using a DL CNN architecture. We also modified the original implemenation a little bit to cover broken sentences and some impossible end of line chars."
