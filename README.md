# JohnSnowLabs Spark-NLP Workshop
## Based on Spark-NLP 1.6.2

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/JohnSnowLabs/spark-nlp-workshop/master)

Using Binder allows you to run Spark-NLP on jupyter notebooks remotely.

Otherwise, please setup your own Spark-NLP environment following quickstart guide or readme

Note: Some notebooks are still work in progress and binder may not provide sufficient resources for them to run properly. Own environment is much recommended.
