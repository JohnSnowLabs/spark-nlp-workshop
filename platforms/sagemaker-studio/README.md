# How to include a Spark NLP Docker Image into Sagemaker

## 1. Unzipping the code
Unzip the `sagemaker_template.zip` file, if you have not done so. Inside, you should find the following files:
- Dockerfile
- SparkNLP_sagemaker.ipynb
- app-image-config-input.json
- ecr_configure.sh
- environment.yml
- README.md
- license.json

## 2. Set your license
`license.json` is empty. You should overwrite it with your own license with both OCR and Healthcare secret and license codes. 
The following fields are required, and should be present in your license(s). if not, please contact JSL team at support@johnsnowlabs.com.
```
{
    "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID": "",
    "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY": "",
    "SPARK_OCR_LICENSE": "",
    "SPARK_OCR_SECRET": "",
    "PUBLIC_VERSION": "",
    "OCR_VERSION": "",
    "SPARK_NLP_LICENSE": "",
    "SECRET": "",
    "JSL_VERSION": ""
}
```

## 3. Configure ECR
The Docker Image for Sagemaker should reside in AWS ECR. 

To configure your ECR, you need to open `ecr_configure.sh` and set the following fields:
```
REGION= 	# Your AWS region for ECR. Example, eu-central-1
ACCOUNT_ID= 	# Your AWS Account Id. Example, 123456789
IMAGE_NAME= 	# Any name may work here, for example, SparkNLP
REPO_NAME=	# The repo name in ECR. It will try to create one if it is not present. Example: JSL
ROLE_ARN=	# AWS ARN Role, something that usually you create when starting Sagemaker, and that allows using ECR and grants other permissions. Is something similar to arn:aws:iam::YYYYY:role/service-role/AmazonSageMaker-ExecutionRole-XXXXXXX
```

## 4. Execute `ecr_configure.sh`
After configuring `ecr_configure.sh` variables as described in previous section, you will be able to create a Docker image using the available Dockerfile file, and this script will build it and upload it to your ECR. Just run:

`./ecr_configure.sh`

If it does not have execution rights, just use `bash ./ecr_configure.sh` or grant permissions by executing `chmod +x ecr_configure.sh`

Don't close the terminal, you will need the output (especially the **image URI**) for adding it to Sagemaker.

After running `.sh` file, please make sure these **outputs are present:**

- A message saying repository is created, with the metadata. Example:

```
{
    "repository": {
        "repositoryArn": "arn:aws:ecr:REGION:ACCOUNT_ID:repository/REPO_NAME",
        "registryId": "ACCOUNT_ID",
        "repositoryName": "REPO_NAME",
        "repositoryUri": "ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.REGION.amazonaws.com/REPO_NAME",
        "createdAt": "2021-12-17T12:01:58+01:00",
        "imageTagMutability": "MUTABLE",
        "imageScanningConfiguration": {
            "scanOnPush": false
        },
        "encryptionConfiguration": {
            "encryptionType": "AES256"
        }
    }
}
```
 If the repository already existed, you will get a `An error occurred (RepositoryAlreadyExistsException) when calling the CreateRepository operation: The repository with name 'jsl' already exists in the registry with id "XXXX"` you can ignore.

- `Login Succeeded `

- `Image successfully tagged`, `Building 2.6s (18/18) FINISHED` and/or information about the output of the Dockerfile build, depending on your version of Docker and OS.

- `Pushed the image properly` or information about the creation of all the layers of the Docker image, for example:
```
The push refers to repository [ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.REGION.amazonaws.com/REPO_NAME]
ada4ff8fc3ed: Pushed
95b2e5a9f88d: Pushed
1c38ff1b8f8b: Pushed
2429bf5919e0: Pushed
...
```

- `ImageVersionStatus`  is `CREATED` :
 ```
{
    "BaseImage": "ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.REGION.amazonaws.com/REPO_NAME:IMAGE_NAME",
    "ContainerImage": "ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.REGION.amazonaws.com/REPO_NAME@sha256:eXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
    "CreationTime": "2021-12-15T13:24:31.162000+00:00",
    "ImageArn": "arn:aws:sagemaker:REGION:ACCOUNT_ID:image/IMAGE_NAME",
    "ImageVersionArn": "arn:aws:sagemaker:REGION:ACCOUNT_ID:image-version/IMAGE_NAME/1",
    "ImageVersionStatus": "CREATED",
    "LastModifiedTime": "2021-12-15T13:24:31.525000+00:00",
    "Version": 1
}
```

## 5. Open Sagemaker
In Sagemaker, go to `SageMaker Domain` -> `Studio`. Make sure you have an active user, with the role arn you have set in ROLE_ARN in Section 3. 

On the bottom part of the screen, you will see `Customer SageMaker Studio images attached to domain`.

## 6. Attach image
In the `Choose image source`, click on `New Image`, and then in the `Enter an ECR image URI`, add the `URI` you will see in the logs from step 4. Click on "Next".

Then, in `Image properties`, fill `Image name` (same as IMAGE_NAME in step 3), and `Image display name` (also use IMAGE_NAME). In `IAM role`, make sure you select the same `ROLE_ARN` from section 3 in the dropdown. Click on "Next".

`EFS mount path` should be `/root`. Kernel name should be `conda-env-myenv-py`. Kernel display name should be `Python [conda env: myenv]`. Click on "Advanced Configuration". Set `User ID (UID)` to 0. Set `Group ID (GUID)` to 0. Click on Submit.

## 7. Launching Sagemaker Studio
After clicking on submit, you  will see a **Ready** status in the `Sagemaker Domain -> Studio` screen. Go to Users (top of the screen), click on `Launch app` and select `Studio`.

Sagemaker Studio will take some time to launch, because will instantiate a container of the image we have added. After that, you can start a new notebook. Make sure you see as active the `Python [conda env: myenv]` kernel. It may take also some time to spin.

### 7.1 Important Note:
**IMPORTANT**
**Please make sure the very first command in the notebook is:**
```
!echo "127.0.0.1 $HOSTNAME" >> /etc/hosts
```

Once spun, you are ready to go. Find in the `.zip` folder a `SparkNLP_sagemaker.ipynb` example notebook you can upload to test that your installation is working.
