# Legal NLP Pipelines on java grpc
This is the code used to reproduce the results given [here](https://medium.com/@jjmcarrascosa/low-latency-real-time-legal-ai-with-spark-nlp-on-grpc-a2f9b899de92).

With gRPC on java, we can add at least 50 models to a LightPipeline and get an inference time of 0.5s per 1024 characters.
If you run gRPC on a cluster, you can scale the number of LightPipelines you can serve via, for example, and API.

To run this:
1) Put the licensed Legal NLP jar somewhere in the project, for example, in src/jars.
2) Change the path in Utils class (JAR_PATH) to reflect that path;
3) Change the credentials in Utils class, vars `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `SPARK_NLP_LICENSE`, `SECRET`, `JSL_VERSION` and `PUBLIC_VERSION`. You have this information in your license json.
4) If your license is a Floating license, set it to `true` in Utils class

To benchmark:
1) Change the number of models you want to load in a pipeline. Possible values: 1, 10, 100, 200, 300;
2) Change the number of calls you want to do to average the time;
3) Change the number of workers you want to deploy in your machine to attend the petition;
