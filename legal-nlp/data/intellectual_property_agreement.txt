Each Party shall ensure that any sublicense that it grants to a Sublicensee does not conflict with this Agreement. For clarity, granting a sublicense shall not relieve the Parties of any obligations hereunder and each Party shall cause each of its Sublicensees to comply, and shall remain responsible for such Sublicensees' compliance, with all terms and conditions hereof applicable to the Parties. At the request of a licensing Party, the other Party shall provide to the licensing Party a list of all Sublicensees and otherwise reasonably cooperate with the licensing Party in connection with Sublicensees' compliance with this Agreement. 7.2 Reservation of Rights. Except as expressly provided in the Stock Purchase Agreement or herein, each Party reserves its and its Affiliates' rights in and to all Intellectual Property (including with respect to the use, registration and licensing thereof). 8. OWNERSHIP 8.1 Ownership of Arizona Licensed IP. The Buyer Entities acknowledge and agree that (a) Arizona and its Affiliates own the Arizona Licensed IP (other than the Arizona Licensed Trademarks), (b) AWI Licensing LLC owns the Arizona Licensed Trademarks, (b) neither the Company, nor its Affiliates or its Sublicensees, will acquire any ownership rights in the Arizona Licensed IP, and (c) the Company shall not represent or make any claim that it has an ownership interest in any Arizona Licensed IP.

9. PROSECUTION, MAINTENANCE AND ENFORCEMENT 9.1 Responsibility and Cooperation. As between the Parties, Arizona, with respect to the Arizona Licensed IP, and the Buyer Entities, with respect to the Company Licensed IP, shall have the right (but not the obligation) for filing, prosecuting, and maintaining all Arizona Licensed IP and Company Licensed IP, respectively, in the licensing Party's name. For the avoidance of doubt, in case either such Party files any new Intellectual Property registration to the extent covering the Licensed IP, such new Intellectual Property registration shall automatically become Licensed IP. However, and for the further avoidance of doubt, the aforementioned shall not apply to new Intellectual Property created by a licensee Party or its Sublicensees separately and independently from the Licensed IP, for example in case of separate and independent technical enhancements or advancements. The Parties shall reasonably consult and coordinate with each other at the other Party's request with respect to the matters set forth in this Section 9.1. 9.2 No Additional Obligations. This Agreement shall not obligate either Party to disclose to the other Party, or maintain, register, prosecute, pay for, enforce, or otherwise manage any Intellectual Property except as expressly set forth herein. 9.3 Enforcement. As between the Parties, Arizona, with respect to the Arizona Licensed IP, and the Company or Buyer, with respect to the Company Licensed IP, shall have the right (but not the obligation) to elect to bring a Proceeding or enter into settlement discussions regarding, or otherwise seek to resolve, any infringement, misappropriation, or other violation, or allegations of invalidity or unenforceability, of the Licensed IP. In the event that Arizona declines to institute any Proceedings against third-party infringers or violators of any Arizona Licensed Patents, regarding activities that would fall within the Company Field if conducted by the Company, within forty-five (45) days after being notified or becoming aware of such infringing conduct, the Company or Buyer shall have the right to institute any Proceedings against such third-party infringers or violators. In the event that the Company or Buyer elects to institute such Proceedings, Arizona will reasonably cooperate with the Company or Buyer in such Proceedings, and the Company or Buyer shall reimburse Arizona for all reasonable costs and fees incurred by Arizona as a result of such cooperation. Such cooperation by Arizona will include joining such Proceeding as a party, if deemed necessary by the Company or Buyer. In the event that Arizona elects to bring a Proceeding against any alleged infringer of the Arizona Licensed Trademarks and seeks the cooperation of the Licensor of the Trademark License Agreement in such Proceeding, Arizona will take reasonable steps to assist the Company or Buyer in requesting the cooperation of the Licensor of the Trademark License Agreement, and pursuing an infringement claim against such alleged infringer. The Company or Buyer, as applicable, shall retain all benefits, recoveries, injunctions or other value derived from such Proceedings instituted by such Party. 10. INDEMNIFICATION 10.1 Indemnification. Each Party (the "Indemnifying Party") agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the other Party and its Affiliates and their respective employees, 9

(b) Either Party may terminate this Agreement if the other Party materially breaches this Agreement and fails to remedy such breach within thirty (30) days' written notice thereof; provided, however, that if the material breach of this Agreement by the breaching Party is limited to the Licensed Copyrights, Licensed Know-How, the Arizona Licensed Patents, or the Licensed Trademarks, the non-breaching Party shall be entitled to termination solely with respect to the affected part of the license (i.e., in such case, the non-breaching Party may terminate this Agreement with respect to the Licensed Copyrights or the Licensed Know-How or the Arizona Licensed Patents or the Licensed Trademarks, as applicable). 12.2 Effect of Termination. (a) Effect of Termination. Upon termination of this Agreement, each licensee Party shall and shall cause all of its Sublicensees to cease all use of the Licensed IP that is subject to such termination (excluding for clarity (a) any Arizona Licensed Patents, Licensed Copyrights or Licensed Trademarks that are expired, invalid or abandoned or (b) any Licensed Know-How that no longer constitutes confidential information). 10

MISCELLANEOUS 13.1 Entire Agreement.

It shall be expressly understood that the Stock Purchase Agreement shall govern the transactions contemplated thereby as a whole and that this Agreement shall not be construed as an amendment or variation of the Stock Purchase Agreement but rather shall be complemented by and interpreted in light of the Stock Purchase Agreement. In the event that any provision of this Agreement is inconsistent with, conflicts with or contradicts any term of the Stock Purchase Agreement, the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement will prevail. 13.2 Assignment. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, including under Section 7.1, neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations of any Party under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, by either Party without the prior written consent of the other Party; provided, however, that (a) either Party may assign any of the foregoing in connection with the sale or other transfer of the applicable business or assets of such Party or its Affiliates to which this Agreement relates (except that neither of the Buyer Entities may assign any such rights, interests or obligations with respect to the Arizona Licensed Trademarks); (b) Arizona may assign any of the foregoing to one or more of its Affiliates and (c) the Company and Buyer may assign any of the foregoing to one or more of its Subsidiaries, controlled Affiliates, AWP, or any holding company that is a direct or indirect parent of the Company; provided that in each case (b) and (c), no assignment shall relieve the assigning Party of any of its obligations under this Agreement unless agreed to by the non-assigning Party.
