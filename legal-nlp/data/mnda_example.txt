This Mutual Nondisclosure Agreement (the “Agreement”) is made on _________ (“Effective

Lewes, Delaware 19958 (“John Snow Labs”), and

Recitals:  
John Snow Labs and Company intend to explore the possibility of a business relationship  
between each other, whereby each party (“Discloser”) may disclose sensitive information to the  
other party (“Recipient”).   
The parties agree as follows:  
1. Definition.   
1.1 The term “Confidential Information” means, to the extent previously, presently or  
subsequently disclosed by or for Discloser to Recipient (whether in writing, orally or by  
another means), all financial, business, economic, legal, competitively sensitive and technical  
information of Discloser or any of its affiliates, suppliers, customers and employees  
(including, without limitation, information about research, development, operations,  
marketing, transactions, regulatory affairs, discoveries, inventions, methods, processes,  
articles, materials, algorithms, software, specifications, designs, drawings, data, strategies,  
codes, patterns, plans, prospects, know-how, formulas, prototypes, procedures, concepts and  
ideas, whether tangible or intangible, and including all copies, abstracts, summaries, analyses  
and other derivatives thereof), that is marked, traditionally recognized or otherwise identified  
as proprietary or confidential at the time of disclosure, or that by its nature would be  
understood by a reasonable person to be proprietary or confidential.   
1.2 Confidential Information shall not include any information that:   
(a)  was rightfully known to Recipient without restriction before receipt from Discloser;  
(b)  is rightfully disclosed to Recipient without restriction by a third party;  
(c)  is or becomes generally known to the public without violation of this Agreement by  
Recipient; or   
(d)  is independently developed by Recipient or its employees without access to or reliance  
on such information.

1.3 Discloser represents and warrants to Recipient that it is authorized to disclose any and all  
Confidential Information made available to Recipient under this Agreement.  
2. Restrictions.   
2.1 As to the Discloser of Confidential Information, Recipient agrees:  
(a)  to use the Confidential Information only for the purpose set out in this Agreement and  
for its consideration internally of a business relationship or transaction between the  
parties, and its performance in any resulting arrangement, but not for any other  
purpose;  
(b)  to strictly maintain the Confidential Information as confidential, and exercise  
reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized access, use or disclosure;  
(c)  not to copy the Confidential Information without a prior written approval of Discloser  
and for any purpose other than set out in this Agreement;  
(d)  not to disclose the Confidential Information to any third party other than Recipient’s  
employees and agents who have a need to know for the permitted purpose and who are  
apprised of the confidential nature of the Confidential Information and all of the  
restrictions in this Agreement;  
(e)  not to decompile, disassemble or otherwise reverse engineer of any Confidential  
Information, or use any similar means to discover its underlying composition,  
structure, source code or trade secrets; and   
(f)  not to export or re-export any Confidential Information or product thereof in violation  
of U.S. or other export control laws or regulations.   
2.2 Recipient acknowledges the confidential character of the Confidential Information, therefore  
undertakes to protect and maintain strictly such information in the same grade of protection  
as its own Confidential Information, but in no case any less than reasonable care.  
2.3 The terms and conditions of any transaction or possible transaction between the parties, the  
fact that disclosures, evaluations or discussions are taking place, and the status and results  
thereof will also be held in confidence by both parties and not disclosed to any third party.  
Each party shall be responsible for any breach of its confidentiality obligations by its  
respective employees and agents.  
3. Compelled Disclosures.   
These restrictions will not prevent either party from complying with any law, regulation,  
court order or other legal requirement that purports to compel disclosure of any Confidential  
Information. Recipient will promptly notify Discloser upon learning of any such legal  
requirement, and cooperate with Discloser in the exercise of its right to protect the  
confidentiality of the Confidential Information before any tribunal or governmental agency.

4. No Warranties or Licenses.   
All Confidential Information is provided “AS IS”. Discloser will not be liable to Recipient  
for damages arising from any use of the Confidential Information, from errors, omissions or  
otherwise. All of Discloser’s rights in and to its Confidential Information remain the  
exclusive property of Discloser. Neither this Agreement, nor any disclosure of Confidential  
Information hereunder (a) grants to Recipient any right or license under any copyright,  
patent, mask work, trade secret or other intellectual property right, except solely for the use  
expressly permitted herein, (b) obligates either party to disclose or receive any information,  
perform any work or enter into any agreement, (c) limits either party from developing,  
manufacturing or marketing products or services that may be competitive with those of the  
other except insofar as this Agreement limits the use and disclosure of Confidential  
Information, (d) limits either party from assigning or reassigning its employees in any way,  
or (e) limits either party from entering into any business relationship with third parties.  
5. Termination.   
This Agreement will terminate as to the further exchange of Confidential Information  
immediately upon the earlier of (a) receipt by one party of written notice from the other and  
(b) the first anniversary of this Agreement. The confidentiality obligations of this Agreement,  
as they apply to any Confidential Information disclosed prior to termination, will survive  
termination for a period of 3 years; except when such Confidential Information disclosed by  
the Discloser is source code, trade secret or patient information, in which case the Receiving  
Party’s obligations to protect such Confidential Information shall be perpetual. Upon  
termination of this Agreement for any reason, or upon Discloser’s request at any time,  
Recipient shall promptly return to Discloser or destroy (if applicable) all originals and copies  
of any Confidential Information and destroy all information, records and materials developed  
therefrom. Upon request of Discloser, Recipient shall certify in writing that all copies thereof  
in its possession have been returned and/or destroyed.   
6. Remedies.   
Due to the unique nature of the Confidential Information, the parties agree that any breach or  
threatened breach of this Agreement will cause not only financial harm to Discloser, but also  
irreparable harm for which money damages will not be an adequate remedy. Therefore,  
Discloser shall be entitled, in addition to any other legal or equitable remedies, to an  
injunction or similar equitable relief against any such breach or threatened breach without the  
ecessity of posting any bond.  
7. General.   
7.1 This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement, and supersedes all prior negotiations,  
understandings or agreements (oral or written), between the parties concerning the subject  
matter hereof.   
7.2 This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which is an original,  
but taken together constituting one and the same instrument. Execution of a facsimile copy  
  
 4  
shall have the same force and effect as execution of an original, and a facsimile signature  
shall be deemed an original and valid signature.   
7.3 No change, consent or waiver to this Agreement will be effective unless in writing and  
signed by the party against which enforcement is sought. The failure of either party to  
enforce its rights under this Agreement at any time for any period shall not be construed as a  
waiver of such rights. Unless expressly provided otherwise, each right and remedy in this  
Agreement is in addition to any other right or remedy, at law or in equity, and the exercise of  
one right or remedy will not be deemed a waiver of any other right or remedy.   
7.4 In the event that any provision of this Agreement shall be determined to be illegal or  
unenforceable, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary  
so that the Agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.   
7.5 This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State  
of Delaware, USA without regard to the conflicts of laws provisions thereof. Exclusive  
jurisdiction and venue for any action arising under this Agreement is in the federal and state  
courts having jurisdiction over John Snow Labs’ principal office, and both parties hereby  
consent to such jurisdiction and venue for this purpose. In any action or proceeding to  
enforce or interpret this Agreement, the prevailing party will be entitled to recover from the  
other party its costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred in  
connection with such action or proceeding and enforcing any judgment or order obtained.   
7.6 Any notice hereunder will be effective upon receipt and shall be given in writing, in English  
and delivered to the other party at its address given herein or at such other address designated  
by written notice.  
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Agreement as a sealed  
instrument, effective as of the date and year first written above.
