of any accounting term used in Sections 7.2.15 and 7.2.16 shall have the meaning
given to such terms (and defined terms) under GAAP as in effect on the date
hereof applied on a basis consistent with those used in preparing the Annual
Statements referred to in Section 7.3.2. If the Company notifies the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders in writing ("NOTICE OF CHANGE IN GAAP")
that the Company requests an amendment to any financial or accounting provision
hereof to eliminate the effect of, or give effect to, any change occurring after

provisions shall be calculated in accordance with GAAP as in effect on the date

terms. In the event the Administrative Agent shall have delivered a GAAP
Objection Notice to the Company, the parties hereto agree to endeavor, in good
faith, to agree upon an amendment to this Agreement that would adjust such
financial or accounting provision in a manner that would give effect to such
change hereunder determined in accordance with the Company's financial
statements at that time; provided, further, that for purposes of the calculation
of the financial covenants in Sections 7.2.15 and 7.2.16, the adjustments to

                  2. REVOLVING CREDIT AND SWING LOAN FACILITIES

          2.1 REVOLVING CREDIT COMMITMENTS.

               2.1.1 REVOLVING CREDIT LOANS.

                    2.1.1.1 COMMITMENT.

               Subject to the terms and conditions hereof and relying upon the
representations and warranties herein set forth, each Lender holding any
Revolving Credit Commitment severally agrees to make Revolving Credit Loans in
either Dollars or one or more Optional Currencies to the Borrowers at any time
or from time to time on or after the date hereof to the Expiration Date,
provided that (i) after giving effect to each such Loan the aggregate Dollar
Equivalent amount of Revolving Credit Loans from such Lender shall not exceed
such Lender's Revolving Credit Commitment minus such Lender's Revolving Credit
Ratable Share of the Dollar Equivalent amount of Letters of Credit Outstanding,
and (ii) no Revolving Credit Loan to which the Base Rate Option applies shall be
made in an Optional Currency. Within such limits of time and amount and subject
to the other provisions of this Agreement, the Borrowers may borrow, repay and
reborrow pursuant to this Section 2.1. The Borrowers, jointly and severally,
subject to Section 10.18 (if applicable), shall repay in full the outstanding
principal amount of the Revolving Credit Loans, together with all accrued
interest thereon and all fees and other amounts owing under any of the Loan
Documents relating thereto on the Expiration Date or earlier termination of the
Revolving Credit Commitments in connection with the terms hereof.

                    2.1.1.2 DISCRETIONARY COMMITMENT INCREASE.

               Provided that no Event of Default or Potential Default is then
occurring or would be caused thereby, at any time prior to the Expiration Date
and subsequent to the Closing Date, the Borrowers may request from time to time
in writing to the Administrative Agent that the Revolving Credit Commitments be
increased, by an amount being an integral multiple of $5,000,000.00 and in an
aggregate amount not greater than $75,000,000.00, according to the following
procedures:

                         (i) The Borrowers shall offer for a period of fifteen
(15) Business Days the existing Lenders the opportunity to participate in any
such increased amount of the Revolving Credit Commitments (such increased amount
being referred to as the


                                       31



"COMMITMENT INCREASE AMOUNT") in accordance with each Lender's Revolving Credit
Ratable Share (each participating Lender being referred to as an "INCREASING
LENDER"). The existing Lenders shall be under no obligation to participate in
any such Commitment Increase Amounts and any agreement by any Lender to so
participate will be in the sole discretion of such Lender.

                         (ii) If any Lender declines to commit to its Revolving
Credit Ratable Share of any such Commitment Increase Amount (such declined
portion of the Commitment Increase Amount being referred to as a "DECLINED
SHARE"), then the Administrative Agent may join a new bank(s) or financial
institution(s) to this Agreement, which shall be acceptable to the Borrowers, or
the Borrowers may propose a new bank(s) or financial institution(s) which shall
be approved by the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion without
unreasonable delay (each such bank or financial institution, an "AUGMENTING
LENDER"), or permit an Increasing Lender which has already agreed to commit to
its Revolving Credit Ratable Share of any such Commitment Increase Amount, to
commit to the Declined Share or portion thereof, with respect to any Augmenting
Lender, in an amount of at least $5,000,000. Each Augmenting Lender committing
to a Declined Share, or a portion thereof, shall join this Agreement as a Lender
by entering into a bank joinder and assumption agreement in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, setting forth the Revolving
Credit Commitment of such Augmenting Lender, pursuant to which such Augmenting
Lender will become a Lender as of the effective date thereof.

                         (iii) On the effective date of any increase in the
Revolving Credit Commitments as contemplated herein (A) each Increasing Lender
and new Augmenting Lender shall make available to the Administrative Agent, for
the benefit of the other Lenders, such amounts, in immediately available funds,
as the Administrative Agent shall determine as being required in order to cause,
after giving effect to such increase and the use of such amounts to make
payments to such other Lenders, each Lender's portion of the outstanding
Revolving Credit Loans of all the Lenders to equal its Revolving Credit Ratable
Share of the Revolving Credit Commitments (after giving effect to the increase
in the Revolving Credit Commitments occasioned by the addition of the Increasing
Lender(s) or Augmenting Lender(s), or both, as the case may be) and (B) the
Borrowers shall be deemed to have repaid and reborrowed all outstanding
Revolving Loans as of the date of any increase in the Revolving Credit
Commitments (with such reborrowing to consist of Revolving Credit Loans subject
to the same interest rate options provided herein, with related Interest Periods
if applicable, specified in a notice delivered by the Borrowers in accordance
with the requirements of Section 3.2). The deemed payments made pursuant to
clause (B) of the immediately preceding sentence in respect of each Revolving
Credit Loan to which a Euro-Rate Option applies shall be subject to
indemnification by the Borrowers pursuant to the provisions of Section 4.6.2 if
the deemed payment occurs other than on the last day of the related Interest
Periods. Upon the request of the Administrative Agent, the Borrowers shall
execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Lenders
any and all Notes and other documents, instruments, and agreements necessary or
advisable in the reasonable judgment of the Administrative Agent to evidence or
document the increase in the Revolving Credit Commitments, including any
amendments hereto, and each of the Lenders and each of the Loan Parties hereby
provides its consent hereto and thereto, and each Lender hereby authorizes the
Administrative Agent, and each Loan Party


                                       32



hereby authorizes the Company, to execute any such documents, instruments, and
agreements consistent with the terms of this Section on its behalf without the
necessity of any further consent of any Lender or Loan Party.

               2.1.2 SWING LOAN COMMITMENT.

               Subject to the terms and conditions hereof and relying upon the
representations and warranties herein set forth, and in order to facilitate
loans and repayments between Settlement Dates, PNC Bank may, at its option,
cancelable at any time for any reason whatsoever, make swing loans (the "SWING
LOANS") to the Borrowers at any time or from time to time after the date hereof
to, but not including, the Expiration Date, in an aggregate principal amount up
to but not in excess of $20,000,000.00 (the "SWING LOAN COMMITMENT"), provided
that the aggregate principal amount of PNC Bank's Swing Loans and the Revolving
Credit Loans of all the Lenders at any one time outstanding shall not exceed the
Revolving Credit Commitments of all the Lenders. Within such limits of time and
amount and subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, the Borrowers may
borrow, repay and reborrow pursuant to this Section 2.1.2.

          2.2 NATURE OF LENDERS' OBLIGATIONS WITH RESPECT TO REVOLVING CREDIT
LOANS.

               Each Lender shall be obligated to participate in each request for
Revolving Credit Loans pursuant to Section 2.4 in accordance with its Revolving
Credit Ratable Share. The aggregate Dollar Equivalent amount of each Lender's
Revolving Credit Loans outstanding hereunder to the Borrowers at any time shall
never exceed its Revolving Credit Commitment minus its Revolving Credit Ratable
Share of the Dollar Equivalent amount of Letters of Credit Outstanding. The
obligations of each Lender hereunder are several. The failure of any Lender to
perform its obligations hereunder shall not affect the Obligations of the
Borrowers to any other party nor shall any other party be liable for the failure
of such Lender to perform its obligations hereunder. The Lenders shall have no
obligation to make Revolving Credit Loans hereunder on or after the Expiration
Date.

          2.3 COMMITMENT FEES.

               Accruing from the date hereof until the Expiration Date, the
Borrowers agree to pay to the Administrative Agent in Dollars for the account of
each Lender, as consideration for such Lender's Revolving Credit Commitment
hereunder, a nonrefundable commitment fee (the "COMMITMENT FEE") equal to the
Applicable Commitment Fee Rate (computed on the basis of a year of 360 days, and
actual days elapsed) on the average daily difference between the amount of (i)
such Lender's Revolving Credit Commitment as the same may be constituted from
time to time (for purposes of this computation, PNC Bank's Swing Loans shall be
deemed to be borrowed amounts under its Revolving Credit Commitment) and (ii)
the sum of the Dollar Equivalent amount of such Lender's Revolving Credit Loans
outstanding plus its Revolving Credit Ratable Share of the Dollar Equivalent
amount of Letters of Credit Outstanding, in each case as determined during the
preceding fiscal quarter (or shorter period commencing with the Closing Date or
ending on the Expiration Date). All Commitment


                                       33



Fees shall be payable quarterly in arrears on the first day of each July,
October, January and April after the date hereof and on the Expiration Date or
upon acceleration of the Loan.

telephonic request without the necessity of receipt of such written
confirmation. Each Loan Request shall be irrevocable and shall specify (i) the
proposed Borrowing Date; (ii) the aggregate amount of the proposed Loans
(expressed in the currency in which such Loans shall be funded) comprising each
Borrowing Tranche, the Dollar Equivalent amount of which shall be in integral
multiples of $100,000.00 and not less than $2,000,000.00 for each Borrowing

               The obligation of the Borrowers to repay the aggregate unpaid
principal amount of the Revolving Credit Loans made to it by each Lender,
together with interest thereon, shall be evidenced by a Revolving Credit Note
dated the Closing Date payable to the order of such Lender in a face amount
equal to the Revolving Credit Commitment of such Lender.

          2.7 SWING LOAN NOTE.

               The obligation of the Borrowers to repay the unpaid principal

          2.8 BORROWINGS TO REPAY SWING LOANS.

               PNC Bank may, at its option, exercisable at any time for any
reason whatsoever, demand repayment of the Swing Loans, and each Lender shall
make a Revolving Credit Loan in an amount equal to such Lender's Revolving
Credit Ratable Share of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Swing
Loans, plus, if PNC Bank so requests, accrued interest thereon, provided that no
Lender shall be obligated in any event to make any Revolving Credit Loan if
after giving effect thereto, the sum of the Dollar Equivalent amount of its
Revolving Credit Loans plus such Lender's Revolving Credit Ratable Share of the
Dollar Equivalent amount of Letters of Credit Outstanding exceeds its Revolving
Credit Commitment. Revolving Credit Loans made pursuant to the preceding
sentence shall bear interest at the Base Rate Option and shall be deemed to have
been properly requested in accordance with Section 2.4.1 without regard to any
of the requirements of that provision. PNC Bank shall provide notice to the
Lenders (which may be telephonic or written notice by letter, facsimile or
telex) that such Revolving Credit Loans are to be made under this Section 2.8
and of the apportionment among the Lenders, and the Lenders shall be
unconditionally obligated to fund such Revolving Credit Loans (whether or not
the conditions specified in Section 6.2 are then satisfied) by the time PNC Bank
so requests, which shall not be earlier than 3:00 p.m. Pittsburgh time on the
next Business Day after the date the Lenders receive such notice from PNC Bank.

          2.9 UTILIZATION OF COMMITMENTS IN OPTIONAL CURRENCIES.

               2.9.1 PERIODIC COMPUTATIONS OF DOLLAR EQUIVALENT AMOUNTS OF
REVOLVING CREDIT LOANS AND LETTERS OF CREDIT OUTSTANDING.

               The Administrative Agent will determine the Dollar Equivalent
amount of (i) proposed Letters of Credit to be denominated in an Optional
Currency as of the requested Borrowing Date or date of issuance, as the case may
be, (ii) Letters of Credit Outstanding denominated in an Optional Currency as of
the last Business Day of each month, and (iii) outstanding Revolving Credit
Loans denominated in an Optional Currency as of the end of each Interest Period
(each such date under clauses (i) through (iii), a "COMPUTATION DATE").

               2.9.2 NOTICES FROM LENDERS THAT OPTIONAL CURRENCIES ARE
UNAVAILABLE TO FUND NEW LOANS.

               The Lenders shall be under no obligation to make the Revolving
Credit Loans requested by the Borrowers which are denominated in an Optional
Currency if any Lender notifies the Administrative Agent by 5:00 p.m.
(Pittsburgh time) four (4) Business Days prior to the Borrowing Date for such
Revolving Credit Loans that such Lender cannot provide its Revolving Credit
Ratable Share of such Revolving Credit Loans in such Optional Currency. In the
event the Administrative Agent timely receives a notice from a Lender pursuant
to the preceding sentence, the Administrative Agent will notify the Borrowers no
later than 12:00 noon (Pittsburgh time) three (3) Business Days prior to the
Borrowing Date for such Revolving Credit Loans that the Optional Currency is not
then available for such Revolving Credit Loans, and the Administrative Agent
shall promptly thereafter notify the Lenders of the same and the Lenders


                                       36



shall not make such Revolving Credit Loans requested by the Borrowers under
their Loan Request.

               2.9.3 NOTICES FROM LENDERS THAT OPTIONAL CURRENCIES ARE
UNAVAILABLE TO FUND RENEWALS OF THE EURO-RATE OPTION.

               If the Borrowers deliver a Loan Request requesting that the
Lenders renew the Euro-Rate Option with respect to an outstanding Borrowing
Tranche of Revolving Credit Loans denominated in an Optional Currency, the
Lenders shall be under no obligation to renew such Euro-Rate Option if any
Lender delivers to the Administrative Agent a notice by 5:00 p.m. (Pittsburgh
time) four (4) Business Days prior to the effective date of such renewal that
such Lender cannot continue to provide Revolving Credit Loans in such Optional
Currency. In the event the Administrative Agent timely receives a notice from a
Lender pursuant to the preceding sentence, the Administrative Agent will notify
the Borrowers no later than 12:00 noon (Pittsburgh time) three (3) Business Days
prior to the renewal date that the renewal of such Revolving Credit Loans in
such Optional Currency is not then available, and the Administrative Agent shall
promptly thereafter notify the Lenders of the same. If the Administrative Agent
shall have so notified the Borrowers that any such continuation of such
Revolving Credit Loans in such Optional Currency is not then available, any
notice of renewal with respect thereto shall be deemed withdrawn, and such Loans
shall be redenominated into Loans in Dollars at the Base Rate Option or
Euro-Rate Option, at the Company's option on behalf of the Borrowers (subject,
in the case of the Euro-Rate Option, to compliance with Section 2.4.), with
effect from the last day of the Interest Period with respect to any such Loans.
The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Borrowers and the Lenders of
any such redenomination, and in such notice, the Administrative Agent will state
the aggregate Dollar Equivalent amount of the redenominated Revolving Credit
Loans in an Optional Currency as of the applicable Computation Date with respect
thereto and such Lender's Revolving Credit Ratable Share thereof.

               2.9.4 EUROPEAN MONETARY UNION.

                    2.9.4.1 PAYMENTS IN EUROS UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES.

               If (i) any Optional Currency ceases to be lawful currency of the
nation issuing the same and is replaced by the Euro or (ii) any Optional
Currency and the Euro are at the same time recognized by any governmental
authority of the nation issuing such currency as lawful currency of such nation
and the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders shall so request in a
notice delivered to the Borrowers, then any amount payable hereunder by any
party hereto in such Optional Currency shall instead by payable in the Euro and
the amount so payable shall be determined by translating the amount payable in
such Optional Currency to the Euro at the exchange rate established by that
nation for the purpose of implementing the replacement of the relevant Optional
Currency by the Euro (and the provisions governing payments in Optional
Currencies in this Agreement shall apply to such payment in the Euro as if such
payment in the Euro were a payment in an Optional Currency). Prior to the
occurrence of the event or events described in clause (i) or (ii) of the
preceding sentence, each amount payable hereunder in any


                                       37



Optional Currency will, except as otherwise provided herein, continue to be
payable only in that currency.

                    2.9.4.2 ADDITIONAL COMPENSATION UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES.

               The Borrowers agree, at the request of any Lender, to compensate
such Lender for any loss, cost, expense or reduction in return that such Lender
shall reasonably determine shall be incurred or sustained by such Lender as a
result of the replacement of any Optional Currency by the Euro and that would
not have been incurred or sustained but for the transactions provided for
herein. A certificate of any Lender setting forth such Lender's determination of
the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender shall be delivered to
the Borrowers and shall be conclusive absent manifest error so long as such
determination is made on a reasonable basis. The Borrowers shall pay such Lender
the amount shown as due on any such certificate within ten (10) days after
receipt thereof.

               2.9.5 REQUESTS FOR ADDITIONAL OPTIONAL CURRENCIES.

               The Borrowers may deliver to the Administrative Agent a written
request that Revolving Credit Loans hereunder also be permitted to be made in
any other lawful currency (other than Dollars), in addition to the currencies
specified in the definition of "Optional Currency" herein provided that such
currency must be freely traded in the offshore interbank foreign exchange
markets, freely transferable, freely convertible into Dollars and available to
the Lenders in the Relevant Interbank Market. The Administrative Agent will
promptly notify the Lenders of any such request promptly after the
Administrative Agent receives such request. The Administrative Agent and each
Lender may grant or accept such request in their sole discretion. The
Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Borrowers of the acceptance or
rejection by the Administrative Agent and each of the Lenders of the Borrowers'
request. The requested currency shall be approved as an Optional Currency
hereunder only if the Administrative Agent and all of the Lenders approve of the
Borrowers' request.

          2.10 USE OF PROCEEDS.

               The proceeds of the Revolving Credit Loans shall be used for (i)
refinancing amounts outstanding under the Prior Senior Credit Facility, and (ii)
general corporate purposes, including financing working capital and Permitted
Acquisitions.

          2.11 LETTER OF CREDIT SUBFACILITY.

               2.11.1 ISSUANCE OF LETTERS OF CREDIT.

               The Borrowers may request the issuance of a letter of credit
(each such letter of credit and each Existing Letter of Credit, a "LETTER OF
CREDIT") on behalf of itself, another Loan Party or any of their respective
Subsidiaries (provided that a Loan Party shall be the obligor with respect
thereto) by delivering or having such other Loan Party deliver to the


                                       38



Administrative Agent a completed application and agreement for letters of credit
in such form as the Administrative Agent may specify from time to time by no
later than 10:00 a.m., Pittsburgh time, at least four (4) Business Days, or such
shorter period as may be agreed to by the Administrative Agent, in advance of
the proposed date of issuance. Each Letter of Credit shall be a Standby Letter
of Credit or Commercial Letter of Credit and may be denominated in either
Dollars or an Optional Currency. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof and
in reliance on the agreements of the other Lenders set forth in this Section
2.11, the Administrative Agent or any of the Administrative Agent's Affiliates
will issue a Letter of Credit provided that each Letter of Credit shall (A) have
a maximum maturity of twelve (12) months from the date of issuance, and (B) in
no event expire later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Expiration Date
and providing that in no event shall (i) the Dollar Equivalent amount of Letters
of Credit Outstanding exceed, at any one time, $20,000,000.00, or (ii) the
Dollar Equivalent Revolving Facility Usage exceed, at any one time, the
Revolving Credit Commitments. The Existing Letters of Credit shall be deemed to
have been issued hereunder.

               2.11.2 LETTER OF CREDIT FEES.

               The Borrowers shall pay in Dollars (i) to the Administrative
Agent for the ratable account of the Lenders a fee (the "LETTER OF CREDIT FEE")
equal to the Applicable Margin then in effect for Revolving Credit Loans subject
to the Euro-Rate Option, per annum, and (ii) to the Administrative Agent, for
its own account or the account of any applicable Issuing Lender, a fronting fee
equal to 0.125% per annum (each computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and
actual days elapsed), which fees shall be computed on the daily average Dollar
Equivalent amount of Letters of Credit Outstanding during the preceding fiscal
quarter (or shorter period commencing with the Closing Date or ending with the
Expiration Date) and shall be payable quarterly in arrears commencing with the
first day of each July, October, January and April following issuance of each
Letter of Credit and on the Expiration Date. The Borrowers shall also pay to the
Administrative Agent in Dollars for the Administrative Agent's sole account the
Administrative Agent's then in effect customary fees and administrative expenses
payable with respect to the Letters of Credit as the Administrative Agent may
generally charge or incur from time to time in connection with the issuance,
maintenance, modification (if any), assignment or transfer (if any),
negotiation, and administration of Letters of Credit.

               2.11.3 DISBURSEMENTS, REIMBURSEMENT.

                    2.11.3.1 Immediately upon the issuance of each Letter of
Credit (and with respect to the Existing Letters of Credit, on the Closing
Date), each Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the Administrative Agent a
participation in such Letter of Credit and each drawing thereunder in an amount
equal to such Lender's Revolving Credit Ratable Share of the maximum amount
available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit and the amount of such
drawing, respectively.

                    2.11.3.2 In the event of any request for a drawing under a
Letter of Credit by the beneficiary or transferee thereof, the Administrative
Agent will promptly notify the Borrowers. Provided that it shall have received
such notice, the Borrowers shall reimburse (such obligation to reimburse the
Administrative Agent, for its benefit or the benefit


                                       39



of a Lender who has issued an Existing Letter of Credit (an "ISSUING LENDER"),
as applicable, shall sometimes be referred to as a "REIMBURSEMENT OBLIGATION")
the Administrative Agent in Dollars prior to 12:00 noon, Pittsburgh time on each
date that an amount is paid by the Administrative Agent under any Letter of
Credit (each such date, a "DRAWING DATE") in an amount equal to the Dollar
Equivalent amount so paid by the Administrative Agent or the applicable Issuing
Lender. In the event the Borrowers fail to reimburse the Administrative Agent or
the applicable Issuing Lender for the full Dollar Equivalent amount of any
drawing under any Letter of Credit by 12:00 noon, Pittsburgh time, on the
Drawing Date, the Administrative Agent will promptly notify each Lender thereof,
and the Borrowers shall be deemed to have requested that Revolving Credit Loans
be made by the Lenders in Dollars under the Base Rate Option in an amount equal
to the Dollar Equivalent amount of such drawing to be disbursed on the Drawing
Date under such Letter of Credit, subject to the amount of the unutilized
portion of the Revolving Credit Commitment and subject to the conditions set
forth in Section 6.2 other than any notice requirements. Any notice given by the
Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 2.11.3.2 may be oral if
immediately confirmed in writing; provided that the lack of such an immediate
confirmation shall not affect the conclusiveness or binding effect of such
notice.

                    2.11.3.3 Each Lender shall upon any notice pursuant to
Section 2.11.3.2 make available to the Administrative Agent, for its benefit or
the benefit of the applicable Issuing Lender, an amount in Dollars in
immediately available funds equal to its Revolving Credit Ratable Share of the
Dollar Equivalent amount of the drawing (whether or not the conditions set forth
in Section 6.2 shall have been satisfied), whereupon the participating Lenders
shall (subject to Section 2.11.3.4) each be deemed to have made a Revolving
Credit Loan in Dollars under the Base Rate Option to the Borrowers in that
amount. If any Lender so notified fails to make available in Dollars to the
Administrative Agent for the account of the Administrative Agent or the
applicable Issuing Lender the amount of such Lender's Revolving Credit Ratable
Share of such Dollar Equivalent amount by no later than 2:00 p.m., Pittsburgh
time on the Drawing Date, then interest shall accrue on such Lender's obligation
to make such payment, from the Drawing Date to the date on which such Lender
makes such payment (i) at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Effective
Rate during the first three (3) days following the Drawing Date and (ii) at a
rate per annum equal to the rate applicable to Loans under the Base Rate Option
on and after the fourth day following the Drawing Date. The Administrative Agent
will promptly give notice of the occurrence of the Drawing Date, but failure of
the Administrative Agent to give any such notice on the Drawing Date or in
sufficient time to enable any Lender to effect such payment on such date shall
not relieve such Lender from its obligation under this Section 2.11.3.3.

                    2.11.3.4 With respect to any unreimbursed drawing that is
not converted into Revolving Credit Loans under the Base Rate Option to the
Borrowers in whole or in part as contemplated by Section 2.11.3.2, because of
the Borrowers' failure to satisfy the conditions set forth in Section 6.2 other
than any notice requirements or for any other reason, the Borrowers shall be
deemed to have incurred from the Administrative Agent or the applicable Issuing
Lender a borrowing (each a "LETTER OF CREDIT BORROWING") in Dollars in the
Dollar Equivalent amount of such drawing. Such Letter of Credit Borrowing shall
be due and payable


                                       40



on demand (together with interest) and shall bear interest at the rate per annum
applicable to the Revolving Credit Loans under the Base Rate Option. Each
Lender's payment to the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 2.11.3.3 shall
be deemed to be a payment in respect of its participation in such Letter of
Credit Borrowing and shall constitute a "PARTICIPATION ADVANCE" from such Lender
in satisfaction of its participation obligation under this Section 2.11.3.

               2.11.4 REPAYMENT OF PARTICIPATION ADVANCES.

                    2.11.4.1 Upon (and only upon) receipt by the Administrative
Agent or the applicable Issuing Lender for its account (as applicable) of
immediately available funds from the Borrowers (i) in payment of any Letter of
Credit Borrowing made by the Administrative Agent or the applicable Issuing
Lender under the Letter of Credit with respect to which any Lender has made a
Participation Advance to the Administrative Agent, or (ii) in payment of
interest on such a payment made by the Administrative Agent or the applicable
Issuing Lender under such a Letter of Credit, the Administrative Agent or the
applicable Issuing Lender will pay to each Lender, in the same funds as those
received by the Administrative Agent or the applicable Issuing Lender, the
amount of such Lender's Revolving Credit Ratable Share of such funds, except the
Administrative Agent or the applicable Issuing Lender shall retain the amount of
the Revolving Credit Ratable Share of such funds of any Lender that did not make
a Participation Advance in respect of such payment by Administrative Agent.

                    2.11.4.2 If the Administrative Agent or any Issuing Lender
is required at any time to return to any Loan Party, or to a trustee, receiver,
liquidator, custodian, or any official in any Insolvency Proceeding, any portion
of the payments made by any Loan Party to the Administrative Agent or such
Issuing Lender pursuant to Section 2.11.4.1 in reimbursement of a payment made
under the Letter of Credit or interest or fee thereon, each Lender shall, on
demand of the Administrative Agent, forthwith return to the Administrative
Agent, for its account or the account of such Issuing Lender (as applicable),
the amount of its Revolving Credit Ratable Share of any amounts so returned by
the Administrative Agent or such Issuing Lender (as applicable) plus interest
thereon from the date such demand is made to the date such amounts are returned
by such Lender to the Administrative Agent or such Issuing Lender, at a rate per
annum equal to the Federal Funds Effective Rate in effect from time to time.

               2.11.5 DOCUMENTATION.

               Each Loan Party agrees to be bound by the terms of the
Administrative Agent's and each Issuing Lender's application and agreement for
letters of credit and the Administrative Agent's and each Issuing Lender's
written regulations and customary practices relating to letters of credit,
though such interpretation may be different from such Loan Party's own. In the
event of a conflict between such application or agreement and this Agreement,
this Agreement shall govern. It is understood and agreed that, except in the
case of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct, the Administrative Agent
and each Issuing Lender shall not be liable for any error, negligence and/or
mistakes, whether of omission or commission, in


                                       41



following any Loan Party's instructions or those contained in the Letters of
Credit or any modifications, amendments or supplements thereto.

               2.11.6 DETERMINATIONS TO HONOR DRAWING REQUESTS.

               In determining whether to honor any request for drawing under any
Letter of Credit by the beneficiary thereof, the Administrative Agent and each
Issuing Lender shall be responsible only to determine that the documents and
certificates required to be delivered under such Letter of Credit have been
delivered and that they comply on their face with the requirements of such
Letter of Credit.

               2.11.7 NATURE OF PARTICIPATION AND REIMBURSEMENT OBLIGATIONS.

               Each Lender's obligation in accordance with this Agreement to
make the Revolving Credit Loans or Participation Advances, as contemplated by
Section 2.11.3, as a result of a drawing under a Letter of Credit, and the
Obligations of the Borrowers to reimburse the Administrative Agent or any
Issuing Lender (as applicable) upon a draw under a Letter of Credit, subject to
Section 10.18 for the avoidance of doubt (if applicable), shall be absolute,
unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance
with the terms of this Section 2.11 under all circumstances, including the
following circumstances:

comply, in connection with a Letter of Credit Borrowing, with the conditions set
forth in Sections 2.1, 2.4, 2.5 or 6.2 or as otherwise set forth in this
Agreement for the making of a Revolving Credit Loan, it being acknowledged that
such conditions are not required for the making of a Letter of Credit Borrowing
and the obligation of the Lenders to make Participation Advances under Section
2.11.3;

                    (iii) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter
of Credit;

                    (iv) any claim of breach of warranty that might be made by
any Loan Party or any Lender against any beneficiary of a Letter of Credit, or
the existence of any claim, set-off, recoupment, counterclaim, crossclaim,
defense or other right which any Loan Party or any Lender may have at any time
against a beneficiary, successor beneficiary any transferee or assignee of any
Letter of Credit or the proceeds thereof (or any Persons for whom any such
transferee may be acting), the Administrative Agent or its Affiliates, any
Issuing Lender or its Affiliates, or any Lender or any other Person or, whether
in connection with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated herein or any
unrelated transaction (including any underlying transaction between any Loan
Party or Subsidiaries of a Loan Party and the beneficiary for which any Letter
of Credit was procured);


                                       42



                    (v) the lack of power or authority of any signer of (or any

connection with any Letter of Credit, or any fraud or alleged fraud in
connection with any Letter of Credit, or the transport of any property or

Administrative Agent or any of the Administrative Agent's Affiliates or any
Issuing Lender or any of an Issuing Lender's Affiliates has been notified
thereof;

                    (vi) payment by the Administrative Agent or any of its
Affiliates or any Issuing Lender or any of its Affiliates under any Letter of
Credit against presentation of a demand, draft or certificate or other document
which does not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit;

                    (vii) the solvency of, or any acts of omissions by, any
beneficiary of any Letter of Credit, or any other Person having a role in any

Administrative Agent's Affiliates or any Issuing Lender or any of an Issuing
Lender's Affiliates to issue any Letter of Credit in substantially the form
requested by any Loan Party, unless the Administrative Agent or such Issuing
Lender (as applicable) has received written notice from such Loan Party of such
failure within three Business Days after the Administrative Agent or such
Issuing Lender (as applicable) shall have furnished such Loan Party a copy of
such Letter of Credit and such error is material and no drawing has been made
thereon prior to receipt of such notice;

                    (ix) any adverse change in the business, operations,

by any party thereto;

                    (xi) the occurrence or continuance of an Insolvency
Proceeding with respect to any Loan Party;

                    (xii) the fact that an Event of Default or a Potential
Default shall have occurred and be continuing;

                    (xiii) the fact that the Expiration Date shall have passed

                                       43



               2.11.8 INDEMNITY.

               In addition to amounts payable as provided in Section 9.5, the
Borrowers hereby agree (subject to Section 10.18 for the avoidance of doubt, if
applicable) to protect, indemnify, pay and save harmless the Administrative
Agent and any of Administrative Agent's Affiliates and each Issuing Lender and
any of the Issuing Lenders' respective Affiliates (collectively, the "LETTER OF
CREDIT PARTIES"), that has issued a Letter of Credit from and against any and
all claims, demands, liabilities, damages, taxes, penalties, interest,
judgments, losses, costs, charges and expenses (including reasonable fees,
expenses and disbursements of counsel and allocated costs of internal counsel)
which any of the Letter of Credit Parties may incur or be subject to as a
consequence, direct or indirect, of the issuance of any Letter of Credit, other
than as a sole result of (i) the gross negligence or willful misconduct of any
of the Letter of Credit Parties as determined by a final judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction or (ii) the wrongful dishonor by any of the Letter of
Credit Parties of a proper demand for payment made under any Letter of Credit,
except if such dishonor resulted from any act or omission, whether rightful or
wrongful, of any present or future de jure or de facto government or
governmental authority (all such acts or omissions herein called "GOVERNMENTAL
ACTS").

               2.11.9 LIABILITY FOR ACTS AND OMISSIONS.

               As between any Loan Party and the Administrative Agent, or the
Administrative Agent's Affiliates, and between any Loan Party and an Issuing
Lender, or such Issuing Lender's Affiliates, such Loan Party assumes all risks
of the acts and omissions of, or misuse of the Letters of Credit by, the
respective beneficiaries of such Letters of Credit. In furtherance and not in
limitation of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent and each Issuing Lender
shall not be responsible for any of the following including any losses or
damages to any Loan Party or other Person or property relating therefrom: (i)
the form, validity, sufficiency, accuracy, genuineness or legal effect of any
document submitted by any party in connection with the application for an
issuance of any such Letter of Credit, even if it should in fact prove to be in
any or all respects invalid, insufficient, inaccurate, fraudulent or forged
(even if the Administrative Agent or the Administrative Agent's Affiliates, or
the applicable Issuing Lender or such Issuing Lender's Affiliates, shall have
been notified thereof); (ii) the validity or sufficiency of any instrument
transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign any such Letter of
Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in
part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason; (iii) the
failure of the beneficiary of any such Letter of Credit, or any other party to
which such Letter of Credit may be transferred, to comply fully with any
conditions required in order to draw upon such Letter of Credit or any other
claim of any Loan Party against any beneficiary of such Letter of Credit, or any
such transferee, or any dispute between or among any Loan Party and any
beneficiary of any Letter of Credit or any such transferee; (iv) errors,
omissions, interruptions or delays in transmission or delivery of any messages,
by mail, cable, telegraph, telex or otherwise, whether or not they be in cipher;
(v) errors in interpretation of technical terms; (vi) any loss or delay in the
transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to make a drawing
under any such Letter of Credit or of the proceeds thereof; (vii) the
misapplication by the beneficiary of any such Letter of Credit of the proceeds
of any drawing under such Letter of Credit; or (viii) any consequences arising


                                       44



from causes beyond the control of the Administrative Agent or the Administrative
Agent's Affiliates, or the applicable Issuing Lender or such Issuing Lender's
Affiliates, as applicable, including any Governmental Acts, and none of the
above shall affect or impair, or prevent the vesting of, any of the
Administrative Agent's or the Administrative Agent's Affiliates, or the
applicable Issuing Lender or such Issuing Lender's Affiliates, rights or powers
hereunder. Nothing in the preceding sentence shall relieve the Administrative
Agent or any Issuing Lender from liability for the Administrative Agent's or
such Issuing Lender's gross negligence or willful misconduct in connection with
actions or omissions described in such clauses (i) through (viii) of such
sentence. In no event shall the Administrative Agent or the Administrative
Agent's Affiliates, or the applicable Issuing Lender or such Issuing Lender's
Affiliates, be liable to any Loan Party for any indirect, consequential,
incidental, punitive, exemplary or special damages or expenses (including
without limitation attorneys' fees), or for any damages resulting from any
change in the value of any property relating to a Letter of Credit.

               Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Administrative Agent, each Issuing Lender and each of their respective
Affiliates (i) may rely on any oral or other communication believed in good
faith by the Administrative Agent, such Issuing Lender or such Affiliate to have
been authorized or given by or on behalf of the applicant for a Letter of
Credit, (ii) may honor any presentation if the documents presented appear on
their face substantially to comply with the terms and conditions of the relevant
Letter of Credit; (iii) may honor a previously dishonored presentation under a
Letter of Credit, whether such dishonor was pursuant to a court order, to settle
or compromise any claim of wrongful dishonor, or otherwise, and shall be
entitled to reimbursement to the same extent as if such presentation had
initially been honored, together with any interest paid by the Administrative
Agent, such Issuing Lender or such Affiliate; (iv) may honor any drawing that is
payable upon presentation of a statement advising negotiation or payment, upon
receipt of such statement (even if such statement indicates that a draft or
other document is being delivered separately), and shall not be liable for any
failure of any such draft or other document to arrive, or to conform in any way
with the relevant Letter of Credit; (v) may pay any paying or negotiating bank
claiming that it rightfully honored under the laws or practices of the place
where such bank is located; and (vi) may settle or adjust any claim or demand
made on the Administrative Agent, such Issuing Lender or such Affiliate in any
way related to any order issued at the applicant's request to an air carrier, a
letter of guarantee or of indemnity issued to a carrier or any similar document
(each an "ORDER") and honor any drawing in connection with any Letter of Credit
that is the subject to such Order, notwithstanding that any drafts or other
documents presented in connection with such Letter of Credit fail to conform in
any way with such Letter of Credit.

               In furtherance and extension and not in limitation of the
specific provisions set forth above, any action taken or omitted by the
Administrative Agent or the Administrative Agent's Affiliates, or the applicable
Issuing Lender or such Issuing Lender's Affiliates, under or in connection with
the Letters of Credit issued by it or any documents and certificates delivered
thereunder, if taken or omitted in good faith, shall not put the Administrative
Agent or the Administrative Agent's Affiliates, or the applicable Issuing Lender
or such Issuing Lender's Affiliates, under any resulting liability to the
Borrowers or any Lender.


                                       45



          2.12 CURRENCY REPAYMENTS.

               Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the
entire amount of principal of and interest on any Revolving Credit Loan made in
an Optional Currency shall be repaid in the same Optional Currency in which such
Loan was made, provided, however, that if it is impossible or illegal for the
Borrowers to effect payment of a Revolving Credit Loan in the Optional Currency
in which such Loan was made, or if the Borrowers default in their obligations to
do so, the Required Lenders may at their option permit such payment to be made
(i) at and to a different location, subsidiary, affiliate or correspondent of
Administrative Agent, (ii) in the Equivalent Amount of Dollars or (iii) in an
Equivalent Amount of such other currency (freely convertible into Dollars) as
the Required Lenders may solely at their option designate. Upon any events
described in (i) through (iii) of the preceding sentence, the Borrowers shall
make such payment, and the Borrowers agree to hold each Lender harmless from and
against any loss incurred by any Lender arising from the cost to such Lender of
any premium, any costs of exchange, the cost of hedging and covering the
Optional Currency in which such Loan was originally made, and from any change in
the value of Dollars, or such other currency, in relation to the Optional
Currency that was due and owing. Such loss shall be calculated for the period
commencing with the first day of the Interest Period for such Loan and
continuing through the date of payment thereof. Without prejudice to the
survival of any other agreement of the Borrowers hereunder, the Borrowers'
obligations under this Section 2.12 shall survive termination of this Agreement.

          2.13 OPTIONAL CURRENCY AMOUNTS.

               Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the
Administrative Agent may, with respect to notices by the Borrowers for Revolving
Credit Loans in an Optional Currency or voluntary prepayments of less than the
full amount of an Optional Currency Borrowing Tranche, engage in reasonable
rounding of the Optional Currency amounts requested to be loaned or repaid; and,
in such event, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrowers and
the Lenders of such rounded amounts and the Borrowers' request or notice shall
thereby be deemed to reflect such rounded amounts.

          2.14 REDUCTION OF COMMITMENT.

               The Company, on behalf of all Borrowers, shall have the right at
any time and from time to time upon five (5) Business Days' prior written notice
to the Administrative Agent to permanently reduce, in whole multiples of
$5,000,000 of principal, or terminate the Revolving Credit Commitments without
penalty or premium, except as hereinafter set forth, provided that any such
reduction or termination shall be accompanied by (a) the payment in full of any
Commitment Fee then accrued on the amount of such reduction or termination and
(b) prepayment of the Revolving Credit Notes, together with the full amount of
interest accrued on the principal sum to be prepaid (and all amounts referred to
in Section 4.6 hereof), to the extent that the Dollar Equivalent Revolving
Facility Usage then outstanding exceeds the Revolving Credit Commitments as so
reduced or terminated. From the effective date of any such reduction or
termination the obligations of the Borrowers to pay the Commitment Fee pursuant
to Section 2.3 shall correspondingly be reduced or cease.


                                       46



                                3. INTEREST RATES

          3.1 INTEREST RATE OPTIONS.

               The Borrowers shall pay interest in respect of the outstanding
unpaid principal amount of the Loans as selected by it from the Base Rate Option
or Euro-Rate Option set forth below applicable to the Loans, it being understood
that, subject to the provisions of this Agreement, the Borrowers may select
different Interest Rate Options and different Interest Periods to apply
simultaneously to the Loans comprising different Borrowing Tranches and may
convert to or renew one or more Interest Rate Options with respect to all or any
portion of the Loans comprising any Borrowing Tranche, provided that there shall
not be at any one time outstanding more than eight (8) Borrowing Tranches in the
aggregate among all of the Loans. If at any time the designated rate applicable
to any Loan made by any Lender exceeds such Lender's highest lawful rate, the
rate of interest on such Lender's Loan shall be limited to such Lender's highest
lawful rate. Interest on the principal amount of each Loan made in an Optional
Currency shall be paid by the Borrowers in such Optional Currency. Swing Loans
shall bear interest at a rate to be agreed upon by the Administrative Agent and
the Company, on behalf of all Borrowers.

               3.1.1 INTEREST RATE OPTIONS.

               The Borrowers shall have the right to select from the following
Interest Rate Options applicable to the Loans (subject to the provisions above
regarding Swing Loans), except that no Loan to which a Base Rate shall apply may
be made in an Optional Currency:

                    (i) Base Rate Option. A fluctuating rate per annum (computed
on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and actual days
elapsed) equal to the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin, such interest rate
to change automatically from time to time effective as of the effective date of
each change in the Base Rate; or

                    (ii) Euro-Rate Option. A rate per annum (computed on the
basis of a year of 360 days, as the case may be, and actual days elapsed),
provided that, for Revolving Credit Loans made in an Optional Currency for which
a 365-day basis is the only market practice available to the Administrative
Agent, such rate shall be calculated on the basis of a year of 365 days for the
actual days elapsed) equal to the Euro-Rate plus the Applicable Margin.

               3.1.2 RATE QUOTATIONS.

               The Borrowers may call the Administrative Agent on or before the
date on which a Loan Request is to be delivered to receive an indication of the
interest rates and the applicable currency exchange rates then in effect, but it
is acknowledged that such projection shall not be binding on the Administrative
Agent or the Lenders nor affect the rate of interest or


                                       47



the calculation of Equivalent Amounts which thereafter are actually in effect
when the election is made.

          3.2 INTEREST PERIODS.

               At any time when the Borrowers shall select, convert to or renew
a Euro-Rate Option, the Borrowers shall notify the Administrative Agent thereof
by delivering a Loan Request at least four (4) Business Days prior to the
effective date of such Interest Rate Option, with respect to an Optional
Currency Loan, and three (3) Business Days prior to the effective date of such
Interest Rate Option, with respect to a Loan denominated in Dollars. The notice
shall specify an Interest Period during which such Interest Rate Option shall
apply. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the following provisions shall
apply to any selection of, renewal of, or conversion to a Euro-Rate Option:

               3.2.1 AMOUNT OF BORROWING TRANCHE.

               The Dollar Equivalent amount of each Borrowing Tranche of
Euro-Rate Loans shall be in integral multiples of $100,000.00 and not less than
$2,000,000.00; and

               3.2.2 RENEWALS.

               In the case of the renewal of a Euro-Rate Option at the end of an
Interest Period, the first day of the new Interest Period shall be the last day
of the preceding Interest Period, without duplication in payment of interest for
such day.

          3.3 INTEREST AFTER DEFAULT.

               To the extent permitted by Law, upon the occurrence of an Event
of Default and until such time such Event of Default shall have been cured or
waived:

               3.3.1 LETTER OF CREDIT FEES, INTEREST RATE.

               The Letter of Credit Fees and the rate of interest for each Loan
otherwise applicable pursuant to Section 2.11.2 or Section 3.1, respectively,
shall at the request of the Administrative Agent be increased, by 2.0% per
annum; and

               3.3.2 OTHER OBLIGATIONS.

               Each other Obligation hereunder if not paid when due shall at the
request of the Administrative Agent bear interest at a rate per annum equal to
the sum of the rate of interest applicable under the Base Rate Option plus an
additional 2.0% per annum from the time such Obligation becomes due and payable
and until it is paid in full.

               3.3.3 ACKNOWLEDGMENT.

               The Borrowers acknowledges that the increase in rates referred to
in this Section 3.3 reflects, among other things, the fact that such Loans or
other amounts have become


                                       48



a substantially greater risk given their default status and that the Lenders are
entitled to additional compensation for such risk; and all such interest shall
be payable by the Borrowers upon demand by the Administrative Agent.

          3.4 EURO-RATE UNASCERTAINABLE; ILLEGALITY; INCREASED COSTS; DEPOSITS
NOT AVAILABLE.

               3.4.1 UNASCERTAINABLE.

               If on any date on which a Euro-Rate would otherwise be
determined, the Administrative Agent shall have determined that:

                    (i) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for
ascertaining such Euro-Rate, or

                    (ii) a contingency has occurred affecting the interbank
eurodollar market relating to the Euro-Rate and reasonable and adequate means do
not exist for ascertaining the Euro-Rate for such Interest Period, the
Administrative Agent and Borrowers shall have the rights specified in Sections
3.4.3 and 4.4.2 (as applicable).

               3.4.2 ILLEGALITY; INCREASED COSTS; DEPOSITS NOT AVAILABLE.

               If at any time any Lender shall have determined that:

                    (i) the making, maintenance or funding of any Loan to which
a Euro-Rate Option applies has been made impracticable or unlawful by compliance
by such Lender in good faith with any Law or any interpretation or application
thereof by any Official Body or with any request or directive of any such
Official Body (whether or not having the force of Law), or

                    (ii) such Euro-Rate Option will not adequately and fairly
reflect the cost to such Lender of the establishment or maintenance of any such
Loan, or

                    (iii) after making all reasonable efforts, deposits of the
relevant amount in Dollars or in the Optional Currency (as applicable) for the
relevant Interest Period for a Loan, or to banks generally, to which a Euro-Rate
Option applies, respectively, are not available to such Lender with respect to
such Loan, or to banks generally, in the interbank eurodollar market, then the
Administrative Agent and Borrowers shall have the rights specified in Sections
3.4.3 and 4.4.2 (as applicable).

               3.4.3 ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT'S AND LENDER'S RIGHTS.

               In the case of any event specified in Section 3.4.1 above, the
Administrative Agent shall promptly so notify the Lenders and the Borrowers
thereof, and in the case of an event specified in Section 3.4.2 above, such
Lender shall promptly so notify the Administrative Agent and endorse a
certificate to such notice as to the specific circumstances of such notice, and
the Administrative Agent shall promptly send copies of such notice and


                                       49



certificate to the other Lenders and the Borrowers. Upon such date as shall be
specified in such notice (which shall not be earlier than the date such notice
is given), the obligation of (A) the Lenders, in the case of such notice given
by the Administrative Agent, or (B) such Lender, in the case of such notice
given by such Lender, to allow the Borrowers to select, convert to or renew a
Euro-Rate Option or select an Optional Currency (as applicable) shall be
suspended until the Administrative Agent shall have later notified the
Borrowers, or such Lender shall have later notified the Administrative Agent, of
the Administrative Agent's or such Lender's, as the case may be, determination
that the circumstances giving rise to such previous determination no longer
exist. If at any time the Administrative Agent makes a determination under
Section 3.4.1 and the Borrowers have previously notified the Administrative
Agent of its selection of, conversion to or renewal of a Euro-Rate Option and
such Interest Rate Option has not yet gone into effect, such notification shall
be deemed to provide for selection of, conversion to or renewal of the Base Rate
Option otherwise available with respect to such Loans. If any Lender notifies
the Administrative Agent of a determination under Section 3.4.2, the Borrowers
shall, subject to the Borrowers' indemnification Obligations under Section
4.6.2, as to any Loan of the Lender to which a Euro-Rate Option applies, on the
date specified in such notice either (i) as applicable, convert such Loan to the
Base Rate Option otherwise available with respect to such Loan or select a
different Optional Currency or Dollars, or (ii) prepay such Loan in accordance
with Section 4.4. Absent due notice from the Borrowers of conversion or
prepayment, such Loan shall automatically be converted to the Base Rate Option
otherwise available with respect to such Loan upon such specified date.

          3.5 SELECTION OF INTEREST RATE OPTIONS.

               If the Borrowers fail to select a new Interest Period or Optional
Currency to apply to any Borrowing Tranche of Loans under the Euro-Rate Option
at the expiration of an existing Interest Period applicable to such Borrowing
Tranche in accordance with the provisions of Section 3.2, the Borrowers shall be
deemed to have converted or continued, as applicable, such Borrowing Tranche of
Loans under the Euro-Rate Option for an Interest Period of one (1) month and, if
required by the Administrative Agent, converted such Borrowing Tranche to a Loan
in Dollars, as applicable, commencing upon the last day of the existing Interest
Period.

          3.6 CANADIAN INTEREST ACT DISCLOSURE.

               For the purposes of the Interest Act (Canada) and disclosure
thereunder, whenever any interest or any fee to be paid hereunder or in
connection herewith is to be calculated on the basis of a 360-day or 365-day
year, the yearly rate of interest to which the rate used in such calculation is
equivalent is the rate so used multiplied by the actual number of days in the
calendar year in which the same is to be ascertained and divided by 360 or 365,
as applicable. The rates of interest under this Agreement are nominal rates, and
not effective rates or yields. The principle of deemed reinvestment of interest
does not apply to any interest calculation under this Agreement.

          3.7 CANADIAN USURY PROVISION.


                                       50



               If any provision of this Agreement would oblige a Canadian
Borrower to make any payment of interest or other amount payable to any Lender
in an amount or calculated at a rate which would be prohibited by law or would
result in a receipt by that Lender of "interest" at a "criminal rate" (as such
terms are construed under the Criminal Code (Canada)), then, notwithstanding
such provision, such amount or rate shall be deemed to have been adjusted with
retroactive effect to the maximum amount or rate of interest, as the case may
be, as would not be so prohibited by applicable law or so result in a receipt by
that Lender of "interest" at a "criminal rate", such adjustment to be effected,
to the extent necessary (but only to the extent necessary), as follows:

     (i) first, by reducing the amount or rate of interest; and

     (ii) thereafter, by reducing any fees, commissions, costs, expenses,
premiums and other amounts required to be paid which would constitute interest
for purposes of section 347 of the Criminal Code (Canada).

                                   4. PAYMENTS

          4.1 PAYMENTS.

               All payments and prepayments to be made in respect of principal,
interest, Commitment Fees, Letter of Credit Fees, Administrative Agent's Fee or
other fees or amounts due from the Borrowers hereunder shall be payable prior to
11:00 a.m., Pittsburgh time, on the date when due without presentment, demand,
protest or notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by the
Borrowers, and without set-off, counterclaim or other deduction of any nature,
and an action therefor shall immediately accrue. Such payments shall be made to
the Administrative Agent at the Principal Office for the account of PNC Bank
with respect to the Swing Loans and for the ratable accounts of the Lenders with
respect to the Revolving Loans in Dollars except that payments of principal or
interest shall be made in the currency in which such Loan was made, and in
immediately available funds, and the Administrative Agent shall promptly
distribute such amounts to the Lenders in immediately available funds, provided
that in the event payments are received by 11:00 a.m., Pittsburgh time, by the
Administrative Agent with respect to the Loans and such payments are not
distributed to the Lenders on the same day received by the Administrative Agent,
the Administrative Agent shall pay the Lenders the Federal Funds Effective Rate
in the case of Loans or other amounts due in Dollars, or the Overnight Rate in
the case of Loans or other amounts due in an Optional Currency, with respect to
the amount of such payments for each day held by the Administrative Agent and
not distributed to the Lenders. The Administrative Agent's and each Lender's
statement of account, ledger or other relevant record shall, in the absence of
manifest error, be conclusive as the statement of the amount of principal of and
interest on the Loans and other amounts owing under this Agreement (including
the Equivalent Amounts of the applicable currencies where such computations are
required) and shall be deemed an "account stated."


                                       51



          4.2 PRO RATA TREATMENT OF LENDERS.

               Each borrowing of Revolving Credit Loans shall be allocated to
each Lender according to its Revolving Credit Ratable Share, and each selection
of, conversion to or renewal of any Interest Rate Option and each payment or
prepayment by the Borrowers with respect to principal, interest, Commitment
Fees, Letter of Credit Fees, or other fees (except for the Administrative
Agent's Fee and the fronting fee for Letters of Credit referred to in Section
2.11.2(ii)) or amounts due from the Borrowers hereunder to the Lenders with
respect to the Loans, shall (except as provided in Section 3.4.3 in the case of
an event specified in Sections 3.4, 4.4.2 or 4.6) be made in proportion to the
applicable Loans outstanding from each Lender and, if no such Loans are then
outstanding, in proportion to the Revolving Credit Ratable Share, as applicable
of each Lender. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, each borrowing or payment
or prepayment by the Borrowers of principal, interest, fees or other amounts
from the Borrowers with respect to Swing Loans shall be made by or to PNC Bank.

          4.3 INTEREST PAYMENT DATES.

               Interest on Loans to which the Base Rate Option applies shall be
due and payable in arrears on the first day of each July, October, January and
April after the date hereof and on the Expiration Date or upon acceleration of
the Notes. Interest on Loans to which the Euro-Rate Option applies shall be due
and payable in the currency in which such Loan was made on the last day of each
Interest Period for those Loans and, if such Interest Period is longer than
three (3) Months, also on the 90th day of such Interest Period. Interest on
mandatory prepayments of principal under Section 4.5 shall be made in the
currency in which such Loan was made and shall be due on the date such mandatory
prepayment is due. Interest on the principal amount of each Loan or other
monetary Obligation shall be due and payable in the currency in which such Loan
was made on demand after such principal amount or other monetary Obligation
becomes due and payable (whether on the stated maturity date, upon acceleration
or otherwise).

          4.4 VOLUNTARY PREPAYMENTS.

               4.4.1 RIGHT TO PREPAY.

               The Borrowers shall have the right, at their option, from time to
time to prepay the Loans in whole or part without premium or penalty (except as
provided in Section 4.4.2 below or in Section 4.6) in the currency in which such
Loan was made:

                    (i) at any time with respect to any Loan to which the Base
Rate Option applies,

                    (ii) at any time with respect to any Loan in any Optional
Currency, subject to Section 4.6.2,

                    (iii) at any time with respect to Loans to which a Euro-Rate
Option applies, subject to Section 4.6.2, or


                                       52



                    (iv) on the date specified in a notice by any Lender
pursuant to Section 3.4 with respect to any Loan to which a Euro-Rate Option
applies.

               Whenever the Borrowers desire to prepay any part of the Loans,
the Company, on behalf of all Borrowers, shall provide a prepayment notice to
the Administrative Agent by 1:00 p.m. Pittsburgh time: (i) at least one (1)
Business Day prior to the date of prepayment of the Revolving Credit Loans made
in Dollars and (ii) at least four (4) Business Days prior to the date of
prepayment of any Loans in an Optional Currency, and (iii) on the date of
prepayment of Swing Loans, in each case setting forth the following information:

               (x) the date, which shall be a Business Day, on which the
          proposed prepayment is to be made;

               (y) the Borrowing Tranche designated for prepayment, if
          applicable; and

               (z) the total principal amount and currency of such prepayment,
          the Dollar Equivalent amount of which shall not be less than
          $500,000.00 for any Swing Loan or $1,000,000.00 for any Revolving
          Credit Loan or such lesser amount as may be outstanding.

               All prepayment notices shall be irrevocable. The principal amount
of the Loans for which a prepayment notice is given, together with interest on
such principal amount except with respect to Loans to which the Base Rate Option
applies, shall be due and payable on the date specified in such prepayment
notice as the date on which the proposed prepayment is to be made in the
currency in which such Loans was made. Except as provided in Section 3.4.3, if
the Borrowers prepay a Loan but fails to specify the applicable Borrowing
Tranche which the Borrowers are prepaying, the prepayment shall be applied first
to Loans to which the Base Rate Option applies, then to Loans to which the
Euro-Rate Option applies, and then to Optional Currency Loans. Any prepayment
hereunder shall be subject to the Borrowers' Obligation to indemnify the Lenders
under Section 4.6.2. Revolving Credit Loan prepayments shall not result in an
reduction of the Revolving Credit Commitments unless the Borrowers have elected
to reduce such Revolving Credit Commitments pursuant to Section 2.14.

               4.4.2 REPLACEMENT OF A LENDER.

               In the event any Lender (any such Lender, a "DEFAULTING LENDER")
(i) gives notice under Section 2.9, 3.4 or 4.6.1, (ii) does not fund Revolving
Credit Loans or otherwise fails to pay over to the Administrative Agent or any
other Lender any other amount required to be paid by it hereunder within one
Business Day of the date when due (unless the subject of a good faith dispute or
unless such failure has been cured and all interest accruing as a result of such
failure has been fully paid in accordance with the terms hereof), (iii) becomes
subject to the control of an Official Body (other than normal and customary
supervision), deemed insolvent by an Official Body or the subject of a
bankruptcy, receivership, conservatorship or insolvency proceeding, or (iv)
becomes a Non-Consenting Lender pursuant to Section 10.1, then the Borrowers
shall have the right at its option to prepay the Loans of such


                                       53



Lender in whole, together with all interest accrued thereon, and terminate such
Lender's Commitment within ninety (90) days after (x) receipt of such Lender's
notice under Section 2.9, 3.4 or 4.6.1, (y) the date such Lender has failed to
fund Revolving Credit Loans or otherwise failed to pay over to the
Administrative Agent or any other Lender any other amount required to be paid by
it hereunder within one Business Day of the date when due as contemplated in
clause (ii) above, or (z) the date such Lender became subject to the control of
an Official Body or any other event contemplated in clause (iii) or (iv) above
occurs, as applicable; provided that the Borrowers shall also pay to such Lender
at the time of such prepayment any amounts required under Section 4.6 and any
accrued interest due on such amount and any related fees (except if a Lender is
a Defaulting Lender as a result of the operation of clause (ii) or (iii) above,
in which event such Lender shall be entitled to receive accrued interest only
and not entitled to receive payment of any fees); provided, however, that the
Revolving Credit Commitment of such Lender shall be provided by one or more of
the remaining Lenders or a replacement financial institution acceptable to the
Administrative Agent; provided, further, the remaining Lenders shall have no
obligation hereunder to increase their Commitments. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Administrative Agent may only be replaced subject to the
requirements of Section 9.14 and provided that all Letters of Credit have
expired or been terminated or replaced.

               4.4.3 CHANGE OF LENDING OFFICE.

               Each Lender agrees that upon the occurrence of any event giving
rise to increased costs or other special payments under Section 3.4.2 or 4.6.1
with respect to such Lender, it will if requested by the Borrowers, use
reasonable efforts (subject to overall policy considerations of such Lender) to
designate another Lending Office for any Loans or Letters of Credit affected by
such event, provided that such designation is made on such terms that such
Lender and its Lending Office suffer no economic, legal or regulatory
disadvantage, with the object of avoiding the consequence of the event giving
rise to the operation of such Section. Nothing in this Section 4.4.3 shall
affect or postpone any of the Obligations of the Borrowers or any other Loan
Party or the rights of the Administrative Agent or any Lender provided in this
Agreement.

          4.5 MANDATORY PREPAYMENTS.

               4.5.1 CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS.

               If on any Computation Date the sum of the Dollar Equivalent
Revolving Facility Usage is greater than the Revolving Credit Commitments as a
result of a change in exchange rates between one (1) or more Optional Currencies
and Dollars, then the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrowers of the
same. The Borrowers shall pay or prepay the Revolving Credit Loans (subject to
Borrowers' indemnity obligations contained in this Agreement, including, without
limitation, under Section 4.6.2) or Swing Loans within three (3) Business Days
after receiving such notice such that the sum of the Dollar Equivalent Revolving
Facility Usage no longer exceeds the aggregate Revolving Credit Commitments.


                                       54



               4.5.2 APPLICATION AMONG INTEREST RATE OPTIONS.

               All prepayments required pursuant to this Section 4.5 shall first
be applied among the Interest Rate Options to the principal amount of the
applicable Loans subject to the Base Rate Option, then to Dollar Loans
denominated in Dollars and subject to a Euro-Rate Option and then to Loans of
Optional Currencies subject to the Euro-Rate Option, and the Borrowers will be
subject to the indemnity obligation set forth in Section 4.6.2.

          4.6 ADDITIONAL COMPENSATION IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES.

               4.6.1 INCREASED COSTS OR REDUCED RETURN RESULTING FROM TAXES,
RESERVES, CAPITAL ADEQUACY REQUIREMENTS, EXPENSES, ETC.

               If any change in any Law or guideline or in any interpretation or
application thereof by any Official Body charged with the interpretation or
administration thereof or compliance with any request or directive (whether or
not having the force of Law) of any central bank or other Official Body:

                    (i) imposes, modifies or deems applicable any reserve,
special deposit or similar requirement against credits or commitments to extend
credit extended by, or assets (funded or contingent) of, deposits with or for
the account of, or other acquisitions of funds by, any Lender or any Lending
Office of any Lender, or

                    (ii) imposes, modifies or deems applicable any capital
adequacy or similar requirement (A) against assets (funded or contingent) of, or
letters of credit, other credits or commitments to extend credit extended by,
any Lender, or (B) otherwise applicable to the obligations of any Lender or any
Lending Office of any Lender under this Agreement,

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to, reduce the
income receivable by, or impose any expense (including loss of margin) upon any
Lender or its Lending Office with respect to this Agreement, the Notes or the
making, maintenance or funding of any part of the Loans (or, in the case of any
capital adequacy or similar requirement, to have the effect of reducing the rate
of return on any Lender's capital, taking into consideration such Lender's
customary policies with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount which such
Lender in its sole discretion deems to be material, such Lender shall from time
to time notify the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent of the amount
determined in good faith (using any averaging and attribution methods employed
in good faith) by such Lender to be necessary to compensate such Lender for such
increase in cost, reduction of income, additional expense or reduced rate of
return. Such notice shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis for such
determination. Such amount shall be due and payable by the Borrowers to such
Lender ten (10) Business Days after such notice is given.


                                       55



               4.6.2 INDEMNITY.

               In addition to the compensation required by Section 4.6.1, the
Borrowers shall indemnify each Lender against all liabilities, losses or
expenses (including loss of margin, any loss or expense incurred in liquidating
or employing deposits from third parties and any loss or expense incurred in
connection with funds acquired by a Lender to fund or maintain Loans subject to
a Euro-Rate Option) which such Lender sustains or incurs as a consequence of
any:

                    (i) payment, prepayment, conversion or renewal of any Loan
to which a Euro-Rate Option applies on a day other than the last day of the
corresponding Interest Period (whether or not such payment or prepayment is
mandatory, voluntary or automatic and whether or not such payment or prepayment
is then due),

                    (ii) attempt by the Borrowers to revoke (expressly, by later
inconsistent notices or otherwise) in whole or part any Loan Requests under
Section 2.4 or Section 3.2 or notice relating to prepayments under Section 4.4,
or

                    (iii) default by the Borrowers in the performance or
observance of any covenant or condition contained in this Agreement or any other
Loan Document, including any failure of the Borrowers to pay when due (by
acceleration or otherwise) any principal, interest, Commitment Fee or any other
amount due hereunder.

               If any Lender sustains or incurs any such loss or expense, it
shall from time to time notify the Borrowers of the amount determined in good
faith by such Lender (which determination may include such assumptions,
allocations of costs and expenses and averaging or attribution methods as such
Lender shall deem reasonable) to be necessary to indemnify such Lender for such
loss or expense. Such notice shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis for
such determination. Such amount shall be due and payable by the Borrowers to
such Lender ten (10) Business Days after such notice is given.

          4.7 INTERBANK MARKET PRESUMPTION.

               For all purposes of this Agreement and each Note with respect to
any aspects of the Euro-Rate, any Loan under the Euro-Rate Option or any
Optional Currency, each Lender and Administrative Agent shall be presumed to
have obtained rates, funding, currencies, deposits, and the like in the Relevant
Interbank Market regardless of whether it did so or not; and, each Lender's and
Administrative Agent's determination of amounts payable under, and actions
required or authorized by, Section 4.6.2 shall be calculated, at each Lender's
and Administrative Agent's option, as though each Lender and Administrative
Agent funded each Borrowing Tranche of Loans under the Euro-Rate Option through
the purchase of deposits of the types and maturities corresponding to the
deposits used as a reference in accordance with the terms hereof in determining
the Euro-Rate applicable to such Loans, whether in fact that is the case.


                                       56



          4.8 TAXES.

               4.8.1 NO DEDUCTIONS.

               All payments made to the Lenders and/or Administrative Agent by
the Borrowers hereunder and under each Note shall be made free and clear of and
without deduction for any present or future taxes, levies, imposts, deductions,
charges, or withholdings, and all liabilities with respect thereto, excluding
taxes imposed on the net income of any Lender and all income and franchise taxes
that would not have been imposed but for such Lender having a past or present
connection with a jurisdiction imposing such taxes other than entering into this
Agreement and performing its obligations and enforcing its rights thereunder(all
such non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges, withholdings, and
liabilities being hereinafter referred to as "TAXES") unless such deduction is
required by Law (and then subject to the following sentence). If the Borrowers
shall be required by Law to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum
payable hereunder or under any Note, (i) the sum payable under such Note shall
be increased as may be necessary so that after making all required deductions
(including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section
4.8.1) each Lender receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received
had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Borrowers shall make such deductions
and (iii) the Borrowers shall timely pay the full amount deducted to the
relevant tax authority or other authority in accordance with applicable Law.

               4.8.2 STAMP TAXES.

               In addition, the Borrowers agree to pay any present or future
stamp or documentary taxes or any other excise or property taxes or similar
levies which arise from any payment made hereunder or from the execution,
delivery, or registration of, or otherwise with respect to, this Agreement or
any Note (hereinafter referred to as "OTHER TAXES").

               4.8.3 INDEMNIFICATION FOR TAXES PAID BY A LENDER.

               The Borrowers shall indemnify each Lender for the full amount of
Taxes or Other Taxes (including, without limitation, any Taxes or Other Taxes
imposed by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section 4.8.3) paid by
any Lender and any liability (including penalties, interest, and expenses)
arising therefrom or with respect thereto. This indemnification shall be made
within 30 days from the date a Lender makes written demand therefor, but in no
event shall such indemnification be required to be made more than ten (10)
Business Days before the date such Taxes or Other Taxes are due to the relevant
taxing authority.

               4.8.4 CERTIFICATE.

               Within 30 days after the date of any payment of any Taxes by the
Borrowers pursuant to Section 4.8, the Borrowers shall notify the Lenders
thereof, and thereafter, if so requested by any Lender, furnish to each Lender,
at its address referred to herein, the original or a certified copy of a receipt
evidencing payment thereof, if available, or, if not


                                       57



available, another reasonable form of confirmation of such payment if it is
requested by any Lender.

               4.8.5 EXCLUSIONS, ETC.

               Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if the
forms provided pursuant to Section 10.17 by a Lender, assignee or participant at
the time such Person first becomes a party to this Agreement indicate a United
States interest withholding tax rate in excess of zero, withholding tax at such
rate shall be considered excluded from Taxes unless and until such Person
provides the appropriate forms certifying that a lesser rate applies, whereupon
withholding tax at such lesser rate only shall be considered excluded from Taxes
for periods governed by such forms; provided, however, that the term Taxes shall
include United States withholding tax, if any, applicable with respect to an
assignee or participant of a Lender only to the extent that, at the effective
date of the agreement or other transaction pursuant to which such assignee or
participant becomes a party to this Agreement, such Lender was entitled to
payments under Section 4.8.1 in respect of United States withholding tax with
respect to interest paid at such date. For any period with respect to which a
Lender or assignee or participant of a Lender (or a financial institution
through which such Lender, assignee or participant has directed any payment to
be made) has failed to comply with Section 10.17, such Lender, assignee or
participant shall not be entitled to indemnification under this Section 4.8 with
respect to any Taxes imposed by reason of such failure.

               4.8.6 CHANGE OF LENDING OFFICE, ETC.

               Any Person claiming any additional amounts payable pursuant to
this Section 4.8 agrees to use reasonable efforts (consistent with any legal and
regulatory restrictions) to file any document or certificate reasonably
requested by a Borrower or change the jurisdiction of its Lending Office with
respect to this Agreement, if the filing of such document or certificate, or the
making of such a change, would avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, any
such additional amounts pursuant to this Section 4.8 that may thereafter accrue.

               4.8.7 SURVIVAL.

               Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of the
Borrowers hereunder, the agreements and obligations of the Borrowers contained
in Sections 4.8.1 through 4.8.4 shall survive the payment in full of principal
and interest hereunder and under any instrument delivered hereunder.

          4.9 JUDGMENT CURRENCY.

               4.9.1 CURRENCY CONVERSION PROCEDURES FOR JUDGMENTS.

               If for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court it is
necessary to convert a sum due hereunder or under a Note in any currency (the
"ORIGINAL CURRENCY") into another currency (the "OTHER CURRENCY"), the parties
hereby agree, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, that the rate of exchange
used shall be that at which in accordance with


                                       58



normal banking procedures each Lender could purchase the Original Currency with
the Other Currency after any premium and costs of exchange on the Business Day
preceding that on which final judgment is given.

               4.9.2 INDEMNITY IN CERTAIN EVENTS.

               The obligation of the Borrowers in respect of any sum due from
the Borrowers to any Lender hereunder shall, notwithstanding any judgment in an
Other Currency, whether pursuant to a judgment or otherwise, be discharged only
to the extent that, on the Business Day following receipt by any Lender of any
sum adjudged to be so due in such Other Currency, such Lender may in accordance
with normal banking procedures purchase the Original Currency with such Other
Currency. If the amount of the Original Currency so purchased is less than the
sum originally due to such Lender in the Original Currency, the Borrowers agree,
as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment or payment, to
indemnify such Lender against such loss. If the amount of the Original Currency
so purchased is greater than the sum originally due to such Lender in the
Original Currency, such Lender agrees to return the amount of any excess to the
Borrowers (or to any other Person who may be entitled thereto under applicable
Law).

          4.10 NOTES.

               Upon the request of any Lender, the Loans made by such Lender may
be evidenced by a Note (or Notes).

          4.11 SETTLEMENT DATE PROCEDURES.

               In order to minimize the transfer of funds between the Lenders
and the Administrative Agent, the Borrowers may borrow, repay and reborrow Swing
Loans and PNC Bank may make Swing Loans as provided in Section 2.4.2 hereof
during the period between Settlement Dates. Not later than 11:00 a.m.,
Pittsburgh time, on any Settlement Date, the Administrative Agent shall notify
each Lender of its Ratable Share of the total of the Revolving Credit Loans and
the Swing Loans (each a "REQUIRED SHARE") as of such date. Prior to 1:00 p.m.,
Pittsburgh time, on such Settlement Date, each Lender shall pay to the
Administrative Agent the amount equal to the difference between its Required
Share and its Revolving Credit Loans, and the Administrative Agent shall pay to
each Lender its Ratable Share of all payments made by the Borrowers to the
Administrative Agent with respect to the Revolving Credit Loans. The
Administrative Agent may at its option effect settlement on any Business Day.
These settlement procedures are established solely as a matter of administrative
convenience, and nothing contained in this Section 4.11 shall relieve the
Lenders of their obligations to fund Revolving Credit Loans on dates other than
a Settlement Date. The Administrative Agent may, at any time at its option, for
any reason whatsoever require each Lender to pay immediately to the
Administrative Agent such Lender's Ratable Share of the outstanding Revolving
Credit Loans and, each Lender may at any time require the Administrative Agent
to pay immediately to such Lender its Ratable Share of all payments made by the
Borrowers to the Administrative Agent with respect to the Revolving Credit
Loans.


                                       59



          4.12 BORROWERS' AGENT.

               Each Borrower hereby designates the Company as its representative
and agent (in such capacity, the "BORROWER AGENT") under the Loan Documents,
including for requests for Loans and Letters of Credit, designation of interest
rates, delivery or receipt of communications, preparation and delivery of
financial reports, and requests for waivers. The Borrower Agent hereby accepts
such appointment. The Administrative Agent and the Lenders may give any notice
or communication with a Borrower hereunder to the Borrower Agent on behalf of
such Borrower. Each Borrower agrees that any notice, election, communication,
representation, agreement or undertaking made on its behalf by the Borrower
Agent shall be binding upon and enforceable against it.

                        5. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

          5.1 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.

               The Loan Parties, jointly and severally, represent and warrant to
the Administrative Agent and each of the Lenders as follows:

               5.1.1 ORGANIZATION AND QUALIFICATION.

               Each Loan Party and each Subsidiary of each Loan Party is a
corporation, partnership or limited liability company duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
organization. Each Loan Party and each Subsidiary of each Loan Party has the
power to own or lease its properties necessary for its business and to engage in
the business it presently conducts or as of the Closing Date proposes to
conduct. Each Loan Party and each Subsidiary of each Loan Party is duly licensed
or qualified and in good standing in each domestic jurisdiction listed on
SCHEDULE 5.1.1 as of the Closing Date or, if applicable, such later date as to
which a version of such Schedule is updated in accordance with Section 5.3, and
in all other jurisdictions where the property owned or leased by it or the
nature of the business transacted by it or both makes such licensing or
qualification necessary except where the failure to do so would result in a
Material Adverse Change.

               5.1.2 SUBSIDIARIES.

               SCHEDULE 5.1.2 states as of the Closing Date or, if applicable,
such later date as to which a version of such Schedule is updated in accordance
with Section 5.3, the name of each of the Company's Subsidiaries, its
jurisdiction of incorporation, its authorized capital stock, the issued and
outstanding shares (referred to herein as the "SUBSIDIARY SHARES") and the
owners thereof if it is a corporation, its outstanding partnership interests
(the "PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS") if it is a partnership and its outstanding limited
liability company interests, interests assigned to managers thereof and the
voting rights associated therewith (the "LLC INTERESTS") if it is a limited
liability company. The Borrowers and each Subsidiary of the Borrowers have good
and marketable title to all of the Subsidiary Shares, Partnership Interests and
LLC Interests it purports to own, free and clear, in each case, of any Lien
except for Permitted Liens which attach to the assets of such Person generally.
All Subsidiary Shares, Partnership Interests and


                                       60



LLC Interests have been validly issued, and all Subsidiary Shares are fully paid
and nonassessable. All capital contributions and other consideration required to
be made or paid in connection with the issuance of the Partnership Interests and
LLC Interests have been made or paid, as the case may be. There are no options,
warrants or other rights outstanding to purchase any such Subsidiary Shares,
Partnership Interests or LLC Interests except as indicated as of the Closing
Date on SCHEDULE 5.1.2 or, if applicable, such later date as to which a version
of such Schedule is updated in accordance with Section 5.3. As of the Closing
Date each of the Material Subsidiaries of the Company is either a Borrower or a
Guarantor.

               5.1.3 POWER AND AUTHORITY.

               Each Loan Party has full power to enter into, execute, deliver
and carry out this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which it is a
party, to incur the Indebtedness contemplated by the Loan Documents and to
perform its Obligations under the Loan Documents to which it is a party, and all
such actions have been duly authorized by all necessary proceedings on its part.

               5.1.4 VALIDITY AND BINDING EFFECT.

               This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered
by each Loan Party, and each other Loan Document which any Loan Party is
required to execute and deliver on or after the date hereof will have been duly
executed and delivered by such Loan Party on the required date of delivery of
such Loan Document. This Agreement and each other Loan Document constitutes, or
will constitute, legal, valid and binding obligations of each Loan Party which
is or will be a party thereto on and after its date of delivery thereof,
enforceable against such Loan Party in accordance with its terms, except to the
extent that enforceability of any of such Loan Document may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium or other
similar laws affecting the enforceability of creditors' rights generally,
general principles of equity (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding
in equity or at law) or limiting the right of specific performance.

               5.1.5 NO CONFLICT.

               Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the other
Loan Documents by any Loan Party nor the consummation of the transactions herein
or therein contemplated or compliance with the terms and provisions hereof or
thereof by any of them will conflict with, constitute a default under or result
in any breach of (i) the terms and conditions of the certificate of
incorporation, bylaws, certificate of limited partnership, partnership
agreement, certificate of formation, limited liability company agreement or
other organizational documents of such Loan Party, (ii) any applicable Law, in
any material respect, or (iii) any agreement or instrument relating to
Indebtedness which would result in a Material Adverse Change or any other
material agreement or instrument or material order, writ, judgment, injunction
or decree to which such Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by
which it or any of its Subsidiaries is bound or to which it is subject, or
result in the creation or enforcement of any Lien, charge or encumbrance
whatsoever upon any property (now or hereafter acquired) of such


                                       61



Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries (other than Liens, if any, granted under
the Loan Documents and Permitted Liens).

               5.1.6 LITIGATION.

               Except as disclosed as of the Closing Date on SCHEDULE 5.1.6 or,
if applicable, such later date as to which a version of such Schedule is updated
in accordance with Section 5.3, there are no actions, suits, proceedings or
investigations pending or, to the knowledge of any Loan Party, overtly
threatened against any Loan Party or any Subsidiary of such Loan Party at law or
equity before any Official Body which individually or in the aggregate would
result in any Material Adverse Change. None of the Loan Parties or any
Subsidiaries of any Loan Party is in violation of any order, writ, injunction or
any decree of any Official Body which would result in any Material Adverse
Change.

               5.1.7 TITLE TO PROPERTIES.

               Each Loan Party and each Subsidiary of each Loan Party has good
and marketable title to or valid leasehold interest in all properties, assets
and other rights which it purports to own or lease or which are reflected as
owned or leased on its books and records, free and clear of all Liens and
encumbrances except Permitted Liens, and subject to the terms and conditions of
the applicable leases.

               5.1.8 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

                    5.1.8.1 HISTORICAL STATEMENTS.

                    The Company has delivered to the Administrative Agent copies
of its audited consolidated year-end financial statements for and as of December
31, 2007, 2008 and 2009 (collectively, "HISTORICAL STATEMENTS"). The Historical
Statements were compiled from the books and records maintained by the Borrowers'
management, are correct and complete in all material respects and fairly
represent the consolidated financial condition of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of their dates and the results of operations for the fiscal
periods then ended and have been prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently
applied.

                    5.1.8.2 ACCURACY OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

                    As of the Closing Date, neither the Borrowers nor any
Subsidiary of the Borrowers have any material liabilities that are not disclosed
in the Historical Statements or in the notes thereto which would cause a
Material Adverse Change. Since December 31, 2009, no Material Adverse Change has
occurred.


                                       62



               5.1.9 USE OF PROCEEDS; MARGIN STOCK.

                    5.1.9.1 GENERAL.

                    The Loan Parties intend to use Letters of Credit and the
proceeds of the Loans in accordance with Section 2.10.

                    5.1.9.2 MARGIN STOCK.

                    None of the Loan Parties or their Subsidiaries engages or
intends to engage principally, or as one of its important activities, in the
business of extending credit for the purpose, immediately, incidentally or
ultimately, of purchasing or carrying margin stock (within the meaning of
Regulation U, T or X as promulgated by the Board of Governors of the United
States Federal Reserve System). No part of the proceeds of any Loan has been or
will be used, immediately, incidentally or ultimately, to purchase or carry any
margin stock or to extend credit to others for the purpose of purchasing or
carrying any margin stock or which is inconsistent with the provisions of the
regulations of the Board of Governors of the United States Federal Reserve
System. Following application of the proceeds of each Loan or drawing under each
Letter of Credit (if applicable), none of the Loan Parties or their Subsidiaries
holds or intends to hold margin stock in such amounts that more than 25% of the
reasonable value of the assets of the Loan Parties and their Subsidiaries on a
consolidated basis are or will be represented by margin stock.

               5.1.10 FULL DISCLOSURE.

               Neither this Agreement nor any other Loan Document, nor any
certificate, statement, agreement or other documents furnished in writing to the
Administrative Agent or any Lender in connection herewith or therewith, contains
any material misstatement of fact or omits to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements contained herein and therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not materially misleading; provided
that with respect to projected financial information or any information
concerning future proposed and intended activities of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, the Loan Parties represent only that such information was prepared
in good faith based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable at the time (it
being understood that such projections and information are forward looking
statements which by their nature are subject to significant uncertainties and
contingencies, many of which are beyond the Loan Parties' control, and that
actual results may differ, perhaps materially, from those expressed or implied
in such forward looking statements, and no assurance can be given that the
projections will be realized).

               5.1.11 TAXES.

               All federal income tax returns and all other material federal,

          8.2 CONSEQUENCES OF EVENT OF DEFAULT.

               8.2.1 EVENTS OF DEFAULT OTHER THAN BANKRUPTCY, INSOLVENCY OR
REORGANIZATION PROCEEDINGS.

               If an Event of Default specified under Sections 8.1.1 through
8.1.13 shall occur and be continuing, the Lenders and the Administrative Agent
shall be under no further obligation to make Loans or issue Letters of Credit,
as the case may be, and the Administrative Agent may, and upon the request of
the Required Lenders, shall (i) by written notice to the Borrowers, declare the
unpaid principal amount of the Notes then outstanding and all interest accrued
thereon, any unpaid fees and all other Indebtedness and Obligations of the
Borrowers to the Lenders hereunder and thereunder to be forthwith due and
payable, and the same shall (subject to Section 10.18 for the avoidance of
doubt, if applicable) thereupon become and be immediately due and payable to the
Administrative Agent for the benefit of each Lender without presentment, demand,
protest or any other notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly
waived, and (ii) require any Borrowers to, and such Borrowers shall thereupon,
deposit in a non-interest-bearing account with the Administrative Agent, as cash
collateral for Borrowers' Obligations under the Loan Documents, an amount equal
to the maximum amount currently or at any time thereafter available to be drawn
on all outstanding Letters of Credit, and each Borrower hereby pledges to the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders, and grants to the Administrative Agent and
the Lenders a security interest in, all such cash as security for such
Obligations. Upon the curing of all existing Events of Default to the
satisfaction of the Required Lenders, the Administrative Agent shall return such
cash collateral to the Borrowers (or applicable Borrowers, as the case may be);
and

               8.2.2 BANKRUPTCY, INSOLVENCY OR REORGANIZATION PROCEEDINGS.

               If an Event of Default specified under Sections 8.1.14 or 8.1.15
shall occur, the Lenders shall be under no further obligations to make Loans or
issue Letters of Credit hereunder and the unpaid principal amount of the Loans
then outstanding and all interest accrued thereon, any unpaid fees and all other
Indebtedness and Obligations of the Borrowers to the Lenders hereunder and
thereunder shall be immediately due and payable, without presentment, demand,
protest or notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived; and

               8.2.3 SET-OFF.

               If an Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, any Lender
to whom any Obligation is owed by any Loan Party hereunder or under any other
Loan Document or any participant of such Lender which has agreed in writing to
be bound by the provisions of Section 9.13 and any branch, Subsidiary or
Affiliate of such Lender or participant anywhere in the world shall have the
right, in addition to all other rights and remedies available to it, without
notice to such Loan Party except as provided herein, to set-off (subject to
Section 10.18 for the avoidance of doubt, if applicable) against and apply to
the then unpaid balance of all the Loans and all other Obligations of the
Borrowers and the other Loan Parties hereunder or under any other Loan Document
any debt owing to, and any other funds held in any manner for the account of, a
Borrower or such other Loan Party by such Lender or participant or by such
branch,


                                       96



Subsidiary or Affiliate, including all funds in all deposit accounts (whether
time or demand, general or special, provisionally credited or finally credited,
or otherwise) now or hereafter maintained by a Borrower or such other Loan Party
for its own account (but not including funds held in custodian or trust
accounts) with such Lender or participant or such branch, Subsidiary or
Affiliate, and each Lender and the Administrative Agent agrees to promptly
notify the Borrowers after such set-off, provided that the failure to give any
such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application. Such
right shall exist whether or not any Lender or the Administrative Agent shall
have made any demand under this Agreement or any other Loan Document, whether or
not such debt owing to or funds held for the account of a Borrower or such other
Loan Party is or are matured or unmatured and regardless of the existence or
adequacy of any collateral, Guaranty or any other security, right or remedy
available to any Lender or the Administrative Agent; and

               8.2.4 SUITS, ACTIONS, PROCEEDINGS.

               If an Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, and whether
or not the Administrative Agent shall have accelerated the maturity of
Obligations pursuant to any of the foregoing provisions of this Section 8.2, the
Administrative Agent, on behalf of the Lenders, if any Lender is owed any amount
with respect to the Obligations, may proceed to protect and enforce the Lenders'
rights by suit in equity, action at law and/or other appropriate proceeding,
whether for the specific performance of any covenant or agreement contained in
this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, including as permitted by applicable
Law the obtaining of the ex parte appointment of a receiver, and, if such amount
shall have become due, by declaration or otherwise, proceed to enforce the
payment thereof or any other legal or equitable right of the Administrative
Agent, on behalf of the Lenders; and

               8.2.5 APPLICATION OF PROCEEDS.

               From and after the date on which the Administrative Agent has
taken any action pursuant to this Section 8.2 and until all Obligations of the
Loan Parties have been paid in full, any and all proceeds received by the
Administrative Agent from the exercise of any remedy by the Administrative
Agent, shall be applied as follows:

                    (i) first, to reimburse the Administrative Agent and the
Lenders for out-of-pocket costs, expenses and disbursements, including
reasonable attorneys' and paralegals' fees and legal expenses, incurred by the
Administrative Agent or the Lenders in connection with collection of any
Obligations of any of the Loan Parties under any of the Loan Documents;

                    (ii) second, to the repayment of all Obligations then due
and unpaid of the Loan Parties to the Lenders incurred under this Agreement or
any of the other Loan Documents or a Lender-Provided Interest Rate Hedge,
whether of principal, interest, fees, expenses or otherwise, in such manner as
the Administrative Agent may determine in its discretion; and


                                       97



                    (iii) the balance, if any, to the Loan Parties or as
otherwise required by Law.

                                  9. THE AGENT

          9.1 APPOINTMENT.

               Each Lender hereby irrevocably designates, appoints and
authorizes PNC Bank to act as Administrative Agent for such Lender under this
Agreement and to execute and deliver or accept on behalf of each of the Lenders
the other Loan Documents. Each Lender hereby irrevocably authorizes, and each
holder of any Note by the acceptance of a Note shall be deemed irrevocably to
authorize, the Administrative Agent to take such action on its behalf under the
provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and any other
instruments and agreements referred to herein, and to exercise such powers and
to perform such duties hereunder as are specifically delegated to or required of
the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof, together with such powers as are
reasonably incidental thereto. PNC Bank agrees to act as the Administrative
Agent on behalf of the Lenders to the extent provided in this Agreement.

          9.2 DELEGATION OF DUTIES.

               The Administrative Agent may perform any of its duties hereunder
by or through agents or employees (provided such delegation does not constitute
a relinquishment of its duties as Administrative Agent) and, subject to Sections
9.5 and 9.6, shall be entitled to engage and pay for the advice or services of
any attorneys, accountants or other experts concerning all matters pertaining to
its duties hereunder and to rely upon any advice so obtained.

          9.3 NATURE OF DUTIES; INDEPENDENT CREDIT INVESTIGATION.

               The Administrative Agent shall have no duties or responsibilities
except those expressly set forth in this Agreement and no implied covenants,
functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations, or liabilities shall be read
into this Agreement or otherwise exist. The duties of the Administrative Agent
shall be mechanical and administrative in nature; the Administrative Agent shall
not have, by reason of this Agreement, a fiduciary or trust relationship in
respect of any Lender; and nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, is
intended to or shall be so construed as to impose upon the Administrative Agent
any obligations in respect of this Agreement except as expressly set forth
herein. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the use of the term
"agent" in this Agreement with reference to the Administrative Agent is not
intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations
arising under agency doctrine of any applicable Law. Instead, such term is used
merely as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only
an administrative relationship between independent contracting parties. Each
Lender expressly acknowledges (i) that the Administrative Agent has not made any
representations or warranties to it and that no act by the Administrative Agent
hereafter taken, including any review of the affairs of any of the Loan Parties,
shall be deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by the
Administrative Agent to any Lender; (ii) that it has made and will continue to
make, without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, its own


                                       98



independent investigation of the financial condition and affairs and its own
appraisal of the creditworthiness of each of the Loan Parties in connection with
this Agreement and the making and continuance of the Loans and issuance and
maintenance of Letters of Credit hereunder; and (iii) except as expressly
provided herein, that the Administrative Agent shall have no duty or
responsibility, either initially or on a continuing basis, to provide any Lender
with any credit or other information with respect thereto, whether coming into
its possession before the making of any Loan or issuance of any Letter of Credit
or at any time or times thereafter.

          9.4 ACTIONS IN DISCRETION OF ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT; INSTRUCTIONS FROM
THE LENDERS.

               The Administrative Agent agrees, upon the written request of the
Required Lenders, to take or refrain from taking any action of the type
specified as being within the Administrative Agent's rights, powers or
discretion herein, provided that the Administrative Agent shall not be required
to take any action which exposes the Administrative Agent to personal liability
or which is contrary to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or applicable
Law. In the absence of a request by the Required Lenders, the Administrative
Agent shall have authority, in its sole discretion, to take or not to take any
such action, unless this Agreement specifically requires the consent of the
Required Lenders or all of the Lenders. Any action taken or failure to act
pursuant to such instructions or discretion shall be binding on the Lenders,
subject to Section 9.6. Subject to the provisions of Section 9.6, no Lender
shall have any right of action whatsoever against the Administrative Agent as a
result of the Administrative Agent acting or refraining from acting hereunder in
accordance with the instructions of the Required Lenders, or in the absence of
such instructions, in the absolute discretion of the Administrative Agent.

          9.5 REIMBURSEMENT AND INDEMNIFICATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT BY THE
BORROWER.

               The Borrowers, on a joint and several basis (subject to Section
10.18 for the avoidance of doubt, if applicable), unconditionally agree to pay
or reimburse the Administrative Agent and hold the Administrative Agent harmless
against (a) liability for the payment of all reasonable out-of-pocket costs,
expenses and disbursements, including fees and expenses of counsel (including
the allocated costs of staff counsel), appraisers and environmental consultants,
incurred by the Administrative Agent (i) in connection with the development,
negotiation, preparation, printing, execution, administration, syndication,
interpretation and performance of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents,
(ii) relating to any requested amendments, waivers or consents pursuant to the
provisions hereof, (iii) in connection with the enforcement of this Agreement or
any other Loan Document or collection of amounts due hereunder or thereunder or
the proof and allowability of any claim arising under this Agreement or any
other Loan Document, whether in bankruptcy or receivership proceedings or
otherwise, and (iv) in any workout or restructuring or in connection with the
protection, preservation, exercise or enforcement of any of the terms hereof or
of any rights hereunder or under any other Loan Document or in connection with
any foreclosure, collection or bankruptcy proceedings, and (b) all liabilities,
obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments,


                                       99



suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever which
may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent, in
its capacity as such, in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or
any other Loan Documents or any action taken or omitted by the Administrative
Agent hereunder or thereunder, provided that the Borrowers shall not be liable
for any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties,
actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements if the same results
from the Administrative Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct, or if
the Borrowers was not given notice of the subject claim and the opportunity to
participate in the defense thereof, at its expense (except that the Borrowers
shall remain liable to the extent such failure to give notice does not result in
a loss to the Borrower), or if the same results from a compromise or settlement
agreement entered into without the consent of the Borrowers, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld. In addition, the Borrowers, jointly and severally, agrees
to reimburse and pay all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative
Agent's regular employees and agents engaged periodically to perform audits of
the Loan Parties' books, records and business properties, provided that such
reimbursement obligation shall be limited to one (1) audit in each fiscal year
so long as no Event of Default exists and is continuing.

          9.6 EXCULPATORY PROVISIONS; LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

               Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its directors,
officers, employees, agents, attorneys or Affiliates shall (a) be liable to any
Lender for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it or them hereunder, or
in connection herewith including pursuant to any Loan Document, unless caused by
its or their own gross negligence or willful misconduct, (b) be responsible in
any manner to any of the Lenders for the effectiveness, enforceability,
genuineness, validity or the due execution of this Agreement or any other Loan
Documents or for any recital, representation, warranty, document, certificate,
report or statement herein or made or furnished under or in connection with this
Agreement or any other Loan Documents, or (c) be under any obligation to any of
the Lenders to ascertain or to inquire as to the performance or observance of
any of the terms, covenants or conditions hereof or thereof on the part of the
Loan Parties, or the financial condition of the Loan Parties, or the existence
or possible existence of any Event of Default or Potential Default. No claim may
be made by any of the Loan Parties, any Lender, the Administrative Agent or any
of their respective Subsidiaries against the Administrative Agent, any Lender or
any of their respective directors, officers, employees, agents, attorneys or
Affiliates, or any of them, for any special, indirect or consequential damages
or, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, for any punitive damages in respect
of any claim or cause of action (whether based on contract, tort, statutory
liability, or any other ground) based on, arising out of or related to any Loan
Document or the transactions contemplated hereby or any act, omission or event
occurring in connection therewith, including the negotiation, documentation,
administration or collection of the Loans, and each of the Loan Parties (for
itself and on behalf of each of its Subsidiaries), the Administrative Agent and
each Lender hereby waives, releases and agrees never to xxx upon any claim for
any such damages, whether such claim now exists or hereafter arises and whether
or not it is now known or suspected to exist in its favor. Each Lender agrees
that, except for notices, reports and other documents expressly required to be
furnished to the Lenders by the Administrative Agent hereunder or given to the
Administrative Agent for the account of or with copies for the Lenders, the
Administrative Agent


                                      100



and each of its directors, officers, employees, agents, attorneys or Affiliates
shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with an credit
or other information concerning the business, operations, property, condition
(financial or otherwise), prospects or creditworthiness of the Loan Parties
which may come into the possession of the Administrative Agent or any of its
directors, officers, employees, agents, attorneys or Affiliates.

          9.7 REIMBURSEMENT AND INDEMNIFICATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT BY
LENDERS.

               Each Lender agrees to reimburse and indemnify the Administrative
Agent (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrowers and without limiting the
Obligation of the Borrowers to do so) in proportion to its Ratable Share from
and against all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions,
judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements, including attorneys' fees
and disbursements (including the allocated costs of staff counsel), and costs of
appraisers and environmental consultants, of any kind or nature whatsoever which
may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent, in
its capacity as such, in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or
any other Loan Documents or any action taken or omitted by the Administrative
Agent hereunder or thereunder, provided that no Lender shall be liable for any
portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions,
judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements (a) if the same results from
the Administrative Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct, or (b) if
such Lender was not given notice of the subject claim and the opportunity to
participate in the defense thereof, at its expense (except that such Lender
shall remain liable to the extent such failure to give notice does not result in
a loss to the Lender), or (c) if the same results from a compromise and
settlement agreement entered into without the consent of such Lender, which
shall not be unreasonably withheld. In addition, each Lender agrees promptly
upon demand to reimburse the Administrative Agent (to the extent not reimbursed
by the Borrowers and without limiting the Obligation of the Borrowers to do so)
in proportion to its Ratable Share for all amounts due and payable by the
Borrowers to the Administrative Agent in connection with the Administrative
Agent's periodic audit of the Loan Parties' books, records and business
properties.

          9.8 RELIANCE BY ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT.

               The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon any
writing, telegram, telex or teletype message, resolution, notice, consent,
certificate, letter, cablegram, statement, order or other document or
conversation by telephone or otherwise believed by it to be genuine and correct
and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons, and upon
the advice and opinions of counsel and other professional advisers selected by
the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall be fully justified in
failing or refusing to take any action hereunder unless it shall first be
indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability and
expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take
any such action.


                                      101



          9.9 NOTICE OF DEFAULT.

               The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or
notice of the occurrence of any Potential Default or Event of Default unless the
Administrative Agent has received written notice from a Lender or a Borrower
referring to this Agreement, describing such Potential Default or Event of
Default and stating that such notice is a "notice of default."

          9.10 NOTICES.

               The Administrative Agent shall promptly send to each Lender a
copy of all notices received from a Borrower pursuant to the provisions of this
Agreement or the other Loan Documents promptly upon receipt thereof.

          9.11 LENDERS IN THEIR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITIES; ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT IN
ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY.

               With respect to its Revolving Credit Commitment, the Revolving
Credit Loans, and PNC Bank's Swing Loan Commitment, the Swing Loans made by it
and any other rights and powers given to it as a Lender hereunder or under any
of the other Loan Documents, the Administrative Agent shall have the same rights
and powers hereunder as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it
were not the Administrative Agent, and the term "LENDER" and "LENDERS" shall,
unless the context otherwise indicates, include the Administrative Agent in its
individual capacity. PNC Bank and its Affiliates and each of the Lenders and
their respective Affiliates may, without liability to account, except as
prohibited herein, make loans to, issue letters of credit for the account of,
acquire equity interests in, accept deposits from, discount drafts for, act as
trustee under indentures of, and generally engage in any kind of banking, trust,
financial advisory, underwriting or other business with, the Loan Parties and
their Affiliates, as though it were not acting as Administrative Agent hereunder
and in the case of each Lender, as though such Lender were not a Lender
hereunder, without notice to or consent of the other Lenders. The Lenders and
the Administrative Agent acknowledge that, pursuant to such activities, the
Administrative Agent or its Affiliates, and the Lenders or their Affiliates, may
(i) receive information regarding the Loan Parties or any of their Subsidiaries
or Affiliates (including information that may be subject to confidentiality
obligations in favor of the Loan Parties or such Subsidiary or Affiliate) and
acknowledge that neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall be under
any obligation to provide such information to the others, and (ii) accept fees
and other consideration from the Loan Parties for services in connection with
this Agreement and otherwise without having to account for the same to the
Lenders.

          9.12 HOLDERS OF NOTES.

               The Administrative Agent may deem and treat any payee of any Note
as the owner thereof for all purposes hereof unless and until written notice of
the assignment or transfer thereof shall have been filed with the Administrative
Agent. Any request, authority or consent of any Person who at the time of making
such request or giving such authority or


                                      102



consent is the holder of any Note shall be conclusive and binding on any
subsequent holder, transferee or assignee of such Note or of any Note or Notes
issued in exchange therefor.

          9.13 SHARING OF PAYMENTS.

               The Lenders and the holders of any participations in any
Commitments, Loans, Letters of Credit or other rights or obligations of a Lender
hereunder agree among themselves that, with respect to all amounts received by
any Lender or any such holder for application on any Obligation hereunder or
under any such participation, whether received by voluntary payment, by
realization upon security, by the exercise of the right of set-off or banker's
lien, by counterclaim or by any other non-pro rata source, equitable adjustment
will be made in the manner stated in the following sentence so that, in effect,
all such excess amounts will be shared ratably among the Lenders and such
holders in proportion to their interests in payments on the Obligations, except
as otherwise provided in Sections 3.4.3, 4.4.2 or 4.6, in connection with any
assignment pursuant to Section 10.11 or as otherwise specifically set forth
herein. The Lenders or any such holder receiving any such amount shall purchase
for cash from each of the other Lenders an interest in Obligations owed to such
Lender in such amount as shall result in a ratable participation by the Lenders
and each such holder in the aggregate unpaid amount of the Obligations, provided
that if all or any portion of such excess amount is thereafter recovered from
the Lender or the holder making such purchase, such purchase shall be rescinded
and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, together with
interest or other amounts, if any, required by law (including court order) to be
paid by the Lender or the holder making such purchase.

          9.14 SUCCESSOR ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT.

               The Administrative Agent (i) may resign as Administrative Agent
or (ii) shall resign if such resignation is requested by the Required Lenders
(if the Administrative Agent is a Lender, the Administrative Agent's Loans and
its Commitment shall be considered in determining whether the Required Lenders
have requested such resignation) or required by Section 4.4.2, in either case of
(i) or (ii) by giving not less than thirty (30) days' prior written notice to
the Company, for all Borrowers. If the Administrative Agent shall resign under
this Agreement, then either (a) the Required Lenders shall appoint from among
the Lenders a successor agent for the Lenders, subject to the consent of the
Company, for all Borrowers, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, or (b)
if a successor agent shall not be so appointed and approved within the thirty
(30) day period following the Administrative Agent's notice to the Lenders of
its resignation, then the Administrative Agent shall appoint, with the consent
of the Company, for all Borrowers, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
a successor agent who shall serve as Administrative Agent until such time as the
Required Lenders appoint and the Company's consent on behalf of all Borrowers to
the appointment of a successor agent. Upon its appointment pursuant to either
clause (a) or (b) above, such successor agent shall succeed to the rights,
powers and duties of the Administrative Agent, and the term "ADMINISTRATIVE
AGENT" shall mean such successor agent, effective upon its appointment, and the
former Administrative Agent's rights, powers and duties as Administrative Agent
shall be terminated without any other or further act or deed on the part of such
former Administrative Agent or any of the parties to


                                      103



this Agreement. After the resignation of any Administrative Agent hereunder, the
provisions of this Section 9 shall inure to the benefit of such former
Administrative Agent and such former Administrative Agent shall not by reason of
such resignation be deemed to be released from liability for any actions taken
or not taken by it while it was an Administrative Agent under this Agreement.

          9.15 ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT'S FEE.

               The Borrowers, on a joint and several basis, shall pay to the
Administrative Agent a nonrefundable fee (the "ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT'S FEE")
under the terms of a letter (the "ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT'S LETTER") among the
Borrowers and Administrative Agent, as amended from time to time.

          9.16 AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS.

               The Administrative Agent may assume that each Lender has made or
will make the proceeds of the applicable Loan available to the Administrative
Agent in the applicable currency unless the Administrative Agent shall have been
notified by such Lender on or before the later of (1) the close of Business on
the Business Day preceding the Borrowing Date with respect to such Loan or two
(2) hours before the time on which the Administrative Agent actually funds the
proceeds of such Loan to the Borrowers (whether using its own funds pursuant to
this Section 9.16 or using proceeds deposited with the Administrative Agent by
the Lenders and whether such funding occurs before or after the time on which
Lenders are required to deposit the proceeds of such Loan with the
Administrative Agent). The Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such
assumption (but shall not be required to), make available to the Borrowers a
corresponding amount in the applicable currency. If such corresponding amount is
not in fact made available to the Administrative Agent by such Lender in the
applicable currency, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover such
amount on demand from such Lender (or, if such Lender fails to pay such amount
forthwith upon such demand from the Borrower) together with interest thereon, in
respect of each day during the period commencing on the date such amount was
made available to the Borrowers and ending on the date the Administrative Agent
recovers such amount, at a rate per annum equal to (i) the Federal Funds
Effective Rate during the first three (3) days after such interest shall begin
to accrue and (ii) the applicable interest rate in respect of such Loan after
the end of such three-day period.

          9.17 CALCULATIONS.

               In the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct, the
Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any error in computing the amount
payable to any Lender whether in respect of the Loans, fees or any other amounts
due to the Lenders under this Agreement. In the event an error in computing any
amount payable to any Lender is made, the Administrative Agent, the Borrowers
and each affected Lender shall, forthwith upon discovery of such error, make
such adjustments as shall be required to correct such error, and any
compensation therefor will be calculated at the Federal Funds Effective Rate or
the Overnight Rate if such computation relates to a Revolving Credit Loan made
in an Optional Currency.


                                      104



          9.18 NO RELIANCE ON ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT'S CUSTOMER IDENTIFICATION
PROGRAM.

               Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that neither such Lender, nor
any of its Affiliates, participants or assignees, may rely on the Administrative
Agent to carry out such Lender's, Affiliate's, participant's or assignee's
customer identification program, or other obligations required or imposed under
or pursuant to the USA Patriot Act or the regulations thereunder, including the
regulations contained in 31 CFR 103.121 (as hereafter amended or replaced, the
"CIP REGULATIONS"), or any other Anti-Terrorism Law, including any programs
involving any of the following items relating to or in connection with any of
the Loan Parties, their Affiliates or their agents, the Loan Documents or the
transactions hereunder or contemplated hereby: (1) any identity verification
procedures, (2) any recordkeeping, (3) comparisons with government lists, (4)
customer notices or (5) other procedures required under the CIP Regulations or
such other Laws.

          9.19 BENEFICIARIES.

               Except as expressly provided herein, the provisions of this
Section 9 are solely for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the
Lenders, and the Loan Parties shall not have any rights to rely on or enforce
any of the provisions hereof. In performing its functions and duties under this
Agreement, the Administrative Agent shall act solely as agent of the Lenders and
does not assume and shall not be deemed to have assumed any obligation toward or
relationship of agency or trust with or for any of the Loan Parties.

                                10. MISCELLANEOUS

          10.1 MODIFICATIONS, AMENDMENTS OR WAIVERS.

               With the written consent of the Required Lenders, the
Administrative Agent, acting on behalf of all the Lenders, and the Company on
behalf of the Loan Parties, may from time to time enter into written agreements
amending or changing any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document
or the rights of the Lenders or the Loan Parties hereunder or thereunder, or may
grant written waivers or consents to a departure from the due performance of the
Obligations of the Loan Parties hereunder or thereunder. Any such agreement,
waiver or consent made with such written consent shall be effective to bind all
the Lenders and the Loan Parties; provided, that, no such agreement, waiver or
consent may be made which will:

          10.1.1 INCREASE OF COMMITMENT.

               Increase the amount of the Revolving Credit Commitment or Swing
Loan Commitment of any Lender hereunder without the written consent of all
Lenders;


                                      105



               10.1.2 EXTENSION OF PAYMENT; REDUCTION OF PRINCIPAL INTEREST OR
FEES.

               Whether or not any Loans are outstanding, extend the time for
payment of principal or interest of any Loan (excluding the due date of any
mandatory prepayment of a Loan or any mandatory Commitment reduction in
connection with such a mandatory prepayment hereunder except for mandatory
reductions of the Commitments on the Expiration Date), the Commitment Fee or any
other fee payable to any Lender, or reduce the principal amount of or the rate
of interest borne by any Loan or reduce the Commitment Fee or any other fee
payable to any Lender, without the written consent of all Lenders;

               10.1.3 RELEASE A GUARANTOR.

               Except in connection with a transaction permitted hereunder or as
otherwise permitted hereunder, release any Guarantor from its Obligations under
the Guaranty Agreement, without the written consent of the Administrative Agent
and all Lenders; or

               10.1.4 MISCELLANEOUS.

               Amend Sections 4.2, 9.6 or 9.13 or this Section 10.1, alter any
provision regarding the pro rata treatment of the Lenders or requiring all
Lenders to authorize the taking of any action or reduce any percentage specified
in the definition of Required Lenders, in each case without the consent of all
the Lenders (other than Defaulting Lenders);

               provided, that no agreement, waiver or consent which would modify
the interests, rights or obligations of the Administrative Agent in its capacity
(as applicable) as Administrative Agent or the issuer of Letters of Credit or
PNC Bank, in the case of Swing Loan, without the written consent of the
Administrative Agent and each such other affected Person, as applicable, and
provided, further, that, if in connection with any proposed waiver, amendment or
modification referred to in Sections 10.1.1 through 10.1.4 above, the consent of
the Required Lenders is obtained but the consent of one or more of such other
Lenders whose consent is required is not obtained (each a "NON-CONSENTING
LENDER"), then the Borrower shall have the right to replace any such
Non-Consenting Lender with one or more replacement Lenders pursuant to Section
4.4.2.

          10.2 NO IMPLIED WAIVERS; CUMULATIVE REMEDIES; WRITING REQUIRED.

               No course of dealing and no delay or failure of the
Administrative Agent or any Lender in exercising any right, power, remedy or
privilege under this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall affect any other
or future exercise thereof or operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single
or partial exercise thereof or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to
enforce such a right, power, remedy or privilege preclude any further exercise
thereof or of any other right, power, remedy or privilege. The rights and
remedies of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders under this Agreement and
any other Loan Documents are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or
remedies which they would otherwise have. Any waiver, permit, consent or
approval of any kind or character on the part of any Lender of any breach or
default


                                      106



under this Agreement or any such waiver of any provision or condition of this
Agreement must be in writing and shall be effective only to the extent
specifically set forth in such writing.

          10.3 REIMBURSEMENT AND INDEMNIFICATION OF LENDERS BY THE BORROWER.

               The Borrowers, jointly and severally, agree unconditionally upon
demand to pay or reimburse to each Lender (other than the Administrative Agent,
as to which the Borrowers' Obligations are set forth in Section 9.5) and to save
such Lender harmless against (i) liability for the payment of all reasonable
out-of-pocket costs, expenses and disbursements (including reasonable fees and
expenses of counsel for each Lender except with respect to (a) and (b) below),
incurred by such Lender (a) in connection with the administration and
interpretation of this Agreement, and other instruments and documents to be
delivered hereunder, (b) relating to any amendments, waivers or consents
pursuant to the provisions hereof, (c) in connection with the enforcement of
this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or collection of amounts due
hereunder or thereunder or the proof and allowability of any claim arising under
this Agreement or any other Loan Document, whether in bankruptcy or receivership
proceedings or otherwise, and (d) in any workout or restructuring or in
connection with the protection, preservation, exercise or enforcement of any of
the terms hereof or of any rights hereunder or under any other Loan Document or
in connection with any foreclosure, collection or bankruptcy proceedings, or
(ii) all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions,
judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature
whatsoever (other than taxes) which may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted
against such Lender, in its capacity as such, in any way relating to or arising
out of this Agreement or any other Loan Documents or any action taken or omitted
by such Lender hereunder or thereunder, provided that the Borrowers shall not be
liable for any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages,
penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements (A) if
the same results from such Lender's gross negligence or willful misconduct, or
(B) if the Borrowers were not given notice of the subject claim and the
opportunity to participate in the defense thereof, at its expense (except that
the Borrowers shall remain liable to the extent such failure to give notice does
not result in a loss to the Borrower), or (C) if the same results from a
compromise or settlement agreement entered into without the consent of the
Borrowers, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. The Lenders will attempt to
minimize the fees and expenses of legal counsel for the Lenders which are
subject to reimbursement by the Borrowers hereunder by considering the usage of
one law firm to represent the Lenders and the Administrative Agent if
appropriate under the circumstances.

          10.4 HOLIDAYS.

               Whenever payment of a Loan to be made or taken hereunder shall be
due on a day which is not a Business Day such payment shall be due on the next
Business Day (except as provided in Section 3.2 with respect to Interest Periods
under the Euro-Rate Option) and such extension of time shall be included in
computing interest and fees, except that the Loans shall be due on the Business
Day preceding the Expiration Date if the Expiration Date is not a Business Day.
Whenever any payment or action to be made or taken hereunder (other than payment
of the Loans) shall be stated to be due on a day which is not a Business Day,
such


                                      107



payment or action shall be made or taken on the next following Business Day, and
such extension of time shall not be included in computing interest or fees, if
any, in connection with such payment or action.

          10.5 FUNDING BY BRANCH, SUBSIDIARY OR AFFILIATE.

               10.5.1 NOTIONAL FUNDING.

               Each Lender shall have the right from time to time, without
notice to the Borrowers, to deem any branch, Subsidiary or Affiliate (which for
the purposes of this Section 10.5 shall mean any corporation or association
which is directly or indirectly controlled by or is under direct or indirect
common control with any corporation or association which directly or indirectly
controls such Lender) of such Lender to have made, maintained or funded any Loan
to which the Euro-Rate Option applies at any time, provided that immediately
following (on the assumption that a payment were then due from the Borrowers to
such other office), and as a result of such change, the Borrowers would not be
under any greater financial obligation pursuant to Section 4.6 than it would
have been in the absence of such change. Notional funding offices may be
selected by each Lender without regard to such Lender's actual methods of
making, maintaining or funding the Loans or any sources of funding actually used
by or available to such Lender.

               10.5.2 ACTUAL FUNDING.

               Each Lender shall have the right from time to time to make or
maintain any Loan or Letter of Credit Borrowing by arranging for a branch,
Subsidiary or Affiliate of such Lender to make or maintain such Loan subject to
the last sentence of this Section 10.5.2. If any Lender causes a branch,
Subsidiary or Affiliate to make or maintain any part of the Loans or Letter of
Credit Borrowing hereunder, all terms and conditions of this Agreement shall,
except where the context clearly requires otherwise, be applicable to such part
of the Loans or Letter of Credit Borrowing to the same extent as if such Loans
or Letter of Credit Borrowing were made or maintained by such Lender, but in no
event shall any Lender's use of such a branch, Subsidiary or Affiliate to make
or maintain any part of the Loans or Letter of Credit Borrowing hereunder cause
such Lender or such branch, Subsidiary or Affiliate to incur any cost or
expenses payable by the Borrowers hereunder or require the Borrowers to pay any
other compensation to any Lender (including any expenses incurred or payable
pursuant to Section 4.6) which would otherwise not be incurred.

          10.6 NOTICES; LENDING OFFICES.

               Any notice, request, demand, direction or other communication
(for purposes of this Section 10.6 only, a "NOTICE") to be given to or made upon

telephone or in writing (which includes means of electronic transmission (i.e.,
"e-mail") or facsimile transmission or by setting forth such Notice on a site on

notice (received at or before noon on such next Business Day);

                    (iv) In the case of a facsimile transmission, when sent to
the applicable party's facsimile machine's telephone number if the party sending

                    (vii) If given by any other means (including by overnight
courier), when actually received.

Any Lender giving a Notice to a Loan Party shall concurrently send a copy
thereof to the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent shall promptly
notify the other Lenders of its receipt of such Notice. SCHEDULE 1.1(B) lists
the Lending Offices of each Lender. Each Lender may change its respective
Lending Office by written Notice to the Administrative Agent and other Lenders.

          10.7 SEVERABILITY.

               The provisions of this Agreement are intended to be severable. If
any provision of this Agreement shall be held invalid or unenforceable in whole
or in part in any jurisdiction, such provision shall, as to such jurisdiction,
be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without in
any manner affecting the validity or enforceability thereof in any other
jurisdiction or the remaining provisions hereof in any jurisdiction.


                                      109



          10.8 GOVERNING LAW.

               This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance
with the laws of the State of New York. Each standby Letter of Credit issued
under this Agreement shall be subject either to the rules of the Uniform Customs
and Practice for Documentary Credits, as most recently published by the
International Chamber of Commerce (the "ICC") at the time of issuance ("UCP") or
the rules of the International Standby Practices (ICC Publication Number 590),
as determined by the issuing Lender, and each trade Letter of Credit issued
under this Agreement shall be subject to the UCP, and in each case to the extent
not inconsistent therewith, the Laws of the State of New York without regard to
its conflict of laws principles.

          10.9 PRIOR UNDERSTANDING.

               This Agreement and the other Loan Documents supersede all prior
understandings and agreements, whether written or oral, between the parties
hereto and thereto relating to the transactions provided for herein and therein,
including any prior confidentiality agreements and commitments.

          10.10 DURATION; SURVIVAL.

               All representations and warranties of the Loan Parties contained
herein or made in connection herewith shall survive the making of Loans and
issuance of Letters of Credit and shall not be waived by the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, any investigation by the Administrative Agent or the
Lenders, the making of Loans, issuance of Letters of Credit, or payment in full
of the Loans. All covenants and agreements of the Loan Parties contained herein
shall continue in full force and effect from and after the date hereof so long
as the Borrowers may borrow or request Letters of Credit hereunder and until
termination of the Commitments and payment in full of the Obligations (other
than non-assessed contingent reimbursement obligations) and expiration or
termination of all Letters of Credit. Section 4 and Sections 9.5, 9.7 and 10.3
shall survive payment in full of the Obligations, expiration or termination of
the Letters of Credit and termination of the Commitments. In addition, all
covenants and agreements of the Borrowers and the Lenders contained herein
shall, if any related payment is later declared to be a fraudulent conveyance or
a preference in any respect, set aside or required to be paid to a debtor in
possession, any secured party, receiver or similar Person, or otherwise voided
or nullified (a "VOIDED PAYMENT"), be reinstated and deemed to have survived
payment in full of the Obligations, expiration or termination of the Letters of
Credit and termination of the Commitments, to the extent such reinstatement and
survival is necessary for the Administrative Agent to recover such Voided
Payment.

          10.11 SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS.

                    (i) This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to
the benefit of the Lenders, the Administrative Agent, the Loan Parties and their
respective successors and assigns, except that none of the Loan Parties may
assign or transfer any of its rights and Obligations hereunder or any interest
herein. Each Lender may, at its own cost, make assignments of or sell
participations in all or any part of its Commitments and the Loans and


                                      110



Letter of Credit Borrowings made by it to one or more banks or other entities,
subject to the consent of the Company, on behalf of the Borrowers, and the
Administrative Agent with respect to any assignee, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, provided that (1) no consent of the Borrowers shall be
required (A) if an Event of Default exists and is continuing, or (B) in the case
of an assignment by a Lender to an Affiliate of such Lender, and (2) any
assignment by a Lender to a Person other than an Affiliate of such Lender may
not be made in amounts less than the lesser of $5,000,000.00 and the amount of
the assigning Lender's Revolving Credit Commitment. In the case of an
assignment, upon receipt by the Administrative Agent of the Assignment and
Assumption Agreement, the assignee shall have, to the extent of such assignment
(unless otherwise provided therein), the same rights, benefits and obligations
as it would have if it had been a signatory Lender hereunder, the Commitments
shall be adjusted accordingly, and upon surrender of any Note subject to such
assignment, the Borrowers shall execute and deliver a new Note to the assignee,
if such assignee requests such a Note in an amount equal to the amount of the
Revolving Credit Commitment assumed by it and a new Revolving Credit Note to the
assigning Lender, if the assigning Lender requests such a Note, in an amount
equal to the Revolving Credit Commitment retained by it hereunder. Any Lender
which assigns any or all of its Revolving Credit Commitment or Loans to a Person
other than an Affiliate of such Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent a
service fee in the amount of $3,500.00 for each assignment. In the case of a
participation, the participant shall only have the rights specified in Section
8.2.3 (the participant's rights against such Lender in respect of such
participation to be those set forth in the agreement executed by such Lender in
favor of the participant relating thereto and not to include any voting rights
except with respect to changes of the type referenced in Sections 10.1.1,
10.1.2, or 10.1.3), all of such Lender's obligations under this Agreement or any
other Loan Document shall remain unchanged, and all amounts payable by any Loan
Party hereunder or thereunder shall be determined as if such Lender had not sold
such participation.

                    (ii) Any assignee or participant which is not incorporated
under the Laws of the United States of America or a state thereof shall deliver
to the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent the form of certificate described
in Section 10.17 relating to federal income tax withholding. Each Lender may
furnish any publicly available information concerning any Loan Party or its
Subsidiaries and any other information concerning any Loan Party or its
Subsidiaries in the possession of such Lender from time to time to assignees and
participants (including prospective assignees or participants), provided that
such assignees and participants agree to be bound by the provisions of Section
10.12.

                    (iii) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement,
any Lender may at any time pledge or grant a security interest in all or any
portion of its rights under this Agreement, its Note (if any) and the other Loan
Documents to any Federal Reserve Lender in accordance with Regulation A of the
FRB or U.S. Treasury Regulation 31 CFR Section 203.14 without notice to or
consent of the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent. No such pledge or grant of
a security interest shall release the Transferor Lender of its obligations
hereunder or under any other Loan Document.


                                      111



          10.12 CONFIDENTIALITY.

               10.12.1 GENERAL.

               The Administrative Agent and the Lenders each agree to keep
confidential all information obtained from any Loan Party or its Subsidiaries
which is nonpublic and confidential or proprietary in nature (including any
information the Borrowers specifically designate as confidential), except as
provided below, and to use such information only in connection with their
respective capacities under this Agreement and for the purposes contemplated
hereby. The Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall be permitted to disclose
such information (i) to outside legal counsel, accountants and other
professional advisors who need to know such information in connection with the
administration and enforcement of this Agreement, subject to agreement of such
Persons to maintain the confidentiality, (ii) to assignees and participants as
contemplated by Section 10.11, and prospective assignees and participants who
will be required to maintain confidentiality as if they were a Lender under this
Agreement, (iii) to the extent requested by any bank regulatory authority or,
with notice to the Borrowers, as otherwise required by applicable Law or by any
subpoena or similar legal process, or in connection with any investigation or
proceeding arising out of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iv)
if it becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this
Agreement or becomes available from a source not known to be subject to
confidentiality restrictions, or (v) if the Borrowers shall have consented to
such disclosure.

               10.12.2 SHARING INFORMATION WITH AFFILIATES OF THE LENDERS.

               Each Loan Party acknowledges that from time to time financial
advisory, investment banking and other services may be offered or provided to
the Borrowers or one or more of its Affiliates (in connection with this
Agreement or otherwise) by any Lender or by one or more Subsidiaries or
Affiliates of such Lender and each of the Loan Parties hereby authorizes each
Lender to share any information delivered to such Lender by such Loan Party and
its Subsidiaries pursuant to this Agreement, or in connection with the decision
of such Lender to enter into this Agreement, to any such Subsidiary or Affiliate
of such Lender, it being understood that any such Subsidiary or affiliate of any
Lender receiving such information shall be bound by the provisions of Section
10.12.1 as if it were a Lender hereunder. Such Authorization shall survive the
repayment of the Loans and other Obligations and the termination of the
Commitments. Each of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the issuer of
Letters of Credit, solely on its own behalf, acknowledges that the information
provided by the Loan Parties and their respective Subsidiaries may include
material non-public information concerning the Loan Parties or their respective
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, and that, to the extent such Person has not
opted out by written notice to the Administrative Agent and the Company from
receiving any such material non-public information, such Person will take
commercially reasonable measures to use such material non-public information in
compliance with applicable Law according to its usual procedures for the
handling of such information as in effect from time to time.

          10.13 COUNTERPARTS.

               This Agreement may be executed by different parties hereto on any
number of separate counterparts, each of which, when so executed and delivered,
shall be an original, and all such counterparts shall together constitute one
and the same instrument.

          10.14 ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT'S OR LENDER'S CONSENT.

               Whenever the Administrative Agent's or any Lender's consent is
required to be obtained under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents
as a condition to any action, inaction, condition or event, the Administrative
Agent and each Lender shall be authorized to give or withhold such consent in
its sole and absolute discretion (unless otherwise specified herein) and to
condition its consent upon the payment of money or any other matter.

          10.15 EXCEPTIONS.

               The representations, warranties and covenants contained herein
shall be independent of each other, and no exception to any representation,
warranty or covenant shall be deemed to be an exception to any other
representation, warranty or covenant contained herein unless expressly provided,
nor shall any such exceptions be deemed to permit any action or omission that
would be in contravention of applicable Law.

          10.16 CONSENT TO FORUM; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL.

               EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY
CONSENTS TO THE NONEXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF ANY NEW YORK STATE COURT OR FEDERAL
COURT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA SITTING IN NEW YORK CITY, AND ANY
APPELLATE COURT FROM ANY THEREOF, IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS TO WHICH IT IS A
PARTY, OR FOR RECOGNITION OR ENFORCEMENT OF ANY JUDGMENT, AND EACH PARTY HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY AGREES THAT ALL CLAIMS IN RESPECT OF ANY SUCH
ACTION OR PROCEEDING MAY BE HEARD AND DETERMINED IN ANY SUCH NEW YORK STATE
COURT OR, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN SUCH FEDERAL COURT, AND
EACH LOAN PARTY WAIVES PERSONAL SERVICE OF ANY AND ALL PROCESS UPON IT AND
CONSENTS THAT ALL SUCH SERVICE OF PROCESS BE MADE BY CERTIFIED OR REGISTERED
MAIL DIRECTED TO SUCH LOAN PARTY AT THE ADDRESSES PROVIDED FOR IN SECTION 10.6
AND SERVICE SO MADE SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE COMPLETED UPON ACTUAL RECEIPT THEREOF.
EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY WAIVES ANY OBJECTION TO JURISDICTION AND VENUE
OF ANY ACTION INSTITUTED AGAINST IT AS PROVIDED HEREIN AND AGREES NOT TO ASSERT

TO THE FULL EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.

          10.17 CERTIFICATIONS FROM LENDERS AND PARTICIPANTS.

               10.17.1 TAX WITHHOLDING.

               Each Lender or assignee or participant of a Lender that is not
incorporated under the Laws of the United States of America or a state thereof
(and, upon the written request of the Administrative Agent, each other Lender or
assignee or participant of a Lender) shall deliver to each of the Company and
the Administrative Agent two (2) duly completed appropriate valid Withholding
Certificates (as defined under Section 1.1441-1(c)(16) of the Income Tax
Regulations (the "REGULATIONS")) certifying its status (i.e. U.S. or foreign
person) and, if appropriate, making a claim of reduced, or exemption from, U.S.
withholding tax on the basis of an income tax treaty or an exemption provided by
the Internal Revenue Code. The term "WITHHOLDING CERTIFICATE" means a Form W-9;
a Form W-8BEN; a Form W-8ECI; a Form W-8IMY and the related statements and
certifications as required under Section 1.1441-1(e)(2) and/or (3) of the
Regulations; a statement described in Section 1.871-14(c)(2)(v) of the
Regulations; or any other certificates under the Internal Revenue Code or
Regulations that certify or establish the status of a payee or beneficial owner
as a U.S. or foreign person. Each Lender, assignee or participant required to
deliver to the Company and the Administrative Agent a Withholding Certificate
pursuant to the preceding sentence shall deliver such valid Withholding
Certificate as follows: (A) each Lender which is a party hereto on the Closing
Date shall deliver such valid Withholding Certificate at least five (5) Business
Days prior to the first date on which any interest or fees are payable by the
Borrowers hereunder for the account of such Lender; (B) each assignee or
participant shall deliver such valid Withholding Certificate at least five (5)
Business Days before the effective date of such assignment or participation
(unless the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion shall permit such
assignee or participant to deliver such valid Withholding Certificate less than
five (5) Business Days before such date in which case it shall be due on the
date specified by the Administrative Agent). Each Lender, assignee or
participant which so delivers a valid Withholding Certificate further undertakes
to deliver to each of the Company and the Administrative Agent two (2)
additional copies of such Withholding Certificate (or a successor form) on or
before the date that such Withholding Certificate expires or becomes obsolete or
after the occurrence of any event requiring a change in the most recent
Withholding Certificate so delivered by it, and such amendments thereto or
extensions or renewals thereof as may be reasonably requested by the Borrowers
or the Administrative Agent. In addition, each Lender or assignee or participant
of a Lender that is not incorporated under the Laws of the United States of
America or state thereof (and, upon the written request of the Administrative
Agent, any financial institution through which any such Lender, assignee or
participant has directed any payment to be made) shall enter into and comply
with any applicable certification, documentation, information or other reporting
requirement or agreement concerning U.S. accounts that it maintains or
concerning U.S. ownership of such Lender, assignee or participant, or any
substantially similar requirement or agreement, if entering into or complying
with such requirement or agreement is required by statute or regulation of the
United States as a precondition to relief or exemption from any tax, assessment
or other governmental


                                      114



charge. Notwithstanding the submission of a Withholding Certificate claiming a
reduced rate of or exemption from U.S. withholding tax, the Administrative Agent
shall be entitled to withhold United States federal income taxes at the full 30%
withholding rate if in its reasonable judgment it is required to do so under the
due diligence requirements imposed upon a withholding agent under U.S. Federal
tax Law. Further, the Administrative Agent is indemnified under Section
1.1461-1(e) of the Regulations against any claims and demands of any Lender or
assignee or participant of a Lender for the amount of any tax it deducts and
withholds in accordance with regulations under Section 1441 of the Internal
Revenue Code.

               10.17.2 USA PATRIOT ACT.

               Each Lender or assignee or participant of a Lender that is not
incorporated under the Laws of the United States of America or a state thereof
(and is not excepted from the certification requirement contained in Section 313
of the USA Patriot Act and the applicable regulations because it is both (i) an
affiliate of a depository institution or foreign bank that maintains a physical
presence in the United states or foreign county, and (ii) subject to supervision
by a banking authority regulating such affiliated depository institution or
foreign bank) shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the certification, or,
if applicable, recertification, certifying that such Lender is not a "shell" and
certifying to other matters as required by Section 313 of the USA Patriot Act
and the applicable regulations: (1) within 10 days after the Closing Date, and
(2) at such other times as are required under the USA Patriot Act.

          10.18 NATURE OF FOREIGN BORROWER OBLIGATIONS.

               (a) Notwithstanding the joint and several liability of the
Foreign Borrowers under this Agreement or any other Loan Document, and
notwithstanding any other provision herein and in any other Loan Document, all
obligations and liabilities of each Foreign Borrower under this Agreement and
any of the Loan Documents on account of principal and interest under the Loans
and Reimbursement Obligations and Letters of Credit Borrowings shall be limited
to the principal amount advanced to such Foreign Borrower or its Subsidiaries
and reimbursement of draws under Letters of Credit issued for the account of
such Foreign Borrower or its Subsidiaries and, in each case, interest thereon.
Each Foreign Borrower shall be liable only for its pro rata share of all fees
and expenses and other sums due hereunder (other than principal and interest on
the Loans) based upon the ratio of the sum of Loans outstanding to and Letters
of Credit issued for such Foreign Borrower to the total amount of Loans
outstanding and Letters of Credit issued hereunder.

               (b) Any Foreign Borrower may from time to time deliver a
termination notice to the Administrative Agent requesting that it no longer be a
party hereto. Such termination shall be effective two Business Days after
receipt by the Administrative Agent so long as all obligations of such Foreign
Borrower hereunder have been paid in full (including principal, interest and
other amounts) and no Letter of Credit issued for the account or benefit of such
Foreign Borrower is outstanding; provided that, to the extent this Agreement
provides for the survival of certain provisions upon termination hereof, such
surviving provisions shall survive a termination under this subsection with
respect to any such Foreign Borrower. Following receipt of such notice, no
further Loans may be borrowed by such Foreign Borrower


                                      115



hereunder, unless such Foreign Borrower shall thereafter rejoin this Agreement
as a Borrower pursuant to the joinder provisions of Section 7.1.10.

          10.19 PLEDGE OF FOREIGN LOAN PARTY LOANS.

               (a) To secure all of the Obligations, each of the Loan Parties
(other than the Foreign Loan Parties) hereby grants to the Administrative Agent,
for its benefit and the benefit of the Lenders, a security interest in and to
the following property of such Loan Party, whether now or hereafter existing,
and wherever located (collectively, the "PLEDGED COLLATERAL"): (i) loans and
advances made by the Loan Parties to Foreign Loan Parties pursuant to Section
7.2.4(v)(b) in an aggregate amount equal to the amount by which the aggregate
amount of loans and advances pursuant to Section 7.2.4(v)(b) exceeds
$20,000,000.00 (collectively, the "PLEDGED LOANS"); (ii) all instruments,
promissory notes, chattel paper, documents, certificates, securities and
investment property evidencing such Pledged Loans; (iii) all Liens and other
contracts securing or otherwise relating to such Pledged Loans; (iv) all books
and records relating to such Pledged Loans and items of collateral described in
the preceding clauses (ii) and (iii); and (v) all proceeds of such Pledged Loans
and items of collateral described in the preceding clauses (ii) and (iii).

               (b) In furtherance of the foregoing: (i) the Company, on behalf
of the Loan Parties, shall promptly as practicable after the existence thereof,
cause all of the Pledged Loans to be evidenced by a duly executed intercompany
promissory note and deliver same to the Administrative Agent together with all
other original items of Pledged Collateral of a type requiring possession by the
Administrative Agent for perfection of the Administrative Agent's and Lenders'
Lien under applicable Law, duly endorsed and dated in blank, if such endorsement
is necessary or customary; and (ii) the Loan Parties hereby authorize the
Administrative Agent, for its benefit and the benefit of the Lenders, to file
Uniform Commercial Code financing statements naming each Loan Party holding
Pledged Collateral as a debtor and describing the Pledged Collateral therein.
Upon and during the continuation of an Event of Default, the Administrative
Agent, for its benefit and the benefit of the Lenders, may exercise all of the
rights and remedies of a secured creditor with respect to the Pledged Collateral
under the applicable Uniform Commercial Code, including without limitation the
right to demand that payment of the Pledged Collateral be made directly to the
Administrative Agent, for its benefit and the benefit of the Lenders, for
application to the Obligations consistent with Section 8.2.5.

               (c) If, after the pledge of Pledged Loans as contemplated in this
Section 10.19, the aggregate amount of loans and advances made by the Loan
Parties to Foreign Loan Parties under Section 7.2.4(v)(b) no longer exceeds
$20,000,000.00, the Borrower Agent may provide to the Administrative Agent a
certificate of a Responsible Officer certifying to such fact (including
reasonable confirming calculations) and request that the Administrative Agent
release such Pledged Loans. The Administrative shall thereafter effectuate such
release by return of the original Pledged Collateral relating to such Pledged
Loans to the Borrower Agent and amendment to any of its applicable Uniform
Commercial Code financing statements. Any such release shall be limited to the
specific Pledged Loans released and shall not constitute a general release of
the requirements of Section 7.2.4(v)(b) and this Section 10.19.


                                       116
