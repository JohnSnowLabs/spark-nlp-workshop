obligations of the Borrower under the Credit Agreement or the Notes. The Bank
hereby expressly reserves all rights and remedies it may have against all
parties who may be or may hereafter become secondarily liable for the repayment
of the obligations under the Credit Agreement or the Notes.

any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original and
all of which, taken together, shall constitute one and the same agreement.

to the Bank on the date this Twelfth Amendment is executed, an amendment and
