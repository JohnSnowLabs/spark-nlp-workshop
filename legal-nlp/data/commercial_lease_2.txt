compliance with all other covenants under this Lease. If at any time during the
Lease term any part or all of the capital shares of Tenant, if Tenant shall be a

the Lease term shall cease as of the date possession shall be taken by such
public authority and Tenant shall pay rent up to that date with an appropriate
refund by Landlord of such rent as may have been paid in advance for any period
subsequent to the date possession is taken. If less than all of the Leased
Premises shall be so taken, the Lease term shall cease only on the part so taken
as of the date possession shall be taken by such authority and Tenant shall pay
rent up to that day with appropriate refund by Landlord for such rent as may
have been paid in advance for any period subsequent to the date that possession
is taken; thereafter, the Minimum Rent and Additional Rent shall be adjusted on
a prorata basis based upon the number of square feet taken. However, if the part
of the Leased Premises so taken leaves space no longer suitable, in the
reasonable opinion of Tenant, for the conduct of Tenant's business, then Tenant
may elect to terminate the Lease term and Tenant shall pay rent up to the day
possession is taken.

power or threat of eminent domain, whether the whole or any part of the Leased
Premises or Building, shall be property of Landlord, whether such damages shall
be awarded as compensation for the diminution in value of the leasehold or to
the fee of the Leased Premises or otherwise, and Tenant hereby assigns to
Landlord all of the Tenant's right, title and interest in and to any and all
such compensation; provided, however, that Landlord shall not be entitled to any
award specifically made to Tenant for the taking of Tenant's trade fixtures,
furniture or leasehold improvements to the extent of the cost to Tenant of said
improvements, less depreciation computed from the date of said improvements to
the expiration of the original term of this Lease. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, Tenant expressly retains the right to pursue a separate
action for loss of Tenant's business, depreciation to and cost or removal of

SECTION 13.01. PARTIAL DESTRUCTION BY FIRE OR OTHER CAUSE.

        If the Leased Premises shall be partially damaged by fire or other
casualty or cause without the fault or neglect of Tenant, the damage shall
promptly be repaired by and at the expense of Landlord and the rent until such
repairs shall be made shall be apportioned according to the part of the Leased
Premises which is unusable by Tenant. If such partial damage is due to the fault
or neglect of Tenant, without prejudice to any other rights and remedies of
Landlord, the damages shall be repaired by Landlord but there shall be no
apportionment or abatement of rent and the Tenant shall pay to the Landlord any
deductible not covered by the proceeds of insurance. In no event shall the
Landlord be required to repair or replace Tenant's stock in trade, fixtures,
furniture, furnishings, floor coverings or equipment. No penalty shall accrue
for reasonable delay which may arise by reason of an adjustment of insurance on
the part of Landlord and/or Tenant, for reasonable delay on account of "labor
troubles" or any other cause beyond Landlord's control. If the Leased Premises
or the Building are substantially damaged by fire or other cause, then either
Landlord or Tenant may elect to terminate this Lease upon written notice to the

property of Tenant in the Leased Premises, to secure the payment of any rent or
other sums due under this Lease; such property shall not be moved therefrom

liability whether for trespass, eviction, forcible entry or conversion, or
otherwise and to sell the same (Tenant hereby waiving the benefit of all laws
exempting property from execution, levy and sale on distress or judgment), with
or without notice, at public or private sale (at which Landlord may purchase)
and apply the proceeds thereof, less all expenses incurred in connection with
the exercise of Landlord's rights hereunder, as a credit against any sums due
from Tenant to Landlord. Any surplus shall be paid to Tenant, and Tenant shall
pay any deficiency forthwith. Alternatively, the lien hereby granted may be
foreclosed in any manner provided by law.

        A. In the event of: (i) any failure of Tenant to pay any rental or other
charges due hereunder for more than ten (10) days after the same shall be due;
or (ii) any failure of Tenant to perform any other of the terms, conditions or
covenants of this Lease to be observed or performed by Tenant for more than
thirty (30) days after written notice of such default shall have been given to
Tenant; or (iii) if Tenant or any guarantor of this Lease shall become bankrupt
or insolvent, or file any debtor proceedings, or take or have taken against

either of the United States or of any state, a petition in bankruptcy or
insolvency or for reorganization or for appointment of a receiver or a trustee
of all or a portion of Tenant's or any such guarantor's property; or (iv) if
Tenant or any such guarantor makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors,
or petitions for or enters into any agreement; or (v) if Tenant shall abandon
the Leased Premises or suffer this Lease to be taken under any writ of
execution; then Landlord, in addition to the other rights or remedies it may
have, shall have the immediate right of re-entry and remove all persons and
property from the Leased Premises; and such property may be removed and stored
in a public warehouse or elsewhere at the cost of, and for the account of
Tenant, and without being deemed guilty of trespass, or becoming liable for any
loss or damage which may be occasioned thereby. It is expressly agreed by Tenant
that Minimum Rent and CAM charges and any other monthly payments due under this
Lease are due on the days specified herein; and utility reimbursement shall be
paid within ten (10) days after receipt of the invoice or notice thereof. Any
charge for Minimum Rent, CAM charges or utility reimbursement not paid when due
shall bear interest at eighteen percent (18%) per annum.


        B. Should Landlord elect to re-enter, as herein provided, or should it
take possession pursuant to legal proceedings or pursuant to any notice provided
for by law, it may either terminate this Lease or it may, from time to time,
without terminating this Lease, make such alterations and repairs as may be
reasonably necessary in order to relet the Leased Premises, and relet the Leased
Premises, or any part thereof, for such term or terms (which may be for a term
extending beyond the Lease Term) and at such rental or rentals and upon such
other terms and conditions as Landlord, in its reasonable discretion, may deem
advisable. Upon each such reletting, all rentals received by Landlord from such
reletting shall be applied, first to the payment of any indebtedness other than
rent due hereunder from Tenant to Landlord; second to the payment of any costs
and expenses of such reletting, including brokerage fees and attorney fees and
costs of such alterations and repairs; third to the payment of rent due and
unpaid hereunder; and the residue, if any, shall be held by Landlord and applied
in payment of future rent as the same may become due and payable hereunder. If
such rental is received from such reletting during any month be less than that
to be paid during that month by Tenant hereunder, Tenant shall pay any such
deficiency to Landlord. Such deficiency shall be calculated and paid monthly.
Should Landlord at any time terminate this Lease for any breach, in addition to
any other remedies it may have, it may recover from Tenant all damages it may
incur by reason of such breach, including the cost of recovering the Leased
Premises, attorney fees, and including the worth at the time of such termination
of the excess, if any, of the amount of rent and charges equivalent to the rent
reserved in this Lease for the remainder of this Lease Term over the then
reasonable rental value of the Leased Premises for the remainder of the Lease
Term. All of which amount shall be immediately due and payable from Tenant to
Landlord. In determining the rent which would be payable by Tenant hereunder,
subsequent to default, the annual rent for each month of the unexpired term
shall be equal to the average monthly minimum and Additional Rent paid by Tenant
from the commencement of the Lease Term to the time of default, or during the
preceding twelve (12) full calendar months, whichever period is shorter,
adjusted, however, to include any provision herein for increases in Minimum
Rent.

        C. If as a result of any default by Tenant, Landlord shall make any
collection efforts or a suit shall be brought for recovery of possession of the
Leased Premises or for the recovery of rent or any other amount due under the
provisions of this Lease, or because of the breach of any other covenant herein
contained on the part of Tenant to be kept or performed, and a breach shall be
established, Landlord shall be entitled to recover from Tenant all expenses
actually incurred therefor, including reasonable attorney fees.


        D. Should Tenant breach any other provision of this Lease, then the
Landlord may give the Tenant ten (10) days written notice to correct the breach.
If the breach is not corrected, then the Lease may be terminated. Notice to the

by Tenant of any term, covenant or condition of this Lease, regardless of
Landlord's knowledge of such preceding breach at the time of acceptance of such
rent. No covenant, term or condition of this Lease shall be deemed to have been

monthly rent herein stipulated shall be deemed to be other than on account of
