        "Native Legal Text Summarization is a valuable tool for legal professionals who need to quickly understand the key points of a legal document. It can save time and improve accuracy, allowing lawyers to focus on more complex tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Native Legal Text Summarization feature uses a deep learning model that has been trained on a large corpus of legal documents to automatically generate summaries of legal text. The model uses a combination of natural language processing techniques, such as entity recognition, part-of-speech tagging, and dependency parsing, to extract important information from the text.\n",
        "\n",
        "The summarization model then uses this extracted information to generate a summary that accurately captures the key points of the document in a concise and understandable manner. The resulting summary can be used to quickly identify relevant information, such as the outcome of a legal case or the main provisions of a regulation.\n",
        "\n",
        "By using our new Legal Summarizer() module, you can get state-of-the-art, short versions of your legal documents, without losing any information.\n",
