        "Native Legal Text Summarization is a valuable tool for legal professionals who need to quickly understand the key points of a legal document. It can save time and improve accuracy, allowing lawyers to focus on more complex tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Native Legal Text Summarization feature uses a deep learning model that has been trained on a large corpus of legal documents to automatically generate summaries of legal text. The model uses a combination of natural language processing techniques, such as entity recognition, part-of-speech tagging, and dependency parsing, to extract important information from the text.\n",
        "\n",
        "The summarization model then uses this extracted information to generate a summary that accurately captures the key points of the document in a concise and understandable manner. The resulting summary can be used to quickly identify relevant information, such as the outcome of a legal case or the main provisions of a regulation.\n",
        "\n",
        "By using our new Legal Summarizer() module, you can get state-of-the-art, short versions of your legal documents, without losing any information.\n",
        "\n",
        "We included 2 models for Legal Summarization:\n",
        "\n",
        "  - **Legal FLAN-T5 Summarization (Base):** The base model, with generic capacities for summarizing legal documents.\n",
        "  - **Legal Finetuned FLAN-T5 Summarization:** A specifically finetuned model trained to summarize Legal Agreements . For this task, we finetuned our base model with more than 8K sections from different legal commercial agreements.\n",

        "\n",
        " For long document summarization, the following steps can be taken:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.   **Splitting the Document**: The initial step is to split the long document into smaller chunks. This is done to ensure that each chunk stays within the token limit imposed by the model and tokenizer. The document can be divided into paragraphs, sections, or any logical divisions based on the content.\n",
        "2.   **Token Limit**:  We split the text into sentences,  The initial text is divided into separate sentences. Starting with an empty container, the sentences are added to it one by one, in the order they appear in the original text. As each sentence is added, the total number of characters in the accumulated text is calculated and monitored. After adding each sentence, the accumulated character count is compared to the specified limit of 400 characters. The process continues until the total character count reaches or exceeds the specified limit. At this point, the process stops, and the accumulated text, consisting of all the sentences added so far, is considered the final output.\n",
        "3.   **Applying Summarization**: After the document is divided into manageable chunks, summarization is applied to each chunk independently. This can be done using the chosen summarization model or technique. The aim is to generate concise summaries for each chunk, capturing the essential information within the given constraints.\n",
        "4.   **Merging and Refining**: Once summaries are generated for each individual chunk, they can be merged and refined to form a coherent and comprehensive summary of the entire long document. This can involve removing redundant information, resolving inconsistencies, and ensuring smooth transitions between different chunks.\n",
        "5.   **Iterative Process:** If the summary generated from the merged chunks exceeds the desired length or does not meet the desired quality, the process can be iterated. This might involve adjusting the splitting strategy, revising the summarization model parameters, or applying additional techniques to improve the summary.\n",
