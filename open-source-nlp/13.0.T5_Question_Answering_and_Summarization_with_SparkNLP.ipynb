This gives T5 general knowledge of real world concepts to additionally enhance its understanding.\n","\n","With T5 you can answer **general knowledge based questions given no context** and in addition answer **questions on text databases**.      \n","These questions can be asked in natural human.\n","\n","\n","## What is a `open book question`?\n","You can imagine an `open book` question similar to an examen where you are allowed to bring in text documents or cheat sheets that help you answer questions in an examen. Kinda like bringing a history book to an history examen.\n","\n","In `T5's` terms, this means the model is given a `question` and an **additional piece of textual information** or so called `context`.\n","\n","This enables the `T5` model to answer questions on textual datasets like `medical records`,`newsarticles` , `wiki-databases` , `stories` and `movie scripts` , `product descriptions`, 'legal documents' and many more.\n","\n","\n","\n","## What is a `closed book question`?\n","A `closed book question` is the exact opposite of a `open book question`. In an examen scenario, you are only allowed to use what you have memorized in your brain and nothing else.      \n","In `T5's` terms this means that T5 can only use it's stored weights to answer a `question` and is given **no aditional context**.        \n","`T5` was pre-trained on the [C4 dataset](https://commoncrawl.org/) which contains **petabytes  of web crawling data**  collected over the last 8 years, including Wikipedia in every language.\n","\n","\n","This gives `T5` the broad knowledge of the internet stored in it's weights to answer various `closed book questions`\n","\n","\n","\n","<!-- [T5]() -->\n","![T5 GIF](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-o4oiOExxq1s/Xk26XPC3haI/AAAAAAAAFU8/NBlvOWB84L0PTYy9TzZBaLf6fwPGJTR0QCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/image3.gif)\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"CbOzz-Ve7jV-"},"source":["<center><h4><b>MODEL LIST</b></h4>\n","\n","Below is a list of Text Generation models.
