(There is also an important difference between an expression, and a function declaration. An expression can be in the form x , and a functional parameter can be a function parameter of the expression y , but this distinction does not apply in code.)\n","\n","Note: If you have a function definition that requires a return type, you must define it like so: def f(x):\n","/\n","\n","Defining a function\n","\n","An argument that cannot be determined from the code does not always raise an exception.

The definition of this function is: x = 2 + y\n","\n","The compiler will try to compile that as: (2), but since x is not defined as a function, it will produce a compile-time error, because x cannot be defined as the function type.

The problem is that neither x nor y, can be considered to have functions of any type.\n","\n","A function that is evaluated only once, and that can not be determined by the code is declared to be a sub-expression of some object that does not have a return value. For the example above, if x andy are functions, then x is a subobject of y, the definition to which x is the subobject, and the value of both y and x is null . The compiler simply cannot determine the value y is using its evaluation rules, since x and the type of y are functions of type Boolean\n","\n","It is not always possible to determine the return type of a function. Some functions can return a value only when they return a specific result to another function. The rule for evaluating a function that takes a single argument only, is: the return value must be of a special type.

They were not altogether crows, nor moles, nor buzzards, nor ants, \n","nor vampire bats, nor decomposed human beings; but something I cannot and must not recall. I could not even name them; and I have yet to learn even for the first time what they were and what they wanted.\n","I think I must have been twenty in the summer of the last century when that frightful dream first came to haunt me. I was one of those wretches who never sleep.\n","The first day I was on the road, I was in the village of Boudicca when an owl dropped from the sky on the path between the fields. I turned and saw a winged form moving along the road in a sort of semi-distant manner, then, with a strange flash, disappeared in a flash of golden light, like some sort of apparition from another world. It moved so slowly I thought I must be following it, but the more I looked around the fields the larger was its outline.\n","At the village we saw some of the creatures again. They seemed like they belonged not to the same race, but were entirely different:\n","-They came out of the ground in a dark, black line. One winged wing was white; the other wings black and yellow. There was another black wing, the one with a little bit of yellow in it.\n","They spoke in a strange, deep, metallic tongue. They had wings of their own, each about a foot long, and were almost invisible on the ground. All three winged beings were wearing white robes over their bodies and were very black as snow. The one who flew was about twenty years of age, very slender, and wore a white tunic made of cloth of wood, and a white cloak; he had golden hair with black hair in it, and was dressed like a gentleman. The girl who flew with him was about thirteen, with black and white hair of a very fine sort, and looked like a lady. She had golden and gold hair.\n","As I watched these strange winged creatures, I had a kind of mental picture, a sort that never fails to bring back the memories of horror, of horror in every sort. \n","There were three things I saw when I looked up through the window of my house: \n","I saw three white, black, and yellow wings on each winged creature in front of my very eyes; and there was a little girl standing there in the middle of them. I saw these things at least seven times in the course of this fright, but there were many more times when I didn't see them, and sometimes only three of them could be seen at a time and I was afraid of them more than usual, so I never went out with a view to seeing them. But when I had gone I saw them again, and this time, when I turned towards the window, I saw a huge, yellow, winged body with a black body and wings, walking with a very pale pale air.\n","This was all that I can remember. The first time I saw the creatures, they were so pale that it didn't matter that I looked at the window. I have been afraid of flying since my youth. But as time passed, as I was exposed to greater numbers of flying reptiles, the fear became stronger and harder. I have not been afraid to go for miles on foot, though I have often been afraid when I have had to walk up a steep hill. I never once went out on horseback, and I don't even like to ride, for fear that one day one of these creatures may get at me and kill me with its huge, pale body. And now I am so afraid of these terrible creatures that I must go for hours at a stretch, because if I stop at first, my brain will freeze up, and my nerves are going numb.  But the fear never goes away. As long as I am afraid of things, I cannot go out on my horse or my bicycle. That is because my brain is too weak for it; it does not know where to go.  I cannot be alone in the woods with my horses or the trees with my trees.  So when I go alone I always feel like a madman, and cannot\n","\n","\n"]},{"data":{"text/html":["\n","  <div id=\"df-05ccb986-3bf6-4c83-b68f-848c4496bcba\">\n","    <div class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","      <div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>id</th>\n","      <th>text</th>\n","      <th>result</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>\\nAt this horror I sank nearly to the lichened...</td>\n","      <td>[ Is it true that \\nAt this horror I sank near...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>\n","      <button class=\"colab-df-convert\" onclick=\"convertToInteractive('df-05ccb986-3bf6-4c83-b68f-848c4496bcba')\"\n","              title=\"Convert this dataframe to an interactive table.\"\n","              style=\"display:none;\">\n","        \n","  <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" height=\"24px\"viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"\n","       width=\"24px\">\n","    <path d=\"M0 0h24v24H0V0z\" fill=\"none\"/>\n","    <path d=\"M18.56 5.44l.94 2.06.94-2.06 2.06-.94-2.06-.94-.94-2.06-.94 2.06-2.06.94zm-11 1L8.5 8.5l.94-2.06 2.06-.94-2.06-.94L8.5 2.5l-.94 2.06-2.06.94zm10 10l.94 2.06.94-2.06 2.06-.94-2.06-.94-.94-2.06-.94 2.06-2.06.94z\"/><path d=\"M17.41 7.96l-1.37-1.37c-.4-.4-.92-.59-1.43-.59-.52 0-1.04.2-1.43.59L10.3 9.45l-7.72 7.72c-.78.78-.78 2.05 0 2.83L4 21.41c.39.39.9.59 1.41.59.51 0 1.02-.2 1.41-.59l7.78-7.78 2.81-2.81c.8-.78.8-2.07 0-2.86zM5.41 20L4 18.59l7.72-7.72 1.47 1.35L5.41 20z\"/>\n","  </svg>\n","      </button>\n","      \n","  <style>\n","    .colab-df-container {\n","      display:flex;\n","      flex-wrap:wrap;\n","      gap: 12px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #E8F0FE;\n","      border: none;\n","      border-radius: 50%;\n","      cursor: pointer;\n","      display: none;\n","      fill: #1967D2;\n","      height: 32px;\n","      padding: 0 0 0 0;\n","      width: 32px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #E2EBFA;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 2px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.3), 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.15);\n","      fill: #174EA6;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #3B4455;\n","      fill: #D2E3FC;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #434B5C;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);\n","      filter: drop-shadow(0px 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3));\n","      fill: #FFFFFF;\n","    }\n","  </style>\n","\n","      <script>\n","        const buttonEl =\n","          document.querySelector('#df-05ccb986-3bf6-4c83-b68f-848c4496bcba button.colab-df-convert');\n","        buttonEl.style.display =\n","          google.colab.kernel.accessAllowed ?
