Now that the tides are at a certain point, we may say with an eye of wonder: \"Why should we venture farther into the dark, and farther from shore?\" And if the answer is that we have found more of the same on a smaller or larger scale, we would have been better off without the sciences, except perhaps to seek the fountain from which the water rushes up again. It would not have happened unless the science of man had come to an end at last.\n","So it was with the science in religion. The first religion began as a mere curiosity, and has gradually come to mean something else. I don't know who started with it first, as he may have been a poet or a writer. Either way, this curiosity has now become a fact of life, and if I am right the reason for this is because it has become a religion. I think the reason is that it has been invented at the very moment when the universe was not yet made and there was no other purpose to which it was put. The purpose is now to explain the origin of things, to understand them in a way that leads us to understand those things, and so to make us understand them. This is the purpose, so far as my knowledge is concerned, that I can give you.\n","I should hope to have been able to explain to a human being what it is to be one, how we are to feel and how we live our lives. How far we can take it will depend very much on what I know already about human beings. It will be no easy matter to teach you what it means to be a moral being. That is a matter which we cannot yet begin to understand, because our moral feelings are as yet immature in the human animal. When they are fully developed, and when, I fear, they may be in the next generation, the moral feelings which the human being feels and the actions which the individual performs will be completely revealed to him. And to be sure, the most mature of the animals will then know what moral feelings it is proper to feel, how to behave, how often to act, and how it is good. But he will not know why he does what he does, and the reason why he acts what he acts in the way he does.\n","There are many different ways in which I have tried to explain human action, and there are many ways in whose direction I will go, because I am an old man. There are still many other kinds of life that may appear to be less satisfactory to a child, if we are willing to take an intellectual, rather than an emotional look at things. For example, in the sphere of morals there are things which do seem less satisfactory, but which are in reality more satisfying than those things which others give us satisfaction with. But the reasons why we ought to enjoy something must come from the fact that it is the way in which we have decided to act. It is the natural way when we are acting in an orderly and logical manner, which is why I consider myself a good moral, rather because I prefer to believe in the natural rules of conduct than in anything else.\n","And if it were to come to my knowledge, I should have found, in a certain way, that the reason which leads to something satisfying and which is the most satisfactory of the different means of doing something, is simply this: that something is more satisfying because it is orderly. If I were not so inclined, I might think that the pleasure which we derive from the orderly movement of our actions was due to some external force or force which we do not understand.\n","In other words, what we feel when we feel what others have felt, or think what others think, or feel when they think what we do, is just the same whether we know how to feel that force or not. That feeling of pleasure which people give to music, or to poetry, or even to dancing, is due to the force which they feel in a particular place and which they perceive to exist in another place, and which causes that force to be more satisfying to them. The same is true whether we feel that feeling of excitement about something which we are not at a loss to understand or to understand that sensation as such. These emotions, though they may not appear to us as a natural thing, we must recognize that we are doing when we say that we feel pleasure, or sadness, or the usual feeling of joy. That happiness, that feeling which we feel as though we had\n","\n","\n"]},{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["   id                                               text  \\\n","0   0  \\nThe most merciful thing in the world, I thin...   \n","\n","                                              result  \n","0  [ Is it true that \\nThe most merciful thing in...

Your life will not be the same as it's been before. It may be better, or worse, but not as it once was. But it cannot be otherwise.\n","In order for you to understand what's behind your existence, it will first have to have been altered to allow you to exist.\n","We have seen, as you are now aware, that your existence is inextricably bound to the matrix that is the world you know. The world was created within and for you, and we are your creators as you now are its creators. We have the physical bodies in which you now live, and it is through those bodies that you have been born.\n","Neon: What are they called?\n","The Archivist: ʿThe  Matrix ʻ.   ʷ\n","You now understand it to be something akin to a computerized version of the physical world that you live in, although that is no longer true. It is your mind's ability to interact with the physical universe through its own matrix that causes it to exist on earth.  However, the physical laws of physics, and the physical environment you inhabit, are not your minds minds creating them. This is a different story from our previous discussions, but we will continue to explore this concept in the future.\n","And what is it about your consciousness that allows you to perceive things?\n","In the words of the Archivist, it is your conscious mind's attempt to create and understand the physical nature of reality.\n","Your consciousness perceives and interprets information from the world around you that is not only your own, but also the physical reality within which we live now, which is the reality that you are currently inhabiting. You see it, remember it, and interpret it.\n","What can you do when you are in this matrix?\n","It must be understood that when you enter its physical state, you are entering your own consciousness. You can't see, hear, or touch it, as that would only be accessing the physical matrix itself. Therefore, you cannot create any forms of contact with the matrix or use the physical senses to communicate. The only way to communicate with it is to enter the real matrix, by entering, or entering from outside.\n","Once you enter this matrix, you become completely different from your physical selves. It appears to be entirely different than the world your present consciousness inhabits, and while it is still not physically identical to the same physical body, you feel like you have completely changed. You have been transformed, but that can never be stated or understood.\n","The same goes for your mind, except for when a physical manifestation of your mind is experienced. We know of the effects of this kind of interaction, such as the perception of objects, sounds and sights, and what has been reported by those who were granted an extra life.\n","When the physical body was destroyed by a certain power, that power left behind a portion of its brain that was sent to the physical plane. The brain and other parts of it were then reintegrated into your consciousness. Your physical body is in essence one of the parts of the matrix which is currently experiencing your existence.\n","It is through its experiences with its own thoughts, memories, and sensations that you come to understand the world beyond your physical body.\n","If you do not have access to a physical body yet, you have to come to terms with having the same experience within your consciousness and its interactions with the world, and that is difficult at times and will likely cause frustration to you.  The fact is, your physical physical body has only itself to blame for your current situation. You are experiencing this, but you do nothing to change that and do nothing but wait for it to end.\n","This is why you should only ever attempt to access the matrix from within if you have access. If you do that, you will never actually be able to enter from outside your own mind. You only gain access to reality via the Matrix, and if the physical brain is lost, the world will be lost as well. \n","The more you experience life, the more you will come to the realization that you should always enter by entering.
