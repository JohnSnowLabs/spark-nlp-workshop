Trump had been touting one of the most racist, heartless and problematic solutions to immigration throughout his entire campaign until just a few weeks ago, when he suddenly walked it back and softened his position. That decision confused everyone   and especially angered his equally racist supporters   and Trump has been stuck in a vicious back-and-forth pattern ever since.Last week, Trump said all undocumented immigrants in the U.S. must leave and then get in line to come back to America. This week, he made another  pivot  in his immigration policy, stating that he hasn t ruled out giving some immigrants a path to legalization. When spokesperson Katrina Pierson went on CNN to try to clear things up, it became apparent that everyone in the Trump campaign is confused now.In trying to defend her boss, a struggling Pierson said that it would be impossible for Trump to deport all the undocumented immigrants in America because there could be 2-3 times more immigrants than what the estimates say. Using the usual imaginary statistics that the Trump campaign has become infamous for, she said: We are continuously hearing that there s not 11 million [undocumented immigrants], there could be 20 million, there could be 30 million. This is important because Mr. Trump can t promise to deport every single illegal alien in the country if there s 30 million. While she was speaking, the host noticed that Pierson was absolutely lost and said,  We understand that it s complicated    which only infuriated Pierson and made her raise her voice. But as hard as she tried, Pierson couldn t give any solid reasoning for why Trump s ever-changing policy could work, because the truth is that it won t. The only thing that was cleared up in this interview was the fact that not even Trump s own campaign can keep up with his policy changes.Watch Pierson stumble through this interview below:.@KatrinaPierson on Trump s changing immigration stance: He said from beginning he d be  a negotiator in Congress  https:\\u002f\\u002ft.co\\u002fG4qVqhxleN  New Day (@NewDay) September 6, 2016Featured image is a screenshot\"],[\"Nothing ever is as it appears. There is usually more to the story than one side. Of course, the media isn t interested in the cops side of the story, because it won t help the Left and their war on cops. There is more than one tragedy in this story, and that is the tragedy of Reynold s 4 year old girl. What this little girl has had to endure with a mother who openly used drugs in front of her and videotaped her crotch and various other body parts while listening to explicit music (see video below) is beyond the pale. We aren t saying the cop in this case is innocent or guilty. We ll do what most Americans should do in any criminal case We ll wait for all of the facts to come out before we make any judgements. The question is, Is it possible for the Black Lives Matter rioters to take a deep breath until the truth is discovered in this case, or is there some sense of urgency to punish\\u002fkill cops and police forces across the country before this case ever goes to court? The Falcon Heights, Minnesota police shooting of Philando Castile is based around an entirely false narrative. Castile and Ms. Diamond Reynolds (Facebook video uploader) were pulled over by police because Castile matched a BOLO Alert for an armed robbery suspect from four days prior.In addition, Mr. Castile also matched the physical description of the suspect as given by eye witnesses:Unfortunately, the false statements in the video   which have gone viral, and are being pushed by the mainstream media   have created a backlash against police officers.Police officers in: Dallas (link), Tennessee (link), Missouri (link) and Georgia (link) have been Shot or killed in the past 24 hours as a result of a false narrative driven by the Black Lives Matter movement. It is important to get the truth out quickly.Saint Anthony, MN, Police Officers Jeronimo Yanez and Joseph Kauser pulled over Mr. Castile and Ms. Reynolds because the driver, Philando Castile, matched the suspect profile in an armed robbery which occurred on July 2nd, at a convenience store, only a few blocks from where their car was pulled over.The armed robbery occurred on July 2nd 7:30pm (Sat). The CCTV images were given to media and LEO by detectives on July 5th (Tuesday). A BOLO (Be On Look Out) alert was issued the same day, Tuesday July 5th. Philando Castile was pulled over on July 6th.From the radio dispatch of Officer Jeronimo Yanez: I m going to stop a car. I m going to check IDs. I have reason to pull it over. The two occupants just look like people that were involved in a robbery. The driver looks more like one of our suspects, just  cause of the wide set nose. A minute and a half later, the recording captures the first report that there was a shooting. (link)Ms. Diamond Reynolds narrates the now viral Facebook video with several false statements.Reynolds claimed they were pulled over for a broken tail light, false.Ms. Reynolds also claims her boyfriend, Castile, was holding a concealed carry permit for a firearm that was resting on his left thigh. This also appears to be false.According to a question presented to the local county sheriff who oversees the Concealed Carry Permit process, Mr. Castile had never requested a concealed carry permit from their office:It is possible a CCP was obtained in another county, however the media are conflating  permit to purchase  with  concealed carry permit . For some reason the CCP ownership is being amplified; it really has no bearing and is largely irrelevant for the context of the situation. That said, there is no factual evidence Mr. Philando Castile had a CCP.Due to the rear facing camera option on the phone Ms. Reynolds was using, the uploaded video everyone has seen is a reversed mirror image   making it appear she was in the drivers side, and Castile was on the passenger side. However, that impression is incorrect, Castile was driving the vehicle. The uploaded image is reversed by Facebook Livestream Video.However, correcting the mirror image, in part of the video it is possible to see a hand gun located on the thigh of Philando Castile. This also appears to be why Officer Yanez repeats to Ms. Reynolds not to reach toward her boyfriend:This hand gun also appears to be the same type of hand gun used in the Convenience Store Armed robbery four days earlier (7\\u002f2\\u002f16)In addition, Mr. Castile also matched the physical description of the suspect as given by eye witnesses:[ ] The other suspect was described as a black man with shoulder-length dreadlocks, who wore tan pants, tan shoes with white soles, a green jacket, a green baseball cap and glasses, the release says. He also had some of his hair pulled into a bun through the strap on the back of his hat and had a small mustache and facial hair on his chin. (link)Similar clothes as noted on the robbery suspect are also noted in the Facebook images of Mr. Castile. However, whether Mr. Castile is actually the person who committed the armed robbery is -again- essentially a moot point. Officer Geronimo Yanez gave the reason for the stop over the radio to his dispatcher as a possible ID on an  armed robbery suspect  Via: Conservative TreehouseDennis Michael Lynch   From what we can see in the video, Castile is hunched over in the passenger seat of a car driven by Castile s girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds. His shirt is blood soaked and he is barely alive. Reynolds talks to her Facebook Live audience as a cop is outside the car calling for backup, and her young daughter sits in the back seat.Here is the video of the shooting. ***WARNING***This video is VERY GRAPHIC and DISTURBING:In the video, Reynolds claims Castile did nothing wrong. She says the police officer asked for Castile s license, and that Castile told the officer he was legally carrying a firearm before he reached for his identification. According to Reynolds, it was when Castile reached for his license that the cop shot him in the arm four times. After Reynolds makes her claim, she points the camera at the police officer who is standing outside the passenger window with his gun pointed at a wounded Castile. The police officer counters Reynolds claim by stating he told Castile not to reach for his gun.Because the video was captured after the shooting, it all comes down to Reynolds  word versus the word of the police officer. But can we take Reynolds  word as being credible?This uncovered, disturbing video shows Castile and Reynolds in car with Reynolds young daughter in the back seat only days before confrontation with police:Three days before his death, Castile took part in another one of Reynolds  Facebook Live videos. In this video Diamond Reynolds sits in the driver s seat and films herself smoking pot. At one point she passes the joint to Castile. This all takes place while Reynolds  daughter watches from the back seat.In addition to showcasing her own drug use, the majority of the video is Reynolds filming her body parts for the world to see, including her breasts and crotch. Castile just sits back and says nothing while Reynolds makes her video. Meanwhile, Reynolds daughter is in the background watching her mother. She appears disturbed by the situation and asks her mother if they can leave to watch fireworks. \"],[\"Marco Rubio is making a name for himself in the Republican Party. Some think (actually most) that he s the GOP s best chance to defeat the Democrats in a general election. He s young, he s Hispanic, he s from an important swing state like Florida, and he s not as crazy as Donald Trump (at least by appearance).But, what most people don t know, is that Rubio s views on abortion make him an absolute nightmare of a candidate. And, people within his own party even are calling him out on it. During Saturday night s Republican debate Senator Rubio made the craziest accusation against Hillary Clinton on abortion yet. He levied the charge that  Hillary supports aborting babies on their due date. When Hillary was asked on Face The Nation what she thought of the comment, here was how she described it, among other words: Pathetic. That s one way to describe Rubio, for sure.We can t say these kinds of attacks are not typical of Republicans, cause then we d be lying. Hillary wasn t even surprised in the least and didn t even flinch when offering her rebuttal.  Here was her full response: I think it s pretty pathetic. This is something that illustrates how Senator Rubio is going as far as he can to try and buttress his credentials within certain parts of the Republican constituency. I ve been on record for years of where I stand on making abortion safe and legal, the exceptions that are appropriate that should be looked into, and the very difficult choices that very few women have to confront that lead to very excruciating kinds of decisions. And, to begin to politicize this so early in the campaign season to try and raise false charges and look like he s going to try and make sure Roe v. Wade is overturned and Planned Parenthood is defunded is just a tried and true tactic by those on the right. Clinton followed this up by pointing out that Rubio should probably brush up on the law first before bringing this up again in the future.Senator Rubio may very well be the GOP s best chance to go up against the Democrats, but with comments like those in a debate, you can be sure Clinton will be ready to shut him down again if she has to. We rate her description of Rubio as  pathetic  to be accurate and right on the money.

Remember when Obama spoke at events and those opposed to his presidency showed up armed and the president gave zero f*cks? Then remember when Donald Trump said, I Could Stand In the Middle Of Fifth Avenue And Shoot Somebody And I Wouldn t Lose Any Voters.  He probably wasn t wrong there. His supporters are unhinged but devoted. As a candidate, Trump garnered strong support from gun owners and the NRA. As a candidate, he promised to keep the Second Amendment intact. As president-elect, he just banned guns from his inauguration.Gizmodo reports:The transition team has drawn up a list of banned items. For instance, you can t bring drones, selfie sticks, or guns. Which all sounds a bit like 1984, if you ask me. I thought Trump was supposed to be the candidate of freedom. More like the candidate of taking our guns away, amirite?At least it looks like vapes aren t included on the verboten list. Which should make Grover Norquist pretty happy. And it makes sense to ban bicycles, since only granola-gulping, latte-sipping pinkos ride bikes. But why does Trump gotta take away all our fun toys like selfie sticks and firearms?The gun grabbing Marxist-Commie s list of banned items are as follows:Aerosols Ammunition Animals other than service\\u002fguide animals Backpacks and bags exceeding size restrictions (18  by 13  by 7 ) Bicycles Balloons Coolers Drones and other unmanned aircraft systems Explosives Firearms Glass, thermal, or metal containers Laser pointers Mace \\u002f Pepper spray Packages Selfie Sticks Signs exceeding the size restrictions (20  x 3  x 1\\u002f4 ) Structures Supports for signs and placards Toy guns Weapons of any kindAt the bottom of the list it reads,  Any other items determined to be potential safety hazards.

And if you watch daily, you may have noticed this slow shift over the past year or so. Sure, there s still shows like Rachel Maddow and Chris Hayes  All In, but all in all, if you re looking for real progressive TV, you re going to have to find it somewhere on the internet. The network is making a strong effort to switch from opinion to hard news, and that s why you re seeing fewer and fewer opinion shows and more generic broadcasts, especially during the day.Unfortunately, it looks like Melissa Harris-Perry was being forced to silence her voice by the network as well, and as of Friday, Harris-Perry has decided that she will no longer do her weekend show.In a letter written by Harris-Perry, and put out by one of her original producers, Jamil Smith, she explains in great detail why she has made this decision.Here s the letter in full:Dearest Nerds,As you know by now, my name appears on the weekend schedule for MSNBC programming from South Carolina this Saturday and Sunday. I appreciate that many of you responded to this development with relief and enthusiasm. To know that you have missed working with me even a fraction of how much I ve missed working with all of you is deeply moving. However, as of this morning, I do not have any intention of hosting this weekend. Because this is a decision that affects all of you, I wanted to take a moment to explain my reasoning.Some unknown decision-maker, presumably Andy Lack or Phil Griffin, has added my name to this spreadsheet, but nothing has changed in the posture of the MSNBC leadership team toward me or toward our show. Putting me on air seems to be a decision being made solely to save face because there is a growing chorus of questions from our viewers about my notable absence from MSNBC coverage. Social media has noted the dramatic change in editorial tone and racial composition of MSNBC s on-air coverage. In addition, Dylan Byers of CNN has made repeated inquiries with MSNBC s leadership and with me about the show and what appears to be its cancellation. I have not responded to reporters or social media inquiries. However, I am not willing to appear on air in order to quell concerns about the disappearance of our show and our voice.Here is the reality: our show was taken without comment or discussion or notice in the midst of an election season. After four years of building an audience, developing a brand, and developing trust with our viewers, we were effectively and utterly silenced. Now, MSNBC would like me to appear for four inconsequential hours to read news that they deem relevant without returning to our team any of the editorial control and authority that makes MHP Show distinctive.The purpose of this decision seems to be to provide cover for MSNBC, not to provide voice for MHP Show. I will not be used as a tool for their purposes. I am not a token, mammy, or little brown bobble head. I am not owned by Lack, Griffin, or MSNBC. I love our show. I want it back. I have wept more tears than I can count and I find this deeply painful, but I don t want back on air at any cost. I am only willing to return when that return happens under certain terms.Undoubtedly, television nurtures the egos of those of us who find ourselves in front of bright lights and big cameras. I am sure ego is informing my own pain in this moment, but there is a level of professional decency, respect, and communication that has been denied this show for years. And the utter insulting absurdity of the past few weeks exceeds anything I can countenance.I have stayed in the same hotels where MSNBC has been broadcasting in Iowa, in New Hampshire, and in South Carolina, yet I have been shut out from coverage. I have a PhD in political science and have taught American voting and elections at some of the nation s top universities for nearly two decades, yet I have been deemed less worthy to weigh in than relative novices and certified liars. I have hosted a weekly program on this network for four years and contributed to election coverage on this network for nearly eight years, but no one on the third floor has even returned an email, called me, or initiated or responded to any communication of any kind from me for nearly a month. It is profoundly hurtful to realize that I work for people who find my considerable expertise and editorial judgment valueless to the coverage they are creating.While MSNBC may believe that I am worthless, I know better. I know who I am. I know why MHP Show is unique and valuable. I will not sell short myself or this show. I am not hungry for empty airtime. I care only about substantive, meaningful, and autonomous work. When we can do that, I will return not a moment earlier. I am deeply sorry for the ways that this decision makes life harder for all of you. You mean more to me than you can imagine.Yours always,MelissaIt s really a shame that MSNBC is trying to silence the liberal voice. A voice that is being drowned out endlessly as more and more news outlets are acquired by right-leaning companies and CEOs. It s as though MSNBC gave up on itself, and instead of work on a formula that could really bring in more views, decided it was easier to just be generic. Hopefully the network comes to their senses sooner rather than later, and hopefully we will hear Harris-Perry s very well-educated, and much-needed voice once again. However, we must respect her decision.Featured image: RCP\"],[\"Defending Satan is hard. That s what Kellyanne Conway learned during an appearance on MSNBC on Wednesday morning.With eleven hours to go before the third presidential debate kicks off, host Stephanie Ruhle relentlessly grilled Donald Trump s campaign manager on everything from the Republican nominee s claims that the election is  rigged  to the sexual assault allegations against him to him inviting President Obama s estranged half-brother to the debate.Ruhle began by asking Conway if she really believes there will be widespread fraud on Election Day. Conway responded by breaking with her boss.  No, I don t believe that,  she said but she went on to suggest that there is a conspiracy to defeat Trump among Clinton and some members of the media. Specifically, Conway cited James O Keefe and his selectively edited undercover videos as proof of Trump s claims.Ruhle called out Trump for misleading the American people. Conway tried to spin by pointing to Trump s recent introduction of an ethics plan for government, but Ruhle was skeptical because Trump could have introduced such a plan months ago but is only doing it now.Conway whined about how the media is supposedly ignoring Trump s plans but Ruhle was not having it, noting that while the media has covered Trump s policy plans, he has made it difficult for them to do so by making wild claims and saying offensive things such as his various insults aimed at women, which Ruhle talked about next.Ruhle asked Conway if she is offended by Trump s remark about grabbing women  by the pussy.  She acknowledged that she is offended but she also lied by claiming that no one in Trump s campaign has tried to defend or condone his remarks when many of his surrogates have tried to write off his comments as mere  locker room talk. Ruhle then moved on to the sexual allegations against Trump, especially those made by a People magazine contributor. Trump has repeatedly called her a liar and attacked her but it turns out there are six witnesses who can corroborate her accusations that he groped her and forcibly tried to kiss her. When there are six people corroborating the People magazine story you still say her word against his?  Ruhle said.  You ve got to look at your kids when you go home at night. Conway complained that it was fair for Ruhle to say that to her because  I get that from a lot of childless people worrying about my kids  but Ruhle actually has three kids, whom she says are not allowed to watch Trump speak because she is afraid he will say offensive things about women.Conway countered by claiming that Hillary Clinton has not done anything for women, which again, is a lie.According to Huffington Post,Globally, no candidate has done more for women s rights than Secretary Clinton. In her time as Secretary of State, she appointed the first-ever Ambassador-at-Large for Global Women s Issues at the State Department; oversaw the creation of the U.S. National Action Plan on Women, Peace, and Security; and introduced the Global Health Initiative (GHI), investing $63 billion to help partner countries provide robust maternal and infant health services.Hillary is also a strong supporter of the Equal Rights Amendment and voted for the Lily Ledbetter Act and Paycheck Fairness Act when she was a United States Senator.She also fought for over-the-counter contraception and expanding Medicaid for family planning services.In short, her record of achievement is long when it comes to women.Conway also bragged about Hillary Clinton not reaching 65 percent support among women, but the fact is that she has a 19-point lead over Trump among women 53-34 in a new CBS poll. If the election were held today, it would be the largest margin of victory among women in history, even surpassing President Obama s wins in 2008 and 2012.For some reason, Conway also tried to criticize Hillary for  hanging out  with billionaires like Mark Cuban just because she has their support. Ruhle was quick to smack Conway down by pointing out that Trump is a billionaire who actually does hang out with billionaires.Conway also took heavy fire from Ruhle after saying that Hillary Clinton  isn t an American success story  even though she is the first woman in history to be a major party s nominee for president.Here s the video via YouTube.Overall, Conway really took a beating in this interview. She lied multiple times all while trying to soften Trump s claims, which really undermines them more than anything else.Donald Trump is unfit to be president and, quite frankly, anyone who worked for his campaign should never be able to work in politics or in the media ever again, and that includes Kellyanne Conway. They have done nothing but poison the democratic process while demonizing the press that is responsible for vetting candidates. That only weakens our country and it s unforgivable.Featured image via screenshot\"],[\" Freedom is not a gift from government. It is a gift from God.    President Donald J. Trump, May 4, 2017The Little Sisters correctly insist that sterilizations, abortifacient chemical birth control and artificial contraception are all immoral. They are not only against the teaching of the scripture and Christian tradition but, as Catholics, the Sisters also maintain that they violate the Natural Moral Law.The Obama administration has asked the Court to compel these Little Sisters of the Poor to do indirectly what they refuse to do directly. They asked the Court to force Catholic nuns to sin, to act against conscience, to pursue an immoral course of action. The nuns were placed in a situation reminiscent of other times in the history of the Church when unjust rulers sought to compel the Church to bend the knee to Caesar.Here are what the Little Sisters Of The Poor are all about. One look at these lovely women who have devoted their lives to God and to helping others in need, and you will see why President Trump made helping them live their faith without fear of persecution a priority:President Donald Trump signed a religious liberty executive order today that would protect Christian organizations like the Little Sisters of the Poor from being forced to pay for abortions.Today is the National Day of Prayer and the White House is celebrating the occasion with Christian leaders by scheduling the order signing today. The order is a promise to respect religious rights and could pave the way for the Trump administration dropping the lawsuit the Obama administration was fighting against the Little Sisters and dozens of Christian entities not wanting to pay for abortions or abortion-causing drugs.The order indicates the Trump administration will  provide regulatory relief for religious objectors to Obamacare s burdensome preventive services mandate, a position supported by the Supreme Court decision in Hobby Lobby. Family Research Council President Tony Perkins was at the White House for the signing ceremony of an executive order protecting religious liberty. He told LifeNews.com that the new order ensures the freedom of all Americans to believe and act in accordance with their beliefs. The executive order makes clear that the administration will pursue policies that  protect and vigorously promote religious liberty. The President s executive order is a clear reflection of his campaign promise to protect the religious freedoms of Americans. President Trump is taking a significant first step to defending religious liberty. In working with the Trump administration, it is clear that they both recognize and understand the dangers of the anti-faith policies of the previous administration and are therefore committed to undoing those policies and restoring true religious freedom,  he said.  The freedom to live out faith in all areas of society without government punishment or intimidation is what has made America great.   Life NewsWatch here: \"],[\"On Wednesday, Rachel Maddow made a comparison between the overt racism of Donald Trump s current campaign and the polite racism of Rick Santorum s campaign in 2012. During the segment, Maddow raises some interesting questions about Trump and the normalization of racism in the 2016 political cycle.Racist policies have been a major part of the GOP s platform since they adopted the southern strategy. Since it is no longer considered polite to be openly racist, the GOP had to come up with a racist agenda that is coded in the language of economic policy. On occasion, a Republican candidate slips up and the veil covering their racist attitudes falls away.Maddow points towards the time when Santorum infamously stated on the campaign trail that he doesn t  want to make black people s lives better by giving them somebody else s money.  Santorum quickly tried to backpedal on the gaffe, saying that he actually said  blah people.  Much like the rest of Santorum s political career, it was both very sad and hilarious.Things have changed since 2012. With black uprisings taking place all across the United States in 2014 and 2015, a movement was born that demanded that people finally recognize that black lives matter. Because the U.S. is extremely racist, that simple demand was meant with a huge backlash from ignorant and racist right-wingers. The same thing can be said in regards to Muslims, Mexicans, and just about every other racial group in the U.S. While racial minorities demand to be treated equally, the right fights harder and harder to maintain white supremacy.So with racial tensions running high and matters of racial justice becoming an ever more partisan subject, Trump entered the 2016 primary election fully exploiting that tension. His rallies have nearly turned into all out race battles, his racist rhetoric is up front and he is unapologetic about that. In the segment, Maddow points towards one of his recent statements involving the judge who ruled against him in a lawsuit over one of Trump s most horrendous scams, Trump University.While it is probably true that Trump is normalizing racist language, he is also exposing the racist foundations that modern GOP is built upon. That s causing deep fractures to form among Republicans. The GOP cannot continue being the party of racists, in a nation that is rapidly becoming more diverse. So while the normalization of racist rhetoric is terrible   it is important to keep in mind that we are witnessing the death throes of a dying political party.You can watch the segment below.

Politicians like Jeff Flake fought Trump on immigration and border security every step of the way. The voters agreed with Trump so Flake was heading for defeat in Arizona by a large margin. Instead of announcing his decision to not seek reelection quietly, Flake chose to grandstand and bash President Trump in what can only be described as a sour grapes hate-fest. Below is a list of  centrist  and left-leaning  Republicans In Name Only  who are not seeking reelection:MAYBE THEY CAN RUN AS DEMOCRATS NEXT TIMEThe 2018 midterm elections on Tuesday, Nov. 6, will give President Trump his first chance to defend the Republican Party s Senate and House majorities. Already, however, several Republicans in Congress have announced they won t be running for re-election. Here s our running list:Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn.After tangling with President Trump, including questioning his  stability  and  competence,  Corker put an end to speculation and announced he would not be running again in 2018. Corker and Trump have since engaged in multiple scraps on Twitter, Corker calling it  a shame the White House has become an adult day care center  and Trump saying Corker  couldn t get elected dog catcher. Rep. Charlie Dent, R-Pa.Dent, a centrist Republican, announced in September that he d decided against running for re-election after consulting with family and advisers. Pennsylvania state Rep. Justin Simmons had announced he would challenge Dent in the primary. Rep. John Duncan, R-Tenn.Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz.Flake confirmed his decision in a Senate floor speech in October and condemned the current state of politics, specifically President Trump, as one of the main reasons he s deciding to step aside.

Mr. Mostyn was only 46, he left behind a wife and several children, and earlier this year had announced that he was going to be stepping away from politics to spend more time with his family.Details about how Mr. Mostyn allegedly committed suicide are slim. However, his family said that it happened after he  suddenly  became afflicted with some sort of mental illness then took his own life, although they weren t clear as to what type of mental illness he suffered from.But it is worth noting that Mr. Mostyn had never suffered from mental illness in the past, according to his family, further raising suspicions over the manner in which he died.Mr. Mostyn was a progressive powerhouse who was heavily involved in politics throughout his career. He made his fortunes off of suing insurance companies after hurricanes ravaged his state, and used his wealth to fund numerous Democrat and progressive causes, including the Super PAC  Ready for Hillary,  which he and his wife co-founded with Susie Tompkins Buell, a radical environmentalist and member of George Soros s Democracy Alliance.Mr. Mostyn s wife, Amber, was also a member of the Democracy Alliance and a close friend of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who was the keynote speaker at a 2010 Annie s List event honoring Amber. The Mostyns were close to the Clintons in general, having held numerous high-dollar fundraisers for Hillary s failed 2016 presidential run at their Houston home.Houston Chronicle  In 2012 alone, Mostyn donated $5.2 million to various pro-Democratic Super PACs ranging from Planned Parenthood to Texans for America s Future to Priorities USA Action, a pro-Barack Obama PAC, according to the Center for Public Integrity.In 2014, he and his wife donated approximately $3 million to Democratic candidates, including state Sen. Wendy Davis, who we running against Republican Greg Abbott. Davis lost. I am heartbroken,  Davis tweeted Thursday.  Texas has lost an extraordinary person. Steve was a committed and effective fighter for justice, a wonderful husband, father and friend. He leaves behind a lasting impact on everyone who s life he touched. Mostyn and his wife, Amber, were co-founders of the Ready for Hillary PAC, a political action committee supporting Clinton s unsuccessful campaign for president. At the same time, state campaign finance records show he also contributed to a police-affiliated PAC that supported Republican primary candidates.Mostyn also help fund the Texas Organizing Project and Battleground Texas, two Democratic comeback strategies for the party that has not won a statewide election in two decades. It s hard to really quantify the hole it leaves for progressives. He s probably the first true financial benefactor for progressives in Houston, and I say that because it s really different than supporting individual candidates the way trial lawyers have collectively in the past. He really supported the underlying causes, which is a different kind of take, and I m not sure that gets filled, certainly not immediately. Despite the Mostyns and the law firm s high-profile political activism   they contributed more than $1.8 million to Texas politicians in 2016   Mostyn told the Texas Tribune in a September interview that he was growing tired of almost single-handedly funding Democratic candidates in a state that was solidly Republican.He said he intended to downscale his political giving to Democrats in Texas elections to encourage others to step forward.  We ve asked other people to do it and they want to do it and I want other people to get credit for doing it,  the Tribune quoted him as saying.  I mean this is a giant, giant state, if we were trying to flip Vermont we d be done. However, their relationship came under stress in 2015, when ethics watchdog group Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust (FACT) filed a formal complaint against Hillary and her campaign for illegal coordination with the Ready for Hillary Super PAC, the Daily Caller reported. FACT has also asked the Senate Select Committee on Ethics to look into an April 21 meeting in which Clinton campaign aides attended a weekly meeting of Senate Democrats. FACT asserts that the meeting violates ruleThis wasn t the first time the Clinton and Mostyns found themselves being questioned over unethical practices. In 2010, Hillary Clinton s State Department pushed through a multi-billion dollar deal for Boeing in Russia, and just two months later the company gave nearly a million dollars to the Clinton Foundation.Just a short time later, Boeing s top lobbyist and former Bill Clinton aide Tim Keating partnered with Mr. Mostyn s Super PAC to do a joint fundraising venture for Hillary s planned presidential campaign.  America s Freedom FightersFrom FOX News   When Hillary Clinton was America s top diplomat, she also appeared at times like a top salesperson for America s biggest airplane maker, Boeing.Traveling abroad on official business as secretary of state, Clinton often visited Boeing facilities and made a pitch for the host country to buy Boeing jets. During one visit to Shanghai in May 2010, she boasted that  more than half the commercial jetliners operating in China are made by Boeing. A sales plug in Russia in 2009, though, may have proved especially fruitful. While touring a Boeing plant, Secretary of State Clinton said,  We re delighted that a new Russian airline, Rossiya, is actively considering acquisition of Boeing aircraft, and this is a shameless pitch. In 2010, Boeing landed the Russian deal, worth $3.7 billion. And two months later, the company donated $900,000 to the Clinton Foundation.This chain of events is raising new questions for Clinton, and Boeing, as the former secretary of state launches her 2016 presidential campaign. The Boeing deal only adds to a growing list of business deals involving Clinton Foundation donors now coming under scrutiny.Boeing shareholder David Almasi recently confronted CEO James McNerney about the ethics of it. That opens the door to charges of honest services fraud, that there was a quid pro quo between the Clinton Foundation, the State Department, and Boeing,  Almasi said.In prepared answers to questions posed to Boeing by Fox News, a spokesman defended the company s actions. Our contribution to the Clinton Foundation to help the people of Haiti rebuild was a transparent act of compassion and an investment aimed at aiding the long-term interests and hopes of the Haitian people,  the spokesman said. The company also pointed out that it gave the American Red Cross $1.3 million after the devastating 2010 earthquake.Clinton defenders say there is no smoking gun.  There s zero evidence that Hillary Clinton went to bat for Boeing for any reason other than to benefit the U.S. economy and U.S. workers,  said former Clinton\\u002fGore adviser Richard Goldstein.But the financial connections don t end there. Boeing also paid former President Bill Clinton $250,000 for a speech in 2012. It was a speech that was approved by the State Department s Ethics Office   which according to an Associated Press report often approved the ex-president s speaking engagements within days.Here is a list of mysterious deaths tied to the Clinton s:1   James McDougal   Clinton s convicted Whitewater partner died of an apparent heart attack, while in solitary confinement.

Over a period of several hours the gunman killed 5o people. Another 53 people were injured during the killing spree.According to police sources, shortly before the attack began, Mateen dialed 911 and pledged his support to the terrorist organization ISIS.Although Mateen was born in the United States, his parents are immigrants who came to the US from Afghanistan. As the Washington Post reports, Mateen s father hosts a political talk show, called the Durand Jirga Show. The title refers to a disputed strip of land between the border of Afghanistan and Pakistan.In at least one video, Seddique Mateen, father of the shooter, is seen praising the Taliban, saying: Our brothers in Waziristan, our warrior brothers in [the] Taliban movement and national Afghan Taliban are rising up. Inshallah the Durand Line issue will be solved soon. According to the Palm Beach Post, Mateen has been known to the FBI for several years. In 2015, the FBI investigated the connection between Mateen and Moner Abu-Salha, a one time resident of Vero Beach, Florida. Abu-Salha was the first American suicide bomber in Syria.Like most religious extremists, Abu-Salha vehemently hated gay people and promoted videos on Facebook calling for their execution.In one video posted to Abu-Salha s Facebook page, the group s religious leader is seen telling a gay man that he would be considered  a murtad or apostate,  who would be cast  out of the fold of Islam.  He goes on to say,  You will not be buried in a Muslim graveyard. No Muslim person would ever read your funeral prayer.  He goes on to say that  Homosexuality is punishable by death. Watch the video below:As the Christian right frantically works to portray the mass shooting at Orlando s Pulse Nightclub as a reason to hate and ban Muslims from America, the similarities between Christian extremists and the Taliban are more apparent than ever.Here in the US, right-wing preachers routinely call for the executions of members of the LGBTQ community. In the meantime, Republican extremists in government work hard to make sure that every crazed, violent, potential mass murderer has access to the weapons they need to carry out such a vicious hate crime.The Pulse Nightclub mass shooting was carried out by a Muslim extremist who targeted the gay community in a violent religious frenzy.It doesn t matter whether a gun-toting religious fanatic is carrying a Christian Bible or a Muslim Koran. Hate is hate, and the end result of hate is violence.Image credit: Omar Mateen via MySpace\"],[\"Boston-based entrepreneur and inventor of Email V.A.

It s a matter of mishandling classified info, they say. She potentially put our national security at grave risk, they claim. We have to investigate every last letter of every last word of every last sentence here, they insist. But when it comes to investigating a true threat to national security, they re blocking attempts at every turn.Of course, we re talking about Donald Trump s potential ties to Russia. Congressional Democrats keep running into roadblock after roadblock in trying to open an investigation into that. GOP staffers told The Daily Beast that while it seems their bosses are privately concerned about the issue, they would rather continue harping on Hillary.It s politics. Disgusting politics that really does put us at risk. The problem is likely that Trump is their nominee which really should make it all the more concerning. Given the GOP s apparent need to protect our security (they re angry with Obama for not going after ISIS the way they want in addition to insisting that Hillary jeopardized our security with her email server), one would think they d be all over this.Intelligence briefings given to both the Senate and House Intelligence Committees point to Russia using hacking as a means to influence our elections: Communications and documents stolen in those hacks have been selectively leaked online since, by a hacker claiming to be unaffiliated with the Russians going by  Guccifer 2.0.  But analysis by private-sector cybersecurity firms have concluded that the character is most likely a front for the Russians to cast doubt on their culpability.Two other hacks   both of state election boards   have also been loosely tied to potential Russian hackers. In Illinois, thousands of voter role records were accessed, and Arizona was also targeted. Though nothing was done to influence elections in those states, experts believe Russian hacking is designed to cast doubt in the security and validity of the election. It s true that some Republicans are suffering some measure of  buyer s remorse  over the party s nomination of Trump, but in blocking investigations that are this important, all they ve done is unmask themselves as the impostors they are.

It is being alleged that workers on the site are being paid less than what is mandated under federal law.The Labor Department confirmed to POLITICO that it s looking into allegations of wage-rule violations by the Craftsmen Group, a Trump Organization subcontractor that restores windows. And workers on the site, including one Craftsmen Group employee, told POLITICO that they and others aren t receiving pay rates mandated by law. Two of them produced pay stubs to support their claims.Trump s refurbishment of the Romanesque pile, built in 1899, into a luxury hotel is his highest-profile real estate project, if only because the historic structure is situated just a few blocks from the White House. Trump staged a campaign event at the construction site in March, blending presidential politics with commerce.  When it s completed,  he said,  it will be truly one of the great hotels of the world. Trump s contract with the federal government for the site is actually structured so that Trump is actually leasing it from the government. That means wages on the site are set by federal law, which requires all workers   union or not   on the site to be paid the  prevailing wage  set in the area by labor unions.A sign at the Trump site pointed out that glaziers, the workers installing shower doors, should be paid between $24.30 to $27.64 an hour. But their paystubs show them earning way less   between $13 to $16 an hour   almost half of what the law requires.Trump has been slammed recently for repeatedly underpaying contractors who have done work on his properties, and in some instances not paying them at all for the work they ve done for him and his companies.

This story will certainly be a hot button for a lot of people. Reactions will likely depend on one s perspective on Trump, understanding of land issues, thoughts on cultural preservation, energy, US jobs, water quality and ecological harmony.With Progressive Leftwing attacks in full overdrive, post Trump s inauguration, many people are looking to the Trump administration to either confirm their worst fears or their greatest hopes, with every move he makes. But remember, Trump s  Art of the Deal,  is in play now and things may not always be black\\u002fwhite or good\\u002fbad, as this administration performs their first set of actions setting the foundation for the next 4-8 years.Many following the issue are not taking into consideration that the pipeline is more than 90% complete when Obama put a hold on the completion of the DAPL via the US Army Corps of Engineers. Obama s move was hardly one of stopping development of this pipeline but was likely politically motivated.It is worth noting that they had previously approved all plans for the completion of the DAPL in June of 2016 and appears to have been put a hold on the completion in the wake of the elevated protests at the Standing Rock location and the US Presidential election.Regardless, both pipeline projects are divisive political hot potato issues   which have now fallen into the hands of Donald Trump. Expect Trump s reaction to generate renewed protests and opportunities for negative press.RT explores the topic further in the report below:RTPresident Donald Trump ordered the removal of obstacles to the construction of two major oil and gas pipelines, which the Obama administration had reluctantly blocked after protests from environmentalists and Native Americans.The construction will be  subject to terms and conditions to be negotiated by us,  Trump said, citing as an example the need for pipe components to be built in the US.Other presidential actions signed on Tuesday included expediting environmental reviews for critical infrastructure projects and streamlining the  extremely cumbersome  regulatory process for domestic manufacturing. The regulatory process in this country has become a tangled-up mess,  Trump said.Tuesday s actions weren t technically executive orders but presidential memoranda, an executive action ranked just below but with equal force. Unlike an executive order, a presidential memorandum does not have to be numbered, include a cost estimate, or cite the authority under which it is issued.White House spokesman Sean Spicer reminded reporters on Tuesday that the Dakota Access Pipeline is 93 percent complete. Trump intends to sit down with all the parties involved with the pipeline, including Native Americans, and negotiate the best deal that benefits everyone, Spicer said.The new administration wanted to start on the Keystone XL approval process as soon as possible, Spicer said.TrumpDAPLReactions Trump s decision was quickly condemned by environmentalists, Native American activists, the American Civil Liberties Union and a number of Democratic lawmakers. Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont) said the US  can t afford to build new pipelines that lock us into burning more fossil fuels  and vowed to do everything to stop both pipelines.A lawyer for the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe said the decision was made  hastily and irresponsibly.  The tribe said it intended to pursue legal action against Trump s order, adding that the pipeline posed a risk not just for their water supply but also for millions of Americans living downstream.One of the leading organizations in the Standing Rock protests, the Indigenous Environmental Network, called Trump s actions  insane and extreme, and nothing short of attacks on our ancestral homelands. Trump is portraying his true self by joining forces with the darkness of the Black Snake pipelines crossing across the culturally and environmentally rich landscape of the prairie lands of America,  the IEN said in a statement.The North Dakota Petroleum Council, representing the state s oil producers, hailed the presidential action as  a great step forward for energy security in America,  the organization s president Ron Ness told Reuters.Keystone XL is a shortcut proposed for the existing system that carries oil and gas from Alberta s shale fields in Canada to Steele City, Nebraska. The segment would have run through Montana, South Dakota and Nebraska. Despite being initially in favor of the pipeline, the Obama administration rejected it in November 2015, citing its  overinflated role in [US] political discourse. Obama likewise blocked the final stretch of the Dakota Access (DAPL) pipeline in December, after US military veterans joined Native Americans protesting the construction under Lake Oahe, the principal water source for the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe in North Dakota. Most of the 1,172-mile-long pipeline from North Dakota s Bakken shale fields to Illinois has already been completed.Asked about #DakotaAccessPipeline & #Keystone, Spicer says #Trump's focus is jobs, the economy & using US resources https:\\u002f\\u002ft.co\\u002fm96ivKU6bR pic.twitter.com\\u002f10MSqpx5YL  RT America (@RT_America) January 23, 2017Both Trump and his nominee for Energy Secretary Rick Perry held shares in Energy Transfer Partners, the company building DAPL, but have since divested of them, according to their attorneys.Following media reports that Trump would revive the pipeline projects, shares of TransCanada, Energy Transfer Partners LP and Energy Transfer Equity LP went up 1.1 percent, 3.3 percent and 1.7 percent respectively, Bloomberg noted.Continue this report at RTREAD MORE TRUMP NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Trump FilesSUPPORT OUR WORK BY SUBSCRIBING & BECOMING A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV\"],[\"Fun fact: While Trump press secretary Sean Spicer fielded 55 questions on February 14 related to the Flynn debacle, Obama s press secretary Jay Carney received only 13 questions from reporters on September 12, 2012, three of which were set-ups to blast Mitt Romney s criticism of the administration after the attack. 55 to 13.So as we now suffer through yet another patch of media mania, conspiracy theories, and unsubstantiated claims about how Trump hearts Russia, as well as the daily beatings endured by Spicer, let s reminisce to when the media and Obama s press flaks spun, deflected even joked about golf and  Saturday Night Live! less than a week after Benghazi.Buried deep beneath the Michael Flynn hysteria this week was Judicial Watch s release of newly obtained State Department documents related to the Benghazi terrorist attack on September 11, 2012. One email confirms again that the Obama administration knew the day after the attack it was not a random act of violence stemming from an anti-Muslim video. That was the excuse shamefully propagated by top Obama administration officials (including the president himself) and swallowed whole by a media establishment desperate to help Obama win re-election six weeks later.According to the summary of a call on September 12, 2012 between State Department Under-Secretary Patrick Kennedy and several congressional staffers, Kennedy was asked if the attack came under cover of protest:  No this was a direct breaching attack,  he answered. Kennedy also denied the attack was coordinated with the protests in Cairo over the video:  Attack in Cairo was a demonstration. There were no weapons shown or used. A few cans of spray paint. But of course nothing matches the audacity of trope by Obama s National Security Advisor Susan Rice on September 16, 2012. Rice went on several Sunday shows to peddle a story she knew was completely phony, one that was already quickly unraveling even as most in the media and administration tried to keep it intact.Rice repeats the line that Benghazi attack was not premediated and was connected to the demonstrations in Cairo over the video (a document obtained by Judicial Watch last year shows Hillary Clinton met with Rice a few days before her television appearances). Which presidential administration is fact-challenged, again?In a press gaggle on Air Force One the next day, guess how many times Deputy Press Secretary Josh Earnest was asked about Rice s comments? Ten? Five? One? Not once. Let me repeat that. The day after Obama s national security advisor was on five news programs to blame a terrorist attack on a YouTube video, not one reporter asked the White House about it. I actually had to re-read the transcripts several times, even checking the date over and over, to make sure this was accurate. Her name did not even come up.No discussion about the investigation. No discussion about emerging evidence from around the world that Benghazi was indeed a terrorist attack. (The only time it was mentioned was when Jen Psaki criticized Mitt Romney s comments about how the administration handled Benghazi and questioned whether he was ready for  primetime. )Here s what they did discuss: Debate prep, Occupy Wall Street, and the Chicago s teachers strike. An actual human reporter asked this:  It was a beautiful weekend for golf and he wasn t out on the course. Is it safe to assume maybe he was doing some preparation at the White House?  WHAT?

Since the original story disintegrated before their eyes, they re now turning to other, ahem, methods to show that Hillary was really behind Crites  non-assassination attempt.Crites is a #NeverTrumper, but is still a Republican and has no ties to Hillary that anyone s aware of. Nevertheless, Trump is among the first who tried to paint him as such by asking how much Hillary had paid him to protest at his rally. That was just before he told his people to get Crites out of there.There are stories floating around claiming that, because Crites  name has been mentioned on Wikileaks, he must be a paid Hillary shill. Nobody could ever possibly show up on the joke that is Wikileaks if they re not connected to Hillary in some way, right? Right. Ha.    Crites  name apparently does show up on Wikileaks, but even this right-wing site says they re not in connection with any of Podesta s emails. Rather, he shows up in connection with a company called Stratfor, which is a global intelligence agency The Atlantic characterizes as  just The Economist a week later and several hundred times more expensive. Yet Wikileaks claims that Stratfor is a front for a global network of shadowy informants and spies, and even publishes its  payment laundering scheme  for those people. The truth is that Stratfor is, more or less, a joke among analysts and others who actually know what s going on in the world, and their methods of information gathering are no different than journalistic methods.In other words, in reporting this, Wikileaks appears desperate to The Atlantic, and the people screaming  SMOKING HILLARY GUN!!  because Crites  name appears in a few Wikileaks dumps are just as pitifully desperate.They don t care, though. They re going about their task of  exposing  the connection between Trump s  assassin  and Hillary with all the gleeful abandon there is in the badly misinformed, paranoid extremist.Mediaite also found evidence that these poor, desperate souls are creating fake profiles for Austyn Crites trying to link him to Hillary. The one that they screencapped is a little too obvious to be serious because it lists him as a money launderer for the Clinton Foundation and a paid protester for the DNC. It also claims he studied Civil Disobedience at the University of Chicago s Booth School of Business.They re getting just flat out ridiculous now, especially given that James Comey just crushed their hopes of any indictment against Hillary over new emails, and the Secret Service destroyed their dreams of proving that Hillary s hiring people to murder Donald Trump.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla\\u002fGetty Images \"],[\"Amateur president Donald Trump blasted rival Hillary Clinton while on the campaign trail as  low energy.  He said Clinton takes naps  and added,  No naps for Trump. I don t take naps. We don t have time!  Since that time, Trump has taken three vacations, gone an a thank you tour and on Saturday, he held a rally   less than a month after being sworn in. Trump is not handling the presidency very well. Adjusting to the most difficult job in the world hasn t been easy for the 70-year-old. This from a man who said in reference to ISIS,  I alone can fix it.  Perhaps Trump didn t really want the job. He did want adoration from his supporters, though.According to Axios  Mike Allen s latest newsletter, a Trump adviser told him that Trump is experiencing  cabin fever  in the White House.Business Insider reports:Trump is reportedly experiencing headaches and frustration that he can t spend his evenings dining at restaurants like he could around Trump Tower in his old neighborhood in New York City.Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders were both far more qualified for the job but Trump supporters thought bringing in a man with zero political experience was the way to go.Instead of doing his job, Trump held a campaign-style rally in Melbourne, Florida Saturday in which he filled his speech with lie after lie. That was just after he blasted the  fake news  media. By the way, he s given press credentials to a fake news site. Whatever Trump accuses someone of, he s guilty of that same thing.During the rally, Trump tried to defend his Muslim ban by fabricating a terror attack in Sweden which never happened.Allen writes that that blunder was  partially about Trump management.  That s three fake terror attacks team Trump has used to defend his travel ban of citizens from seven predominately Muslim countries, none of which committed an act of terror on U.S. soil.Trump is to spend Sunday interviewing candidates to replace Mike Flynn, the disgraced former national security adviser who was ousted over his conversations with a Russian ambassador about lifting sanctions.Photo by Win McNamee\\u002fGetty Images.\"],[\"\\\"Writing on Twitter Sunday, the All in the Family star mentioned a Fox News report about the Trump campaign s alleged collusion with Russia during the 2016 election.

Some nominees waited hundreds of days for just a hearing, and others have waited even longer for a confirmation.And with that, one nominee, who has waited over 820 days for a confirmation, has died.The New York Times reports that Cassandra Butts, a worker in government and non profit entities, died suddenly at the age of 50 on May 24 of acute leukemia, which she did not know she had until shortly before her death. President Obama and the White House, recognizing her passion for helping others through public service, tapped her to serve as the United States ambassador to the Bahamas.Butts had worked for multiple branches of the government, including lawmakers on Capitol Hill and the White House counsel.Butts sailed through hearings in May 2014, and all seemed on track for a swift confirmation to a seemingly unimportant position, which urgently needed filling. So far, the Bahamas hasn t had a proper ambassador for 1,647 days.But, in typical Washington form, Republicans held up her nomination, not because she wasn t qualified, but because they literally hate President Obama.And it isn t fair to link all Senate Republicans to this hold up. Only two Republicans can be single handedly blamed for this: Tom Cotton and Ted Cruz.Is anyone surprised? Cruz, up in arms over the Iran nuclear deal, placed a hold on the confirmation on all State Department nominations, which of course included Butts.Cruz couldn t get his way, so naturally he unleashed a scorched earth policy on all those even remotely associated with the President.But it was Senator Tom Cotton   better known as  Tehran Tom  by progressive advocates   who proved to be a nefarious monstrosity in the whole matter. In seeking to punish the Obama Administration over a Secret Service leak of private information about a member of Congress, specifically targeted Butts and the Norwegian and Swedish ambassador nominees. After making a fool of himself, Cotton lifted the hold on the Scandinavian ambassadors. But he kept the hold on Butts.As the New York Times reports:Cotton eventually released the two other holds, but not the one on Butts. She told me that she once went to see him about it, and he explained that he knew that she was a close friend of Obama s   the two first encountered each other on a line for financial-aid forms at Harvard Law School, where they were classmates   and that blocking her was a way to inflict special pain on the presidentAnd there you have it. Because Republicans hate the President so much, they upheld a qualified, dignified, and devoted public servant from serving in a position that yields almost no political power.And now she has died, never getting the grace of a confirmation vote.That s how the Republicans have chosen to govern. They should be so proud of all their  accomplishments.

After all, he was calm and smooth in the face of attack after attack from his opponent, Democratic presidential nominee Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia. However, there s just one VERY BIG problem there: Pence flat-out lied throughout the debate. Well, this is likely something that people are just casual, general election political observers don t know. But, certainly pundits and political nerds knew this right away, and the non-partisan fact-checking operation Politifact was ready to call Pence out on his many, many lies. Here are just a few highlights:Pence:  Hillary Clinton failed to renegotiate a status of forces agreement. We rated this claim Mostly False. In 2011, the Obama administration was negotiating with the Iraqi government to give American troops immunity prosecution by Iraqis   a touchy political issue.There s debate on whether the Americans could have worked out a deal, but Pence is wrong to suggest Clinton is to blame. The key decisions and discussions took place between the White House itself and Iraqi leaders.Pence:  They want to expand (Obamacare) into a single-payer program. Clinton and Kaine have proposed a public option   a government-sponsored insurance plan   but they have not proposed single-payer. Clinton has consistently resisted going in that direction and instead proposes to work to prevent the repeal of Obamacare and try to improve on it.Pence s claim is Mostly False.Pence: Donald Trump  never said that  more nations should get nuclear weapons.Mostly False. Trump has said some countries, namely Japan and South Korea, might be  better off  if they were to develop nuclear weapons, given their proximity to North Korea. However, he has also said   often in the same interview   that he opposes nuclear proliferation in general.Pence:  We delivered $400 million in cash as a ransom payment for Americans held by the radical mullahs in Tehran.This  ransom  line, which we ve previously heard from Trump, is Mostly False. Iran received the payment on the same day that American prisoners were released, but experts said this was not ransom. The United States owed Iran the money as part of a decades-long financial dispute.Pence:  Less than 10 cents on the dollar in the Clinton Foundation has gone to charitable causes. This is a repeated Republican talking point and it s inaccurate. While it s true that the foundation gives away in grants a small fraction of its resources, about 87 percent of its expenses go toward services it provides directly.And that s just a few. The entire analysis of the truthfulness of the vice presidential candidates  claims can be found here at Politifact.Overall, Mike Pence had to walk a very difficult tight rope Tuesday night. While he might have won when it comes to a calm, cool style, he failed miserably on substance. Perhaps that is because when it comes down to it, his running mate is a racist, misogynist, pathological liar and a dangerous demagogue who should never be anywhere near the Oval Office. To that end, Pence s strategy seemed to be to insist that the more outrageous things that Donald Trump has said throughout this horrific travesty of a presidential campaign aren t true, and to run away from clearly indefensible positions. Or maybe he s just drank the Kool-Aid they regularly serve up at Trump Tower, and actually thinks he is telling the truth and being reasonable.Either way, it s insanity. Thank goodness for fact-checkers to help set the American people straight in this nightmare of a presidential election season.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla\\u002fGetty Images\"],[\"You know things are going badly for the GOP President-Elect when even Fox News begins to turn on him. In an interview with Fox s Chris Wallace on Fox News Sunday, Trump was grilled about his conflicts of interest and about his similar accusations toward Hillary Clinton.Wallace asked Trump about his campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, telling CNN that Trump would continue his role as executive producer for Celebrity Apprentice in his  spare time.  as well as the fact Trump plans on keeping a stake in his real estate business while in the White House.  Isn t that a huge conflict of interest, sir?  Wallace asked.Trump s response was that it was okay because everyone in the world knows he s a big real estate tycoon and he denied that he will be involved in the management of the company.To Wallace s credit (and I don t say that often), the Fox anchor countered that Trump  hammered Hillary Clinton over the Clinton Foundation and pay to play. Trump responded that that was  different because she takes massive amounts of money from foreign countries.  That s not true, but Fox didn t point that out.Wallace continued, noting that Trump will also be making  massive amounts of money  because  foreign countries are already booking events at the Trump hotel in D.C.,  and that Trump has  business operations, deals with foreign countries isn t this on steroids. Trump was seemingly appalled, but Wallace went on, saying that foreign governments were trying to curry favor with the United States through Trump s hotels.Trump, though, made the claim that he is  turning down billions of dollars in deals  because of potential conflicts of interest, but he did claim that he didn t know if he d be  doing deals,  and said that  under the law (he has) the right to do it,  but he doesn t want to.Here s the video:It s becoming increasingly clear that Trump is a danger, not just for domestic policy, but that he and his conflicts of interest present a real threat to the world. This issue is resonating with the American people, nearly 2\\u002f3rds of whom have expressed concern with Trump s conflicts of interest. As for why Fox is waking up to that reality now, and not before the election, well, perhaps they see it as their ticket out of a wildcard Trump presidency. They would much rather deal with a President Mike Pence.Featured image via screenshot\"],[\"So here s a funny hypothetical: You re a White House Communications Director. You ve settled into your office in the West Wing. You have a definite connection with the boss   your speaking styles are similar, you come from the same moneyed and even geographical background, and just for good measure, let s say you both are known to engage in the occasional  locker room talk.  Honestly, you re over the moon at landing this job, because you ve been after it for half a year, and god knows there have been some twerps standing in your way.There s really only one thing you should be concerned with, and that s knowing how to do this. Maybe Anthony Scaramucci got so excited to work for Donald Trump that he forgot to learn that last part. And if this hypothetical were about you, dear reader, I can t imagine that you d overlook a teensy detail like knowing how to do things  off the record. The Mooch s downfall came from the hilariously bad telephone conversation he had with Ryan Lizza, Washington correspondent for the New Yorker. Scaramucci called Lizza to try and ascertain the identity of a  leaker  who had told him about a dinner Donald Trump attended. That phone call was, as everyone now knows, recorded.Now Mooch is claiming that Ryan Lizza broke the law. Or rather, he s insinuating it..@RyanLizza is the Linda Tripp of 2017. People know. And he is up at night not being able to live with himself.  Anthony Scaramucci (@Scaramucci) August 10, 2017Linda Tripp, of course, is the woman who recorded over 20 hours of telephone conversations with Monica Lewinski, whose dalliances with Bill Clinton ended with impeachment in the House of Representatives. There are questions to this day whether or not Tripp broke the law: Maryland law still dictates that all parties must consent to the taping of a phone call, but courts there ruled at the time that the law didn t apply to people who didn t know it was illegal. She broke the law, but if she didn t know she was breaking the law, she didn t break it. Ooookay.So of course that led to the question:Are you accusing him of taping the call without your permission?  Roland Scahill (@rolandscahill) August 10, 2017And the succinct, albeit editorialized, answer:Yes. He absolutely taped the call without my permission. #lowlife https:\\u002f\\u002ft.co\\u002ffTDcBw4vcT  Anthony Scaramucci (@Scaramucci) August 10, 2017Scaramucci, like his former boss, thinks that any offense committed against him must somehow be a crime. We learned from the phone call to Lizza that Mooch believed  leaking  his (publicly available) financial disclosures to the press wasn t just a crime but a felony for which he promised to involve the FBI and DOJ. So does he think Lizza (hashtag lowlife), by recording without his  permission,  broke the law as well?Turns out it doesn t matter. In Washington D.C.   where both ends of the phone call took place   taping a telephone conversation requires only the consent of one party. Don t wonder too long about whether hitting a button to start recording is consent from one: It is. And from his tweets today, Ryan Lizza is definitely not losing sleep over it.Sorry, Mooch. You re still the dipshit who just didn t know how to do his job.

Shortly after Conway criticized the recount effort, Trump chimed in with a statement of his own. In Trump s response, he blamed Stein and the Green Party for their  ridiculous  recount  scam  and accused Stein of trying to profit from it. Trump said: The people have spoken and the election is over, and as Hillary Clinton herself said on election night, in addition to her conceding by congratulating me,  We must accept this result and then look to the future. It is important to point out that with the help of millions of voters across the country, we won 306 electoral votes on Election Day   the most of any Republican since 1988   and we carried nine of 13 battleground states, 30 of 50 states, and more than 2,600 counties nationwide   the most since President Ronald Reagan in 1984. This recount is just a way for Jill Stein, who received less than one percent of the vote overall and wasn t even on the ballot in many states, to fill her coffers with money, most of which she will never even spend on this ridiculous recount. All three states were won by large numbers of voters, especially Pennsylvania, which was won by more than 70,000 votes. This is a scam by the Green Party for an election that has already been conceded, and the results of this election should be respected instead of being challenged and abused, which is exactly what Jill Stein is doing. Trump is right that Clinton conceded the election, but she s not legally bound to that   and it s especially insane that Trump would use her concession as part of his argument because he once said he wouldn t concede. Another glaring mistake in Trump s argument is his  the people have spoken  statement, which is hilarious considering Clinton won the popular vote by a landslide, as The Atlantic s David Frum pointed out:TwitterIn Wisconsin, there have already been four precincts that were reported to have discrepancies. Trump and his team are not hiding their anxiety over this issue very well, and they have every reason to be worried.Featured image via Win McNamee and Ty Wright \\u002f Getty Images\"],[\"Can you put a price on bigotry? North Carolina Republicans just did. It s $500,000.North Carolina is a state precariously placed in the danger zones of both hurricanes and tornadoes. It s suffered its fair share of disastrous floods. It s warm enough to be a fertile ground for the mosquitoes experts warn could be spreading the devastating Zika virus. So it s more than just a little crazy that Republican Governor Pat McCrory announced that he would be robbing his state s own disaster relief fund to pay for the defense of his illegal trans bathroom bill.Led by McCrory, state Republicans have diverted half a million dollars from the state s  Emergency Response and Disaster Relief  fund and say they will use it to hire lawyers to fight tooth-and-nail against the federal government which has deemed the anti-trans bill known as HB2 unconstitutional. Considering how obvious it is that this violates the Civil Rights Act, the money will serve only to delay the inevitable for as long as possible.The law has already cost the state tens of millions of dollars in lost business, boycotts, and bad press. Adding the $500,000 is only going to make things worse. This is particularly dire because the fight against the Zika virus continues to go unfunded at the federal level. A recent bill proposed by Republicans to give some of the funds was shot down by Democrats after they insisted on including an amendment to defund Obamacare. The premise, to take away millions of Americans health insurance during the outbreak of a potential health epidemic was, to put it lightly, repugnant on every level.So rather than get serious at a state level, North Carolina decided to defund itself. It will now head into the eye of the Zika storm with a pitiable amount of money to combat it. Instead, they will pay for a few lawyers to ensure trans people are victimized for just a few months longer.

Source: Wikicommons)Miles Elliott 21st Century Wire For the past few days, news outlets have been reporting on the Trump Administration and CIA s announcement to end the controversial covert program to arm and train  moderate rebels  fighting to overthrow the Syrian government of Bashar al Assad. While many who want peace in Syria see this move as a step in the right direction, others still doubt that the underlying goal of ousting Assad has been abandoned completely. The decision may serve a number of purposes, but the long-term goals of the US and its close coalition allies do not change easily, and removing President Assad from power has been a centerpiece of their regional restructuring plan for a very long time.Does the announcement really mean that Trump is going to leave Assad alone? Is the US turning a corner in Syria and finally learning from the mistakes it made in Iraq and Libya? Is it really a concession to Russia? Is Trump finally actualizing his campaign rhetoric that seemed to reject America s foreign wars?Not likely.Of course, it s possible that Trump is at odds with other factions in the US government s military and foreign policy establishment, possibly because he recognizes the danger of arming terrorists and the political damage this might do to his own reputation as a leader who is  tough on terror.  Such a belief however, might be extremely generous to Trump, especially considering how under his authority the US military has dangerously escalated several wars, not just in Syria, but also in Yemen, and probably soon in Afghanistan.A more likely explanation is that the Trump administration and a complicit mainstream media are trying to manage public perceptions regarding six years of troublesome US involvement in Syria. In a bait-and-switch type PR deception, Washington might be attempting to generate the perception of de-escalation   even as the US increases its presence in Syria.Consider the SourceWithin hours of this story breaking, it had been covered by major outlets from across the mainstream media, and since that time there have been a variety of reactions from different commentators and media platforms.Some, such as former US diplomat Jim Jatras, are hailing the decision as a  game-changer .Others, like New York Times journalist Nicholas Kristof (one of the first in the mainstream media to promote the White Helmets) called it a  major gift to Russia .Middle East  expert  Charles Lister claims it will strengthen terrorists in Syria, while numerous others are saying it will weaken the terrorists.Many of these reactions, however, as well as all of the reporting on this decision, all seem to stem from a single story in The Washington Post. That said, there are a few things that should be pointed out about this original story Washington Post and the CIAIt is well known that Amazon chairman and CEO Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post. It is also public knowledge that the CIA has a contract with Amazon to use its cloud computing services. In fact, beginning in 2014 Amazon began providing its services to the CIA under a $600 million contract that is good for up to ten years, making the CIA a long-term customer of Amazon. Seeing as the owner of The Washington Post has a long-term commercial relationship with the CIA, any reporting from that newspaper covering CIA activities could be viewed as a potential conflict of interest. This would be a very unpopular position for any mainstream media outlets to take. Normally, these outlets will unquestioningly repeat this or any story by The Post concerning the CIA, and that s the end of that.NOTE: After this article was published at 21WIRE, Trump came out swinging at Bezos and the  Amazon-Washington Post :The Amazon Washington Post fabricated the facts on my ending massive, dangerous, and wasteful payments to Syrian rebels fighting Assad ..  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 25, 2017Of course this is not to say that the decision to end CIA support to terrorists in Syria has not been taken. Much of that activity will remain classified and certainly redacted if ever released. However, the fact that information was  leaked exclusively  to the Washington Post by unnamed US officials may indicate a desire to have the story spun in a particular way for particular reasons. Syrian  rebels  fire missiles toward the towns of Kafarya and Foua (Photo: Qasioun News Agency. Source: Wikicommons)Focus on RussiaA major element of the spin on the The Washington Post story can be found in the headline:  Trump ends covert CIA program to arm anti-Assad rebels in Syria, a move sought by Moscow  (emphasis added). From the outset, the Post is portraying the decision to stop arming groups trying to overthrow the Syrian government as a concession to Russia.This is clearly one of the themes of the article, as it also appears in quotes from an unnamed official who said,  Putin won in Syria , and from Charles Lister, who stated:  We are falling into a Russian trap.  In total, Russia, Moscow, Putin or the Kremlin are mentioned no less than 20 times in the article, a clear sign of The Post s attempt to place Trump s decision in the context of Russian interests in Syria.There are several obvious problems with this narrative, however.Firstly, it is implied that if Russia  wins  in Syria, that America somehow  loses   but is that really the case? One of the points Trump campaigned on is that US and Russian interests in Syria are actually aligned in the wider fight to defeat ISIS and radical Islamist terror.Secondly, there is zero evidence to indicate that the decision to end CIA support for terrorist groups in Syria was driven by Russia   but that hasn t stopped many in the mainstream media, like New York Times writer Nicholas Kristof, and Washington establishment figures like John McCain, for inferring a Russian conspiracy is at play. It is true that The Post s article was published within two weeks of the recent ceasefire in southwestern Syria agreed by the US, Russia and Jordan. On the other hand, it is acknowledged that the decision to halt the  train and equip  program in Syria was made a month ago, after a White House meeting between Trump, national security advisor H R McMaster, and CIA Director Mike Pompeo.At most, leaking the story to the press may have been an empty gesture toward Russia, but facts on the ground still indicate that the conflict in Syria is being escalated in other ways, as we shall see. Independent journalist Gareth Porter offers this analysis: By 2016, when the Syrian government, with the support of the Russians and Iranians and others, were able to push the al-Qaeda-led rebels out of Aleppo, really the major part of the conflict between the rebels and the Assad government was completed. And from then on I think the fate of this program was really sealed The decision to announce this clearly followed the agreement that was reached very recently with the Russians on a ceasefire in southern Syria  And so to announce it was a gesture in part towards the Russians, but the idea that has been reported in some news media that somehow this is a concession to the Russians is totally false. That really doesn t follow logically, in terms of the nature of the decision and the timing of it. Furthermore, to believe the decision is a  gift  to Russia is to completely discount the fact that arming terrorists is simply wrong, or at the very least dangerous. As former US diplomat Jim Jatras stated: It doesn t occur to some people that not supporting terrorists is the right thing for America, having nothing to do with Russia. Thirdly, in light of the year-long string of unsubstantiated and unproven accusations perpetuated by US mainstream media that somehow the Trump team  colluded  with Russia to affect the outcome of the US presidential election, pushing the Russian angle to this story in Syria appears to be an attempt to add fuel to that fire. However, if one unpacks the rationale underlying this suggestion, it becomes clear how illogical it really is.As it turns out, even US commanders do not subscribe to the Russian conspiracy theory angle regarding the CIA stopping arms to  rebels  in Syria. This was confirmed by U.S. Army General Raymond Thomas, head of Special Operations Command, who told the Aspen Security Forum in Colorado the following this past week: At least from what I know about that program and the decision to end it, (it was) absolutely not a sop to the Russians.  If mainstream media institutions like The Post object to alleged Russian interference in US elections, they presumably do so on the grounds that foreign interference in a sovereign country s domestic affairs is  against the rules  of the international community. If that is the case, then surely they must also object to the funding and arming of terrorist or  rebel  groups by one country to overthrow the government of another. If The Post were being consistent, and not hypocritical in their editorial line, then any disapproval at the unsubstantiated allegation that Russia interfered  nonviolently   with America s democracy, should be matched by unbridled outrage at the US funding, training and arming terrorists in Syria to violently overthrow its government. Free Syrian Army vehicle equipped with anti-aircraft weapon. (Photo: Qasioun News Agency. Source: Wikicommons)At the root of all three of these problems with this article and its paper s stance toward Russia is the belief in American exceptionalism   which is particularly strong in the US  defense  establishment and which is what gives the US license to break the very same rules that it enforces on other countries.The idea of American exceptionalism was explicitly countered by Vladimir Putin in his editorial for the New York Times (published after the 2013 chemical weapons incident in Ghouta when the US was on the brink of going to war in Syria) in which he stated: It is extremely dangerous to encourage people to see themselves as exceptional, whatever the motivation. There are big countries and small countries, rich and poor, those with long democratic traditions and those still finding their way to democracy. Their policies differ, too. We are all different, but when we ask for the Lord s blessings, we must not forget that God created us equal. Goodbye CIA, Hello PentagonAmerican exceptionalism taken to its logical conclusion has also resulted in the doctrine of  full spectrum dominance . In the current era of full-spectrum or hybrid warfare, there are many tools in the US government s belt. So even as this particular CIA program ends, there are myriad ways in which the US might continue its involvement in the destablization and possible dismembering of the Syrian nation-state.The most obvious is that the Pentagon and US military are expanding their presence in Syria. The Post states that the US military s anti-ISIS air campaign will continue, as will the Pentagon s  train-and-equip  program for the primarily Kurdish militias operating around Raqqa.However, The Post completely fails to mention the presence of American and allied troops on the ground in Syria. Last month 21WIRE warned of the danger of escalation from the presence of US and British troops stationed near al-Tanf in the southeast of Syria. Since then the buildup has continued, and within the past few weeks 21WIRE reported on the series of eight US military bases established inside Syrian borders, complete with heavy weapons such as the HIMARS rocket system.Gareth Porter summarized it this way: The United States has created this alleged stake in the conflict in Syria over the last few years, over the ISIS presence in Raqqa and surrounding areas. Once the US began its bombing program both in Iraq and in Syria against ISIS, that created a whole set of new dynamics which inevitably in the nature of the US political-military-intelligence complex, created a constant forward movement of military and intelligence activities We have now more US military personnel in the area near Raqqa than ever before, we have more special forces there, we have more helicopters, we have more CIA people. In other words they ve created an entirely new dynamic here that is going to be very difficult to break. It s going to be very difficult to reverse it. Within the past few days it has also been reported that significant numbers of US military armored vehicles are arriving in areas to the north of Raqqa, not for use by Kurdish SDF fighters in the region but   according to a US spokesperson    for use by the Coalition .There is also the question of other countries funneling weapons and\\u002for terrorists into Syria. In particular, American allies Turkey, Israel and Saudi Arabia have all played important roles in building up and perpetuating the conflict in Syria so far, and there is no reason to believe that they will cease doing so.For instance, Syrian news agency SANA frequently reports on seizures of Israeli-made weapons within Syrian borders. Another example can be found in a previous story broken by Bulgarian journalist Dilyana Gaytandzhieva, in which she discovered ships were being used for transporting weapons into Syria via Saudi Arabian ports.So it is possible that whatever support is being withdrawn from terrorist factions in Syria could be redirected through cooperating countries or other conduits and still reach the same destination.Truth vs NarrativeIt is often said that truth is the first casualty of war. As regular readers of 21WIRE will already be aware, the levels of propaganda and deception in mainstream media narratives have reached new heights in coverage of the conflict in Syria. Even terms such as  moderate rebel  and  Assad regime  in common usage used by The Post and its ilk are tools of propaganda explicitily designed to legitimize the construction of a foreign-funded mercenary force to overthrow the government of Syria.The truth, however, is rising.For instance, the recent article, How America Armed Terrorists in Syria, spelled out just that: By helping its Sunni allies provide weapons to al Nusra Front and its allies and by funneling into the war zone sophisticated weapons that were bound to fall into al Nusra hands or strengthen their overall military position, U.S. policy has been largely responsible for having extended al Qaeda s power across a significant part of Syrian territory. The CIA and the Pentagon appear to be ready to tolerate such a betrayal of America s stated counter-terrorism mission. Unless either Congress or the White House confronts that betrayal explicitly, as Tulsi Gabbard s legislation would force them to do, U.S. policy will continue to be complicit in the consolidation of power by al Qaeda in Syria, even if the Islamic State is defeated there. So not only are the  rebels  not moderate, in many cases they are actually al Qaeda, the raison d etre for the War on Terror.Public awareness of this fact has been increasing, and in January Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii introduced the Stop Arming Terrorists Act into the House of Representatives, while Senator Rand Paul, who has opposed the arming of Syrian opposition groups for years, introduced the bill in the Senate. On introducing the bill Rep. Gabbard s remarks included the statement: If you or I gave money, weapons or support to Al-Qaeda or ISIS, we would be thrown in jail. Yet the US government has been violating this law for years, quietly supporting allies and partners of Al-Qaeda, ISIL, Jabhat Fateh al Sham and other terrorist groups with money, weapons, and intelligence support, in their fight to overthrow the Syrian government. Then, within the past two weeks, 21WIRE covered the latest stunning chapter in a story broken by independent journalist Gaytandzhieva, which documents in full detail how hundreds of tons of heavy weapons were trafficked via protected diplomatic flights from various NATO member states and allies (including the US) to conflict zones around the the Middle East, Central Asia and Africa. Some of these arms ended up in the hands of al-Nusra, the al-Qaeda franchise in Syria.Stories like those on covert weapons shipments; statements like the one above from Tulsi Gabbard; the introduction of the Stop Arming Terrorists Act; stories such as How America Armed Terrorists in Syria; and the rising influence of independent media outlets like 21WIRE among others, are all contributing to the rising awareness that the US government has been funding, training and arming terrorists in Syria.It is likely that Trump s decision to end the CIA program supporting the anti-Assad terrorists in Syria  however meaningful it was or was not  was in part a response to this growing awareness. Although on the surface the decision by Trump seems to be a positive step towards a peaceful resolution of the conflict in Syria, by no means does it mean an end to the conflict or even a withdrawal of US or other foreign interference with Syrian affairs. It is more likely that this announcement is yet another distraction  a further exercise in perception management  and that the objective to remove Assad remains in place under other guises using other means.More on this from The Washington Post  A unit of the Southern Front, which received money and weapons from the US, et al. (Photo: Mutasim Billah Brigade, Daraa. Source: Wikicommons)Greg Jaffe and Adam Entous The Washington PostPresident Trump has decided to end the CIA s covert program to arm and train moderate Syrian rebels battling the government of Bashar al-Assad, a move long sought by Russia, according to U.S. officials.The program was a central plank of a policy begun by the Obama administration in 2013 to put pressure on Assad to step aside, but even its backers have questioned its efficacy since Russia deployed forces in Syria two years later.Officials said the phasing out of the secret program reflects Trump s interest in finding ways to work with Russia, which saw the anti-Assad program as an assault on its interests. The shuttering of the program is also an acknowledgment of Washington s limited leverage and desire to remove Assad from power.Just three months ago, after the United States accused Assad of using chemical weapons, Trump launched retaliatory airstrikes against a Syrian air base. At the time, U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, said that  in no way do we see peace in that area with Assad at the head of the Syrian government.

We already have millions of illegals from Central America that we cannot and should not support. We now know that small towns across America like Athens, GA and Spartanburg, SC are being targeted for a influx of muslim refugees. Because it s very secretive (for obvious reasons), you need to keep your ear to the ground and push back like Athens and Spartanburg. Below is a fantastic piece that will fill you in on what s REALLY going on:With Muslim immigrants streaming into the United States at a rate of 100,000 per year, some of the communities targeted for new arrivals are seeking information on their new neighbors, only to be frustrated by federal bureaucrats and their hired contractors.How does a city get on the U.S. State Department s list of 190 communities selected for refugee resettlement? How can cities find out who will be coming and when? What services will they use, and what will be the cost to taxpayers?And, the granddaddy of all questions: Can the communities be assured that foreign nationals with ties to ISIS, al-Shabab and other Islamic terrorist groups won t slip through the government s porous screening process posing as  refugees ?The answers to these questions are simple. Very little information is available. And there are no guarantees that some very bad apples won t arrive in your town, says a leading expert on the refugee resettlement program. One community that is trying to get information right now is Spartanburg, South Carolina.On March 16, Ann Corcoran, author of the Refugee Resettlement Watch blog, spoke at a national security summit in Columbia, South Carolina, hosted by former Defense Department analyst Frank Gaffney. A few days before that conference, on March 9, a story broke in the local Spartanburg newspaper that World Relief, one of the nine resettlement agencies that works under contract with the federal government, was planning to open an office in Spartanburg.When an agency like World Relief opens an office in a city, it means refugees will be arriving soon. There are no public hearings or announcements in local media, Corcoran said. Typically a story will appear in the local newspaper just before or after the first arrivals appear in town.Corcoran met some activists at Gaffney s conference who wanted to find out more about the plans for resettling United Nations-certified refugees in their city. It is like pulling teeth to get any information,  Corcoran said.  And these are long-term grassroots activists who know how to get information. One of the activists is Christina Jeffrey, a political science professor and former U.S. House of Representatives historian who ran against Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., in last year s Republican primary. Gowdy is now chairman of the House subcommittee on immigration and refugees. He is chair of this committee, and so they want to set up a refugee office in his home district, and we still can t get any information,  Corcoran said.Jeffrey has asked the federal government to prepare a comprehensive impact statement, detailing the impact the refugees will have on Spartanburg s public services. Schools, health facilities, housing, the job market and public welfare programs will all be affected, but so far nobody is saying to what extent.The mayor of Athens, Georgia, who asked for the same type of report last year, encountered the same blackout of information.St. Cloud, Minnesota, residents have also inquired about how many more Somali refugees will be arriving in light of recent problems with Somali student protests at a local community college. Dozens of other Somalis have either left the country to fight for al-Shabab or ISIS while others have been charged and convicted with sending material support to overseas terrorist organizations. They re trying to get information because residents have heard the rumor that there are 1,500 more Somalis getting ready to be resettled there in St. Cloud,  Corcoran said.The resettlement agencies hold lots of meetings and place lots of phone calls with  stakeholders  in the targeted communities, but these collaborative efforts almost always occur outside of the public spotlight. The term  stakeholders  does not apply to you, the taxpayer footing the bill for all of this,  Corcoran said.According to a March 8 article in the Spartanburg Herald-Journal,  a partnership of faith leaders  called Come Closer Spartanburg issued an invitation more than a year ago to World Relief to open a refugee office in Spartanburg. The March 8 article was the first public revelation of this effort even though World Relief had been working behind the scenes with  stakeholders  for a year. An initial group of 65 refugees will arrive this year, starting in April or May, from Congo, Bhutan and Syria.Jeffrey, in a March 30 op-ed in the local newspaper, shed more light on the group, Come Closer Spartanburg, and its goals: On its website, Come Closer Spartanburg describes the city of Spartanburg as  home to what has been identified as the fifth most dangerous neighborhood in the United States. We have extremely high rates of unemployment, poverty and domestic violence. Overall, we were recently listed as the fourth most  miserable  city to live in our country. It does not take long to realize that we are a city in need of transformation. Jeffrey discovered that the objective is to plant a  seed community  in Spartanburg that will eventually blossom and transform the city. The federal government is creating communities within communities often pitted against each other economically and culturally.It s the same tactic that has been used for decades in Europe. Looking at other U.S. cities with new refugee communities, it appears that contractors often keep sending refugees to the same place until there is a community within a community. Unassimilated communities have created problems in Europe, and we are beginning to have similar problems here in the United States (witness Milwaukee, Wis., and Lewiston, Maine),  Jeffrey writes.Corcoran said the word  assimilation  is no longer used by the resettlement agencies and their friends in the federal government. Rather, the new buzzword is  integration.  The goal of integration is to have a multitude of diverse cultures living side by side in  coexistence  but never assimilating.President Obama issued an executive memorandum dated Nov. 21, 2014, to all federal agencies directing them on  Creating Welcoming Communities and Fully Integrated Immigrants and Refugees. This sort of backroom dealing between the federal government, its hired resettlement contractors and local officials is not designed to provide information to the people who live and work in the targeted refugee cities, Corcoran said. They don t like this whole idea that their town is being secretly selected,  she said.  This has been going on for over a year now in Spartanburg, and the refugees are now due to start arriving in a month or so. And these people have no information until it s actually upon them. The mayor of Athens, Nancy Denson, requested a plan. The city of Spartanburg is asking for the same consideration. That s what these people in Spartanburg are asking for, and they are asking that when you have a plan that you present it publicly at a public hearing,  Corcoran said.  They don t want to have to show any of that to the public. They re saying it s only 65; well, it s only 65 for the first year. It will continue to be more every year afterward once you become a seed community. Of the more than 500 Syrian refugees brought to the U.S. so far this past year, 90 percent of them have been Muslim, Corcoran said.Read more: wnd \"],[\"And once again, the snowflakes want to erase parts of history they know nothing about.

Who knew?Trump told his band of merry morons: All of the men, we re petrified to speak to women any more  the women get it better than we do, folks. They get it better than we do. If by  get it  he means  understand  then maybe he s on to something, but if he meant it in terms of have it better off in life, well, then he s absolutely just full of shit.Women earn, on average, only 79% of what men make. This isn t due to men s greater ability, or being smarter, or having more training. It s based upon the fact that they have an extra appendage between their legs that women don t have. And the pay gap is even worse among women of color. Not to mention the fact that many women are treated with far less respect in the work place. Often times their opinions are treated as  hostile  or  bossy  compared to a man s  assertiveness  and  drive to succeed. Trump is a bully, and he thinks that he can belittle women by saying how much they have it  better  than men. He says this because he gets in trouble for belittling them. He doesn t think people should call him out on his misogynistic bullshit. That s what he means by  women get it better,  because women these days are finally being heard, and he hates it. Absolutely despises it.Honestly? Any person who votes for Donald Trump, a man with zero policy or diplomacy experience, is an idiot, but women who vote for Trump? Seriously?

The aim is for the  Progressive Agenda  to become the basis for the Democratic Party s main economic policies, including those of its 2016 presidential candidate.De Blasio has compared his plan to the  Contract with America,  a document released by the Republican Party during the 1994 congressional election and drawn up by future House Speaker Newt Gingrich to serve as the GOP policy agenda.Now WND documents that most of the 13 points in de Blasio s  Progressive Agenda  can also be found in the manifestos and literature of the Communist Party USA and the Socialist Party USA.The full progressive plan, entitled,  The Progressive Agenda to Combat Income Inequality,  can be found on the agenda s new website.Here is a comparison of the Agenda s plan with literature from the manifestos and writings of the Community Party USA, or CPUSA, and the Socialist Party USA, or SPUSA.  Progressive Agenda:  Raise the federal minimum wage, so that it reaches $15\\u002fhour, while indexing it to inflation. SPUSA:  We call for a minimum wage of $15 per hour, indexed to the cost of living. CPUSA: Calls for  struggles for peace, equality for the racially and nationally oppressed, equality for women job creation programs, increased minimum wage.   Even with ultra-right control of the Federal government, peoples legislative victories, such as increasing the minimum wage, can be won on an issue-by-issue basis locally, statewide, and even nationally.  Progressive Agenda:  Pass comprehensive immigration reform to grow the economy and protect against exploitation of low-wage workers. SPUSA:  We defend the rights of all immigrants to education, health care, and full civil and legal rights and call for an unconditional amnesty program for all undocumented people. We oppose the imposition of any fees on those receiving amnesty. We call for full citizenship rights upon demonstrating residency for six months. CPUSA: Declares the  struggle for immigrant rights is a key component of the struggle for working class unity in our country today.  Progressive Agenda:  Make Pre-K, after-school programs and childcare universal. SPUSA:  We support public child care starting from infancy, and public education starting at age three, with caregivers and teachers of young children receiving training, wages, and benefits comparable to that of teachers at every other level of the educational system.  Progressive Agenda:  Earned Income Tax Credit.   Implement the  Buffett Rule  so millionaires pay their fair share. SPUSA:  We call for a steeply graduated income tax and a steeply graduated estate tax.  CPUSA:  No taxes for workers and low and middle income people; progressive taxation of the wealthy and private corporations.  Dems hail  beginning of revolution De Blasio criticized Obama as  too conservative  to assert a progressive economic vision and  too afraid to take the bold kind of action that President Roosevelt took  during the Great Depression, reported the liberal news network.Speaking at the  Progressive Agenda  launch event outside the Capitol building last Tuesday, de Blasio said  something is changing in America. It s time to take that energy and crystallize it into an agenda that will make a difference,  he said.

What  if  it were a goal of government and their security services to ensure that we  feel  we re being watched at every turn, in every-way feasible;  but reality is not exact what we  think  it is and we re doing most of the censoring all by ourselves.Adam Garrie from The Duran takes us on an interesting journey in the below article. It also contains an important element of what we ve talked about on shows at 21st Century Wire and Alternate Current Radio s The Boiler Room regarding this  fourth wall  that people find it difficult to push through, which is  fear . The fear of losing their job, loved ones, social acceptability, and so forth.More on this article from The Duran  Adam Garrie The DuranEven prior to the release of Vault 7 from Wikileaks, people knew that so-called intelligence agencies in western states had the means to spy on their own citizens. Many also assumed that the typical illegality of such activities was of no consequence for agencies and individuals in those agencies who regard themselves as being above the law.Now that we know the CIA and other institutions have such abilities to digitally hack just about every household device from the smart phone and Smart-TV to the good old fashioned PC, the biggest question is, when do these deep state organisations implement these measures to spy on civilians and compromise their lives?The answer can be found without needing to resort to conspiracy theories nor even speculation. The answer lies in the private sector.Organisations like the CIA, MI5, FBI etc., need only do what the private sector isn t all ready doing for them and as it is, the private sector is doing a hell of a lot.If one wonders why major financial, academic, diplomatic, trading, banking, security and even artistic institutions in the West tend to have people on their payrolls who follow the  western ideological narrative , there are two reasons.The first is that people are attracted to like-minded people and by extrapolation like-minded professions.But there is a second more devious reason. Those who think outside the western box, those who  question more  simply cannot get a foot through the door. Technically, one needn t have any view on Vladimir Putin to be on the board of a major western construction company, law firm, private bank or hedge fund. These professions do not involve knowledge of Russian politics or society.  But those who have and even casually express a view of Putin or of the Arab world or of East Asia and Latin America that differs from the neo-lib\\u002fneo-con point of view, are blacklisted.Social media has made this blacklisting easier to do than ever. If two equally qualified candidates were applying for a high level position at a financial institution and one person had a picture of himself at a Hillary Clinton fundraiser on his Facebook and the other had a  Save Palestine  picture or a pro-Putin meme on his social media accounts, there would be no prizes for correctly guessing who would almost certainly get the job.In the words of George Carlin,  It s a big club and you ain t in it .The punitive blacklisting of those who don t follow the CNN\\u002fBBC\\u002fNYT script has a double effect.First of all, it keeps those who think outside the box away from positions of power in the private sector and in most western countries, without a prominent position in the business or mainstream entertainment community, achieving political office is next to impossible.Secondly, there is a powerful deterrent effect. Many people would like to post pro-Putin, pro-Donbass, pro-Syria or pro-Palestine items on social media, but they are afraid that it could cost them their job, their bonus or even their friends. In the west such things can break-up families. It happens every day. At this very movement, someone in a western country is contemplating suicide because of being on the losing end of a divorce settlement. Very sad, yet very true.This Kafkaesque reality is achieved without the CIA needing to hack people s phones or computers. The private sector does the job for them.For every tabloid story about a woman losing her job because she posted a photo of her genitals on-line, there are many more people who are professionally compromised for posting photos of patriotic Russian or Arab leaders.Throughout the 20th century, the private sector has always been happy to do the bidding of the deep state. Hollywood was largely compliant with the  red scare  tactics of the 1950s and frankly, Hollywood producers did more to censor free-speech than the drunk and soon discredited Joseph McCarthy ever could have done.Why should the CIA waste time and money to read people s emails, when their much more local boss, or chairman of  human relations  can take a quick look at Facebook and achieve the CIA s goal far more easily?The answer is that they don t. The beauty of a police state is that unquestioning citizens are deputies of the secret police and they work for free.

What s new are the other reports or observations of Hillary Clinton s behavior or mannerisms   as well as her dysphasia, the fact that she s fallen, she has had a concussion, there are really interesting things out there,  Pierson said.The Trump campaign has been echoing conspiracy theorists like radio host Alex Jones (who believes 9\\u002f11 was an  inside job  by the government) and Republican dirty trickster Roger Stone (he thinks that LBJ had John F. Kennedy killed) for the last few months. And Trump of course was the lead spokesperson for the birther conspiracy theory that alleges that President Obama was not born in America.Along with these conspiracy theorists, right wing media outlets like the Drudge Report and Fox News  Sean Hannity have been presenting a pile of false claims that Clinton s health is weak.Months ago, her campaign released a medical assessment from Clinton s doctor and found the former Secretary of State in good health. By comparison, the Trump campaign s health document was widely ridiculed at the time, as its hyperbolic language seemed to have come from Trump himself, and not a reputable doctor.The wild theories about Clinton s health have coincided with Trump s drop in the polls, as he has plummeted to be anywhere from 4-15 percent behind Clinton nationally. He is even tied or very close to her in multiple  red  states that have been easily won by previous Republican candidates like Mitt Romney and John McCain, including Georgia, Missouri, and even Texas.So more conspiracies can be expected.Featured image via YouTube\"],[\"Republicans found their new election year wedge issue.

They KNEW this was coming, and there was no outrage   right up until someone who was both non-white and non-male was going to do the replacing.Luckily, Fox News  Greta Van Susteren came up with the perfect response. Her plan is to leave white people s money as it is and make separate money for non-whites. No, that s not a joke. She literally said we should make a new $25 bill so that Jackson could stay in place.Let s do a bit of critical thinking, based on a bit of history. A Susan B. Anthony dollar coin was released by the government a long time ago. EVERYBODY hated it. Not only did it look like a quarter, and people got confused by that, but it was redundant. We already had a $1 bill that everyone was accustomed to. Not every cash register has room for a new bill slot either. Certain types of automated bill changing machines would have to be retrofit for a $25 bill as well.The point is that a whole new denomination of money would be an annoyance and hassle, and the public would not have any patience for it. To put it into context, America has had a $2 bill with Thomas Jefferson on it for a really long time. Do you know ANYONE who uses them? Do you even remember the last time you saw one outside of some novelty situation for collectors?To sum it up, the Republican party thinks that the only place for a woman or a non-white person when it comes to money, is on something that will be marginalized by society   Just like how they ve marginalized women and non-white people for decades!

It is almost certain that Owens knew that there was risk involved in his job, but he also relies on the Commander-in-Chief to know what he11-year-old boy is doing.

Because this is what  success  looks like in Trump s America, of course!Despite Spicer and Trump s numerous claims that the mission was hugely successful, senior military officials tell NBC that they are unaware of any  actionable intelligence  that was recovered during the raid: We gathered an unbelievable amount of intelligence that will prevent the potential deaths or attacks on American soil,  said Spicer.A Defense Department official also pushed back Monday afternoon, saying the raid has yielded  a significant amount  of intelligence.But the only example the military has provided turned out to be an old bomb-making video that was of no current value.On Monday, Spicer addressed the remarks of Bill Owens, whose son died. I can tell him that on behalf of the president, his son died a hero and the information that he was able to help obtain through that raid, as I said before, is going to save American lives,  he said.  The mission was successful in helping prevent a future attack or attacks on this nation. Multiple senior officials told NBC News they have not seen evidence to support that claim.It s one thing to authorize a mission with insufficient intelligence or support. It s another to lie to the family of someone your negligence killed and call it a  success. Ryan Owens was a hero   but his country failed him. His President failed him. And someone must answer for it.Featured image via Getty Images\\u002fDrew Angerer\"],[\"This is not the first time Putin has warned the US to hurry up with its release of Hillary s emails. Biden better get the emergency campaign team ready. If Putin releases the unedited, corrupt version of Hillary s highly classified emails, Crooked Hillary will not likely be able to overcome the damage that will be done to what s left of her reputation. Reliable intelligence sources in the West have indicated that warnings had been received that the Russian Government could in the near future release the text of email messages intercepted from U.S. Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton s private e-mail server from the time she was U.S. Secretary of State. The release would, the messaging indicated, prove that Secretary Clinton had, in fact, laid open U.S. secrets to foreign interception by putting highly-classified Government reports onto a private server in violation of U.S. law, and that, as suspected, the server had been targeted and hacked by foreign intelligence services.The reports indicated that the decision as to whether to reveal the intercepts would be made by Russian Federation President Vladimir Putin, and it was possible that the release would, if made, be through a third party, such as Wikileaks. The apparent message from Moscow, through the intelligence community, seemed to indicate frustration with the pace of the official U.S. Department of Justice investigation into the so-called server scandal, which seemed to offer prima facie evidence that U.S. law had been violated by Mrs Clinton s decision to use a private server through which to conduct official and often highly-secret communications during her time as Secretary of State. U.S.Sources indicated that the extensive Deptartment of Justice probe was more focused on the possibility that the private server was used to protect messaging in which Secretary Clinton allegedly discussed quid pro quo transactions with private donors to the Clinton Foundation in exchange for influence on U.S. policy.The Russian possession of the intercepts, however, was designed also to show that, apart from violating U.S. law in the fundamental handling of classified documents (which Sec. Clinton had alleged was no worse than the mishandling of a few documents by CIA Director David Petraeus or Clinton s National Security Advisor Sandy Berger), the traffic included highly-classified materials which had their classification headers stripped. Russian (and other) sources had indicated frustration with the pace of the Justice Dept. probe, and its avoidance of the national security aspects of intelligence handling. This meant that the topic would be suppressed by the U.S. Barack Obama Administration so that it would not be a factor in the current U.S. Presidential election campaign, in which President Obama had endorsed Mrs Clinton. via: Oilprice.com\"],[\"President Obama is pissed off and he took Republicans and their nominee to the woodshed on Tuesday for inciting hate against all Muslims and insisting that describing terrorists using certain words will make the threat disappear.Ever since the mass shooting in Orlando, Republicans and Donald Trump have suggested that President Obama is weak on terrorism because he hasn t said the words,  radical Islamic terrorism. Apparently tired of hearing this line of bullshit, President Obama struck back with logic and reason during remarks at the Treasury Department. What exactly would using this language accomplish? What exactly would it change? Would it make ISIL less committed to try and kill Americans? Would it bring in more allies? Is there a military strategy that is served by this? The answer is none of the above. Calling a threat by a different name does not make it go away. This is a political distraction,  Obama continued before making it clear to anyone who thinks the administration is  confused  should tell that to all the terrorists who have been killed or captured by our military. The men and women who put their lives at risk and the Special Forces I ordered to get bin Laden and are now on the ground in Iraq and in Syria   they know full well who the enemy is. So do the intelligence and law enforcement officers who spent countless hours disrupting plots. And protecting all Americans, including politicians who tweet, and appear on cable news shows. They know what the nature of the enemy is. So there s no magic to the phrase  radical Islam.  It s a political talking point. Clearly, Obama was taking aim squarely at Donald Trump without even saying his name by talking about  politicians who tweet. But President Obama had more strong words to say to Republicans and Trump on the subject of discriminating against all Muslim for the actions of one in Orlando. We are now seeing how dangerous this kind of mindset and this kind of thinking can be,  Obama said in reference to Trump s renewing his hateful call to ban all Muslims from entering the country.  We re starting to see where this kind of rhetoric and loose talk and sloppiness about who exactly we re fighting, where this can lead us. Are we going to start treating all Muslim-Americans differently? Are we going to start subjecting them to special surveillance? Are we going to start discriminating them because of their faith? We ve heard these suggestions during the course of this campaign. Do Republican officials actually agree with this? Because that s not the America we want. It doesn t reflect our Democratic ideals. It will make us less safe. Here s the video via YouTube:President Obama has rarely displayed flashes of impatience or anger in response to the Republican Party, but after Trump and the GOP have started to suggest that Obama is helping the terrorists, it appears President Obama is done taking shit from them at a time when he is busy trying to take out ISIS leaders even as Republicans continue to refuse to do their part by declaring war.Indeed, if Republicans believe terrorism is such a big threat, one would think they would take the step of declaring war so that President Obama can use all the tools at his disposal to destroy the terrorists and present a united White House and Congress to the American people on this serious issue.But Trump and Republicans would rather play partisan games instead of doing their jobs to protect the American people.Featured Image: Screenshot\"],[\"When a state has legislated themselves into an unrecoverable financial crisis, and they re offering health care to 170,000 illegal immigrants the only solution is to find a way to start eliminating costs. While most people would turn to cutting unnecessary government programs, compassionate Californians instead, turn to finding ways to eliminate humans who are a drain on the system.The Democrats appear to have found a solution to the massive costs of caring for humans. If you re living outside of the womb (we already know you have no rights if you re living inside the womb in CA) and are a burden on society, you might want to consider packing your bags and making a quick exit out of Communist California   Democrats in California might have found a solution for the burgeoning costs of Medi-Cal which still doesn t provide any palliative care and offers only one in every three a chance of getting cancer treatments. The solution they ve come up with is doctor-assisted suicide also known as euthanasia. That s right, they re going to end the lives of some people on the program.They are willing to put their money where their mouths are and Governor Moonbeam Brown, in addition to putting it in the budget, will allow this expansion to take place before the new proposed law even takes effect.It s hard to remember a case where they were this enthusiastic and worked this fast.The lethal drugs will cost $5400 per patient but it s a lot cheaper than keeping them alive and providing care.The proponents claim it has nothing to do with saving costs but they said it during the session called to address the ever-growing deficit in Medi-Cal.Enthusiastically, Governor Moonbeam put $2.3 million into the budget to off 443 Medi-Cal patients. The doctor of death only has to visit twice and only nine of the planned 443 targeted patients will be sent for mental health evaluations.The proponents want another quarter million to hire staff to help with the Euthanasia regulations and DHCS wants another $323,000 to set up a database.One of the original authors of the bill, Senator Bill Monning (D-Carmel), has proposed a toll-free number for the public to find out how to arrange suicide with the help of a doctor.No effort will be too small to get this sure-fire deficit buster going. Liberals  love this sort of thing.Leftist Robert Reich on assisted suicide:Dr. Kevorkian once went to jail for this.California just extended Medi-Cal to 170,000 illegal immigrant children and they want to extend it to all illegal immigrants. They will have to end a lot of lives to cover the costs. Liberals don t worry about costs until after the program is implemented. Now that Daddy Government is in charge of your healthcare, he s also in charge of your death.

I ll still have that same big-shouldered Chicago lust for power that drove me from Greenwood Avenue in Hyde Park to Pennsylvania Avenue in three short years.But if Hillary replaces me in the Oval, she and Bill will take control of the Democratic Party it ll become the Clinton party once again and they ll block me from having any future influence.I ll end up like Jimmy Carter hammering away in Appalachia for Habitat for Humanity.On the other hand, if a Republican wins in  16, the Clintons will be finished their foundation and their speaking fees will dry up and they ll be a thing of the past. But I ll still be the titular head of the party. I ll be able to continue my push to transform America into a European-style socialist state.So, personally, I d be better off if the next president is a Republican.I was hoping it wouldn t come to this. I had hopes that Old Joe would get in the running and knock Hillary off her pins. Joe in the White House would be like my third term. I d have plenty of influence in a Biden administration.But Joe hemmed and hawed until it was too late.For a while, Val and Miche tried to convince me that Martin O Malley was the one to snatch the nomination away from Hillary. They said he was O Malleable and would share the levers of power with me. But I knew from the get-go that Martin didn t have the right stuff.Still, it s amazing to me that Hillary hasn t imploded. Everybody knows she deliberately tried to cover her tracks with her home-brew e-mail server and that she did it with felonious intent. My biggest fear all along has been that Hillary s mess will end up tainting my presidency and my legacy.Val and Miche are dead set against that happening. They re hoping that Hillary is indicted sooner rather than later. Then Uncle Joe could ride in like the cavalry and save the party.Just the other day, Hillary asked for another meeting in the Oval. I threw a major fit because I knew she wanted me to shut down the investigation of her e-mails and all her cover-ups.Generally, I don t lose my composure, but this time, I leaped from my desk and threw a rubber ball across the room. Almost broke the china.I even yelled at Val:  Tell the Clintons to go to hell! I never want to see Hillary s face again. I never want her or Bill in my house lecturing me. They have no respect for this office or for me, and I m not taking it anymore. She has lied about everything. I also told Val:  Make sure that any smidgen of wrongdoing that is in Hillary s files is turned over to the authorities everything. Obviously, I can t be seen influencing the FBI investigation in any way. But I ve made it clear to Jim Comey over at the FBI and Loretta at Justice that I want a thorough investigation and, if warranted, a vigorous prosecution.If Hillary winds up being sentenced, maybe a presidential pardon can be worked out. Nobody wants to see a former first lady and secretary of state rotting in jail. \"],[\"Republicans are stooping to a new low when it comes to their disdain for civil disobedience and the Bill of Rights.As anti-Trump protests continue across the nation over a week after the election, a Republican lawmaker in Washington state is drafting a proposed law that would label the protesters as  terrorists  and give law enforcement and prosecutors the ability to charge them with  economic terrorism. According to Fox Q13, the law  would allow felony prosecution of protesters who block streets, cause property damage, threaten jobs and put public safety at risk. State Senator Doug Ericksen, who proposed the legislation, insists that he  respects  the right to protest,  but when it endangers people s lives and property, it goes too far. Fear, intimidation and vandalism are not a legitimate form of political expression,  he continued.  Those who employ it must be called to account. Breaking the law would be considered a felony and would apply to any protester who is accused of trying to  intimidate or coerce private citizens or the government by obstructing economic activity  and  those who fund, organize, sponsor or otherwise encourage others to commit acts of economic terrorism. Accomplices may be required to pay restitution up to triple the amount of economic damage. We are not just going after the people who commit these acts of terrorism,  Ericksen said.  We are going after the people who fund them. Wealthy donors should not feel safe in disrupting middle class jobs. In other words, Republicans are literally trying to classify acts of civil disobedience as  terrorism  in order to ruthlessly put down the mass protests against their fascist leader.Of course, if Hillary Clinton had won the election, Republicans would not being saying the same thing about right-wing protests, even if those protests included acts of bloody violence that Trump supporters threatened to use if Trump had lost. Somehow, they believe rebellion and armed government coups are patriotic, but they consider civil disobedience an act of terrorism.As Doug Honig of the Washington ACLU explained, if this kind of law had been in place during the protests against segregation, every black person who sat down at a  white s only  lunch counter to protest discrimination would have been charged with committing terrorism. That s the kind of excessive approach to peaceful protest that our country and state do not need,  Honig explained.  Let s keep in mind that civil rights protesters who sat down at lunch counters could be seen as  disrupting business  and  obstructing economic activity,  and their courageous actions were opposed by segregationists as trying to  coerce business and government. So this is the latest strategy Republicans are looking to employ to silence people who disagree with them and it would drastically restrict the right to protest to the point of elimination. But again, this law would not apply to right-wingers who openly protest through displaying or using firearms in order to scare and intimidate. This law is solely aimed at protesters who disagree with them. It s the very definition of political retaliation and is the beginning of a concerted Republican effort to rip up the Constitution and replace it with fascism.Featured Image: Spencer Platt\\u002fGetty Images\"],[\"Donald Trump is already running for re-election, with a campaign fund set up and everything. And just as he did with his 2016 campaign, he s using the campaign to funnel money into his wallet via his businesses, because why patronize anybody else, and pay them all those campaign donations, when you can just pay yourself with them?Thus far, that amount totals $500,000. $274,000 alone has gone to Trump Tower. $58,000-plus has gone to the Trump International Golf Club in Florida, and nearly $14,000 has gone to Trump s Las Vegas hotel. The rest has gone to various other properties.Federal election law requires any candidate who uses their own business for campaign purposes to reimburse said business for the market value of the goods or services used. Generally, this winds up being a whole one to two percent of total campaign expenditures. As of June 2016, Trump s expenditures at his own properties was more than $6 million, or 10 percent of his total campaign expenditures.By the Nov. 8 election, that amount was over $14 million.That part of election law actually forms a loophole that Trump has no problem taking advantage of to the fullest extent he can.Obama stopped fundraising for awhile following his election in 2008. Trump never did. As soon as he was elected, he and the RNC began fundraising for 2020, and thus far, they ve raised more than $42 million together. Trump s refusal to divest himself from his businesses means some of that money could very easily be literally going into his wallet as we speak.Given that this is probably the least transparent administration in a long time, there s no way to trust that this is all Trump will funnel into his pockets. He s a master at exploiting loopholes in the law. His supporters will probably chant,  There s nothing illegal about this, so shut up,  but legal doesn t mean right or ethical.The fact that he s already busy funneling campaign donations to his own pockets just adds to the growing stack of items illustrating just how unethical he really is.Featured image by Alex Wong via Getty Images\"],[\"One would think that conservatives would have figured out by now that they can t get people to turn out for their marches and protests. That seems to be especially true with Trump in office. So many more people are against him than for him, yet these delusional Trumpkins still think they re some kind of majority in this country.Witness their enthusiasm for today s March 4 Trump. It was supposed to be a counter to the Women s March on Washington that happened all over the world the day after Trump s inauguration. The Women s March drew well more than two million people just in the U.S. The March 4 Trump must have been overwhelming then, given all that support Trump and his loyal subjects think they have.And overwhelming these marches were, in their own way   the lack of support they showed for Trump is actually what was overwhelming. Most of these protests drew dozens, rather than the thousands they seemed to think they were going to get. For instance, in Orlando, roughly 200 people showed up, compared to the 5,000 that showed up in January for the Women s March.Denver had just dozens, where 145,000 had marched in January. In our nation s capital, Trumpers were hoping that they could draw more than half a million, which would rival the Women s March there. They drew a few thousand at best, despite Trump s claim that marches for him would be the biggest marches of all:Here at the yuge rally for Trump at the White House pic.twitter.com\\u002faJ5gcMicyr  Brian Tashman (@briantashman) March 4, 2017The #TrumpTrain is in town and standing strong for @POTUS.I will be articulating the case for #Trump shortly, friends.#March4Trump pic.twitter.com\\u002fzdH682s7Vk  Michael Johns (@michaeljohns) March 4, 2017Here s the march at Trump Tower in New York City:Literally the March 4 Trump pic.twitter.com\\u002fOf8vChB8NQ  Eric Grant (@ericgrant) March 4, 2017Small crowd at the March 4 Trump. pic.twitter.com\\u002fLxPMcYtBO3  Eric Grant (@ericgrant) March 4, 2017Crowds were just as pathetic elsewhere, too:#March4Trump draws about 200 people to Voinovich Park, plus about 100 counter protestors pic.twitter.com\\u002fJfq3GL05ar  Kabir Bhatia (@KabirBhatiaTime) March 4, 2017#NoMorein614 march in Columbus, OH. #BlackLivesMatter #NoBanBoWall #organizeCBUS #JaronThomas @614Unity @soit_goes @marymad @OhioPJP pic.twitter.com\\u002fdu1EdboKfd  SURJ Columbus (@SURJColumbusOH) March 4, 2017At #March4Trump rally in Springfield,IL pic.twitter.com\\u002fWFvZLkSn25  James B (@JebLadat) March 4, 2017We are live from Denver where black bloc is confronting March 4 Trump DPD ready with police tape line https:\\u002f\\u002ft.co\\u002fRxJlYm2jkM pic.twitter.com\\u002f2817ZMkUq4  Unicorn Riot (@UR_Ninja) March 4, 2017A better view of just how empty the Plaza is for this pro-Trump rally.

On Friday, Kristol tweeted that he had indeed found his candidate, and that he was the true principled conservative who would offer voters something real and unique.Well, it s been announced who this Republican savior is and it s National Review writer and constitutional lawyer David French.The man with absolutely no name recognition is the alternative to Trump   a guy who literally has his name plastered on skyscrapers.Congratulations, Republicans, you ve managed to make yourselves look more stupid than you already have. They could have put Romney on the ticket, who may have been the best choice to take on Clinton and Trump. In a moment of irony, just a week ago, French was calling on Romney to run third party, saying he was the  only hope  for the GOP s survival. How about that, not even the current third party candidate thinks he s good enough.And French doesn t even fit the description of what Kristol and his allies were searching for. According to Bloomberg Politics:According to one person deeply involved in the efforts to recruit an independent challenger, the search has focused on individuals who have one or more of the following three traits seen as vital for credibly launching such a bid: fame, vast wealth, and elective experience.Oh, and there s one more harbinger: French hasn t actually officially announced his candidacy. So Kristol s only pick might no actually file to run in the first place.Whereas French may be conservative, he is more principled than Trump: while the GOP blowhard has multiple draft deferments and rips off veteran s organizations, French is an Iraq War veteran and a recipient of the Bronze Star.And French, like Kristol, has had a few words to say about Donald Trump. In March, French wrote a blistering critique of the real estate mogul titled  What Now, Conservatives?  likening him to segregationist George Wallace:The party of Lincoln is in ruins. A minority of its primary voters have torched its founders  legacy by voting for a man who combines old-school Democratic ideology, a bizarre form of hyper-violent isolationism, fringe conspiracy theories and serial lies with an enthusiastic flock of online racists to create perhaps the most toxic electoral coalition since George Wallace.How do you know French is a true Republican? He thinks Trump ruined the GOP when it clearly was George W. Bush. Oh, and he once referred to Planned Parenthood as  disgusting,  so that gives you an insight as to how he feels about women s reproductive health.So maybe French isn t all that better than Donald Trump. Republicans just aren t ready for an orange man with a bad comb-over and tiny hands to ruin their party.Featured image via 93.1 FM WIBC\"],[\"Time to exhale James Barack Obama supporter James Taylor doesn t just think the U.S. president is great   he believes Obama is the greatest of all-time.

Taylor, 67, is a recipient of the National Medal of Arts. The pop icon performed  America the Beautiful  at Obama s second inauguration in 2013.

He promised to give us a health care system, it s a work in progress, but he has put us on a road to that,  Taylor said.  I m so grateful for what he s done for gay rights and for the emancipation of gay people. Particularly from my point of view, I think that was so overdue and so important, and so important for America to be ahead of the curve on this. Taylor criticized Congress in Obama s defense. I ve never seen a Congress that has been so obstructive and so contrary and so committed to doing anything that will foul up this administration. I just think it s an absolute scandal that he has had so little cooperation,  he said.  So anyway, you hit a nerve and I ll go on forever. But I ll just say it a third time: Every day that Barack Obama and Michelle Obama are in the White House is a day that I am thankful for. Obama isn t the only politician Taylor is supporting: The singer said he s on the Hillary Rodham Clinton train, too. And aside from the fact that she s a woman running, she s the right person.

That s exactly what has happened in the US.We can trace some of this line of thinking back to Cass Sunstein, the radical, liberal progressive technocrat and chief advisor to President Barack Obama (as well as the husband of disastrous UN Ambassador Samantha Power). According to his own writing and public declarations, Sunstein believes that activists should be able to bring a lawsuit on behalf of an animal in US courts. In his 2004 book Animal Rights: Current Debates and New Directions, Sunstein remarked:Cass Sunstein. My simplest suggestion is that private citizens should be given the right to bring suits to prevent animals from being treated in a way that violates current law. I offer a recommendation that is theoretically modest but that should do a lot of practical good: laws designed to protect animals against cruelty and abuse should be amended and interpreted to give a private cause of action against those who violate them, so as to allow private people to supplement the efforts of public prosecutors. Somewhat more broadly, I will suggest that animals should be permitted to bring suit, with human beings as their representatives, to prevent violations of current law. As one of liberal America s most influential technocrats, Sunstein argues that this legal right can be invoked on the basis of animal cruelty. While no cruelty seems to be present in the case of the Monkey Selfie (see story below), activists at PETA were no doubt emboldened by Sunstein and others who have propelled their ideological argument into the political activist discourse.While our society and our legal system are far from perfect, a move like this from a wealthy charity like PETA could throw that system into even further chaos.Surely, if animals can sue humans, then shouldn t humans be able to sue animals? As you can see, when you pursue this activist rabbit hole, reality starts to dissolve rather quickly.More on this incredible story from AP Monkey Selfie    Copyright credited to David J.

Next came the violent riots against cops and non-blacks over the death of thug, Michael Brown that left the town of Ferguson in shreds. On the heels of Ferguson we saw masses of unruly protestors shutting down major bridges in NYC over the death of Eric Garner. NYC will forever be known as the city where the first violent thug, inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement, took the lives of two law enforcement officers.  The hate and violence against police officers and non-blacks only increased in Baltimore as innocent business owners, like the one in this video, who was doused by lighter fluid and lit on fire by a 14 year old girl inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement (See video HERE).America s watched an Asian reporter attacked and bullied by protestors at Univ. of Missouri assigned to covering the ridiculous hunger strike protest against unfair treatment by a student, who it was later discovered is the son of multi-millionaire railroad tycoon.

I m living in a small, podunk red town and I m already getting death threats,  said Lewis, whose store is in right-leaning Chico, population 90,000.  My business has completely floundered. Overnight I had more one-star reviews than all the reviews I ve received in a year. The sign was up for less than 24 hours before Stott Outdoor Advertising took it down amid a backlash that featured online attacks.But Lewis said she s standing behind her beliefs. I don t necessarily think that just because I m a business doesn t mean I can t mix my beliefs,  Lewis said.  That s a common misconception that you can t mix politics and business.   I have a platform and I m going to use it. Lewis has used the billboard at the corner of Third Avenue and Mangrove Avenue all year, though this is the first time she s made it political. He is not presidential, he is not a president,  Lewis said.  He is a celebrity who was born into money. And he s a Nazi sympathizer. I am going to stand behind my beliefs regardless. Lewis said she has been getting some support, too.Lewis got slammed by bad reviews on her store, Rouse and Revolt Facebook page, as well as her personal Facebook page, where she posted this video. In the video, Lewis pleas with liberals to make false claims against the sign company, as a payback because she s been hit with bad reviews.

Claiming that whites are the superior race. What s even worse than that? Doing it again.On Monday, Iowa Rep. Steve King replaced his dog whistle with a microphone and openly declared that whites are the superior race. Responding to criticism that the Republican National Convention is filled with  loud, unhappy, dissatisfied white people  during an appearance on MSNBC, King snapped: This whole business does get a little tired. I would ask you to go back through history and figure out where are these contributions that have been made by these other categories of people that you are talking about, where did any other subgroup of people contribute more to civilization? Than white people?  Chris Hayes asked. Than than western civilization itself that s rooted in western Europe, eastern Europe and the United States of America, and every place where Christianity settled the world,  King replied after realizing that he had actually uttered the words he was thinking.  That s all of western civilization. On Tuesday, King clarified his remarks, explaining that while whites are the superior race, people of other races have also made contributions to civilization. It s pretty close [to what I said]. What I really said was  Western civilization  and when you describe Western civilization that can mean much of Western civilization happens to be Caucasians. But we should not apologize for our culture or our civilization,  King told ABC News. The contributions that were made by Western civilization itself, and by Americans, by Americans of all races stand far above the rest of the world. The Western civilization and the American civilization are a superior culture. King says he was responding to, and correcting, political blogger Charlie Pierce but he s happy that he was able to start a dialogue about how awesome white people are: But what we have is people who are trying to parse something, to hyperventilate about that. I m OK if they do that because it starts the dialogue so we can open up more minds so people can think about what s right for America. So, there you have it: whites have contributed far more than other races, according to King, but he s now willing to admit that maybe others have done stuff too.Watch King s original remarks below:Featured image via Getty Images\\u002fAndrew Burton\"],[\"According to White House Propaganda Minister Sean Spicer, it was completely fine that conservatives endlessly delayed President Obama s Supreme Court pick because it was his  fourth term. I know what you re thinking   The White House press secretary couldn t possibly be so stupid that he would not know how many terms a President can legally serve (two)   but it s true. Spicer explained that the Democrats had a responsibility to confirm any  qualified  Supreme Court nominee of Trump s despite the campaign last year to deprive President Obama of the same courtesy. According to Spicer, this is completely different because: There s never been a situation in which you had a fourth term, someone that late in an election cycle. That had never occurred before. And I think the Senate Republicans were very clear that we should wait and let the voters have a choice. And that s exactly what happened. Yes, fourth term. We didn t even get the third term conservatives were sure Obama would have and the rest of us desperately wish he could have had and Spicer thinks he served for 16 years. but he is right that the obstruction on the part of the GOP was unprecedented. There really is something unique about the position Republican senators are taking with respect to the Scalia vacancy,  law professor Jason Mazzone told The New York Times last year.  We really did not find any precedent for the idea, notwithstanding the Senate s very broad powers in this area, that a sitting president could be denied outright the authority to offer up a nominee who would receive evaluation through normal Senate processes. There is a difference between the Senate rejecting, as it s quite entitled to do, a particular nominee on the merits, and the Senate taking the position that a president cannot exercise a constitutionally delegated power,  he added.Trump s nominee isn t exactly qualified, as he has sided against the right of women to have available to them a full array of healthcare options, including a decision related to Hobby Lobby. He has also stated that  secular courts  do not have the right to interfere with [the Christian] religion, even when businesses are practicing discrimination against women.Watch Spicer s latest f*ckup below:Featured image via screenshots\"],[\"So far, forty-four states are resisting the Trump administration s request for voter data.

We have to fight like hell to keep every inch of public land,  Marcario said in a May article at Huffpost.  I don t have a lot of faith in politics and politicians right now. In an effort to prevent citizens from retaking possession of their state lands, one of her immediate actions will be to sue the Trump administration for its efforts to scale back Obama s unprecedented land grab. A president does not have the authority to rescind a national monument,  Marcario said in an April 26 statement after Trump announced his national monuments order.  An attempt to change the boundaries ignores the review process of cultural and historical characteristics and the public input. In particular, the Trump administration is preparing to revisit Obama s order to create the Bears Ears National Monument. In April, Trump issued an executive order requiring the Department of the Interior to review Obama s actions on national monuments. Ordering Interior Secretary Ray Zinke to review Obama s policies in April, President Trump called Obama s move an  egregious abuse of federal power. Many state governments fully agree with Trump s assessment and were furious when Obama swooped in from Washington and stole away millions of acres of land from state control to create new national monuments and parks.A poll of residents of Utah, for instance, showed that 60 percent opposed Obama s land grab, while only 33 percent supported it.This is far from the first time the sportswear company pledged its profits to political matters.

We are just getting started,  Mr. Trump said, speaking from the Roosevelt Room of the White House. He described progress so far as the  most far-reaching regulatory reform  in United States history, a claim he did not back up.  In 1960, there were approximately 20,000 pages in the Code of Federal Regulations. Today there are over 185,000 pages, as seen in the Roosevelt Room. Today, we CUT THE RED TAPE!

These new court findings reaffirms much of what 21WIRE and the Daily Shooter column have been reporting for the last five years   that the FBI is responsible for the majority of so-called  terrorist  attacks in the US.According to a new legal case filed against the FBI, court filings have revealed how the agency allowed an alleged  home grown  ISIS attack to take place in Garland, Texas on May 4, 2015. International criminal lawyer Jennifer Breedon shows the FBI was complicit in the attack, and even enticed the two terrorists to carry out the attack, and where agents had  pretended to be ISIS  in order to keep their entrapment operation going. She explains: Some of the facts are indicating that they had an undercover agent that was trying to get in with ISIS   trying to find out these ISIS groups, and he wanted to make himself higher up in ISIS ranks to know more of their fighters. Apparently, he stayed in the car behind them, which came out in another case filing with the FBI. They did not prevent it because if the attack had been carried out successfully, and people died, it was likely this undercover agent and his supervisors in the FBI felt that this would promote him up to high ranks within ISIS   the undercover agent would be promoted up, because the attack was then successful. Read Breddon s full interview here.On the surface this is a clear case of entrapment by the FBI, but upon deeper examination it s now clear that the FBI seems to have aided and abetted a terrorist attack on US soil.While other mainstream and alternative media outlets were busy promulgating the official narrative, 21WIRE actually called-out the staged event, designed to leverage a far right, anti-Muslim agenda, and stoke irrational fears of endless  ISIS attacks  on US soil.PROVOCATEUR: Professional provocateur Geller provided the PR bait for media, the FBI-run  American ISIS  cell.The contrived event was marketed as a controversial  Muhammad Art Exhibit and Cartoon Contest,  organized by a cut-out politcal front group, American Freedom Defense Initiative, led by anti-Muslim activist and professional provocateur, Pamela Geller, and featured far-right Dutch politician Geert Wilders, as its keynote speaker. Media personality Geller claimed to have purposely chosen the venue following the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) gathering who held a  Stand with the Prophet  conference in late January 2015 after the Charlie Hebdo shootings in Paris earlier that year.According to the victim s attorney Breedon, the FBI had an undercover agent that was  trying to get in with ISIS   trying to find out these ISIS groups, and he wanted to make himself higher up in ISIS ranks to know more of their fighters. American journalist Trevor Aaronson further explains the derelict role of James Comey (image, left) in FBI s attempt to cover its own fingerprints on this dodgy operation: Hours earlier, the FBI had sent a bulletin to local police with Elton Simpson s photo, warning that he was  interested in the event. FBI Director James Comey said in a press conference following the shooting that the FBI did not have reason to believe Simpson was planning to attack the event, even though the bureau had spent years trying to build a case against him. ENTRAPMENT: The unwitting youngster, Elton Simpson, was groomed by a paid FBI informant, and brought to the scene of the staged  attack. After the FBI-staged  attack , 21WIRE was one of few media outlets to report how a paid FBI informant was not only  handling , but directing what appeared to be a naive and vulnerable federal target for entrapment   a new young Muslim convert named Elton Simpson from Phoenix, Arizona:It s now been revealed that  gunman , Elton Simpson, was already under surveillance by the FBI and was even the subject of a terror investigation. More importantly, we can also confirm Simpson was being handled by an FBI informant. Court papers filed in Arizona name the FBI undercover informant as Mr. Daba Deng, a Kenyan and who, from 2007, was paid $132,000 by the FBI to  become friends with Mr. Simpson , and who appears to have groomed Simpson through a local mosque, and helped to develop Simpson s ideas about  jihad .So keen was CNN at the time to convince its audience that Garland was a real terrorist event, it took the trouble of creating its own cartoon version of the attack in a desperate attempt to make the official story believable:SYNTHETIC TERROR: CNN uses cartoon to make the Garland Shooting look like a real terror event.At the time, and almost comically, CNN tried to push the official narrative, appearing totally clueless of the fact that the attackers were under FBI supervision for years: He wasn t well-known to federal law enforcement and was not on the FBI s radar, one of the officials said. Investigators were combing through evidence retrieved from the shooters  Arizona home to help piece together a timeline of how their plot came together, the official said. It was as if CNN had copied and pasted their report from an FBI press memo issued after the event (perhaps it was). CNN s coverage of the event was equally ridiculous, not picking up on the fact that a small platoon of heavily armed US special ops mercenaries were pre-positioned at Geller s event in anticipation of the made-for-TV  terror  attack that followed:#BREAKING Update from SWAT Team Leader. @wfaachannel8 pic.twitter.com\\u002fHoF5f4bF7U  Jobin Panicker (@jobinpnews) May 4, 2015SEE OUR INITIAL REPORT ON GELLER S GARLAND HOAX: Hebdo Redux in Garland, Texas?

I am not anti-police, I support the police. I just don t support police abusing their powers,  Soto told Action News.In the video, Soto showed his license, but refused to show his registration.Police are concerned about Soto s motives and criminal past. We are going to tell our officers to be cautious. It raises your level of suspicion when you have a person   a prior felony   and has had some prior interaction with the law and has been known to interact with guns. So we are going to tell our officers to be careful,  said Lt. John Sanford, Philadelphia Police.Soto sat down with Action News to discuss the controversial video. This traffic stop, just brought to light an ongoing issue that is continually denied all over our nation with individuals being stopped and in some cases being racially profiled,  said Soto.Soto says the officers who stopped him were not African-American but police say differently. They were African American officers,  said Lt. Stanford.The original reason for the stop was for tinted windows.Soto flashed a paper at the officer saying he had a medical exemption from PennDOT for sun screening on his car, but he didn t bring that letter to our meeting. If you were provided that certificate from PennDOT, it has to be colorless tint,  said Lt. Stanford.We asked Soto if his windows were dark tinted. Okay in your opinion or anyone else s opinion from watching the video tape   that s their opinion. No one knows what tint is on my vehicle, whether it s colored or colorless, although it may look dark,  said Soto.And then there s this   in the video, Soto held up a card and badge identifying himself to the officer as a fire marshal.We asked him if he s a fire marshal. The tape speaks for itself and, at this point, okay let s not take the focus as to who I am or what I do or what is going on and let s keep the focus on what is really going on. It is not about Tony Soto,  said Soto.So who is Soto?He s a felon, sentenced to 33 months in federal prison for straw purchasing firearms.He has multiple convictions for theft, fleeing from police, and was convicted of impersonating a public servant in 2005 and now claims he is a volunteer firefighter.We asked Soto where he works. Well we are going to   you are going to stop that right there alright   we are going to stop that and we are not going to go into that,  said Soto.Police are also cautioning the public not to use Soto s video as an example of what to do during a traffic stop.While it is legal to record video, the Pennsylvania vehicle code requires drivers to turn over their identification and registration.In addition, the Fraternal Order of Police is now asking authorities to pursue charges against Soto for allegedly impersonating a public servant.

A $23 billion cut is aimed at eliminating food benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) to people on unemployment who are either in school or job training. It s an age-old GOP tactic. Eliminate the help for people who are looking to do better and they are forced out of school or training and into minimum wage jobs.Once they get there, the Republicans can claim they re teenagers living at home for free and it s their own fault for settling for a minimum wage job when all they have to do is go back to school or get some training. And the cycle continues. According to Roll Call:Republican leaders have proposed more than $23 billion in food stamp cuts in a budget plan that could be brought to the House floor in the next two weeks, several sources say.The proposed changes in the food stamp, or Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, include the end of waivers that allow some adults to receive assistance for a limited amount of time, while they are in school, or training for a job.$23 billion in cuts to food for people.

She has a ground game, and get out the vote operation, and she also has voter targeting and demographics on her side. However, despite all of this, the polls are tightening in these final hours. So, what is Hillary doing to make sure everyone remembers just who Trump is? Why, bringing out a secret weapon that has been one of Trump s biggest pieces of kryptonite of the entire campaign: Khizr Khan.We all remember how Khan, the father of a fallen Muslim-American soldier, Army Captain Humayun Khan, excoriated Trump at the Democratic National Convention this summer. As a result, the notoriously thin-skinned Trump went on a tirade against Khan. He insulted Khan s wife in a fight there was no way he could win politically as he lost control of himself and spent nearly a week attacking the Gold Star family. Now, Khan plans to campaign with Hillary in the 11th hour.This all-important joint campaign trail appearance between Hillary and Mr. Khan will happen Sunday night, just two days before Election Day. Trump is already feeling anxious and aggrieved, thanks to the fact that his path to 270 electoral votes is so much more narrow than Hillary s. In trotting out Mr. Khan, Hillary is setting the perfect Trump trap   especially if Khan lays into Trump the same way he did at the Democratic National Convention.Now, this late in the game, it could be argued that everyone is already in their corners, and many have already voted. There s likely nothing either candidate can do or say between Sunday and Tuesday to make a supporter not vote the way he or she had planned to vote. But   what a Trump meltdown of Khan-level qualities could do is to remind soft and Independent voters, who were going to hold their noses and vote for Trump, just what makes them so uneasy about his being president, and they will stay home   or maybe even vote for Hillary.Featured image via Justin Sullivan\\u002fGetty Images\"],[\"The Twitter war between Donald Trump and Alec Baldwin just escalated.As we all know, Trump and his team have been unable to find A-list celebrities willing to perform at the inauguration on January 20th.

The younger man, whom police have identified as 26-year-old Kyle Christopher Hannover, was at the park fishing when he allegedly started yelling racial slurs at Dominguez and threw a rock at Dominguez s car.Hannover then allegedly got into his Ford Ranger truck and drove directly toward Dominguez, striking him. He was completely rolled over from the suspect s car and trailer,  a witness told ABC.  When I called 911 it was,  No ambulance.  It was,  Get a trauma chopper out here as quickly as possible. Unsurprisingly, Hannover has a history of violence. In 2015, he was arrested and for allegedly threatening his girlfriend with a shotgun. Considering how disturbed he is, it s amazing that she survived long enough for him to be arrested. As a result of his threats, his guns were confiscated as part of his plea deal this past March. I can only assume that s why Hannover didn t simply shoot Dominguez instead of sadistically running him over.The cause of the fight is unclear and, honestly, is irrelevant. There is literally no justification for a 26-year-old to run over a senior citizen in a rage. The only upshot to this entire incident is that Hannover will probably be about the same age when he gets out of prison.His step-granddaughter Damaris Riveron expressed her gratitude to the police: We re extremely happy there has been an arrest, Thank you to the police department for all of their hard work and for everyone who contributed.

Hundreds of people marched through the streets of London on Tuesday, showing their support for the Democratic candidate. Super Tuesday marked the beginning of The Democrats Abroad Global Primary. Given the logistics of the global operation, voters will have eight days to cast their vote, with the primary concluding on March 8.Here is video footage of the Londoners for Bernie event:These people will be doing more than just march for Sanders, they plan on voting for him as well. American expats make a small but very real impact in the Democratic primary race.Speaking to Business Insider UK, former chair of Democrats Abroad UK, Bill Bernard, said: It s a great occasion. We had a similar turnout in 2008 when it was Hillary Clinton versus Obama. The turnout was enormous that year and today seems to be equaling that. Globally, Americans who are living abroad will have 21 delegates representing them at the Democratic National Convention in July. First they will meet up for a Global Convention in Berlin, Germany on May 14. Of those, 8 delegates are super delegates.  Despite the media s spin, Sanders is doing very well for himself in the primary election. The only loss for the campaign on Super Tuesday was Clinton s very narrow win in Massachusetts. That being said, Sanders entered the race knowing he was in for a long uphill battle against another candidate with global name recognition. So, for Sanders, every delegate is crucial.According to the London for Bernie website, Sanders is currently beating Clinton globally. That isn t surprising when you consider the fact that much of Sanders  platform could be considered a list of things the United States needs to catch up to the rest of the developed world on.Here is more video footage that shows Sanders  supporters chanting  feel the Bern.

He said another organization would be set up to promote the Muslim-friendly presidential candidate.Awad urged all Muslims to register to vote and to use Islamic centers as polling stations.

Anytime she sees something that doesn t quite look right; you can bet she s the last person in a room afraid to speak up about   especially when big banks are involved.On Friday, Senator Warren was reading a story like the rest of us mere Earthlings, and was so outraged by it that she took to her Facebook page for a viral call out. Her target? Jeb Bush, his super PAC, and Former AIG Chairman Hank Greenberg.The billionaire Republican donor just gave $10 million to the Right to Rise group to keep Jeb from falling out of the race. It s basically keeping him alive to duel it out just before the nation s first primaries begin. But   that s not the reason for her dissatisfaction. It turns out; Warren still has a bitter taste in her mouth stemming from the economic collapse of 2008, which saw his company receive a  huge bailout from the Bush administration  after doing a disservice to the American people. She doesn t forget these things it seems.Her full post is featured below, but this part of it is the most headline-worthy, without a doubt: I m not sure what s more disgusting: That Jeb Bush is pinning his Presidential hopes on his brother s bailout money, or that bailed-out CEOs are trying to buy elections.

Our website (100percentfedup.com), along with several other conservative websites like Breitbart, IJ Review, Infowars, Biz Pac Review and The Blaze were included on this list. Most of the websites listed had a considerable amount of traffic and cumulatively reach hundreds of millions of readers. I told her to ignore it, that it was clearly created by some leftist organization who was trying to discredit conservative websites. One year later, a list that has striking similarities has been revived. This time however, the list has been amended to include ONE liberal website,  Occupy Democrats  and has a new author, Melissa Zimdars. After all, a list of 90  phony  or  misleading  websites wouldn t be legitimate if at least one of them wasn t a liberal site right?While some of the websites on the list are fake and should be called out as such, there are WAY more legitimate conservative sites on this list who work very hard to vet their sources and to bring their readers truthful news they won t find in the mainstream media. After the election results came in, many on the Left were inconsolable and were lashing out at conservative news sites as the reason Hillary lost. It didn t take long for the Left to realize they had finally met their match with driven conservatives who were not going to roll over and let the Left drive the narrative this time around. Thus the list by Leftist activist Melissa Zimdars, that is being used to discredit many of us who take our jobs very seriously, and are doing all that we can to fight back against a biased media complex.We were curious about Melissa and her political leanings. Could this list have anything to do with wanting to  pay back  the sites who helped to topple Hillary? We did a little research on Melissa and found that her Twitter account is on lock-down. We found this to be slightly ironic considering she appears to be all about transparency. Thanks to Way Back Time Machine, we were able to find out a little bit about Melissa:Melissa is a follower of The Radical  Chicago Rising  and  The End Of Protest  who describes their group as  A new playbook for revolution by Micah White, co-creator of Occupy Wall Street: Melissa is big fan of Black Lives Matter, and was helping to promote the BLM march that threatened the safety and security of many innocent people in Chicago:Here s the real reason why Zimdar likely has her Twitter account on lockdown. She wouldn t want to let everyone know she just published a list of conservative sites that she suggests,  should never be trusted  and allow her hatred for Donald Trump to be exposed at the same time. Besides her hatred for Trump and Karl Rove (see below), she apparently gets  goosebumps  when she hears Bernie Sanders  name. I know what you re thinking She s sounding more  objective  all the time right?Melissa retweeted Hillary s angry tweet about Trump:She s no fan of Dr. Ben Carson and his belief that the government shouldn t be able to force employers to pay an arbitrary minimum wage:Melissa s story became popular after she posted it to her Facebook page, which should come as no surprise given the  friends  who are actively suggesting names of other conservative sites they detest that  Melissa needs to add to the her list. Even though Breitbart is on her  list , Zimdar s friend asks her,  Where s Brietbart? Other friends want to know how they can submit conservative sites that can be added to her list:And of course, what kind of conservative media  hit list  would be complete without Fox News? This friend suggests she needs to put FOX News at the  top  of the list:This Hillary supporter tells Zimdar she d like to use this list as a teaching tool in her class:Just another liberal agitator who plans to use this list to teach her students about honest journalism.Here is Zimdar admitting that not every site is always unreliable, that some,  waffle back and forth .

It turns out, Republicans are currently trying to protect Trump from the health care bill s backlash if it fails by distancing Trump from the legislation. CNN reports:But White House top aides also see the distance as a way to inoculate Trump from considerable blame if the bill fails, a nod to the President s low approval rating and waning political capital. No one knows the Senate better than McConnell,  one White House official said when asked about Trump s involvement, an acknowledgment that he is taking the lead. A Republican Senate aide agreed. This is a leadership bill, sink or swim. All credit and all blame stays in the Senate,  the aide said, adding this political reality:  This gives the President cover, in a sense, if it fails. Now, in all fairness, the GOP might have chosen to keep Trump far away from this health care bill because the more he s involved in something, the worse the outcome is. It s extremely likely that Republicans feel that Trump will either say or do something to mess everything up, and that s why they don t want him getting his little orange hands in it. However, from the White House s perspective, the Trump administration is more than okay with this bill s possible (and likely) failure falling on Mitch McConnell instead of Trump, whose approval rating continues to dwindle.The separation of Trump from the GOP health care bill is a telling one, and it s one that the Republicans have done on their own. They must be sensing that the bill is in trouble, and are taking precautions to safeguard Trump.Featured image via Mark Wilson \\u002f Getty Images\"],[\"Gay Mafia descends in 5 4 3 2 1 Given the current body of evidence, the American College of Pediatricians believes it is inappropriate, potentially hazardous to children, and dangerously irresponsible to change the age-old prohibition on same-sex parenting, whether by adoption, foster care, or reproductive manipulation,  they conclude.  This position is rooted in the best available science. A Utah juvenile court judge ruled Tuesday that a 1-year-old girl, who has been in the care of lesbian foster parents, cannot be adopted by them and should be sent to  a more traditional home,  says the Utah Division of Child and Family Services.According to CNN, the case is the first major challenge to same-sex adoption rights. LGBT civil rights groups are outraged over the ruling.While Judge Scott Johansen is not commenting on his decision publicly per the Utah Code of Judicial Conduct April Hoagland, one of the lesbians, married over a year ago to Beckie Peirce, told KUTV that Johansen said research indicates children in homosexual homes do not do as well as they do in heterosexual homes. [W]hen they asked to show his research he would not,  Hoagland added.Hoagland and Peirce were approved as foster parents by the division of family services and are raising Peirce s two children. They say the state and the child s biological mother are supportive of their desire to adopt the child.As CBS reports, the two women are part of a group of same-sex couples who were permitted to become foster parents in Utah following the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide. Deborah Lindner, a spokeswoman for the Utah Foster Care Foundation, which trains foster parents for the state, said about 20 same-sex couples are caring for children in the foster program. Heartbreaking. We ve been told to take care like a mother would and I m her mother, and that s who she knows and she s just going to be taken away in seven days to probably another good, loving home,  Hoagland said.  But it s not fair, and it s not right, and it hurts me very badly, because I have done nothing wrong. Removing a child from a loving home simply because the parents are LGBT is outrageous, shocking and unjust,  Chad Griffin, president of the Human Rights Campaign, said in a statement.  It also flies in the face of overwhelming evidence that children being raised by same-sex parents are just as healthy and well-adjusted as those with different-sex parents. At a time when so many children in foster care need loving homes, it is sickening to think that a child would be taken from caring parents who planned to adopt,  he added.Utah child and family services said they are reviewing the ruling to determine their options, including whether to challenge the order. This is the first time there has been an attempt to deprive gay foster parents of their rights to care for an adoptive child,  said CNN legal analyst Paul Callan.  I believe it was a bizarre and highly unusual decision by the judge based most probably on religious beliefs rather than scientific facts. He predicted the case would be overturned by Utah appeals courts.In 2012, however, sociologist Mark Regnerus of the University of Texas at Austin published research in the journal Social Science Research on a large, random sample of Americans of ages 18-39 who were raised in different types of families. The study of some 3,000 adults found numerous differences that exist among the various family arrangements and that outcomes for children of gay and lesbian parents were  suboptimal. In another study by Loren Marks of Louisiana State University also published in Social Science Research Marks debunked a 2005 policy brief on same-sex parents by the American Psychological Association (APA), in which the organization analyzed 59 studies and concluded  [n]ot a single study has found children of lesbian or gay parents to be disadvantaged in any significant respect relative to children of heterosexual parents. Marks observed that 55 of the studies analyzed by APA did not even  provide evidence of statistical power  in accord with APA s own standards. [N]ot one of the 59 studies referenced in the 2005 APA Brief compares a large, random, representative sample of lesbian or gay parents and their children with a large, random, representative sample of married parents and their children,  Marks noted. [W]e have been left with large, scientifically strong studies showing children do best with their married mother and father but which do not make comparisons with homosexual parents or couples,  observed Peter Sprigg, senior fellow for policy studies at Family Research Council,  and studies which purportedly show that children of homosexuals do just as well as other children but which are methodologically weak and thus scientifically inconclusive. However, Regnerus s research, called the  New Family Structures Study,  included comparisons with children raised by same-sex parents and surveyed young adults about their experiences growing up in their family situations as well as their current life. Unlike other studies, Regnerus also did not rely on reports of children, while they were still living in their homes, or the potentially biased reports of the parents.Regnerus found that children of homosexuals fared worse on 77 out of 80 outcome measures that compared children with same-sex parents to those from other family arrangements. Specifically, compared with children raised by married, biological parents, children of homosexual parents are more likely to be on public assistance, have lower educational attainment, and report both less safety in their childhood families and more continued  negative impact  from them. In addition, children of same-sex parents were found to more likely suffer from depression, to have been arrested more often, and to have had more male and female sexual partners if they are female.For children of lesbian mothers, statistical significance in both direct comparisons and with control subjects was found in numerous areas in Regnerus s research. Children of lesbian mothers were found to be four times more likely to be on welfare, more than three times more likely to be unemployed, nearly ten times more likely to have been  touched sexually by a parent or other adult caregiver,  and nearly four times as likely to have been  physically forced  to have sex against their will.Despite numerous statistically significant correlations in his study and his carefully controlled methodology, Regnerus still cautions these relationships do not indicate causality. Still, as Sprigg noted,  The large number of significant negative outcomes in this study gives legitimate reason for concern about the consequences of  homosexual parenting. According to Drs. Michelle Cretella and Den Trumbull:[M]others and fathers parent differently and make unique contributions to the overall development of the child. Psychological theory of child development has always recognized the critical role that mothers play in the healthy development of children. More recent research reveals that when fathers are absent, children suffer as well. Girls without fathers perform more poorly in school, are more likely to be sexually active and become pregnant as teenagers. Boys without fathers have higher rates of delinquency, violence, and aggression. [T]radition and science agree that biological ties and dual gender parenting are protective for children,  the doctors continue.  The limited research advocating childrearing by same-sex parents has severe methodological limitations. There is significant risk of harm inherent in exposing a child to the homosexual lifestyle.

Back in 2000, the establishment rigged the US Presidential Election and made Florida and its notorious pregnant chads the centerpiece of that artificial controversy. Predictably, the public reaction is outrage. Suddenly, there are calls nationwide for electronic voting as the solution to the old  inefficient  paper ballot system.Now that electronic voting is all-pervasive in the US, the next problem becomes  cyber security    which the government is referring to as the next burning national security issue.Enter the relatively new and prohibitively expensive Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which ironically (or not) was created by one George W. Bush   a president who was installed into power not by the popular vote, but by a dubious Supreme Court decision in that very same 2000 US Presidential Election. Now DHS head and Obama appointee Jeh Johnson, is nudging towards the idea of the domestic military force taking over the election process. Johnson claims that US elections are part of the country s vital infrastructure and therefore it must be under the control of an already bloated federal agency.What is wrong with a decentralized, traditional paper ballot system? If you are in the business of fixing elections, the answer is simple: paper is too difficult, sloppy and complicated... to hack.It s no coincidence at all that this latest power-grab by the federal government comes immediately after a mainstream conspiracy theory that Russia was somehow behind this week s election database  hack  in Arizona (once again, Putin did it). No proof has been offered by either politicians or media anchors presently parroting this latest sensational plot.Looking back, we can see now that years of excessive lobbying by Washington insider firms eager tosecure lucrative contracts  by implementing a myriad of fatally flawed electronic voting systems  was not a mere accident of nature. It was designed for this very police state end-run we see now.The only problem is that this would be unconstitutional, but does this government really care about constitutional law?Not when you are erecting a police state Barbara Hollingsworth CNS NewsHomeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson s suggestion that state and local voting systems be designated as  pieces of critical infrastructure  so that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) can protect them from hackers is unconstitutional and would create a dangerous precedent, legal experts said.

It s unclear if Rubio was wincing because he isn t happy with Trump s choice   after all, Scott previously suggested that his millionaire buddy Carlos Beruff should take Rubio s seat   or because he really doesn t like Trump touching him.Rubio would be far from the only person who doesn t want Trump getting that close to him. Recently, reporter Katy Tur detailed a truly disturbing encounter she had with Trump, which resulted in the POTUS planting an unwanted kiss on her cheek. It has also been widely documented that First Lady Melania Trump winces or looks extremely uncomfortable whenever Trump touches her. It s clear that there s definitely something wrong with Trump s transfer of affection, and it seems to make everyone feel dirty.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla\\u002fGetty Images\"],[\"Buckle up America Obama still has 6 months to fundamentally transform America. If the media and #NeverTrump crowd manages to convince voters to support Crooked Hillary, it will be the end of America as we know it Who will be vetting the unlimited number of potential terrorists refugees Obama is bringing to America? The White House announced last week that it is launching a  Call to Action  asking private businesses to help with the resettlement of refugees. This could be done without regard to the government cap of 85,000 total refugees, including 10,000 Syrian refugees, in 2016.Fifteen founding corporations have teamed up with the Obama administration on the effort. These are: Accenture, Airbnb, Chobani, Coursera, Goldman Sachs, Google, HP, IBM, JPMorgan Chase & Co., LinkedIn, Microsoft, Mastercard, UPS, TripAdvisor, and Western Union. The Call to Action initiative is not only to help refugees in the United States, but all over the world.In Europe for example, Mastercard  worked with Mercy Corps to distribute prepaid debit cards to eligible refugees traveling through Serbia. Approximately $75,000 was distributed to nearly 400 families and individuals.  The three main facets of this private partnership program are:  education,   employment,  and  enablement.  Education includes  facilitating refugee children and young adults  education by ensuring that refugee students can access schools of all levels.  The employment facet includes  increasing employment opportunities for refugees. Through those two parts of the initiative refugees can be settled in the United States without limit as they wouldn t fall under the purview of the government cap on refugee resettlement. Through work and education visas refugees would not actually be considered as refugees for their immigration status. One of the companies already partnered with the Obama administration, Chobani, currently has a work force in the United States that is roughly 30 percent resettled refugees. A White House fact sheet states 66 percent of refugees are of working age.Outside of employment and education, under the  enablement  part of the initiative, the White House mentions that companies can help refugees get access to financial services, technology, housing and transport. This also includes  covering costs of charter flight to bring resettled refugees to the United States (or to another country of resettlement). These refugees will be coming outside the refugee resettlement program so they would not be counted under the government cap of 10,000. These  alternative legal pathways or sponsorships  will be under employment visas, training, student visas and scholarships, visiting scholars etc,  Nayla Rush, senior researcher at the Center for Immigration Studies, told The Daily Caller.Rush added,  remember, the aim is to bring as many Syrian refugees as possible. 10,000 is the limit this [Fiscal Year] under the refugee resettlement program. No limit to these  private sponsorships , more importantly, to traceability. At a United Nations summit on September 20, Obama is going to push for  double the number of resettlement slots and alternative legal pathways for admission that are available to refugees, and increase the number of countries accepting significant numbers of refugees.

On Wednesday, speaking at a joint summit with the Prime Minister of Canada and the President of Mexico, the topic of presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump came up.In the course of discussing Trump s foot-stamping about economic issues, the President took a second to dissect the media narrative that has described Trump as a  populist  for months on end.https:\\u002f\\u002fwww.youtube.com\\u002fwatch?v=gGdIiAO5Pdo Somebody   who has never shown any regard for workers, has never fought on behalf of social justice issues or making sure that poor kids are getting a decent shot at life or have health care,  does not meet the definition, Obama said. They don t suddenly become a populist because they say something controversial in order to win votes. That s not the measure of populism. That s nativism, or xenophobia. Or worse. Or it s just cynicism,  he said.The media has used the reaction of white, blue collar audiences to Trump as evidence that he is a populist speaking to the masses. But the reality TV star is not a man of the people. He has actually made a lot of his money swindling some of those same sorts of people with his fraudulent enterprises like Trump University.As President Obama made clear in just a few seconds, Trump is simply posturing as if he were a populist, but a short glance at his language and his habit of practicing demagoguery destroys his posturing pretty quickly.Trump launched his campaign attacking Latinos as criminals and rapists, he has blamed all immigrants   especially Muslims   for terrorism, and he has also denigrated blacks and women throughout his career.A populist stands up for the little guy, he doesn t turn him upside down and try to suck the money out of his pockets.Featured image via YouTube\"],[\"Wow .just wow!

He was taken to the hospital where he died from his injuries. The gunman is still at large. Police are not currently treating the double-homicide as a hate crime, as the gunman s motive for the crime is not yet known.The New York Daily News reports that: Imam Alala Uddin Akongi, the married father of three, was a revered religious leader since his arrival in Queens from Bangladesh less than two years ago. His assistant, 65-year-old Thara Uddin, died about four hours after the attack.The shooter left his victims lying in their own blood just one block from the Al-Furqan Jame Masjid Mosque in Ozone Park, where the two prayed together only minutes earlier.The imam s nephew said Akongi had no problems with anyone in the neighborhood.

In his speech, Williams explained who the award was really for: Now, this award, this is not for me,  he said. This is for the real organizers all over the country, activist civil rights attorneys, the parents, the teachers, the students who are realizing that a system built to divide and impoverish and destroy us cannot stand if we do. All right?  he explained.  It s kind of basic mathematics, the more we learn about who we are and how we got here, the more we will mobilize. Despite its peaceful yearning for racial understanding, for some reason conservatives and racists were set off by the speech. An online petition was launched, asking that Williams be fired from his position on the TV show, and said he  spewed a racist, hate speech against law enforcement and white people at the BET awards.  The petition creator, Erin Smith, compared the speech to racist outbursts from TV personality Paula Deen and a homophobic rant from actor Isaiah Washington.But Shonda Rhimes, the creator and producer of Grey s Anatomy, who has been called the most powerful woman in television, did not bow to the online mob.The ShondaLand producer fired back Monday night at a 7,000 signature-strong Change.org petition calling for ABC to ax Williams   who plays hunky Dr. Jackson Avery on the doctor drama   in light of his much-praised speech inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement.

Well, the artist responsible for it is speaking out on the past two Obama presidencies. Some might say that Shepard Fairey is partly responsible for the election of Obama. Who DIDN T want some hope and change in 2008? Now we know the rest of the story we got no hope and the change is a disaster! So you would think that Shepard Fairey has seen the light and is voting like many Democrats are for Trump. No, he hasn t learned anything after all. As much as he says Obama s agenda was a disaster, he s going to vote for Bernie. Liberal lunacy for sure!Shepard Fairey, who s now a Bernie Sanders supporter, says that after Obama won the presidency, he went  quiet on a lot of things  he promised while running for office. I think history will be fairly kind of his presidency but I want things to move further in the direction that he promised as a campaigner,  he said.  He s been more outspoken in the last 18 months. I think he s going out having done some good things and said some good things, but there were about six years there where I think he could have done more. Fairey said he had  high hopes  for Obama and that the president couldn t blame his failures entirely on congressional gridlock. If he had been as outspoken as he was as a campaigner, I would give him a pass on not being able to push through some of the progressive things I hoped he would, but he was quiet on a lot of things,  he added.  That to me was unfortunate. Similarly, German journalist Klaus Faissner pointed out that Obama transformed from an  electrifying candidate  into a  Bush on steroids  who promoted drone strikes, mass surveillance, and a totalitarian relationship with the media. Obama signed more orders for drone assaults than Bush Jr. had done in the entire eight years of his presidency,  he said.  These were drone strikes which caused catastrophic levels of non-combatant casualties, which America simply wrote-off under the euphemism of  collateral damage.

Businesses with fewer than 25 employees would have an extra year to comply.At $10 an hour, California already has one of the highest minimum wages in the nation along with Massachusetts. Only Washington, D.C., at $10.50 per hour is higher. The hike to $15 would make it the highest statewide wage in the nation by far, though raises are in the works in other states that might change by the time the plateau is reached in 2022.The ongoing campaign to increase the minimum wage in America, dubbed  the fight for fifteen,  has received support in the states most often as part of laws enacted pertaining to government employees and not the population as a whole. Oregon has enacted legislation upping pay in urban areas, while the city of Seattle passed a minimum wage increase ordinance.Ahead of the 2014 midterm elections, Democrats introduced a bill to increase the national minimum wage to $15. Despite having a majority of the votes in the Senate, the bill failed because enough Republicans opposed it reaching the critical requirement of 60 votes in favor.On the Democratic side of the presidential race, both Clinton and Sanders have backed minimum wage increase ballot initiatives, with Sanders often being more aggressive than Clinton in backing the most progressive iterations of the legislation.Republican presidential candidates have often opposed attempts to raise the wage, with some using the excuse that it would add to the cost of goods even though research indicates that this could easily be absorbed by companies while also preserving fat profits.Featured image via Flickr\"],[\"What happens when Hillary s poll numbers take a nose-dive after she s caught having convulsions in a  press-free  zone, passes out, and has to lifted into her vehicle by secret service? What happens when the public realizes Hillary is a sociopathic liar and they decide they can no longer support her, even if her genitalia matches theirs? They panic and then they resort to the most despicable act of all impugning the character of Donald J. Trump by using a FROG to paint him as a  racist!  pinning him to ONE person on Twitter who used Pepe the Frog to push a  White Nationalist  message. According to the liberal rag The Daily Beast the Twitter user is a self-proclaimed 19 yr old White Supremacist. The Hillary campaign is desperate, and is looking for any excuse they can think of to take down their formidable opponent, Donald J. Trump. How do they do it? With a frog From the Hillary.com website:Over the weekend, Donald Trump s son and one of his closest advisers posted an odd photo on their social media accounts:This raised some important questions.That s Pepe. He s a symbol associated with white supremacy.That s right.Here s the short version: Pepe is a cartoon frog who began his internet life as an innocent meme enjoyed by teenagers and pop stars alike.But in recent months, Pepe s been almost entirely co-opted by the white supremacists who call themselves the  alt-right.  They ve decided to take back Pepe by adding swastikas and other symbols of anti-semitism and white supremacy. We basically mixed Pepe in with Nazi propaganda, etc. We built that association,  one prominent white supremacist told the Daily Beast.Trump has retweeted his white supremacist supporters with regularity, but the connection between the alt-right and his campaign continues to strengthen. Trump has been slow to disavow support from Ku Klux Klansmen (HILLARY IS THE ONLY CANDIDATE WHO HAS RECEIVED OVER $20,000 IN DONATIONS FROM THE KKK AND HAS BEEN OPENLY ENDORSED BY THE HATE GROUP) and white supremacy groups, and he recently hired Breitbart.com s Steve Bannon as his campaign CEO (and Bannon isn t shy about the fact that his  news  organization is the  platform for the alt-right ).Now white supremacists have given Pepe the cartoon frog some Trump hair and the candidate s own son says he is  honored to be grouped with  him.Let me get this straight: Trump s presidential campaign is posting memes associated with white supremacy online?Yes.Like all great art, Pepe was open to endless interpretation, but at the end of the day, he meant whatever you wanted him to mean. All in good fun, teens made Batman Pepe, Supermarket Checkout Girl Pepe, Borat Pepe, Keith Haring Pepe, and carved Pepe pumpkins.But he also embodied existential angst. Pepe, the grimiest but most versatile meme of all, was both hero and antihero a symbol fit for all of life s ups and downs and the full spectrum of human emotions, as they played out online.On social media, Pepe became inescapable. Katy Perry tweeted a crying Pepe with the caption  Australian jet lag got me like,  racking up over 10,000 retweets. Nicki Minaj posted a twerking Pepe on Instagram with the caption  Me on Instagram for the next few weeks trying to get my followers back up,  which 282,000 users  liked. And then, recently, things took a turn: Pepe became socially unacceptable.Here is a screen shot of the PARODY account @JaredTSwift the Daily Beast and Hillary s campaign refer to:Yep that s it. Pepe the Frog was used by a singe Twitter user who clearly identifies his account as  PARODY,  so if Trump or anyone associated with Trump uses Pepe the Frog (who has been used by literally hundreds of thousands of social media users) Trump must be a  racist!  There is absolutely no mention of Jared Taylor Swift s support for Donald J. Trump in his bio or in his Pepe the Frog posts.

In fact, according to a video that was uncovered by citizen journalist Jack Posobiec, Obama s State Department told reporters during the Trump transition period, that the State Department didn t have any problem with the transition team meeting with any foreign officials (See video below). According to CNN correspondent Jim Acosta, the Obama regime actually gave the  go-ahead  for Flynn to have conversations with the Russian Ambassador: On Friday, the White House said that it was the Obama administration that authorized former national security adviser Michael Flynn s contacts with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak during President Trump s transition, according to CNN. Flynn pleaded guilty on Friday to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Kislyak in the month before Trump took office, the first current or former Trump White House official brought down by special counsel Robert Mueller s investigation into Russian election meddling.

So, what does Trump do in retaliation? Why, he takes to Twitter, of course.First, Trump insisted that it was  illegal leaks  and  fake news  that was the REAL story, not Sessions s shading dealings with the Russian Ambassador and his lies regarding said dealings. When that tactic didn t kill the story, Trump tried an even more insane approach, and tweeted a 13-year-old photo of Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) with Vladimir Putin.This approach makes no sense at all, considering that Team Trump keeps saying that there s absolutely nothing wrong with people in Congress meeting with foreign diplomats and leaders, be they adversaries or otherwise. However, Trump plowed on, and tweeted the following:So, let me get this straight.

Eduardo Leonardo plead guilty to stealing from the USDA by illegally exchanging over a million dollars of food stamp benefits for cash for over two years. I stole from the USDA and the Food and Nutrition Service,  Eduardo Leonardo said slowly in Spanish through a translator in Brooklyn Federal Court.  It was an exchange of benefits for cash. Leonardo, 57,  admitted to committing  food stamp  fraud between Oct. 2015 and March 2017 by giving customers cash in exchange for running their EBT cards for a higher amount, which the federal government would later reimburse.In one instance, an undercover witness from the USDA went into Super Economic and picked up a jar of peanut butter and jelly and crackers, totaling $5.48. The witness then asked Leonardo to exchange benefits for $200 cash and Leonardo charged an undercover EBT card $287.89 and gave the witness $200 in cash, making a $82.41 profit.The USDA lost a total of $1,116,924.27 in the transactions.The scammer has run his store, Super Economic One Way Supermarket out of 104-21 Glenwood Road in Canarsie since Dec. 2011.

The group of men surrounding Trump on a day-to-day basis are fringe racists, incompetent liars, yes-men, goons, and at least one member of a Nazi alliance organization overseas. It s less  team of rivals and more dysfunctional group culled from the comment section at Breitbart.Worse still, Trump s two closest advisors   son-in-law Jared Kushner and former Breitbart owner Steve Bannon   reportedly despise each other, fighting  non-stop,  according to sources within the White House.Unfortunately for the dignity of the office, Trump s decision to hire white nationalist Steve Bannon to be his go-to guy is coming back to haunt him. Bannon has taken to using two disgusting phrases to refer to Kushner:  cuck  and  globalist. The word  cuck  is frequently flung around in fringe right-wing white nationalist circles and originates from  cuckhold  meant to denote emasculation. In more modern times, the term is often used by racists to describe a white woman cheating on her white husband with a black man. Bannon apparently can t stop using it in reference to Kushner. [Steve] recently vented to us about Jared being a  globalist  and a  cuck He actually said  cuck,  as in  cuckservative,  the administration official told The Daily Beast. Cuckservative,  a portmanteau of  cuckold  and  conservative,  has become a favorite slur on the right, used like a sexually and racially charged version of  RINO,  a Republican In Name Only.His other favorite is  globalist,  a term often used by white nationalists and neo-Nazi groups to mean  Jewish.  The term is considered a two-for-one slur within the right-wing community. Its origins in anti-Semitism is accented by its nativism. Here s how Daily Beast s Asawin Suebsaeng put it: Globalist  is a term typically used by nationalist, pro-Trump right-wingers against political opponents; however, the term has also come under fire for at times carrying anti-Semitic tones. (Kushner is Jewish.)The use of  globalism  as a stand-in for  Jewish  is well documented and seems to be particularly entrenched in minds of some Trump voters. Forward magazine did an excellent piece on why that is.For Bannon, Kushner represents  interests  outside of white America. Anyone outside Trump s White House probably isn t surprised what that means. Bannon is a long-time anti-Semite.

Only then, Trump said, will he figure out a plan to deal with the  terrific people  who are in the U.S. illegally but have otherwise clean criminal histories. Securing the border, he said, is a prerequisite for any other action on immigration One unchanged part of his immigration platform has been his plan for the construction of a wall along America s southern border with Mexico, something he said he would force the Mexican government to pay for by threatening to cut off the flow of money from immigrants to their families south of the border. Trump said Sunday that while an actual wall will be necessary along some portions of the border, a mere fence will suffice in others.

The phrase is a racialized code word that was aimed at crystallizing the public s opinion to support tougher sentences for criminals in the 1990 s. Jones lambasted Trump for his violently misogynistic comments towards women.  I want to say a couple things. First of all, this is the law and order candidate,  Jones said to the show s panel.  Let s not forget, this is Mr. Law and Order, who is now on tape confessing to a crime. He s confessing to sexual assault. The problem isn t the talk, the problem isn t the bad words, the problem is the bad deeds. He s saying he feels he has the right as a star to sexually assault women. Jones then went on to recall the time that Trump worked to get five black boys charged with sexual assault. Those boys turned out to be innocent. They have become known as the Central Park Five. The irony of all this and how it relates to Trump s current situation was not lost on Jones.    Now, the irony here is this for me   this man came on to the scene politically in New York City attacking five innocent black boys accusing them of what? Sexual assault. He comes on the scene. He says these five boys committed sexual assault   and they were innocent. He never apologized! He said Mexican immigrants are rapists, sexual assaulters. It turns out the sexual assaulter, the superpredator is the man running for president! We have a superpredator named Donald Trump. I want to challenge the media now: put up the pictures of those five young innocent black boys and Donald Trump and ask America,  Who is a thug here? Who is a thug?  It s Donald Trump. Jones recently appeared in Netflix original documentary 13th. In the documentary, Jones explains how Trump has held consistently racist views that have been used to support mass incarceration efforts in the U.S. It is an excellent documentary that everyone in the U.S. absolutely MUST SEE.  As Jones explains in the interview and the film, Trump is a dangerous man who uses coded language to advance his racist agenda. He brags that he would have had five innocent boys executed for a crime they did not commit. At the time, Trump even paid top dollar for a full page ad urging New Yorkers to bring back the death penalty in order to have the Central Park Five be given a capital punishment sentence.

But Williams says there s an area where he can t disagree with  the President   Obama s plan to use his executive powers to help alleviate a problem most of his fellow conservatives won t touch.On Tuesday, the President broke into tears as he discussed the problem of gun violence in America today   specifically, the lives lost in the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary in 2012, which Obama calls the  worst day in [his] presidency.  Obama has pledged to close the  gun show loophole,  which has traditionally allowed pretty damn near everyone to circumvent the background check procedure and get themselves a shootin  stick with minimal hassle. In addition, the President will be removing legal barriers preventing a doctor from reporting when someone is too crazy to have a gun, strengthening licensing requirements for sellers, and making dealers responsible for reporting guns that go missing.While many conservatives, including the veritable Brady Bunch of ignorance that is the GOP 2016 presidential field, view these common sense steps as an attack on the freedom of every single man, woman, and child, Williams applauds the President s approach to the problem of gun violence today.  I PROUDLY own 14 guns RESPONSIBLY,  Williams wrote on Facebook.  Naturally, I listened closely to what President Obama said today on guns, and I ve read what was put out detailing his proposals. He explained that no truly responsible gun owner should oppose the President s plans to reform gun laws, nor should any of them develop the opinion that the President and his jack-booted thugs will be going door to door taking people s firearms from them. I m a proud, responsible gun owner and we ought to be the LOUDEST voices for universal background checks, for keeping guns away from criminals and the mentally ill,  he says.  That is how to be a proud steward of the  # 2a right I and so many others hold dear. If I thought for a minute the goal was to take my guns, I d oppose it,  Williams added in a comment.  I m a law abiding American   nothing to fear. I think the corollary to effective background checks is to make it EASIER and more streamlined for law abiding folks to get guns. In an op-ed for HuffPo, Williams says that  as a proud, responsible, gun owner,  he  can t NOT support  the President s proposal: I realize this may not make me popular with some gun owners, and I realize there is deep distrust of President Obama and his use of executive action. Simply put, I ve always believed in being a responsible ambassador for the Second Amendment, a right that I hold dear; and, thus, I believe responsible gun owners MUST be the loudest voices for universal background checks and addressing the mental health crisis we face in this country, which form the crux of the president s proposals. Williams says that he has formed his views largely through his work with students  in the wake of school shootings over the years.  Williams challenges anyone who disagrees that it is important to enact common sense gun legislation to spend time with children who have survived school shootings: They all have the same, haunted look in their eyes, one that frequently keeps me up at night. I would challenge anyone to listen to their stories, experience their pain and then go back the next year and the next, and see how profoundly they are affected and then do it all over again for the next school   you ll feel the same way I do. Universal background checks should be a no-brainer. Guns should not change hands without a background check,  he says.  I cannot give my car to my children without filing a form with the DMV, and no one complains about that burden, nor do they suggest it s a veiled attempt to de-car America. Unfortunately, the NRA and its acolytes spread fear   Obama wants your guns   to all who will listen, and unfortunately too many listen. The NRA and its bought-and-paid-for politicians fight progress with regard to gun legislation every step of the way   including, of course, background checks. Giving up even that much, in their eyes, would be giving up their guns.Williams suggests that we dispense with the meaningless rhetoric, cross the aisle, and work together to solve the problem of gun violence in this country   the root of which, he  says, is that it s  dangerous allowing people to acquire guns without a background check. Williams says that both liberals and conservatives need to skip the divisiveness that plagues our country and focus on the fact that our children s lives are at stake. He asks his fellow gun owners not to buy into the extreme Right s propaganda that paints this as a gun-grabbing measure: This is common sense, and, ultimately, the best way to advance and protect the Second Amendment right we hold dear. Williams is right. No one is trying to take anyone s guns. In fact, President Obama is attempting to ensure that everyone who should be able to get a gun can get one. In the end, this would even accomplish some conservative goals: people would feel safer around armed individuals if they all passed a comprehensive background check and were mentally competent to handle the weapon, for instance. In that sense, the President s plan is a godsend for pro-Second Amendment people of all stripes. If conservatives want to end the stigma associated with gun ownership, the absolute best way is to support this opportunity to protect the integrity of the Second Amendment.Featured image via Facebook\\u002fscreengrab \"],[\"Can you believe a first grader was  investigated  for whether she intentionally  misgendered   a fellow student who decided to identify from a boy to a girl?

The incident reportedly took place at California s Rocklin Academy, in the school playground, where the female student called her biologically male classmate  by his given name   apparently unaware that the boy now identified as a girl,  according to Fox News. This innocent little first grader sees a classmate, calls him by the name she knew him last year and the boy reports it to a teacher,  claimed Karen England, from the Capitol Resource Institute.  The little girl gets in trouble on the playground and then gets called out of class to the principal s office. During her visit to the principal s office, the child was reportedly  investigated  to determine  whether or not she had bullied the transgender child by calling him by his original name. After about an hour it was determined the little girl made an honest mistake and she was not punished or reprimanded. But she was terribly traumatized by the incident,  Fox News claimed.After the child returned home upset, her mother wrote a letter to the school. I stressed over and over with the principal that I am all for protecting the rights of [the transgender child], but my children have rights as well,  wrote the mother in her letter.  It makes me sad that my daughter felt like she was punished for trying to be kind to the kid.

None of this has been stopped in Britain by the government, who did not care to protect thousands of children raped, threatened, sold, drugged and many even killed by Muslim men. This mentality amongst Muslims that the video shows, especially Sunni Muslims, will be common in virtually every single mosque not only in Britain, but throughout Europe, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the US.The Muslim hatred continues to flourish throughout the country, all because of a weak and incompetent leadership and EU policies that protect hate preachers and terrorism. The permission for Islam to grow and exist   a fascist ideology of the medieval ages   is the root cause of growing terrorism growing and expanding into the West.It is not difficult to see what Britain s future will be.

Locke explains that he received the  thank you  letter from his favorite  baby parts  boogeyman after an an undisclosed amount was donated in his honor by a woman named Krista Ginsberg in Houston, Texas. At the end of the day, it doesn t matter how big or how small it was, it was a waste of your money and the stamp was a waste of your money,  Locke raves in the video.  Don t ever send me anymore nonsense from Planned Parenthood. There has never been an organization in the world that has killed more innocent people other than radical Islam than that of Planned Parenthood,  Locke lied. Naturally, he did not cite a source for the claim.  Look, I m just gonna say it whether you like it or not   Planned Parenthood does not give one flip of a wooden nickel about women s healthcare. It s a bunch of deceptive individuals that are in it for the money that have been known to sell baby parts on the black market and they have done nothing but butcher innocent lives for years. It s safe to assume that Locke was referencing abortion there, which is only three percent of the total services Planned Parenthood provides women. The organization absolutely has not  been known  outside of certain circles of people who can barely operate a fork without adult supervision to sell  baby parts on the black market.  Previously, the organization accepted reimbursements to cover the costs of preparing and shipping donated fetal tissue, but it has since stopped accepting the reimbursements because of liars and zealots like Locke. As far as I m concerned, I don t care if I ever get another piece of literature from you guys again because you re just wasting your money to send me this nonsense,  Locke says, adding that  Pastor Greg Locke has absolutely positively tee-totally nothing to  do with Planned Parenthood. Y all can keep butchering babies, I m gonna keep speaking the truth,  he concludes after throwing the nice thank you letter in the garbage.Apparently, some awesome people decided to get together and go to Planned Parenthood s donation page, where they filled out the form and made a donation   of course carefully checking the  Yes, my gift is in honor or in memory of someone special  box where they entered Locke s information and the address of his church (2060 Old Lebanon Dirt Rd in Mt.

You should totally do it.Within a week of his initial posting, Locke complained about all the love he is getting from enthusiastic supporters of women s healthcare.

In 2013, when then-Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid did basically the same thing, he was cheered on in the studios of MSNBC and CNN.Back then MSNBC s Chris Hayes hailed it as  an affirmative win for democracy,  while his colleague Rachel Maddow blurted  This is a huge freaking deal. This is like 3-inch headlines. This is like people who don t even care about politics really ought to care about this.

And Begala s colleague Ron Brownstein approved of Reid s decision as a forward-thinking move:  The idea of requiring a super majority for the president to appoint his nominees just is anachronistic. But the cable network news hosts and analysts weren t the only ones championing the nuclear option. On the pages of the Los Angeles Times, Reid s move was celebrated in a November 22 editorial  Democrats bust the filibuster, and good for them. The Times editorial board crowed:  We welcome this action not because it represents a comeuppance for arrogant Republicans but because filibustering presidential nominees is undemocratic and violates the spirit if not the letter of the Constitution, which says that the president shall appoint judges and other officials  by and with the advice and consent of the Senate    not by and with a supermajority of the Senate.  The Times went on to call it  a victory not just for the Democrats but for good government.  Newsbusters\"],[\"It s really a pretty simple scheme. Obama is placing Democrat voters (illegal aliens who are given housing, education, food, health care and ultimately citizenship in exchange for their votes) in unsuspecting communities across the USA. Our safety and the safety of our nation is really of no consequence to a man and his family who will be surrounded by secret service for the rest of his life. There seems to be a particular focus on populating red states with illegal aliens and refugees in hopes that can give their party the boost it needs to put those states in play when the elections roll around Part of the supposed mission of DHS is to transport individuals apprehended in the country illegally from our soil to their own. They might stop and spend some time on our soil behind bars, but the general direction of travel and the paperwork is, in theory, towards their home country. That was before the enemies of America took over our country, Hussein Obama in the White House and Jihadi Jeh Johnson at the Department of Homeland Security. Now everything is backwards. There often is no paperwork to track the individuals or direct their travel, just a white van, loaded with illegal aliens pointed north, towards the interior of the United States and a Phoenix bus station. We all remember the uproar over the DHS buses with mirrored windows that were the subject of protests last year. Now DHS is using stealth to bypass the angered American people and it s working.According to a report by Judicial Watch, Homeland  Security  is still secretly transporting illegal aliens into the interior of the United States, those same  shadows  that they will later disingenuously claim to be wanting desperately to rescue them from. They ll be the families that can t be broken up and can t be transported together back to where they belong. They re the immovable squatters who are dictating what will and won t be done to them through the corrupt government that is using them as pawns to advance their agenda.The good people who make up the rank and file members of the CBP and ICE aren t happy about what they are being forced to do and the destructive impact it s having on our nation. Judicial Watch wrote:The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is quietly transporting illegal immigrants from the Mexican border to Phoenix and releasing them without proper processing or issuing court appearance documents, Border Patrol sources tell Judicial Watch. The government classifies them as Other Than Mexican (OTM) and this week around 35 were transferred 116 miles north from Tucson to a Phoenix bus station where they went their separate way. Judicial Watch was present when one of the white vans carrying a group of OTMs arrived at the Phoenix Greyhound station on Buckeye Road.This report, part of an ongoing Judicial Watch investigation into the security risks along the southern border, features only a snippet of a much broader crisis in which illegal aliens are being released and vanishing into unsuspecting American communities. The Senate Subcommittee on Immigration and the National Interest addressed this issue just a few weeks ago in a hearing called Declining Deportations and Increasing Criminal Alien Releases   The Lawless Immigration Policies of the Obama Administration. Judd, the Border Patrol Union chief, delivered alarming figures at the hearing. He estimated that about 80% of apprehended illegal immigrants are released into the United States. This includes unaccompanied minors who are escorted to their final destination, family units and those who claim to have a credible fear of persecution in their native country. Single males that aren t actually seen crossing into the U.S. by Border Patrol agents are released if they claim to have been in the country since 2014, Judd added.The OTMs are from Honduras, Colombia, El Salvador and Guatemala and Border Patrol officials say this week s batch was in custody for a couple of days and ordered to call family members in the U.S. so they could purchase a bus ticket for their upcoming trip from Phoenix. Authorities didn t bother checking the identity of the U.S. relatives or if they re in the country legally, according to a Border Patrol official directly involved in the matter. American taxpayers pick up the fare for those who claim to have a  credible fear,  Border Patrol sources told JW. None of the OTMs were issued official court appearance documents, but were told to  promise  they d show up for a hearing when notified, said federal agents with firsthand knowledge of the operation.A security company contracted by the U.S. government is driving the OTMs from the Border Patrol s Tucson Sector where they were in custody to Phoenix, sources said. The firm is called G4S and claims to be the world s leading security solutions group with operations in more than 100 countries and 610,000 employees. G4S has more than 50,000 employees in the U.S. and its domestic headquarters is in Jupiter, Florida.Outraged Border Patrol agents and supervisors on the front lines say illegal immigrants are being released in droves because there s no room to keep them in detention.  They re telling us to put them on a bus and let them go,  said one law enforcement official in Arizona.  Just move those bodies across the country.  Officially, DHS denies this is occurring. Of course DHS denies it s happening. They are violating their oaths, the public trust and the United States Constitution; it s not likely they ll confess. But there is no doubt it is, and that it is they and not the rank and file members who are lying.The real question that needs to be asked is why it is happening. Why has an agency that is responsible for border enforcement evolved into a mechanism for facilitating border violations or was this its intended function from its subversive beginning?Via: Rick Wells \"],[\"The entire premise for Chuck Todd s position is two media reports.

Lord threw out a false equivalency by comparing everything Trump has said to Hillary Clinton s accurate assessment of Trump supporters as  deplorable  people.Apparently, Clinton s one comment magically makes every truly horrible thing Trump said disappear.Lord then tried to claim that Russia did not influence the election simply because they allegedly did not hack any voting machines.That s when Maher pounced.

Russians didn t hack Nancy Pelosi s election,  Maher shot back.  They hacked our election, all of our intelligence agencies said for one side to win, your side.

Current law gives Democrats the majority because Cooper is going to be governor.Another bill would eliminate 80 percent of the governor s staff, from 1,500 employees to only 300, which would make Cooper s job excruciatingly difficult.Furthermore, Republicans are trying to pass a bill requiring state Senate approval for Cooper s cabinet picks, which means the state of North Carolina will likely be denied leadership in various state agencies because Republicans will more than likely refuse to approve of anyone Cooper picks.Republicans are literally trying to cripple Cooper s administration before he even takes office. But that s not all.Republicans also introduced a bill that would prevent the state Supreme Court from reviewing cases for years by requiring cases to go through the state Court of Appeals first. Democrats gained the majority on the Supreme Court in November while Republicans have the majority on the Appeals Court. So, it s pretty clear what Republicans are doing. Instead of a court-packing bill, it appears we got a court-denial bill,  Southern Coalition for Social Justice director Anita Earls told The Charlotte Observer.  This proposal seems to delay Supreme Court review of cases, including those involving citizens  constitutional rights. Unconstitutional laws could be in effect for years before the state Supreme Court would finally get the case and rule. Republicans are also trying to take cabinet positions away by turning them into independent agencies whose leaders would be appointed by the lieutenant governor, who happens to be a Republican.In short, North Carolina Republicans are screwing over the people and the state because they can t handle losing an election. They are pathetic losers who should be forced out of office before they do any more damage.North Carolina pastor William Barber is reporting that Republicans have introduced 15 bills in all targeting the power of the governor and he is organizing protests against the GOP power grab.

He also falsely told law enforcement that cars outside the nightclub had explosives in them and that he was wearing a vest like the kind they  used in France,  making reference to explosive vests used in the Paris terror attacks. FBI Director James Comey has previously said that Mateen pledged allegiance to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State, as well as to various Islamist terror groups. However the names of those groups and individuals were edited out of the transcripts released Monday.Law enforcement defended the selective editing, saying that they wanted to avoid re-victimizing those who lived through the attack or encouraging others to carryout similar attacks.The editing is  meant to not give credence to individuals who have done terrorist acts in the past,  said FBI Special Agent in Charge Ron Hopper.  We are not going to propagate their violent rhetoric.  But the decision not to release full transcripts of Mateen s 911 call or three crisis negotiator calls almost immediately drew criticism. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan said the decision to edit out references to the Islamic State terrorist group was  preposterous.   We know the shooter was a radical Islamist extremist inspired by ISIS. We also know he intentionally targeted the LGBT community. The administration should release the full, unredacted transcript so the public is clear-eyed about who did this, and why,  the Wisconsin Republican said in a statement. Agent Hopper said Monday that investigators still have no indication that Mateen, who identified himself as an  Islamic solider,  was directed to carry out the attacks by any foreign terrorist group organization. Rather the gunman was radicalized domestically, he said.Read more: Washington Times\"],[\"When people think of rape, they generally imagine some masked man grabbing a woman and dragging her into a dark alley or the woods and assaulting her. However, it generally doesn t happen that way. Most sexual assault occurs at the hands of someone the victim knows   this is usually referred to as  date rape,  or  acquaintance rape.  That is what makes these cases so difficult to prosecute. That is also what makes things like the processing of rape kits and other physical evidence following an assault so vital. However, one Idaho sheriff has gotten the idea in his head that most rapes are  consensual sex,  and thanks to that, he doesn t think his state needs laws making sure rape kits get processed.However, following rightful public outrage, Bingham County Sheriff Craig Rowland is backpeddling. He took to the Sheriff Department s Facebook page to try to explain just why he made the outrageous and despicable assertion that most rapes are actually, to use his words,  consensual sex.  Here is this neanderthal s Facebook  apology : I want to explain what I was trying to say in the interview. I misspoke when I said the majority of our rape cases are consensual sex. The meaning behind my statement that has been misunderstood is that when a case is called into the dispatch center each and every one is thoroughly investigated. A Deputy is sent to every one of these cases and that Deputy then in turn contacts the on-call detective to help with the investigation. In some of these cases through the investigation it may be determined that the sex was consensual, but not always. In these types of cases after the investigation is complete and it was determined that the sex was consensual. I don t believe that those kits should be sent to the lab. Then, as if that sorry excuse for an  apology  weren t enough, Rowland then went on to go down the old  I m sorry if you were offended  road, and then proceeded to paint HIMSELF as a victim here, talking about  cyber-bullying : I know that it is hard for victims to come forward on sexual assault cases. I spoke to a rape victim today and told her that I knew it was hard for her to come forward. I want to apologize to anyone who I might have offended with my statement as my main responsibility is to the public s safety and well being and maintaining their trust.,  he wrote.  I can also say with regret that I now know what it is like to be cyber bullied. Not only have I been threatened but so has my family. I hope that this will clear things up a bit. Sure, it clears things up, Sheriff Rowland, but not in the way you think. What you ve said here is no different from what you said before. You re victim-blaming. Nine times out of ten, if a woman says she was raped, she was. You say yourself that it s hard for victims to disclose. So, why the hell would anyone make something like that up? It s men like you, Sheriff Rowland, who keep rape culture alive and well.You have no business in law enforcement, and I sincerely feel for the rape victims for whom you are their only source of so-called  help.

Entitled  Vault 7  and containing a password that echoed the alleged JFK quote  splinter the CIA into a thousand pieces and scatter it into the winds,  this leak comprises 8,761 documents and files from an isolated, high-security network situated inside the CIA s Center for Cyber Intelligence in Langley, Virginia. Year Zero , which is part one of the leak and conveniently named after a  zero day  exploit used by intelligence agencies, was gathered throughout 2016 and is said to be the  largest intelligence publication in history .Whilst a lot of the information and methodology outlined in  Year Zero  is of no surprise to security analysts and researchers since the Edward Snowden (image, left) revelations, once again the public has explicit confirmation of how one of the most powerful intelligence agencies in the world, aided by their international counterparts like GCHQ, have been infiltrating and scooping vast quantities of private information from Apple and Android devices right up to Samsung  Smart TV  technology where false  stand-by  modes and live microphones can be executed to record information and send it back to the appropriate servers.This document dump is a game changer, because not only does the world know what they ve done, we now know how they ve done it.Based on the CIA s own documents, how do we know it wasn t the CIA themselves behind various  Russian  hacking conspiracies circling around Trump? The questions are proliferating as we speak.More on this report from Wikileaks  Wikileaks  Today, Tuesday 7 March 2017, WikiLeaks begins its new series of leaks on the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency. Code-named  Vault 7  by WikiLeaks, it is the largest ever publication of confidential documents on the agency.The first full part of the series,  Year Zero , comprises 8,761 documents and files from an isolated, high-security network situated inside the CIA s Center for Cyber Intelligence in Langley, Virgina. It follows an introductory disclosure last month of  CIA targeting French political parties and candidates in the lead up to the 2012 presidential election.Recently, the CIA lost control of the majority of its hacking arsenal including malware, viruses, trojans, weaponized  zero day  exploits, malware remote control systems and associated documentation. This extraordinary collection, which amounts to more than several hundred million lines of code, gives its possessor the entire hacking capacity of the CIA. The archive appears to have been circulated among former U.S. government hackers and contractors in an unauthorized manner, one of whom has provided WikiLeaks with portions of the archive. Year Zero  introduces the scope and direction of the CIA s global covert hacking program, its malware arsenal and dozens of  zero day  weaponized exploits against a wide range of U.S. and European company products, include Apple s iPhone, Google s Android and Microsoft s Windows and even Samsung TVs, which are turned into covert microphones.Since 2001 the CIA has gained political and budgetary preeminence over the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA). The CIA found itself building not just its now infamous drone fleet, but a very different type of covert, globe-spanning force   its own substantial fleet of hackers. The agency s hacking division freed it from having to disclose its often controversial operations to the NSA (its primary bureaucratic rival) in order to draw on the NSA s hacking capacities.By the end of 2016, the CIA s hacking division, which formally falls under the agency s Center for Cyber Intelligence (CCI), had over 5000 registered users and had produced more than a thousand hacking systems, trojans, viruses, and other  weaponized  malware. Such is the scale of the CIA s undertaking that by 2016, its hackers had utilized more code than that used to run Facebook. The CIA had created, in effect, its  own NSA  with even less accountability and without publicly answering the question as to whether such a massive budgetary spend on duplicating the capacities of a rival agency could be justified.In a statement to WikiLeaks the source details policy questions that they say urgently need to be debated in public, including whether the CIA s hacking capabilities exceed its mandated powers and the problem of public oversight of the agency. The source wishes to initiate a public debate about the security, creation, use, proliferation and democratic control of cyberweapons.Once a single cyber  weapon  is  loose  it can spread around the world in seconds, to be used by rival states, cyber mafia and teenage hackers alike.Julian Assange, WikiLeaks editor stated that  There is an extreme proliferation risk in the development of cyber  weapons . Comparisons can be drawn between the uncontrolled proliferation of such  weapons , which results from the inability to contain them combined with their high market value, and the global arms trade. But the significance of  Year Zero  goes well beyond the choice between cyberwar and cyberpeace. The disclosure is also exceptional from a political, legal and forensic perspective. Wikileaks has carefully reviewed the  Year Zero  disclosure and published substantive CIA documentation while avoiding the distribution of  armed  cyberweapons until a consensus emerges on the technical and political nature of the CIA s program and how such  weapons  should analyzed, disarmed and published.Wikileaks has also decided to redact and anonymise some identifying information in  Year Zero  for in depth analysis. These redactions include ten of thousands of CIA targets and attack machines throughout Latin America, Europe and the United States. While we are aware of the imperfect results of any approach chosen, we remain committed to our publishing model and note that the quantity of published pages in  Vault 7  part one ( Year Zero ) already eclipses the total number of pages published over the first three years of the Edward Snowden NSA leaks.CIA malware and hacking tools are built by EDG (Engineering Development Group), a software development group within CCI (Center for Cyber Intelligence), a department belonging to the CIA s DDI (Directorate for Digital Innovation). The DDI is one of the five major directorates of the CIA (see this  organizational chart of the CIA for more details).The EDG is responsible for the development, testing and operational support of all backdoors, exploits, malicious payloads, trojans, viruses and any other kind of malware used by the CIA in its covert operations world-wide.The increasing sophistication of surveillance techniques has drawn comparisons with George Orwell s 1984, but  Weeping Angel , developed by the CIA s Embedded Devices Branch (EDB), which infests smart TVs, transforming them into covert microphones, is surely its most emblematic realization.The attack against Samsung smart TVs was developed in cooperation with the United Kingdom s MI5\\u002fBTSS. After infestation, Weeping Angel places the target TV in a  Fake-Off  mode, so that the owner falsely believes the TV is off when it is on. In  Fake-Off  mode the TV operates as a bug, recording conversations in the room and sending them over the Internet to a covert CIA server.As of October 2014 the CIA was also looking at  infecting the vehicle control systems used by modern cars and trucks. The purpose of such control is not specified, but it would permit the CIA to engage in nearly undetectable assassinations.The CIA s Mobile Devices Branch (MDB) developed  numerous attacks to remotely hack and control popular smart phones. Infected phones can be instructed to send the CIA the user s geolocation, audio and text communications as well as covertly activate the phone s camera and microphone.Despite iPhone s minority share (14.5%) of the global smart phone market in 2016, a specialized unit in the CIA s Mobile Development Branch produces malware to infest, control and exfiltrate data from iPhones and other Apple products running iOS, such as iPads. CIA s arsenal includes numerous local and remote  zero days  developed by CIA or obtained from GCHQ, NSA, FBI or purchased from cyber arms contractors such as Baitshop. The disproportionate focus on iOS may be explained by the popularity of the iPhone among social, political, diplomatic and business elites.A similar unit targets Google s Android which is used to run the majority of the world s smart phones (~85%) including Samsung, HTC and Sony. 1.15 billion Android powered phones were sold last year.  Year Zero  shows that as of 2016 the CIA had 24  weaponized  Android  zero days  which it has developed itself and obtained from GCHQ, NSA and cyber arms contractors.These techniques permit the CIA to bypass the encryption of WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram, Wiebo, Confide and Cloackman by hacking the  smart  phones that they run on and collecting audio and message traffic before encryption is applied.The CIA also runs a very substantial effort to infect and control Microsoft Windows users with its malware. This includes multiple local and remote weaponized  zero days , air gap jumping viruses such as  Hammer Drill  which infects software distributed on CD\\u002fDVDs,  infectors for removable media such as USBs, systems to  hide data in images or in covert disk areas (  Brutal Kangaroo ) and to keep its malware infestations going.Many of these infection efforts are pulled together by the CIA s Automated Implant Branch (AIB), which has developed several attack systems for automated infestation and control of CIA malware, such as  Assassin  and  Medusa .Attacks against Internet infrastructure and webservers are developed by the CIA s Network Devices Branch (NDB).The CIA has developed automated multi-platform malware attack and control systems covering Windows, Mac OS X, Solaris, Linux and more, such as EDB s  HIVE  and the related  Cutthroat  and  Swindle  tools, which are described in the examples section below.In the wake of Edward Snowden s leaks about the NSA, the U.S. technology industry secured a commitment from the Obama administration that the executive would disclose on an ongoing basis   rather than hoard   serious vulnerabilities, exploits, bugs or  zero days  to Apple, Google, Microsoft, and other US-based manufacturers.Serious vulnerabilities not disclosed to the manufacturers places huge swathes of the population and critical infrastructure at risk to foreign intelligence or cyber criminals who independently discover or hear rumors of the vulnerability. If the CIA can discover such vulnerabilities so can others.The U.S. government s commitment to the  Vulnerabilities Equities Process came after significant lobbying by US technology companies, who risk losing their share of the global market over real and perceived hidden vulnerabilities. The government stated that it would disclose all pervasive vulnerabilities discovered after 2010 on an ongoing basis. Year Zero  documents show that the CIA breached the Obama administration s commitments. Many of the vulnerabilities used in the CIA s cyber arsenal are pervasive and some may already have been found by rival intelligence agencies or cyber criminals.As an example, specific CIA malware revealed in  Year Zero  is able to penetrate, infest and control both the Android phone and iPhone software that runs or has run presidential Twitter accounts. The CIA attacks this software by using undisclosed security vulnerabilities ( zero days ) possessed by the CIA but if the CIA can hack these phones then so can everyone else who has obtained or discovered the vulnerability. As long as the CIA keeps these vulnerabilities concealed from Apple and Google (who make the phones) they will not be fixed, and the phones will remain hackable.The same vulnerabilities exist for the population at large, including the U.S. Cabinet, Congress, top CEOs, system administrators, security officers and engineers. By hiding these security flaws from manufacturers like Apple and Google the CIA ensures that it can hack everyone &mdsh; at the expense of leaving everyone hackable.Cyber  weapons  are not possible to keep under effective control.While nuclear proliferation has been restrained by the enormous costs and visible infrastructure involved in assembling enough fissile material to produce a critical nuclear mass, cyber  weapons , once developed, are very hard to retain.Cyber  weapons  are in fact just computer programs which can be pirated like any other. Since they are entirely comprised of information they can be copied quickly with no marginal cost.Securing such  weapons  is particularly difficult since the same people who develop and use them have the skills to exfiltrate copies without leaving traces   sometimes by using the very same  weapons  against the organizations that contain them. There are substantial price incentives for government hackers and consultants to obtain copies since there is a global  vulnerability market  that will pay hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars for copies of such  weapons . Similarly, contractors and companies who obtain such  weapons  sometimes use them for their own purposes, obtaining advantage over their competitors in selling  hacking  services.Over the last three years the United States intelligence sector, which consists of government agencies such as the CIA and NSA and their contractors, such as Booze Allan Hamilton, has been subject to unprecedented series of data exfiltrations by its own workers.A number of intelligence community members not yet publicly named have been arrested or subject to federal criminal investigations in separate incidents.Most visibly, on February 8, 2017 a U.S. federal grand jury indicted Harold T. Martin III with 20 counts of mishandling classified information. The Department of Justice alleged that it seized some 50,000 gigabytes of information from Harold T. Martin III that he had obtained from classified programs at NSA and CIA, including the source code for numerous hacking tools.Once a single cyber  weapon  is  loose  it can spread around the world in seconds, to be used by peer states, cyber mafia and teenage hackers alike.In addition to its operations in Langley, Virginia the CIA also uses the U.S. consulate in Frankfurt as a covert base for its hackers covering Europe, the Middle East and Africa.CIA hackers operating out of the Frankfurt consulate (  Center for Cyber Intelligence Europe  or CCIE) are given diplomatic ( black ) passports and State Department cover.  The instructions for incoming CIA hackers make Germany s counter-intelligence efforts appear inconsequential:  Breeze through German Customs because you have your cover-for-action story down pat, and all they did was stamp your passport Your Cover Story (for this trip) Q: Why are you here? A: Supporting technical consultations at the Consulate.Two earlier WikiLeaks publications give further detail on CIA approaches to customs and secondary screening procedures.Once in Frankfurt CIA hackers can travel without further border checks to the 25 European countries that are part of the Shengen open border area   including France, Italy and Switzerland.A number of the CIA s electronic attack methods are designed for physical proximity. These attack methods are able to penetrate high security networks that are disconnected from the internet, such as police record database. In these cases, a CIA officer, agent or allied intelligence officer acting under instructions, physically infiltrates the targeted workplace. The attacker is provided with a USB containing malware developed for the CIA for this purpose, which is inserted into the targeted computer. The attacker then infects and exfiltrates data to removable media. For example, the CIA attack system Fine Dining, provides 24 decoy applications for CIA spies to use. To witnesses, the spy appears to be running a program showing videos (e.g VLC), presenting slides (Prezi), playing a computer game (Breakout2, 2048) or even running a fake virus scanner (Kaspersky, McAfee, Sophos). But while the decoy application is on the screen, the underlaying system is automatically infected and ransacked.In what is surely one of the most astounding intelligence own goals in living memory, the CIA structured its classification regime such that for the most market valuable part of  Vault 7    the CIA s weaponized malware (implants + zero days), Listening Posts (LP), and Command and Control (C2) systems   the agency has little legal recourse.The CIA made these systems unclassified.Why the CIA chose to make its cyberarsenal unclassified reveals how concepts developed for military use do not easily crossover to the  battlefield  of cyber  war .To attack its targets, the CIA usually requires that its implants communicate with their control programs over the internet. If CIA implants, Command & Control and Listening Post software were classified, then CIA officers could be prosecuted or dismissed for violating rules that prohibit placing classified information onto the Internet. Consequently the CIA has secretly made most of its cyber spying\\u002fwar code unclassified. The U.S. government is not able to assert copyright either, due to restrictions in the U.S. Constitution. This means that cyber  arms  manufactures and computer hackers can freely  pirate  these  weapons  if they are obtained. The CIA has primarily had to rely on obfuscation to protect its malware secrets.Conventional weapons such as missiles may be fired at the enemy (i.e into an unsecured area). Proximity to or impact with the target detonates the ordnance including its classified parts. Hence military personnel do not violate classification rules by firing ordnance with classified parts. Ordnance will likely explode. If it does not, that is not the operator s intent.Over the last decade U.S. hacking operations have been increasingly dressed up in military jargon to tap into Department of Defense funding streams. For instance, attempted  malware injections  (commercial jargon) or  implant drops  (NSA jargon) are being called  fires  as if a weapon was being fired. However the analogy is questionable.Unlike bullets, bombs or missiles, most CIA malware is designed to live for days or even years after it has reached its  target . CIA malware does not  explode on impact  but rather permanently infests its target. In order to infect target s device, copies of the malware must be placed on the target s devices, giving physical possession of the malware to the target. To exfiltrate data back to the CIA or to await further instructions the malware must communicate with CIA Command & Control (C2) systems placed on internet connected servers. But such servers are typically not approved to hold classified information, so CIA command and control systems are also made unclassified.A successful  attack  on a target s computer system is more like a series of complex stock maneuvers in a hostile take-over bid or the careful planting of rumors in order to gain control over an organization s leadership rather than the firing of a weapons system. If there is a military analogy to be made, the infestation of a target is perhaps akin to the execution of a whole series of military maneuvers against the target s territory including observation, infiltration, occupation and exploitation.A series of standards lay out CIA malware infestation patterns which are likely to assist forensic crime scene investigators as well as Apple, Microsoft, Google, Samsung, Nokia, Blackberry, Siemens and anti-virus companies attribute and defend against attacks. Tradecraft DO s and DON Ts  contains CIA rules on how its malware should be written to avoid fingerprints implicating the  CIA, US government, or its witting partner companies  in  forensic review . Similar secret standards cover the  use of encryption to hide CIA hacker and malware communication (pdf), describing targets & exfiltrated data (pdf) as well as  executing payloads (pdf) and  persisting (pdf) in the target s machines over time.CIA hackers developed successful attacks against most well known anti-virus programs. These are documented in AV defeats, Personal Security Products, Detecting and defeating PSPs and PSP\\u002fDebugger\\u002fRE Avoidance. For example, Comodo was defeated by CIA malware placing itself in the Window s  Recycle Bin . While Comodo 6.x has a  Gaping Hole of DOOM .CIA hackers discussed what the NSA s  Equation Group  hackers did wrong and how the CIA s malware makers could avoid similar exposure.The CIA s Engineering Development Group (EDG) management system contains around 500 different projects (only some of which are documented by  Year Zero ) each with their own sub-projects, malware and hacker tools.The majority of these projects relate to tools that are used for penetration, infestation ( implanting ), control, and exfiltration.Another branch of development focuses on the development and operation of Listening Posts (LP) and Command and Control (C2) systems used to communicate with and control CIA implants; special projects are used to target specific hardware from routers to smart TVs.Some example projects are described below, but see  the table of contents for the full list of projects described by WikiLeaks   Year Zero .The CIA s hand crafted hacking techniques pose a problem for the agency. Each technique it has created forms a  fingerprint  that can be used by forensic investigators to attribute multiple different attacks to the same entity.This is analogous to finding the same distinctive knife wound on multiple separate murder victims. The unique wounding style creates suspicion that a single murderer is responsible. As soon one murder in the set is solved then the other murders also find likely attribution.The CIA s Remote Devices Branch s UMBRAGE group collects and maintains a substantial library of attack techniques  stolen  from malware produced in other states including the Russian Federation.With UMBRAGE and related projects the CIA cannot only increase its total number of attack types but also misdirect attribution by leaving behind the  fingerprints  of the groups that the attack techniques were stolen from.UMBRAGE components cover keyloggers, password collection, webcam capture, data destruction, persistence, privilege escalation, stealth, anti-virus (PSP) avoidance and survey techniques.Fine Dining comes with a standardized questionnaire i.e menu that CIA case officers fill out. The questionnaire is used by the agency s OSB (Operational Support Branch) to transform the requests of case officers into technical requirements for hacking attacks (typically  exfiltrating  information from computer systems) for specific operations. The questionnaire allows the OSB to identify how to adapt existing tools for the operation, and communicate this to CIA malware configuration staff. The OSB functions as the interface between CIA operational staff and the relevant technical support staff.Among the list of possible targets of the collection are  Asset ,  Liaison Asset ,  System Administrator ,  Foreign Information Operations ,  Foreign Intelligence Agencies  and  Foreign Government Entities . Notably absent is any reference to extremists or transnational criminals. The  Case Officer  is also asked to specify the environment of the target like the type of computer, operating system used, Internet connectivity and installed anti-virus utilities (PSPs) as well as a list of file types to be exfiltrated like Office documents, audio, video, images or custom file types. The  menu  also asks for information if recurring access to the target is possible and how long unobserved access to the computer can be maintained. This information is used by the CIA s  JQJIMPROVISE  software (see below) to configure a set of CIA malware suited to the specific needs of an operation. Improvise  is a toolset for configuration, post-processing, payload setup and execution vector selection for survey\\u002fexfiltration tools supporting all major operating systems like Windows (Bartender), MacOS (JukeBox) and Linux (DanceFloor). Its configuration utilities like Margarita allows the NOC (Network Operation Center) to customize tools based on requirements from  Fine Dining  questionnaires.HIVE is a multi-platform CIA malware suite and its associated control software. The project provides customizable implants for Windows, Solaris, MikroTik (used in internet routers) and Linux platforms and a Listening Post (LP)\\u002fCommand and Control (C2) infrastructure to communicate with these implants.The implants are configured to communicate via HTTPS with the webserver of a cover domain; each operation utilizing these implants has a separate cover domain and the infrastructure can handle any number of cover domains.Each cover domain resolves to an IP address that is located at a commercial VPS (Virtual Private Server) provider. The public-facing server forwards all incoming traffic via a VPN to a  Blot  server that handles actual connection requests from clients. It is setup for optional SSL client authentication: if a client sends a valid client certificate (only implants can do that), the connection is forwarded to the  Honeycomb  toolserver that communicates with the implant; if a valid certificate is missing (which is the case if someone tries to open the cover domain website by accident), the traffic is forwarded to a cover server that delivers an unsuspicious looking website.The Honeycomb toolserver receives exfiltrated information from the implant; an operator can also task the implant to execute jobs on the target computer, so the toolserver acts as a C2 (command and control) server for the implant.Similar functionality (though limited to Windows) is provided by the RickBobby project.See the classified user and developer guides for HIVE.WikiLeaks published as soon as its verification and analysis were ready.In February the Trump administration has issued an Executive Order calling for a  Cyberwar  review to be prepared within 30 days.While the review increases the timeliness and relevance of the publication it did not play a role in setting the publication date Continue this story at WikileaksREAD MORE WIKILEAKS AT: 21st Century Wire WIKILEAKS FilesSUPPORT OUR WORK BY SUBSCRIBING & BECOMING A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV\"],[\"Donald Trump s appearance at an MSNBC town hall event Wednesday didn t go very well for him when host Mika Brzezinski played a little game with him. It was simple: she would describe a candidate and Trump would guess who she was speaking about. Pretty simple, right?Brzezinski gave the following description of a candidate: The candidate is considered a political outsider by all the pundits. He s tapping into all the anger of the voters, delivers a populist message. He believes everyone in the country should have healthcare. He advocates for hedge fund managers to pay higher taxes. He s drawing thousands of people at his rallies and bringing in a lot of new voters to the political process, and he s not beholden to any super PAC. Who am I describing? Or any special interests or any donors,  he said, adding.  You re describing Donald Trump. Actually, I was describing Bernie Sanders,  Brzezinski said as the audience burst into laughter. That s good,  Trump conceded. The billionaire, who has spent his career ripping people off, says that there is one area in which they agree   that  our country is being ripped off big-league on trade    though he says Sanders   can t do anything about it because he  doesn t understand  the problem.Trump, of course, doesn t understand much of anything past how to creepily talk openly about how much he wants to f*ck his daughter. His rise in popularity has nothing to do with how much he can accomplish, his knowledge, or anything substantive. Trump s ascension is linked to his talk of building walls, of rounding up Muslims into concentration camps, of banning brown people from entering the country. His supporters are largely uneducated bigots who simply like him because he  speaks his mind    the same thing your irritating right-wing uncle does at holiday dinners.Trump s harnessing of the anger of the Stupid Part of America is very real. Make no mistake about it: he will absolutely be bringing voters to the polls in November. It is important that you register to vote. If your state has enacted voter ID legislation in an effort to disenfranchise certain segments of the population, make sure you obtain all the required documentation to vote   and vote BLUE.Watch Trump embarrass himself below:Featured image via screengrab\"],[\"The Ferguson #BlackLivesMatter protesters are spilling the beans on the so-called  grassroots  movement.Earlier this week black protesters staged a protest at at the office of MORE (Missourians Organizing for Reform and Empowerment) on Thursday to press their claim that groups led by whites have collected tens of thousands of dollars in donations off of the Black Lives Matter movement without paying the Black participants their fair share.Much more on that sit-in protest at MORE here.The black protesters threatened to  f*ck up  the white protest organizers.Now this  It s widely known thatFerguson activists were flown to New York City, Wisconsin, and even the West Bank to spread racial hatred.Now we know why they re so committed to the cause.They are being paid   quite a bit   to disrupt and initiate violence across the country.The protesters are talking online about how much they were getting paid to protest against the police and stir up racial hate in Ferguson and other communities since August.** Protesters were making MORE THAN $5,000 a month to disrupt cities and attack police!Listening to @search4swag live now on @JoePrich  they pointing out that @deray is getting paid by Soros  Independent CaT (@RealOrangeCat) May 16, 2015The far left billionaire George Soros pumped at least $33 million into the violent Ferguson protest movement, according The Washington Times.Many of the  grassroots  leaders were paid handsomely.And the protesters are wising up to Deray   who has been out every night tweeting and stirring up the race hate n numerous cities for several months.

As Secretary of State, Clinton was in charge of screening visas for admission, which some foreign nationals could then adjust to receive green cards.Following the Orlando terrorist attack, in which the son of Afghan migrants targeted the LGBT community and slaughtered 49 people in a gay nightclub, Donald Trump called for a common-sense,  mainstream immigration policy that promotes American values.  Indeed, new evidence has shown that the Orlando terrorist s anti-Western values were imported from overseas   and were not  homegrown  or native to the United States absent immigration.Trump explained that the values of radical Islam   which our current immigration policies are importing into America   are  incompatible with Western values and institutions :A radical Islamic terrorist targeted the nightclub not only because he wanted to kill Americans, but in order to execute gay and lesbian citizens because of their sexual orientation. It is a strike at the heart and soul of who we are as a nation  Many of the principles of Radical Islam are incompatible with Western values and institutions. Radical Islam is anti-woman, anti-gay and anti-American. I refuse to allow America to become a place where gay people, Christian people, and Jewish people, are the targets of persecution and intimidation by Radical Islamic preachers of hate and violence.Trump pledged that, as President, he would curb the flow of assimilation-resistant migrants from terror-prone regions that  share these same oppressive views. Following the attack, the Washington Post published a list of mostly Muslim countries where homosexuality may be punished by death. The Washington Post, however, did not deem it necessary to make any mention of how many migrants from these nations that hold anti-Western, anti-LGBT values are being resettled throughout the United States.Between 2001 and 2014, the U.S. permanently resettled 674,920 migrants from nations where gays can be executed, according to data from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).This figure does not include the total number of migrants the U.S. has permanently resettled from Muslim nations during that time, which is nearly 1.7 million.To see the breakdown of how many migrants the U.S. has admitted from countries where homosexuality can be punishable by death, click HERE.Many Washington politicians, however, have pushed to continue   and even expand-   the already record high levels of immigration from nations that hold anti-Western values.Hillary Clinton is joined in her opposition to pausing Muslim migration by House Speaker Paul Ryan, who today said that temporarily pausing Muslim migration is  not reflective of our principles  and is not  in our country s best interest. In stating his opposition to Trump s proposal, Ryan did not explain how American communities have been made better by such historic flows of Sharia-sympathetic migrants or   as Donald Trump put it    why we should admit anyone into our country who supports violence of any kind against gay and lesbian Americans.

Instead, they doubled down on anti-Latino sentiment. Then they tripled down. Then they played their Trump card and that was the end of the GOP s Latino outreach. Now, Pew Research Center has released a study that confirms the Republican Party is doomed. Not only is the fastest growing group of voters Latino, Millennials (who already dislike the GOP intensely) make up the fastest growing segment within that already critical demographic.In other words, the people the least likely to vote for Republicans are going to be one of the most powerful voting blocks in just a few years. Just to make it a little more clear, here s what the growth of Latino voters looks like by the millions:And almost half of them are Millennials. If I were a Republican, this graph would make me wake up screaming every night. It s like the Grim Reaper showed up on my doorstep and said,  Hola, Gringo! I d feel bad for the GOP but they really did bring it on themselves. A few years ago, they MIGHT have been able to appeal to Latino voters. But the last two years have seen a repeat of the exact same short-sighted stupidity that drove the black community away from voting Republican for the last 50 years. Trump sped up the process considerably but it was already happening. You cannot tell an entire group of people that you hate their very existence and then be surprised when they vote against you.Republicans have painted themselves into a corner with no chance of escape. In order to rally their aging base, they demonized Latinos by pretending immigration was an existential threat of America. They were so successful in this that they cannot, in any way, appeal to Latinos without immediately alienating the old angry white people that keep them in office. But without the Latino vote, Republicans cannot possibly continue to compete at the national level for much longer.It s the most delicious Burrito of Electoral Doom imaginable and I can t wait to dig in!Feature image via Pew Research\"],[\"This week, a racially-motivated massacre took place at an apartment complex in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The triple homicide shows where the politics of hate will lead America.Three people were slaughtered in horrifying circumstances this week, because their white neighbor was enraged by their ethnic origin and grasp of the English language. The terrifying scenes unfolded at a four unit apartment complex. One unit was occupied by Dan J Popp, one by the Manso-Perez family, and one by Phia Vue, his wife Mai, and their four children.The Journel-Sentinel reports that 40-year-old Jesus R. Manso-Perez and his son passed the apartment of their 39-year-old neighbor Dan J. Popp on their way to the basement laundry room. Popp invited them into his home with the offer of a neigborly beer, which they declined. Popp then cut short the niceties and got straight to his point, asking the pair where they were from. At their response, he reportedly said: Oh, that s why you don t speak English. You re Puerto Rican. The father and son bid their goodbyes and went on to do their laundry. However, when they made their way back up to their apartment, Popp was waiting for them on the stairs, rifle in hand. You guys got to go,  Popp said, according to police, before shooting Jesus in the head, killing him. He then fired at his son, but missed.Hearing the gunshots, Phia and Mai K. Vue hid in the bedroom with their four children and a 25-year-old relative who had been watching the children that day. The couple had just returned home from a day trip. When Popp began hammering at their door, they called the police and stayed in their hiding places. But Popp kicked down their door and searched the home until he found them. He demanded 36-year-old Phia leave the room, took him into the bathroom and shot him dead. Then he returned for Mai, dragging her and two young daughters out of the apartment while the rest of the family ran out in front and around them.The couple s young son was first to reach the police and told them: He shot my father; he s in the bathroom. A further shot then rang out from the apartment complex as Popp shot and killed 32-year-old Mai.Popp then surrendered himself to police. He has no previous criminal record, and is detained on bail of $150,000, while mental health assessments are completed.The explosion of violence is however, the terrifying end game of the ever escalating racist rhetoric and violence we are seeing in the current political climate. The very worst elements of white America are being unleashed. The bitter hatred of difference, the idea that non-European immigrants to the United States are the root of all evil and that everything wrong with the nation can be traced back to those groups.There is very good reason why, at home and abroad, the rise of the racist right in modern America is being compared to the rise of Adolf Hitler in 1930 s Germany. That reason is simple: the comparison is accurate.Depressed wages, a perceived crisis of masculinity, the demand for a  tough  leader who would drive through his agenda as an authoritarian, an obsession with a perceived dent to national pride which must be remedied with a show of economic and military force at home and abroad   and pure, unadulterated racism.When you unleash this level of anger at a scapegoat, people set out to hurt and kill that scapegoat.This is the vision of America that the racist right represents. And it is a vision of hell.The victory of such forces would be a disaster for America as a nation, but also for the international community in which she sits. This is not some television show where we sit back and watch the fall-out from the safety of our couch. This is real life. The racist right is a real and present danger, and it must be confronted with relentless and unwavering opposition by everyone who has a stake in a progressive, free, and hopeful America.Featured image via Gawker\"],[\"The double standard in our judicial system today, as it relates to the protection of religious rights for Christians in America is stunning. Activist judges have been legislating from the bench for far too long when it comes to the protection of religious rights. Will President Trump s DOJ put an end to the persecution of Christians with this very important upcoming case?  In a major upcoming Supreme Court case that weighs equal rights with religious liberty, the Trump administration on Thursday sided with a Colorado baker who refused to bake a wedding cake for a same-sex couple.The Department of Justice on Thursday filed a brief on behalf of baker Jack Phillips, who was found to have violated the Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act by refusing to created a cake to celebrate the marriage of Charlie Craig and David Mullins in 2012. Phillips said he doesn t create wedding cakes for same-sex couples because it would violate his religious beliefs.The government agreed with Phillips that his cakes are a form of expression, and he cannot be compelled to use his talents for something in which he does not believe. Forcing Phillips to create expression for and participate in a ceremony that violates his sincerely held religious beliefs invades his First Amendment rights,  Acting Solicitor General Jeffrey B. Wall wrote in the brief.  WaPoComedian Steven Crowder made a powerful (and hilarious) video that was seen by over 5 MILLION viewers, exposing how the left twists the narrative to promote their radical ideology. Crowder went undercover to several Muslim bakeries in Dearborn, Michigan to see how many of them would be willing to bake a cake for a gay couple.

Speaking to Channel 4 news, Khan felt Trump s out-of-context criticisms and continued attacks on Twitter meant that the U.K. should not  roll out the red carpet  for the president as  his policies go against everything we stand for.

Gabriel, the president and founder of ACT for America, travels around the nation delivering a message to everyday Americans about the radical infiltration of Muslim extremists in America. She explains in easy to understand terms how the Muslim Brotherhood has one goal: to sabotage America from within, and to make Islam the dominant religion of the country.Watch Brigitte Gabriel explain the Muslim Brotherhood s plan for the destruction of the United States: The most important page of this document is the last page. Because in the last past, they list 29 Islamic organizations set up  in the United States with the specific goal of sabotaging America from within, and destroying America by our own hands. The MSA is listed as one of the Islam organizations whose goal it is to destroy America. The MSA, or Muslim Student Association has more chapters on American  college campuses than the Republican and Democrat Party combined. Watch here:The tolerance for the funding of terror groups by Americans is about to come to end under President Donald J. Trump. One of the first actions he may take is to designate what many experts have been calling a terror group for years. The Trump administration could soon declare the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization, a move that would greatly restrict the controversial group s global reach and would come despite its insistence that it has peaceful intentions.Trump himself was often critical of President Obama s outreach to the Muslim Brotherhood, and Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, has proposed a bill to call for declaring the Brotherhood a terror organization. In the past, it has been accused of supporting terrorist groups around the world, and several countries, including Muslim nations, have banned them.If the U.S. declares the Brotherhood a terrorist organization, it would make it a criminal act for Americans to fund the group, ban banks from processing money for it, bar people with ties to the group from coming to the United States and make it easier to deport immigrants who have worked with the organization. It is time to call this enemy by its name and speak with clarity and moral authority,  Cruz said in a statement introducing the bill. Watch Brigitte Gabriel destroy this Imam on Judge Jeanine s FOX News show: FOX NewsThe Left doesn t think Trump should designate the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization and here s why:The New York Times editorial board thinks President Trump shouldn t designate the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization because it could make Trump the enemy of all Muslims.The liberal paper published Thursday an editorial Thursday titled  All of Islam Isn t the Enemy  arguing against the move, which the Trump administration is reportedly considering as a possible option. CIA Director Mike Pompeo has said he supports designating the group, which is open about its goal of creating a state ruled by Islamic law, as a terrorist organization. Is President Trump trying to make enemies of the entire Muslim world? That could well happen if he follows up his primitive ban on refugees and visa holders from seven Muslim nations with an order designating the Muslim Brotherhood   perhaps the most influential Islamist group in the Middle East   as a terrorist organization,  the editors charged.

Nearly everything that s been coming out of his mouth lately regarding Hillary Clinton is exactly what has been said about him. It s as if he doesn t think anyone will notice, and likely his imbecilic supporters won t.Now, in a move that is bizarre to most sane-minded individuals, Trump is trying to paint Hillary Clinton as a racist. You know, the woman with 90+% of the African-American vote locked up.Why does Hillary have such widespread support from the black community? Because she s worked her whole career to make life better for them. It s not rocket science.Well, it s that and the fact that Donald Trump, quite literally, is racist and is supported by white nationalists everywhere.Trump has been pandering to the black and Latino vote at almost every recent rally. It s obvious, pathetic, and kind of insulting to people s intelligence. Something he doesn t have to worry about among his pack of lemmings.So, when Hillary delivered a speech in Reno, Nevada highlighting how very racist Trump is with his incendiary remarks, and there s evidence to back it up with how he s treated the Latino community, and how he refused to rent property to African-Americans back in the 70s, his quick reaction was to say Hillary is actually the racist one.How did he deliver this reaction?

Water World, in Stoke-on-Trent, in Britain s West Midlands region, is hosting  sisters only  and  brothers only  events, demanding visitors wear  Islamically appropriate  attire.The water-park   which claims to attract nearly half a million visitors a year   is believed to have hosted dozens of events over the past few years, with  Islamic Fundays  as well as fundraising events for Gaza charities dating back as far as 2009. The park even goes so far as to claim that female  guards  will keep men out of the venue for the day.Water World s website reads:  Our sisters only event is an event restricted to female gender only and boys up to the age of 4 years old. All rides and attractions are open as normal. Clothing during this event must be both culturally and islamically appropriate for the event. There is a designated prayer area located in the reception area. All windows are blacked out with only female staff\\u002flifeguards on duty throughout the night, Female staff will guard the front entrance to make sure that no males enter the facility. Breitbart London has seen other invitations to the water park, on behalf of Islamic charity Interpal, which has hosted fundraising events for Gaza. Interpal has been accused of fundraising for the Hamas terrorist organisation on three separate occasions, and while it has been cleared by Britain s Charity Commission, one of their recent findings also claimed that Interpal  had not put in place adequate due diligence and monitoring procedures to be satisfied that these organisations were not promoting terrorist ideologies or activities. Where procedures were in place, they were not sufficient nor fully implemented .The group was also forced to sever any links to the  Union of Good  group, which, according to the U.S. government, was  an organization created by Hamas leadership to transfer funds to the terrorist organization. One invitation to a  Sisters Only Funday  even went so far as to promote certain types of clothing. It reads:Dress Code Please ensure that your Awrah [nakedness] is covered at all times. Below are a few suggestions on what you can wear: Top Long Loose T-Shirt\\u002fTop. Bottoms Leggings 3 Quarter\\u002fFull Length Jogging Bottoms. We would also suggest wearing a leotard under the T-shirt or belt over it as it is likely to float up when you enter the water. A dark coloured T-shirt is recommended as white can become transparent when wet.The most recent  Sisters Only  day was held on May 17th 2015. The  cause , it stated, was  Rebuilding Lives in Gaza   Providing Clean Water , this time hosted by the  Human Appeal  international charity, which is listed on an unverified CIA report from 1996 into  NGOs (non governmental organisations) with Terror Links . Human Appeal reject the validity of the document, despite it being cited by the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in the 2007 book,  Understanding Islamic Charities .The organisation, listed as Human Appeal International on the Companies House register, is similarly named to a UAE-based organisation called Human Appeal International, though the Israeli government has linked both groups, as well as an Australian office. The organisation has not made the claim of mistaken identity, and indeed has  liked  the Human Appeal International (UAE) page on Facebook, via the UK organisation. Human Appeal UK told Breitbart London that the CIA document is  a fake    and that they have previously claimed damages from the Jewish Chronicle newspaper for alleging that the group is a terrorist organisation, which it is not, with further reference to alleged links to Hamas.The Australian Broadcasting Corporation website still carries a report from 2003 that states:  The document, obtained by Lateline, outlines a close relationship between Human Appeal International and Hamas, as well as the US-based Palestinian charity the Holy Land Foundation For Relief and Development, which was raided and shut down three months after the September 11 attacks,  and Wikileaks reveals that a State Department cable from 2005 stated,  In 2003, there were indications that HAI was sending financial support to organizations associated with Hamas and that members of its field offices in Bosnia, Kosovo, and Chechnya had connections to al-Qa ida associates . It is not clear which Human Appeal organisation these reports refer to.The GulfNews website however goes further, and continues to host a diagram linking Human Appeal (UK) to the UAE organisation, and ultimately, Hamas. Human Appeal was banned in 2012 from hosting an event at Manchester Parrs Wood High School. Britain s Department of Education stated:  Since the concerns about HAI have come to light, Parrs Wood has performed further research including consulting local Jewish community representatives. As a result they have decided not to allow HAI or other charities which appear to have links to political organizations to use the school in future.

He s accused their people of being rapists and killers, said that the country is deliberately sending their trash up to us to deal with, and we all know about the wall he wants to force Mexico to pay for.

Mexico is a foreign country. Their people are foreigners, and Trump likes to claim they re stealing our jobs, both inside and outside our borders. He hates them and he wants us to hate them.His ability to convince his loyal subjects that the country is in serious decline, when it isn t, is likewise textbook fascism. He s got the entire world worried, confused as to how he could even have gotten this far in a U.S. election cycle, and just generally pissed the hell off.One thing he did recently was complain that Mexico forces us to pay a tax to sell products there, but they can sell their products here without paying the same tax. Mexico has a value-added tax that American companies must pay when they sell products there, but Mexican companies have to pay that same tax to sell in their own country, even though they don t have to pay it here. Our companies don t pay it here either.Trump listed that as one of his millions of reasons that NAFTA is needs to be torn up. Trump doesn t know what he s talking about. But that is, in fact, just another claim that Mexico is stealing from us, and must be stopped.In other words, Letras Libres sees Trump for what he is.

But the madness didn t stop there.According to reports, White House aides told Republican Senator Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, host state of this year s quadrennial Boy Scouts of America National Jamboree, that she could fly with him on Air Force One when he addressed the boy scouts, but only on one condition; that she vote in favor of Senate Republicans  healthcare bill. At the time the offer was made to Capito, Republicans were clutching at straws and doing anything possible to salvage their overhaul in the Senate in an effort to actually try and come through on one of the main promises Donald Trump made the entire time he was on the campaign trail, to repeal and replace  the disaster that is Obamacare. Naturally, Capito took the high road and turned down the offer, mainly due to the fact that she hadn t even read the actual text of the bill at the time, however, Capito was also one of several Republicans senators who had made their doubts clear about it in the first place.There were several versions of the plan that failed so the Republicans ultimately threw together a  skinny repeal,  but that also failed when 49 voted for it while 51 voted against, with Arizona Senator John McCain casting the deciding negative vote. Capito also voted against the Republican s skinny repeal, sending them back to the drawing board.President Trump still vows to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act and is adamant that he will get his bill passed, however, it may take a little more than a ride on Air Force One to get the votes.Featured image via Joe Raedle\\u002fGetty Images\"],[\"Sacrifice is for the peasants When Hollywood actor Leonardo DiCaprio hosts a reception for a string of A-list stars, supermodels and wealthy philanthropists later this month, he will make an impassioned plea for more action to be taken on global warming.But instead of holding the event in Los Angeles, where most of his guests are based, they will fly halfway around the world to the glitzy French resort of St Tropez   at enormous cost to the environment.Last night, green campaigners were quick to criticise 41-year-old DiCaprio, who in February used his Best Actor acceptance speech at the Oscars to warn about the dangers posed by climate change.The reception   the grand-sounding Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation Annual Gala To Fund Climate and Biodiversity Projects   will be held on July 20 at the Bertaud Belieu Vineyards on the French Riviera.Celebrities including Kate Hudson, Charlize Theron, Cate Blanchett, Marion Cotillard, Penelope Cruz, Robert De Niro, Scarlett Johansson, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Kevin Spacey are all expected to attend, along with a host of international rock and pop stars, supermodels and tycoons.And while a table seating 12 people at the gala costs up to  125,000, the real price will be paid by the environment.If just one guest among the 500 invitees chooses to fly the 12,000-mile round trip from LA to St Tropez by private jet   a notoriously environmentally unfriendly way to travel   they will produce 86 tons of carbon dioxide greenhouse gas.Even those who use a scheduled flight will be responsible for releasing seven tons of CO2   leading green campaigners to ask why the event could not have been held in Hollywood or in St Tropez during May s Cannes Film Festival, when many of the guests would have been there anyway.Robert Rapier, an environmental analyst, said:  DiCaprio demonstrates why our consumption of fossil fuels continues to grow. It s because everyone loves the combination of cost and convenience they offer. He believes that no sacrifice is necessary; just Government policies that can provide him with a solar-powered yacht or jet, or that give individuals low-cost renewable energy on a broad scale. One guest who attended last year s gala said:  It s basically a big party for Leo and his showbusiness friends and models. The models, of course, do not pay for tickets, and neither do the VIP guests   they get to have a nice big free party.

Ryan made the request after Clinton was severely criticized by the FBI for her email use, but not punished. Nominees for president and vice president receive these briefings by virtue of their status as candidates, and do not require separate security clearances before the briefings,  Clapper wrote to Ryan.  Briefings for the candidates will be provided on an even-handed non-partisan basis. Ryan s request is even more ridiculous when his own party s nominee is Donald Trump. Earlier in the year, intelligence experts expressed concerns that Trump would be given these briefings, as he has shown time and time again a complete disregard for how things are to be handled with sensitivity at the presidential level.The Speaker himself has expressed concerns on multiple occasions about Trump s temperament, admitting that his campaign sent an anti-Semitic tweet and that Trump s remarks about a Latino judge were racist. Yet Ryan has not raised any objections about Trump receiving intelligence briefings.Conservatives have repeatedly whipped themselves up into a frenzy, believing that investigations into the Benghazi attack would take down President Obama, and now Secretary Clinton. The probe into the email was an outgrowth of that frustration, and has now turned into a big zero.

The float is plastered with a Trump\\u002fPence sign, a Make America Great Again sign and of course, something with Benghazi written on it and it also mentions Clinton s health.An Aurora mother posted a photo on Facebook of the offensive float. Who thinks this is appropriate for a fair parade where children, some of them minorities and girls, are marching and playing instruments and watching? Who thinks this is something to laugh at or be proud of?  Penny Britton wrote on her Facebook page.  This is disgusting. This makes me embarrassed to say I live here. This is Aurora, Indiana. Congratulations. That prompted different comments ranging from calling it  disgusting  and  racist,  to another saying  Who cares! On Saturday morning, the float was featured as part of the Aurora Farmers Fair Parade.WCPO reports:It s sponsored by the Aurora Lions Club, according to its website, and touted as Indiana s oldest street festival. The theme of the parade was  Celebrating the Past, Embracing the Future. A Lions Club board member spoke with WCPO and said the organization was not prepared to make a statement.The parade manager did not return a call by a WCPO reporter.Meanwhile, Frank Linkmeyer, whose trailer which held the float is now in his driveway, says he didn t mean to offend anyone and he s sorry. He did a really bad job of trying to not be offensive. We re pretty sure Trump supporters will say it s being politically correct to object because children have to witness a display of racism. One man said,  If anyone is offended by it, well don t look at it.  It s pretty hard to change the channel on a parade you re attending.

Currently, FOIA requests are handled by each separate agency, each with its own rules about how to submit a request. Today s vote sends a clear message that the American people have a fundamental right to know what their government is doing,  Cornyn said.( ) We cannot leave it to the next president to decide how open the government should be,  Leahy said.  We have to hold all presidents and their administrations accountable to the highest standard. Republicans in Congress have complained that the Obama administration hasn t been fully transparent in sharing records with lawmakers and the public, while the White House has criticized Congress for exempting itself from the requirements. FOIA does not apply to Congress.The House passed a similar bill in January.

For those who are deeply invested in this now official conspiracy theory, however, this might be a hard pill to swallow. The White House and the Hillary Clinton campaign are now married to the idea that  Putin is hacking the US elections.  In response, the President is weighing his options   tougher economic sanctions, revoking diplomatic status to Russian envoys in the US, or even deploying his newly developed malicious cyber-activity  tools.Even VP Joe Biden wants in on the action, threatening Moscow by saying, We re sending a message. We have the capacity to do it.   Presumably, he s referring to a cyber  counter attack  by Washington.It seems that where ever you turn nowadays, someone in Washington is issuing a threat against Russia. Are US-Russian relations really that bad, or does this trend have more to do with the defense industry and power struggles within the US?What was previously a stance reserved for right-wing neoconservative hawks and Cold War hold-outs has now infected America s left-wing, and is a firm plank in the Democratic Party platform, as evidenced by Hillary Clinton s constant anti-Russian rhetoric throughout this 2016 election cycle. Along with the White House, Clinton has now transformed the Democrats into the vanguard of Washington s new anti-Russia movement.On July 27th, Josh Rogin from the Washington Post wrote,  The Clinton campaign has decided to escalate its rhetoric on Russia. After Trump suggested Wednesday that if Russia had indeed hacked Clinton s private email server it should release the emails, the Clinton campaign sent out its Democratic surrogates to bash Russia and Trump in a manner traditionally reserved for Republicans. Anyone who was paying attention back then knew this  Russian hack  talking point was purely political, but then again, who s really paying attention these days? Certainly not the US media.You can trace the genesis of the Democratic Party s hardcore anti-Russian strategy back to when President Vladimir Putin made a mild passing remark about Donald Trump s GOP primary success. From that point on, Trump s political opponents saw this as an open target. In their words,  comparing one dictator to another. Never one to pass up an opportunity to score cheap political points, President Obama got in on the act, intensifying the Trump-Putin narrative to the level of bromance.  If you ve made a career out of idealizing Ronald Reagan, then where were you when your own party s nominee for president was kissing up to Vladimir Putin?  said Obama on Oct 20th at a Clinton rally in Miami.Backed by the Obama White House, Clinton and the media felt they had a green light to keep pressing ahead with blaming Russia   not only for the controversial DNC leaks, but also for hacking into US election systems in Arizona   a charge devoid of any evidence other than innuendo and speculation. The media s coverage on this issue was deceptive from the onset. In a leading news release, entitled,  Russian hackers targeted Arizona election system,  we can see how after the cock-sure headline, the first paragraph would always sound definitive: Hackers targeted voter registration systems in Illinois and Arizona, and the FBI alerted Arizona officials in June that Russians were behind the assault on the election system in that state. But then by the time you advanced down the story, the report would quickly retreat into a zone of uncertainty: The bureau described the threat as  credible  and significant,  an eight on a scale of one to 10,  Matt Roberts, a spokesman for Arizona Secretary of State Michele Reagan (R), said Monday. As a result, Reagan shut down the state s voter registration system for nearly a week. And then, down to almost nothing It turned out that the hackers had not compromised the state system or even any county system. They had, however, stolen the username and password of a single election official in Gila County. At no point was any evidence ever given. Only ambiguous statements like,  Cyber security officials agree that this looks very much like a Russian government-directed hack. Are American politicians so callous as to tempt geopolitical conflict in order to further their short-term political ambitions? Better yet, has American political life really arrived in such a dark cul de sac (translated in French:  bottom of the bag ) where politicians in power are so insecure as to make-up and propagate wild international conspiracy theories   in the middle a national election cycle? It s a very depressing prospect, and yet, this is exactly what we are seeing in this 2016 Presidential Election.Behind Clinton s wild hyperbolic rants about the Kremlin and Wikileaks, you will find the White House On October 7th, the Obama Administration formally accused the Russian government of stealing emails from the Democratic National Committee and other high-profile individuals including Hillary Clinton s campaign manager John Podesta   giving them to Wikileaks. Soon, there was a queue of  national security  politicians eager to hitch a ride on this bandwagon. Senator Ben Sasse (NE-R), a member of the Homeland Security Committee spouted out,  Russia must face serious consequences. Moscow orchestrated these hacks because [Russian President Vladimir] Putin believes Soviet-style aggression is worth it. The United States must upend Putin s calculus with a strong diplomatic, political,  cyber and economic response. According to a Washington Post report by technology editor, Ellen Nakashima, the only  evidence  that seems to be available on this story is a corporate analysis of the alleged  Russian government hacks    provided by a US cyber security company called Crowdstrike. No actual specifics are given, so we are meant to take private firm Crowdstrike s word for it.IMAGE: Crowdstrike cyber security.The Post s Nakashima then added: The administration also blamed Moscow for the hack of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the subsequent leak of private email addresses and cellphone numbers of Democratic lawmakers. An online persona calling himself Guccifer 2.0 has claimed responsibility for posting the material. Those sites and that persona are  consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts,  the joint statement said.   We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia s senior-most officials could have authorized these activities. Moscow s press secretary s reply:  This is some sort of nonsense,  said Dmitry Peskov.Despite the constant repetition by Democrat media surrogates, and as CNN s Maria Cardona said last night, no US national intelligence agency has really  confirmed  that Russia was behind the email hacks   and still no evidence, other than speculative guesswork, has been presented.Likewise, US intelligence agencies have never actually said definitively on record that  Russia did it,  thus, leaving the door open to walk-back the accusation at a later date. Standard Washington procedure of ambiguity. This little detail doesn t seem to matter in this hyperbolic political climate though. It seems that the White House, Hillary Clinton and media operatives like Cardona   are quite happy living in what John Kerry recent dubbed as a parallel universe. The announcement, albeit vague, actually originated from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.Still, during the final Presidential debate, Hillary Clinton proudly crowed how  17 US intelligence agencies  aka the  Intelligence Community    all agreed that Russia did it. We have 17 intelligence agencies, civilian and military, who have all concluded that these espionage attacks, these cyberattacks, come from the highest levels of the Kremlin, and they are designed to influence our election,  said Clinton.  I find that deeply disturbing. What s even more disturbing is the fact that Clinton is lying in front of a national audience. The highest levels of the Kremlin? Here are Clinton s 17 agencies :Air Force Intelligence, Army Intelligence, Central Intelligence Agency, Coast Guard Intelligence, Defense Intelligence Agency, Energy Department, Homeland Security Department, State Department, Treasury Department, Drug Enforcement Administration, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Marine Corps Intelligence, National Geospatial Intelligence Agency, National Reconnaissance Office, National Security Agency, Navy Intelligence and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.What does the Coast Guard Intelligence, National Geospatial Intelligence Agency or the Drug Enforcement Administration know about John Podesta s emails? Answer: nothing.The exact same thing happened following Wikileaks first trove of DNC emails back in July 2016. The US government issued a vague accusatory statement, but would not actually name the culprit. Some might call that propaganda.In both instances, the Obama Administration refused to present any evidence. Translated: there was no evidence. If there had been, the White House would have been shouting from the rooftops and using it as leverage to apply muscle in the UN over Washington s  flagging efforts in Syria. Both Obama Administration announcements were nothing more than dog whistles for Democrats and  journalists  working for hopelessly partisan outlets like New York Times and CNN  none of whom have bothered to press the White House for one ounce of evidence pertaining to the Party s decree that Russia is hacking the US election process. If you actually look at the joint DNI-DHS statement issued on the matter, it contains no definitive statement:  [the hacks] are consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts. These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the US election process. Such activity is not new to Moscow   the Russians have used similar tactics and techniques across Europe and Eurasia, for example, to influence public opinion there. We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia s senior-most officials could have authorized these activities. According to NSA intelligence worker-turned whistleblower William Binney, when asked about WikiLeaks and whether the Russians are  hacking US elections, he concluded that the cyber efforts against the DNC were more likely to be the work of a disgruntled U.S. intelligence worker. Under partisan pressure from senior Democrat Senator Harry Reid, the FBI also initiated another investigation into  people linked to the Trump team with Russia.  Reid was unset about the DNC hacks and the Podesta emails and demanded the FBI do something about the Trump campaign. To date, the FBI haven t come up with anything.To be fair, Hillary would have every reason to believe that the Kremlin is behind the hack   because her staff read it to her from the campaign s daily intelligence briefings, presumably, supplied from the US government s much vaunted Intelligence Community. Of course, that s the same Intelligence Community that briefed George W Bush about Saddam s nonexistent nuclear weapons program, and who also briefed Colin Powell about Iraq s imaginary  Winnebagos of Death  aka mobile anthrax labs disguised as senior double-wide camper vans. So, of course, they would know if Putin directed the DNC leaks and Podesta email hacks.For those us who are skeptical of the great oxymoron known as  Washington Intelligence,  I can almost hear the mainstream rebuttal now,  No, that was Iraq, that was Bush. We re not like that. No, this time it s different. This time we are sure the Russians did it!  In 2014, Obama claimed that Kim s notorious  Bureau 121  hacked into Sony Pictures. This isn t the first time that President Obama has cried wolf on a foreign  hack  and then tried to sell it for political purposes. Back in December 2014, Obama claimed that North Korea had hacked Sony Pictures in Hollywood. Pentagon-CIA media proxy CNN quickly chimed in to support Washington s conspiracy theory, floating a colorful story that Kim Jing-Un had deployed a secret underground hacking unit called  Bureau 121.  Just like with today s  Russian Hack  theory, no member of the mainstream press dared to question the White House s ridiculous North Korean claim, and like the  Russian Hack  claims, the only source cited for Sony hack was analysis provided by US firm Crowdstrike.Jumping the SharkAfter their Democratic Party Convention on July 27th, the Clinton campaign machine put all of its chips on their Putin narrative.Soon after, a cadre of top Clinton national security surrogates then accused Trump of emboldening Russia in their evil plot to  destabilize and dominate the West.   Tom Donilon, a former national security adviser then accused Russia of interfering  with elections all over Europe and then accused Trump is helping Russia directly. At that point, they were in too deep to turn back.The biggest impact of @wikileaks? Shining a spotlight on Russia s attempt to undermine American democracy and Trump s refusal to condemn it https:\\u002f\\u002ft.co\\u002fALzpYm1Bb5  Josh Schwerin (@JoshSchwerin) October 21, 2016Clinton spin doctors Josh Schwerin and Michael Fallon would stoop even lower by accusing RT of having possession of the Podesta emails even before Wikileaks did. Their only evidence  seemed to be Twitter posts by RT News which Clinton held up as  proof  that the Kremlin was front-running Wikileaks email dumps. The Clinton braintrust failed to note that the Podesta emails were posted on Wikileaks own website well before RT News had tweeted about them. At that point it became obvious that the Clinton campaign was panicking and hysterically grabbing for any excuse they could get their hands on. We then watched, as one RT reporter after another dismantled the Clinton campaign s desperate claims. It was embarrassing.They could not face the uncomfortable fact that it was WikiLeaks head Julian Assange who chose the timing of the release of the DNC and Podesta emails. Rather than attack Assange himself, who happens to be popular with millennials (the very group Clinton struggles to connect with), her operatives opted to target Russia and Trump instead.Either way, the political strategy here is clear  to shoot the messenger. The Clinton campaign is stuck in permanent rear-guard mode, because based on the content of both the DNC Leaks, Wikileaks files, and Project Veritas video   their own Democratic Party has been discredited and exposed as a corrupt political organization.Their other big problem is that despite all the outrage from Democrats and their mainstream media surrogates, none of the leaked content has been challenged on the basis of its authenticity. The results speak for themselves. The initial DNC leak of 20,000 emails resulted in the resignation of DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz. They revealed the unthinkable: the Democratic National Committee actively worked to undermine the Presidential campaign of Bernie Sanders in favor of the establishment choice in Hillary Clinton. Sanders never had a chance. Honest commentators called this an affront to the democratic process, while party insiders and Clinton supporters pretended to be aloof as if it never happened.To prove this point, both President Obama and Hillary Clinton then gave Wasserman-Schultz a glowing endorsement on the way out. For the last eight years, Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz has had my back. This afternoon, I called her to let her know that I am grateful,  said Obama. Not surprisingly, Clinton thanked Wasserman Schultz, presumably for helping to knock her only competitor Sanders out of the Democrat primary race.  I am grateful to Debbie for getting the Democratic Party to this year s historic convention in Philadelphia, and I know that this week s events will be a success thanks to her hard work and leadership,  said Clinton.The party had sold its soul to devil and no one seemed to care too much about it.Party MeltdownWasserman Schultz s replacement didn t fair much better. DNC Vice Chairwoman Donna Brazile was installed to serve as interim chair through the remainder election, but Brazile was soon skewered by subsequent Wikileaks batches   showing how, on more than one occasion, she fed debate questions obtained from corrupt mainstream media operatives   straight to Hillary Clinton. A March 12 email exchange shows Brazile stating that she received a town hall question from Roland Martin, a TV One host who co-moderated a March 13 town hall with CNN s Jake Tapper. A March 5 email shows that she shared a question with Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta and communications director Jennifer Palmieri that was to be asked in a March 6 debate hosted by CNN in Flint, Mich.  (Source: Daily Caller)Brazile s audacious fraud also helped contribute to her party s planned sabotage of Democrat challenger Bernie Sanders. Watch Brazile go into full meltdown when confronted here: In addition, it was also revealed how CNN s head political commentator, Gloria Borger, was named by Podesta as one of a shortlist of  journalists  the Clinton campaign would  work with  to gain favorable coverage. You d think that CNN would have dropped Borger after this was revealed, but no. Amazingly, Borger is still leading CNN s election coverage.Clearly, CNN cannot be trusted to police itself when it comes to matters of outright collusion with Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party.Ever-unbiased CNN's Gloria Borger refers to being in \\\"\\\"GOP hell\\\"\\\" and says she'll \\\"\\\"reach out soon\\\"\\\" to Podesta.

According to police, the shooting occurred shortly after 2 a.m on New Year s Day. Police arrived at what they assumed was a run-of-the-mill New Year s drunk driving incident, but quickly learned that the driver of a car that slammed into an electrical pole near Texas Woman s University had been shot in the head.According to witnesses, the driver   a 20-year-old woman who remains unidentified   and her three passengers met with a bit of New Year s terror when an SUV carrying five or six men pulled up alongside them. The occupants of the vehicles apparently argued, leading the men to do what gun-toting road ragers do best  one of them pulled out a gun and opened fire on the woman s sedan.After taking a bullet to the head, the driver lost control and crashed into another vehicle before slamming into the pole. Her passengers suffered minor injuries. One of them   another female   was treated at the hospital and released. The driver remains in critical condition. The shooter, of course, fled the scene along with his friends.According to witnesses, at least two of them men were seen at a New Year s Eve party earlier that night, though there are no other leads that would help locate them.Unfortunately, people who need to validate their manhood by toting guns around are more likely to engage in road rage-y behaviors when they have the option of filling the object of their anger with holes, according to a Harvard School of Public Health study. In addition, a University of Wisconsin study confirms that the presence of guns stimulates violent thoughts and actions in everyone around the weapons  they don t even have to be holding the Second Amendment Stick.Hopefully, the shooter is brought to justice   whomever he is.

Everyone who carries a weapon is a  good guy with a gun    until they aren t.Since the open carry of handguns just became legal in Texas with the start of the New Year, we can surely expect to see more of this from the Lone Star State.The victim,  Sara Mutschlechner was taken off life support and passed away shortly before 7 p.m. She had been serving as the designated driver for a group of friends that night.Featured image via Odisha Sun Times\"],[\"FBI files reveal missing email  boxes  in Clinton case, allegations of evidence tamperingBuried in the 189 pages of heavily redacted FBI witness interviews from the Hillary Clinton email investigation are details of yet another mystery   about two missing  bankers boxes  filled with the former secretary of state s emails.The interviews released earlier this month, known as 302s, also reveal the serious allegation that senior State Department official Patrick Kennedy applied pressure to subordinates to change the classified email codes so they would be shielded from Congress and the public.The details about the boxes are contained in five pages of the FBI file   with a staggering 111 redactions   that summarize the statements of a State Department witness who worked in the  Office of Information Programs and Services (IPS).

When RNC speakers weren t busy spreading malicious lies for the purpose of driving fear, they were busy attacking her (and sometimes President Obama). Overall, very little was said about what they will do, and it made Hillary kind of sad.Speaking on 60 Minutes, she flat-out said [emphasis mine]: I don t know what their convention was about, other than criticizing me. I seem to be the only unifying theme that they had. There was no positive agenda. It was a very dark, divisive campaign. And the people who were speaking were painting a picture of our country that I did not recognize   you know, negative, scapegoating, fear, bigotry, smears. I just was so, I was saddened by it. I seem to be the only unifying theme they had.  That s a sad testament to how far the GOP has fallen if there ever was one. Republicans still can t decide how to unify behind someone as vile as Trump, and the RNC wasn t well-attended in part because of that. The fact that they can only unify in their hatred of Hillary is, indeed, sad.The only other unifying theme they have is the impending collapse of the U.S., which is something of which the GOP has been trying to convince us since Nixon ran for president. That s not really new and can t be seen as true unity. It s dogma.Then there are prominent Republicans like Ted Cruz, who openly refused to endorse Trump even in front of an audience made up entirely of Republicans. Trump s presence at the top of the party threw a huge monkey wrench into the GOP s plans to take over the country, and now they don t know what to do with him.It d be hilarious if it wasn t so sad. It d be ridiculously depressing if it wasn t so hilarious. That s the massive contradiction of the Republican Party   they can only agree on how they feel about Hillary. Everything else? The GOP civil war escalates.Hillary may well want a real race with a real opponent, and instead she got the three-ring political circus that is Donald Trump and Mike Pence, and the nickname  Crooked Hillary.

I came back, I applied for the green card, I applied for the citizenship later on after many years of green card. So I went by system, I went by the law. And you should do that, you should not just say let me stay here and whatever happens, happens. Trump, who immigrated to the United States from Slovenia in 1996, said that she and her husband are  prepared  for people to call him names for expressing his viewpoints.  I m a full-time mom, and I love it. So, I decided not to be in the campaign so much, but I support my husband 100 percent,  she said of her role in the campaign itself. We have thick skin, and we know that people will judge him and people will call names. They don t give him enough credit. From June that he announced, they don t give him enough credit,  she said, leading Brzezinski to ask her what she thought about people who felt he insulted Mexicans with his comments that the country is sending rapists and murderers across the border in his announcement speech.

Boehner was asked about his views on Cruz and other presidential candidates during an event held at Stanford University this week. The Stanford Daily reported that Boehner replied: I have Democrat friends and Republican friends. I get along with almost everyone, but I have never worked with a more miserable son of a b*tch in my life. Adding that he considers Cruz to be: Lucifer in the flesh. This was in sharp contrast to his views on the other candidates. Boehner revealed that he is on friendly terms with frontrunner Donald Trump, stating that the two are actually  texting buddies.  One can only imagine the contents of those texts.And how does Boehner feel about outside challenger and fellow Ohioan John Kasich? Not much apparently. [Kasich] requires more effort on my behalf than all my other friends  but he s still my friend, and I love him. Boehner went on to state that in the event of a run off between Ted Cruz and Donald Trump, he would throw his vote and support behind a Trump candidacy. Of course, the frontrunner may well be forced to consider that with a friend like Boehner, he may require no enemies. The former speaker is, like Trump, a fairly divisive figure in the Republican Party and wider conservative movement.Of course, as Addicting Info s Matthew Desmond pointed out earlier today, this is all becoming a moot point. Like it or not, the campaigns of Ted Cruz and John Kasich are essentially over. Donald Trump is the de facto Republican candidate for President.The GOP clown car has delivered perhaps the most repugnant presidential candidate since Barry Goldwater. The party will have to live with that, but America still has the chance to repeat the landslide of 1964 against Trump in 2016   and remind the world that the U.S. is committed to progress, not hate.Featured image via Flickr Creative Commons\\u002fFlickr Creative Commons\"],[\"How many times will our lawless president plead his unconstitutional positions before our Supreme Court? For a Constitutional lawyer, Obama sure does have a difficult time understanding how our laws work President Barack Obama s executive action to shield millions of undocumented immigrants from deportation suffered a legal setback on Monday with an appeal to the Supreme Court now the administration s only option.The 2-1 decision by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans to uphold a May injunction deals a blow to Obama s plan, opposed by Republicans and challenged by 26 states.The Obama administration has said it is within its rights to ask the Department of Homeland Security to use discretion before deporting nonviolent migrants with U.S. family ties.The case has become the focal point of the Democratic president s efforts to change U.S. immigration policy.Seeing no progress on legislative reform in Congress, Obama announced last November he would take executive action to help immigrants. He has faced criticism from Republicans who say the program grants amnesty to lawbreakers.In its ruling, the appeals court said it was denying the government s appeal to stay the May injunction  after determining that the appeal was unlikely to succeed on its merits. Republicans hailed the ruling as a victory against the Obama administration.John Scalise, the No. 3 Republican in the House of Representatives, said in a Twitter message that the court decision was  a major victory for the rule of law. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said in a statement the ruling meant the state, which has led the legal challenge,  has secured an important victory to put a halt to the president s lawlessness.

About 8,000 square miles have been reclaimed under Trump, McGurk said in a briefing for reporters.Although the Trump administration has yet to announce its new strategy for the campaign against the Islamic State, McGurk cited  key changes  under Trump. In addition to the delegation of decision-making authority, which he said has allowed much greater responsiveness to opportunities and changing circumstances, he cited a  campaign of annihilation  that has concentrated on surrounding cities held by the militants before launching offensives, to ensure that no militants will escape.He said the 2,000 militants remaining in Raqqa  most likely will die in Raqqa.  The United Nations has estimated that 25,000 civilians also remain in the city.McGurk, who held the same job in the Obama administration, also cited renewed administration efforts to  increase burden sharing from the coalition  among what he said were 73 countries. Most of them do not contribute to the warfighting but are expected to help with stabilization efforts in cleared areas, including in the Iraqi city of Mosul, where U.S.-backed Iraq security forces declared victory over the Islamic State last month.\"],[\"Republicans are caught between a rock and a hard place and Democrats are poised to take advantage of the chaos.The avalanche that buried the Republican Party on Friday is causing mass panic among GOP candidates up and down the 2016 ballot.Trump s vulgar remarks about groping women has resulted in many Republicans withdrawing their support of his presidential campaign. But whether they stick with him or turn their backs on him, it s a double-edged sword that is making Republicans bleed out with under a month to go before Election Day.The Republican nominee has been a toxic force ever since he threw his hat into the ring over a year ago, and while that has hurt Republicans among independent and moderate Republican voters in addition to the many groups Trump has insulted, Republicans who are just now running away from Trump have angered the conservative base that somehow still supports him.And the political consequences could cut deep if Trump has his way. Even if he loses in November, Trump could still bring many Republicans down with him, especially after this threat he posted on Twitter.So many self-righteous hypocrites. Watch their poll numbers   and elections   go down!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 9, 2016Just in case you re confused, that s Trump attacking the Republicans who have denounced him since Friday s bombshell, and there is no doubt that Trump s supporters are going to remember who betrayed them when it s time to vote.Trump even escalated the threat by instructing his team to launch the attack.According to the New York Times,In a set of talking points sent to his supporters Sunday morning, Mr. Trump s campaign urged them to attack turncoat Republicans as  more concerned with their political future than they are about the country. As we all know, Trump s team has received a lot of television time this year, which means any Republican who has distanced themselves from Trump is about to get a whole lot of negative press.And that s really bad news for Republicans, because as the Times further reports,  much of the party appeared to be in a state of paralysis, uncertain of how to achieve political distance from Mr. Trump without enraging millions of voters who remained loyal to his campaign. Specifically, Republicans now fear losing both houses of Congress, which would be a historic political victory for Democrats at a time when gerrymadering basically guaranteed that the GOP would at least hold onto power over the House of Representatives.Steven Law, a longtime lieutenant of the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, said the party had descended into chaos. The Republican Party is caught in a theater fire; people are just running to different exits as fast as they can,  said Mr. Law, who now heads the  super PAC  American Crossroads.One member of the House Republican leadership, conceding its majority was now in jeopardy, compared the situation to the 2006 scandal involving a Florida congressman s inappropriate conduct with congressional pages. If that scandal was a house fire, this lawmaker said, Mr. Trump had brought on the political equivalent of a nuclear attack.Democrats see this as a major opportunity to seek wins in Republican leaning states such as Indiana and Georgia, and even wins in red states like Arizona. If successful, we could be seeing a reversal of the 2010 midterm election that swept Republicans into office.Should it come to pass that Republicans lose across the board on November 8th, we could be finally seeing the last gasp of Republican reliance upon it s conservative base, which means Republicans will have to move towards the center if they want to be politically relevant again.Featured Image: Win McNamee\\u002fGetty Images\"],[\"Everyone had their suspicions as to the timing of FBI Director James Comey s letter regarding Hillary Clinton s email server that he later rescinded in relation to the election. In addition, many were fairly certain that Russia had direct involvement in our election. And now, as it turns out, both things definitely did affect the election, and the first person who will agree with that definitely seems to be Hillary Clinton herself.Breaking her silence while speaking to donors about what seemed to directly impact the election away from her winning, Clinton didn t hold back and called out Russian President Vladimir Putin by name.According to NBC News: Hillary Clinton told donors on Thursday night that her loss was partly due to U.S. election hacks directed by Russian President Vladimir Putin and FBI director James Comey s election-eve letter to Congress related to her use of a private email server. Putin publicly blamed me for the outpouring of outrage by his own people that is the direct line between what he said back then and what he did in this Election,  Clinton is heard saying in an audio recording first obtained by the New York Times and verified as authentic by several sources present at the event to NBC News. Clinton also said: He is determined not only to score a point against me, which he did, but also to undermine our democracy. And as it turns out, Putin was directly involved with the hacks and how the information gained was to be used. In fact, NBC News reported: Putin s objectives were multifaceted, a high-level intelligence source told NBC News. What began as a  vendetta  against Hillary Clinton morphed into an effort to show corruption in American politics and to  split off key American allies by creating the image that [other countries] couldn t depend on the U.S. to be a credible global leader anymore,  the official said. Putin very clearly wanted Donald Trump to win and used information gained to release only what he wanted to skilfully get what he wanted out the the U.S. election.And now that all of this has been revealed, President Obama is vowing retaliation against Russia, saying: I think there is no doubt that when any foreign government tries to impact the integrity of our elections that we need to take action and we will at a time and place of our own choosing some of it may be explicit and publicized; some of it may not be. And while Donald Trump and his campaign are clearly pleased with the election results and want to peacefully continue a transition while thinking all accusations against Russia are just excuses for a Clinton loss, evidence proves quite to the contrary.Hopefully, we will get to the bottom of this and justice will prevail.Featured Photo by Justin Sullivan\\u002fGetty Images\"],[\"One thing you don t ever want to do is tell a woman to smile more. It s become this thing where people feel they are entitled to tell a woman how she should or should not behave or appear. As if a woman does this one thing, she ll appear more likable or more genuine or more pretty. Here s the thing   no one is telling men to smile more, because when men don t smile they re being serious and responsible and down to business. God forbid it be the same thing for a woman.Pointing out this hypocrisy perfectly was none other than Ellen DeGeneres on her show. She said: She gave a very passioninate speech, and then someone, I don t want to say it was a man, because it was a bunch of men   they said that Hillary needs to smile more Here s something you should never tell a woman   smile, relax, calm down, or drink less. It s then brought up that no one is telling the male candidates to smile. Ellen then shows photos of all the men still running for office (sans Kasich). She also points out that it s lose-lose for women, because at the same time they re being told to smile more, they re told to wipe the smile off their face because they may look crazy. Meanwhile, the men can pretty much do as they please.Ellen said: I know Hillary, and I know there are plenty of things that make her smile   like her daughter, her granddaughter, when there s a sale on pantsuits I m not against smiling. I think we should all do it more   women, men, cats, Clint Eastwood  But we should do it on our own terms. Which is exactly right. Telling a woman that they should smile is telling a woman what they should be doing with their body and image, and that s pretty much the epitome of misogyny.

Her solicitations, in both emails and in person, came a few months before her 1997 lawsuit was brought to light, along with several other sexual misconduct allegations against the candidate. The Hill learned of her appeals to Trump in an interview with Harth in December about her friendship with celebrity attorney Lisa Bloom; Trump s lawyers then provided the emails. The Hill followed up with Harth, who defended both her attempts to work with the man she accused of sexual assault and her current call for him to be impeached.In 1997, Harth sued Trump for allegedly pushing her up against a wall and trying to get his hands up her dress during a meeting at Mar-a-Lago in 1993. She eventually withdrew the lawsuit as part of a settlement over Trump allegedly pulling out of a business deal. But as The Hill notes, the tone of her emails to Trump in 2015 was  starkly different  than the tone of her 1997 lawsuit and the interviews she gave about it in 2016.The Hill provides some examples of the emails Harth personally sent to Trump between the summer of 2015 and early 2016: Hi Donald, you are doing a tremendous job of shaking things up in the United States. I am definitely on Team Trump as so many others are,  Jill Harth wrote the future president in an Oct. 1, 2015, email sent to him through his New York company s headquarters. I can t watch television without seeing you or hearing your name everywhere! It s a good thing for sure but PLEASE let me do your makeup for a television interview, a debate, a photo session, anything!  Harth wrote. It kills me to see you looking too orange and with white circles under the eyes. I will get your skin looking smoother and even toned,  she added, boasting she would  sculpt your face  to look good on high-definition television sets.The Hill also notes that Harth is one of the accusers who financially benefited from her work with Bloom on the allegations: the attorney set up a GoFundMe page for Harth that paid off her mortgage and an email revealed that Harth s sales soared after Bloom appeared on TV to discuss her allegations.  Daily WireBIG PAYDAYS FOR TRUMP ACCUSERS:According to FOX News, Legal powerhouse Lisa Bloom tried to line up big paydays for women who were willing to accuse President Trump of sexual misconduct during the final months of last year s election, according to an explosive report.Proud to call Attorney @LisaBloom my friend.

It s T-minus one week for Chicago Public Schools.As schools let out for the summer, CPS administrators are scrambling to come up with a more than $600 million teacher pension payment due at the end of the month and the district has zero reserves, according to media reports.The problem is further compounded by a more than $1 billion school budget shortfall for the next fiscal year and an angry teachers union hell bent on securing another raise the district can t afford. With no plan, no money and no where to turn, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel seems to be focused solely on a state bailout as the solution. Springfield has to step up and help in this case, not only as it relates to just the pension payment, (but also) the educational opportunities of our children,  Emanuel said, according to the Chicago Tribune.  Because a payment will then begin to impact   the classroom. And CTU could soon partner with its mortal enemies at City Hall to lobby state lawmakers for more money. Right now, the district needs us,  CTU VP Jesse Sharkey told the news site.  The politics of (Chicago Mayor) Rahm Emanuel going to Springfield are a lot different than the politics of Rahm Emanuel and (CTU President) Karen Lewis going to Springfield. The dire financial situation comes amid a federal investigation into a $20 million no-bid contract to a previous employer of former CPS superintendent Barbara Byrd-Bennett, who resigned this month. It feels like a complete mess,  Better Government Association senior editor Sarah Karp told ABC 7.Karp doesn t think recently elected Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner, who ran on a platform of fiscal restraint and criticized union influence in Illinois, is receptive to calls for a bailout. He previously suggested that bankruptcy may be the best way out for CPS, ABC 7 reports. Now, Chicago Public Schools does not have somebody in the State House that is a Democrat or is seemingly sympathetic at all to what s going on here,  Karp said.Meanwhile, school ended for the summer on Friday, and principals around the city are left scratching their heads in planning for next school year. Normally you do your planning in the summer and you can t do too much planning without the actual dollar amount,  Coles Language Academy principal Jeff Dase told ABC 7.Dase said many Chicago principals are concerned that the budget turmoil, and looming possibility of layoffs and program cuts, could convince many of the city s teachers to seek jobs elsewhere.The Tribune reports the city council could authorize CPS to increase taxes on residents, or secure some sort of bailout, or negotiate concessions with CTU, but not even all three combined could put the budget back on track. And then there s another $228 million payment coming due for costs related to interest rate swaps on the district s debt.    (E)ven if CPS wins concession from the City Council, state lawmakers and CTU, the district won t be able to close its annual $1 billion budget gap, according to a May 22 report by Ernst & Young, which spent four weeks meeting with school finance officials and analyzing budget documents,  the Tribune reports. The report shows that even with a capital improvement tax, a separate, even-larger property tax increase, additional state aid, increased state funding of teacher pensions, concessions from the CTU and $150 million with of budget cuts, CPS would still face an annual $350 million shortfall. Next June s teacher pension payment is set to balloon to $700 million.

Behind the scenes, Trump is making a critical error that could doom his attempt to win the presidency more than a simple racist comment, and it is driving the party chairman nuts.Meanwhile, the Trump high-dollar fund-raising operation is showing signs of duress, people here say. A joint fund-raising agreement was hatched last month to split proceeds between the RNC and the Trump campaign. And while the first joint fund-raisers have gone well, RNC chair Reince Priebus has phoned some associates expressing frustration that Trump wants to direct dollars to his own ambitious plans, according to a person who has spoken directly with Priebus, which includes quixotic bids to win deep blue states like California and New York.The RNC did not respond to a request for comment.There isn t any data to indicate that a win in traditionally blue states is remotely possible for Trump to pull off. Most polling has shown that his best shot would come with a winning streak in so-called  purple  states, the same states that both John McCain and Mitt Romney tried to target against President Obama that have swung between both parties with a difference of one percentage point or less.By comparison, no Republican has won California and New York since Ronald Reagan s epic landslide victory in 1984, which was 32 years ago. Both states have delivered huge, lopsided victories to Democratic presidential candidates for decades, and both also consist of the diverse electorates   Latino, black   that are the most opposed to Trump.Republican insiders know and understand this. Trump s ego insists that he should contend in the blue states, especially his home state of New York, but using any money to campaign there is a fool s errand for the Republican Party, made even worse since the GOP is so far behind the Democrats and Secretary Clinton on raising money.It has all the ingredients for an election disaster.Featured image via YouTube\"],[\"Of course, the government will have to address that whole income inequality issue, because clearly every illegal alien or  underprivileged  American doesn t have the financial means to live in the wealthier communities or suburbs. Socialism is here, and unless we find someone in Congress willing to stand up to this  president, everything Americans have worked so hard for will likely be taken away by government force This is what you get when you put a community organizer in the White House   he tries to reorganize your community from Washington.Apparently, President Obama thinks your neighborhood may not be inclusive enough, so he has instructed his Department of Housing and Urban Development to issue a new rule called Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing, which is designed to force communities to diversify.According to the Obama administration, in too many neighborhoods  housing choices continue to be constrained through housing discrimination, the operation of housing markets, [and] investment choices by holders of capital.  (Yes, that is a quote from an actual HUD document, not a bad undergraduate thesis on Karl Marx.)Under Obama s proposed rule, the federal government will collect massive amounts of data on the racial, ethnic and socioeconomic makeup of thousands of local communities, looking for signs of  disparities by race, color, religion, sex, familial status, national origin, or disability in access to community assets.  Then the government will target communities with results it doesn t like and use billions of dollars in federal grant money to bribe or blackmail them into changing their zoning and housing policies.This is not about blocking housing discrimination, which has been illegal since 1968. It is unlawful for someone to deny you a loan or prevent you from buying a home because of your race, creed or color. Socioeconomic status is   and ought to be   another matter. If you want to buy a nice house in the suburbs, you have to be able to afford it. Apparently, Obama thinks that s unfair discrimination by the  holders of capital. Putting decisions about how local communities are run in the hands of federal bureaucrats is an assault on freedom. Local autonomy is essential to liberty. As Milton Friedman put it in  Capitalism and Freedom,   If I don t like what my local community does, be it in sewage disposal, zoning or schools, I can move to another local community. . . . If I don t like what my state does, I can move to another. If I do not like what Washington imposes, I have few alternatives in this world of jealous nations.  Washington has no business imposing decisions about zoning and housing policies on thousands of local communities.The proposed rule could become an issue in the presidential race. HUD Secretary Julian Castro, the man assigned to implement this new policy, is on everyone s shortlist to be Hillary Clinton s running mate. Moreover, as National Review s Stanley Kurtz points out, collecting all the data will take time   which means decisions about how to use that data will be up to the next president, whoever that turns out to be.Local communities across the United States will be up in arms over this rule   and rightly so. The federal government should have no say over whether your neighborhood is too Jewish, or too Caucasian, or has too many married couples. But Republicans need to be very careful. Democrats want the GOP to rail against this rule and see it as an opportunity to paint the Republicans as the party that wants to protect the wealthy, white suburbs and keep out poor people of color.Conservatives need to make this absolutely clear: We believe Americans of all races, colors and creeds should be free to live wherever they want. And we want to help them do so by unleashing economic opportunity for those at the bottom so that more Americans can get better educations and better jobs and ultimately move to better neighborhoods.Under Obama, those opportunities have been disappearing for Americans at the bottom of our economy. While he talks a good game about inequality, the poor have gotten poorer while the rich have gotten richer on Obama s watch. During the Obama recovery, Americans in the top 5 percent of households (those with average incomes of more than $320,000) were the only group in the United States to see incomes rise from 2009 to 2013. Meanwhile, those worst hit were in the bottom 20 percent, who saw their real incomes fall by 7 percent on average. As American Enterprise Institute President Arthur C. Brooks explains ,  Our putatively progressive president has inadvertently executed a plutocratic tour de force. Having Washington micromanage the housing and zoning policies of thousands of local communities is not going to change this. The answer is not to force local governments to build affordable housing in affluent communities. The answer is to restore upward mobility in the United States so that more people can afford housing in affluent communities.Via: Washington Post \"],[\"Most leaders, when they give statements on atrocities happening elsewhere in the world, use the opportunity to condemn those atrocities and pledge some kind of help or solidarity.

One of the things we found interesting is her affiliation with ICNA Relief, an Islamic charity affiliated with the Islamic Circle of North America. We don t know much about the organization but found a video of Noelle speaking about her support from ICNA. To be honest, it sounds like a bunch of bs but she s trying to raise funds for a women s shelter. She rambles on and on but you can at least get a better understanding of what an attention wh*re she is.NOELLE (PLEASE GO TO THE 7:00 MARK FOR HER  STORY ) ALSO KNOWN AS AISHA ASIF IS A WANNABE JIHADIST WHO CONSPIRED TO BOMB THE NYC POLICE FUNERAL: One of the two Queens women accused of plotting a homemade bomb strike on American soil worked at a preschool, where officials remained tight-lipped Friday after her arrest on terrorism charges.Asia Siddiqui, a 31-year-old native of Saudi Arabia, was behind bars Friday, locked up with her best friend and accused sister in jihad Noelle Valentzas, 28.An undercover operative reported that Valentzas said  being a martyr in a suicide attack guarantees entrance into heaven.  A picture of Osama bin Laden with an AK-47 allegedly decorated her cell phone. She also allegedly turned her interests to pressure cookers after the Boston Marathon bombing: You can fit a lot of things in [the pressure cooker], even if it s not food,  Velentzas told the undercover operative, apparently referencing explosives.She evidently told the undercover operative,  If we get arrested, the police will point their guns at us from the back and maybe from the front. If we can get even one of their weapons, we can shoot them. They will probably kill us but we will be martyrs automatically and receive Allah s blessing. Velentzas was allegedly also friends with U.S. airman Tairod Pugh who, last month, was indicted on terrorism charges after allegedly plotting to travel to Syria to join the Islamic State.Less than two weeks ago, Velentzas was reportedly asked whether she had heard the news about the recent arrest of Pugh and replied that she did not understand why people were traveling overseas to wage jihad when there were more opportunities of  pleasing Allah  in the United States. In that same meeting, Velentzas said she needed to learn the science behind bomb-building to avoid being like Faisal Shahzad, the man who drove an SUV full of explosives into Times Square on a warm Saturday night in May 2010. He wasn t able to detonate the bombs. We have no comment at this time,  said a worker at 82nd Street Academics in Queens on the day after FBI agents arrested the two Al Qaeda-linked suspects at their homes.The busts followed a two-year undercover probe, with the terrorist sympathizers accused of amassing bomb-making materials and studying bomb-making manuals while plotting their strike.The self-identified citizens of the Islamic State   the terrorist organization responsible for beheading Western hostages   have billed themselves as  some bad bitches. Outside their South Jamaica home on Friday, Valentzas  husband (PICTURED BELOW), Abu Bakr, defended his wife and her friend against the federal charges that carry a potential life sentence. He was left at the home with their two kids, ages 5 and 11, after federal agents took Noelle away in handcuffs. The 27-year-old Valentzas, a home health-care worker, was born in Florida, authorities said.She and Siddiqui became close friends and co-conspirators united by a desire to  make history  through a terrorist attack in the U.S. Both women are American citizens.But a federal criminal complaint said the two suspects were overheard repeatedly discussing violent activities with the undercover agent   including a plot to bomb a police funeral.Read more: NYDN \"],[\"On Sunday, August 13th, Salt Lake City Police seemed to have a routine bicycle stop under control. Patrick Harmon, a 50-year-old black man who was pulled over on his bike for riding without a working taillight at night, was standing on the side of the road with officers complying with their requests. Officer Clinton Fox asked Harmon if he knew about his warrants, which Harmon answered in the affirmative. Harmon was in tears throughout the encounter.Then, as Harmon finished removing his backpack as Officer Fox requested, he decided he was too scared of jail to stay. He got loose of the straps of his pack and ran.Did Clinton Fox, fellow human being, decide to run after Patrick Harmon? Not on your life. Or more precisely, not on Patrick s. One assumes that Fox, being a police officer, was in far superior shape to the middle-aged man smoking a cigarette only moments before, but rather than expend the energy it would ve required to run his suspect down on foot   like police do every damn day   he instead chose to draw his service weapon and fire three shots into Harmon s back as he ran. His finger was already pulling the trigger the first time by the moment he shouted  I m gonna fuckin  shoot you! Harmon s sobbing can be heard as he lies prone on the sidewalk. The light of another officer s taser, which had been at the ready well before Officer Fox shot Harmon in the back, circles around Patrick s heaving body. I got  im,  says Officer Fox.The DA would later say that the shooting was  legally justified,  before the body camera footage you re about to see was released. The police report would alternately first say that Harmon was on foot, then on a bike. It would say that he had a gun, then it was changed to a knife. His rap sheet was public long before the footage.Patrick s sister Antoinette drove 1,300 miles to join the rally held by Black Lives Matter organizer Lex Scott to demand the release of the body cam video. Ms. Scott has held many such rallies. This is about accountability and transparency. This is about Patrick Harmon s family deserving to see that footage. If [SLCPD] did nothing wrong, wouldn t they have released the footage by now? Now the footage has been released, and it is damning.Will Officer Fox face consequences for the apparent murder of Patrick Harmon? The shooting, by any metric, is certainly not justified. Will the DA withdraw their statements? Will the SLCPD form a tight ring around their comrade, squeezing out truth and transparency?Let s hope this incident breaks the pattern and there is accountability.THE FOLLOWING FOOTAGE IS GRAPHIC AND SHOWS THE SHOOTING OF PATRICK HARMONFeatured image via George Frey\\u002fGetty Images\"],[\"The only reality show Donald Trump should have ever been featured in is The Biggest Loser because he just got his ass handed to him in court.Two years ago, Trump National Doral Miami golf resort signed a contract worth $200,000 for a local business called The Paint Spot to provide paint used to renovate the golf course.Well, guess who tried to stiff The Paint Spot of the final $34,863 payment in the deal?Yeah, that would be Republican nominee Donald J. Trump.Trump and his company refused to honor the contract by not paying the final payment, saying that they ve  paid enough  for the paint. In other words, Trump negotiated a deal that ended up costing him more in the end, just like the kinds of deals he wants to negotiate for America with the rest of the world.Anyway, Paint Spot owner Juan Carlos Enriquez filed suit against Trump in court, and Judge Jorge Cueto just slapped Trump and his company with a $300,000 hit to cover The Paint Shop s attorney and court fees, nearly ten times more money than the $34,863 owed. And Trump STILL hasn t paid that debt, so how are we supposed to trust him to pay down the debt of en entire nation if he can t meet his own obligations? I m happy I have a judgment,  Enriquez told the Miami Herald.  But he [Trump] hasn t paid yet. You know how he says he ll surround himself with the greatest people if he is president? In this case, he might not be surrounded by the right people. This isn t even the first fine Trump has been ordered to pay this month.On the same day as his coronation as the Republican Party nominee last week, the National Labor Relations Board slapped Trump with an $11,200 fine for treating employees like shit because they tried to join a labor union.As it turns out, one employee was wrongfully fired and the other was retaliated against by denying them the promotion they had earned.For someone who claims to be the  law and order  candidate, Trump sure does break the law a lot.Featured Image: Christopher Furlong\\u002fGetty Images\"],[\"Rosie O Donnell and Donald Trump have been engaged in a years-long feud, mostly because he leveled pathetic jabs at her over minor issues. But since Trump began his run for President, watching her smack him around has gone from entertaining to downright epic. On Wednesday, O Donnell made an appearance at a Boy George and Cyndi Lauper gig in New York. Speaking to the crowd, she launched into another attack on Trump that is likely eating away at him this very moment.In a video posted by the Daily Mail, O Donnell joked that she is  depressed because I f*cking hate that orange piece of sh*t.  She says he talked to her therapist about The Donald, and was told not to focus on the 2016 Republican frontrunner. Well I would rather give birth to a flaming iguana while taking a sh*t,  she recalls saying, apparently about his presidential prospects.  I hate him. I hate him. O Donnell noted that someone who was her  enemy for years  is friends with the  sh*tstain with a tinge of orange    a fact that  worries  her.All through her brief set, the audience cheered and laughed, but the man who recorded the video says that a few people were upset with O Donnell. Rosie s routine was just jaw-dropping,  he told the Daily Mail, noting that he began recording after the comedienne called Trump a sh*tstain.  She sounds like she is obsessed with Donald Trump and it was what she spent most of her very short act talking about.  He says that  not everyone was impressed,  tossing out an unverifiable claim that people around him were  shaking their heads in disagreement. One man near me turned to his wife turned and said,  I really hope Donald gets elected so she keeps her promise and moves to Canada ,  the man claims, apparently able to overhear someone s conversation with his wife over both O Donnell and the very enthusiastic crowd. He says that  Another lady was shouting,  Get off and let Cyndi sing'    something that is oddly missing from his video.Recently, O Donnell made headlines with a rather hilarious observation about Trump s mouth   specifically that it looks almost exactly like a puckered anus.Watch O Donnell s latest Trump smackdown below:Featured image via Getty Images (Dimitrios Kambouris)\\u002fGetty Images (Spencer Platt)\"],[\"Clint Eastwood will long be remembered for his influence in Hollywood, but his legacy will always be tainted by his 2012 speech at the Republican National Convention, when he spent the more than 10 minutes talking to a chair. Now, Trump wants political correctness and Hillary Clinton s voice to get off his lawn.The 86-year-old Eastwood didn t actually say the n-word during this interview with Esquire Magazine, but gosh darn, he s sure offended over the idea that rich old white guys no longer get to decide what s offensive and what s not.Eastwood has his own not-so-loving nickname for Millennials. He calls them the  pussy generation,  you know, because of that pesky insistence that everyone be treated with respect. He s doesn t agree with Trump on everything, but as for all those racist comments coming from Trump, well, Americans should  just fucking get over it. I haven t endorsed anybody. I haven t talked to Trump. I haven t talked to anybody. You know, he s a racist now because he s talked about this judge. And yeah, it s a dumb thing to say. I mean, to predicate your opinion on the fact that the guy was born to Mexican parents or something. He s said a lot of dumb things. So have all of them. Both sides. But everybody the press and everybody s going,  Oh, well, that s racist,  and they re making a big hoodoo out of it. Just fucking get over it. It s a sad time in history. Eastwood isn t 100 percent sure who he ll vote for, but damn those Millennials again, wanting an education: I d say get to work and start being more understanding of everybody instead of calling everybody names, start being more understanding. But get in there and get it done. Kick ass and take names. And this may be my dad talking, but don t spend what you don t have. That s why we re in the position we are in right now. That s why people are saying,  Why should I work? I ll get something for nothing, maybe.  And going around and talking about going to college for free. I didn t go to college for free. I mean, it was cheap, because I went to L. A. City College it wasn t like going to a major university. But it was okay. And then, you know, I didn t finish, because I decided to become an actor, ruin my whole life. [Everyone laughs.] As for Hillary Clinton, it s unlikely the Republican will vote for her. He s afraid she ll follow in Obama s footsteps, but there s also another, far more sexist reason: her voice. When asked what he thinks of Clinton, he said,  I mean, it s a tough voice to listen to for four years. It could be a tough one. If she s just gonna follow what we ve been doing, then I wouldn t be for her. That s a tough one, isn t it? I d have to go for Trump   you know,  cause she s declared that she s gonna follow in Obama s footsteps. There s been just too much funny business on both sides of the aisle. She s made a lot of dough out of being a politician. I gave up dough to be a politician. I m sure that Ronald Reagan gave up dough to be a politician. I guess it s okay to make money from evading taxes, shady business deals and using bankruptcy as a way to pass debt on to taxpayers. Yes, that s much more trustworthy.

Your tax dollars paid for this insane rant against whites. The kicker is the Census Bureau paid Gregory  a whopping $1,400 to  share a wealth of history as a Civil Rights Activist.  So he got paid to offend anyone who s not black unreal!The U.S. government paid a controversial civil rights activist\\u002fcomedian to deliver an anti-white racist tirade at a major federal agency during Black History month and Judicial Watch has obtained the disturbing transcript of the offensive political rant.It took place at the United States Census Bureau earlier this year and the paid speaker was Dick Gregory, a self-professed humanitarian and drum major for justice who claims that his social satire changed the way white Americans perceive African American comedians. But Gregory s angry outburst at the Census Bureau was not funny to some employees and the agency was forced to explain that it will thoroughly review its procedures for selecting future speakers to  ensure their views are appropriate for the federal workplace.  Gregory also said whites stole black inventions, such as ice hockey and the cotton gin, and accused the U.S. government of conspiring to kill Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri and Tamir Rice in Cleveland, Ohio. The movie King Kong is really a depiction of former heavyweight champion Jack Johnson dating white women, Gregory claimed at the Census Bureau performance, and whites treat President Obama  like dirt  and  like he s a Redneck Cracker that can t read or write.  Gregory delivered most of his routine in Ebonics (also known as African American Vernacular English) and advised his black audience not to obey  white racist cops,  which he also referred to as  filth. The rioters who destroyed Ferguson after a cop fatally shot a black man with an extensive criminal record who had just committed a robbery, didn t steal enough merchandise from the businesses they looted, Gregory told his government audience.  I was complaining about Ferguson because the N_ _ _ _ _ _ wasn t getting enough,  Gregory said, according to the transcript obtained by JW.  Did you see the brother go in there and walk out with a half-pint, I said  Get some tips.  And, y all be trying to trick them White folks and say rebellion. No rebellion is put together, predicated, on some White person shooting a Black person and that tips it off. Those was riots, riots. Gregory also told his audience of public servants that if he were president of the United States no white people would be in his cabinet.  Had I been elected to be the President, listen good White folks, none of y all would be in my cabinet,  he says.  Now don t worry about Black folks who be saying  oh, he didn t mean it.  So, I ll say it ten times, non of y all be in my cabinet, none of y all be in my cabinet, none of y all be in my cabinet.

The Calvary Christian Church in Del City, Oklahoma was the scene of a brainwashing that led to more than 50 counts of sexual abuse charges against 45-year-old Donnie Ray Shultz.Shultz, who has a history of sexual abuse, was allowed to volunteer to teach a class on church doctrine, in spite of his sordid past. While the class was supposed to be for adults, a spokesman said ,  apparently some participated in the class before they were eighteen. In this case, four years before. Even though the church was aware of Shultz s past when he joined 19 years ago, they are still  shocked  at the allegations. The girl told police that she had intercourse with Shultz 20-30 times and engaged in oral sex several times as well. Police are investigating Shultz for the possibility that there are other victims.You have to wonder how things like this continue to happen. The Catholic church, plagued by arrests and lawsuits over molested altar boys, still manages to let a priest or two through the cracks every now and then. People like Josh Duggar, who consider themselves to be of a higher moral fiber than the rest of us because of his relationship with Jesus, astound us with incredible acts of hypocrisy that can somehow be explained away with  a moment of weakness  and set aside because with enough prayer God forgives you.Does God sign some kind of a hall pass for depravity or is it merely implied?This church in Oklahoma most likely allowed a sick individual with a past that told a tale of immorality to volunteer to teach a class because he  repented.  They say he wasn t an employee and wasn t paid for his work, but that certainly doesn t excuse them or release them from liability for the hell an innocent 14-year-old girl went through because a serious lack of judgement.Watch the news report, courtesy of KOCO, below:Featured image via screen capture \"],[\"Unreal! Mooch gets millions for Pakistani girls? The American taxpayers should be outraged by this! Let Pakistan empower its own people! Michelle Obama has been traveling all over the world with the Let Girls Learn initiative as her pet project. The only thing is that most of the places she s traveled to have a great track record with educating girls. It s just one big around the world vacation for Mooch compliments of the American taxpayer. Judicial Watch s Tom Fitton had this to say about the trip: The Obama family continues to bill the taxpayers for costly tourism jaunts thinly disguised as humanitarian crusades EUROPEAN VACATION: MOOCH RUNS UP A HUGE TAB COMPLIMENTS OF THE TAXPAYERS Could someone please remind this woman that America is BROKE! As public schools around the United States suffer through a perpetual financial crisis, the Obama administration commits a breathtaking $70 million to help educate girls in a terrorist nation known as Al Qaeda headquarters. It s part of the First Lady s initiative (Let Girls Learn) to educate and empower an estimated 62 million girls in third-world countries who are not in school. A noble cause indeed, but it s costing American taxpayers huge sums while kids especially minorities in this country struggle in schools that aren t adequately funded, according to public education advocates.  We know that countries with more girls in secondary school tend to have lower maternal mortality rates, lower infant mortality rates, lower rates of HIV\\u002fAIDS, and better child nutrition,  according to the initiative s website.  But too often, a girl who could change her world for the better is locked out of that future by the circumstances of her birth or the customs of her community.  So it s Uncle Sam to the rescue. The government of Pakistan, which is included in the State Department s Country Reports on Terrorism, will get the $70 million to promote education among 200,000 girls and young women age 10-19. The announcement was initially made during a White House event this month with the wife and daughter of Pakistan s Prime Minister, Nawaz Sharif. The program will serve as a platform and catalyst for broader political and social commitment to strengthen girls  education and empowerment in Pakistan, according to a government announcement.  Young women in Pakistan face barriers and lack of access to education opportunities from an early age due to poverty, cultural norms, and geographic isolation,  the announcement states. The question remains; should American tax dollars go to this foreign education cause when public schools in this country have been hurting for years? Besides financial troubles, there s an epidemic of low-performing schools and dismal graduation rates around the country, especially in the nation s inner cities. They could probably use a few million to create programs that might help improve academic performance or perhaps empower needy students like the multi-million-dollar allocation is predicted to help empower girls in Pakistan. The public school district in the Obamas  own hometown of Chicago could use some extra cash. By Thanksgiving as many as 5,000 teachers could be laid off unless the 367,499-student district Chicago Public Schools gets a $500 million bailout from the state. A recent editorial in the area s mainstream newspaper says that it  has been a disastrous time for Chicago Public Schools.  The piece is accompanied by an illustration of a yellow school bus with  Corruption & Politics in our Schools  plastered across the side. Districts across the nation are in similar situations.

That gave diplomats from around the world to weigh in on this year s very strange presidential election. Many seem rather rattled about the idea of a Donald Trump presidency, while others merely poked fun at Trump s buffoonery.One diplomat mocked Trump, saying,  he s a clown.  Another said,  He s nuts.  Yet another said that Trump is an  untrustworthy egomaniacal equivocator. Well, it s too bad so many American citizens can t see these traits in Trump. An Ipsos poll that polled foreign ambassadors who are currently working in America has 60 percent of these people saying they would vote for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton if they were citizens, while only 7 percent would hop on the Trump Train. That in and of itself is very telling.Dennis Jett, who spent much of his career being a diplomat himself and now works for Pennsylvania State University School of International Affairs, says that Trump s behavior has made many diplomats nervous and worried about American leadership, America s role in the world. Also curious is the fact that the American people have succumbed to the belief that Hillary is untrustworthy, while 93 percent of those surveyed in the Ipsos poll say that they find Hillary to be  somewhat  or  very much  in the realm of someone who they feel they can trust. On the other hand, just two in five of those surveyed say that they trust Trump  a little  while the rest said they don t trust him as far as they can throw him.German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier says that Trump is a  hate preacher  and alluded to the idea that the billionaire tycoon reminds him of demagogues from past times in his own homeland. French President Fran ois Hollande says that the GOP nominee s excesses make you want to retch. One lobbyist familiar with the diplomatic community says that there are deepening fears around the world regarding the idea of Trump making it to the White House. Speaking anonymously, the lobbyist said: Foreign clients are very concerned about what they perceive as a tipping point in this election. This is less about Democrat versus Republican, and more about open versus closed economy, vis- -vis the rest of the world. With a wave of nationalism and protectionism sweeping the West, there is a real concern it will take hold in the United States and in what form it might show itself post-election.Whether it s immigration reform or trade policy, it feels as if much of the world is opening while the U.S. is teetering on closing. Even more alarming, the diplomats say, is Trump s  America First  and isolationist demagoguery. Stephen Walt, who works as a professor at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, says of the situation among diplomats: First and most obviously, most foreign governments would like a relatively predictable post-November situation, and I think they regard Trump correctly as a giant leap in the dark.Whatever Hillary Clinton s strengths or weaknesses might be, she has been a very conventional politician, at least when it comes to foreign policy. Therefore, people don t anticipate any kind of radical turn if she s elected. Of course, another source of more than a little concern is Trump s penchant for starting public feuds with longtime allies of the United States, as well as his public musings that he might not honor alliances such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)   which is the single most important military alliance that we have developed since the horrors of World War II.In other words, the entire world is afraid of Donald Trump. Why aren t the American people able to see how dangerous this demagogue is? Donald Trump could single-handedly destroy the world with the power of the presidency.Featured image via Joe Raedle\\u002fGetty Images\"],[\"The American taxpayers are on the hook for less than predicted but this is still huge! It was Obama s green energy scam with companies like Solyndra that was like flushing millions and billions down the toilet Taxpayers are on the hook for more than $2.2 billion in expected costs from the federal government s energy loan guarantee programs, according to a new audit Monday that suggests the controversial projects may not pay for themselves, as officials had promised.Nearly $1 billion in loans have already defaulted under the Energy Department program, which included the infamous Solyndra stimulus project and dozens of other green technology programs the Obama administration has approved, totaling nearly about $30 billion in taxpayer backing, the Government Accountability Office reported in its audit.The hefty $2.2 billion price tag is actually an improvement over initial estimates, which found the government was poised to face $4 billion in losses from the loan guarantees. But as the projects have come to fruition, they ve performed better, leaving taxpayers with a shrinking   though still sizable   liability. As of November 2014, DOE estimates the credit subsidy cost of the loans and loan guarantees in its portfolio   that is, the total expected net cost over the life of the loans   to be $2.21 billion, including $807 million for loans that have defaulted,  the GAO said in its report to Congress.The green program loan guarantees were created in a 2005 law and boosted by the 2009 stimulus. The first applications were approved in 2009, and through 2014 the Obama administration had issued some 38 loans and guarantees, covering 34 projects ranging from nuclear power plants to fuel-efficient vehicles to solar panels and wind-generation technology.Read more: Washington Times\"],[\"It s no secret that Rosie O Donnell and Donald Trump don t get along.

Does the idea of Sharia Law still seem like a far-fetched idea in America? Political jobs held by two veteran Democratic politicians have been outsourced to two young immigrants, underscoring the growing impact of mass immigration on white-collar Americans.

Steve King (R-IA) went on CNN to propose a heartless, revolting solution to getting Trump s border wall paid for. King is apparently accepting Mexico s refusal to pay for Trump s moronic border wall (even as Trump still insists that the country will pay) and has come up with another solution   cutting food assistance to low-income Americans! And while he s at it, he d also like to slash Planned Parenthood funding.This disgusting suggestion came up when Alisyn Camerota asked King if he would be  comfortable with providing $1.6 billion of taxpayer money not from Mexico to bill that wall?  This question was prompted by the House Republicans  threat to Democrats on Tuesday, where they suggested a government shutdown if $1.6 billion for the border wall wasn t included in the 2018 budget. King responded: Absolutely yes and more. And I d throw another $5 billion on the pile, and I would find half of a billion of dollars of that right out of Planned Parenthood s budget. And the rest of it could come out of food stamps and the entitlements that are being spread out for people who have not worked in three generations. Camerota, of course, was speechless. She did a double take and asked: You want to take food from people who are on the lowest rung in terms of the nation s safety net and their children, in terms of foot stamps you re happy to take money from them in order to give the $1.6 billion for the border wall? King tried to defend himself, stating that the border wall would create jobs. Then, he jumped to the school lunch program that Michelle Obama had created. He said: I would just say let s limit it to that anybody who wants to have food stamps, it s up to the school lunch program, that s fine. You can watch King turn into an absolute piece of sh*t below:These food stamps   provided by the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)   are responsible for assisting 45 million people. Trump has already proposed that this program be cut 25% over the next 10 years, and King wants to cut it even more to support an ineffective border wall that most Americans strongly oppose. By cutting SNAP and Planned Parenthood funding, King is solidifying himself as a conservative who doesn t care about low-income Americans. He s truly living up to the GOP s reputation.Featured image via Justin Sullivan \\u002f Getty Images\"],[\"What a bitter woman! She blames a different thing every week for her 2016 loss to President Trump. Everything she says below is a lie. She just makes it up as she goes along:  She went on to describe how  men who shaped the narrative  of the campaign harmed her but are now under fire for sexual harassment. Hillary Clinton thinks that former NBC host Matt Lauer s demise is  karma  for how he questioned her about her private email server during the 2016 presidential campaign.Clinton was in Philadelphia on Thursday promoting her campaign memoir, What Happened, when she was asked about Lauer being fired this week over allegations of sexual misconduct, the Philly Voice reported. Lauer faced a storm of criticism last year when several journalists and commentators deemed his questioning of Clinton at a candidate forum unfair and even sexist. Every day I believe more in karma,  Clinton said of Lauer.She went on to describe how  men who shaped the narrative  of the campaign harmed her but are now under fire for sexual harassment, echoing how her supporters have tied Lauer s alleged misconduct to his treatment of Clinton. She also repeated her past arguments about the election, primarily blaming a host of outside factors for her defeat. EXTENDED COUGHING FIT  IS THIS KARMA TOO?At one point early in the evening, Clinton launched into an extended coughing fit, the kind of thing that tended to lead to theories during the campaign that the candidate was concealing some sort of illness. Weiner attempted to fill the time by making a self-deprecating joke about her own last name, but knowing that Clinton s history with a man of that particular surname is what led to the notorious Comey Letter, she may have not found it so funny.STILL TRYING TO SELL HER BOOK ON THE ROAD, CLINTON IS ONLY SUCCESSFUL IN MAKING HERSELF OUT TO BE THE BIGGEST WHINER AROUND The only video out there that we could find is of Hillary s response to a heckler:Philly and @HillaryClinton were having none of this asshole tonight #pizzagate #HillaryClinton #philly #whathappened pic.twitter.com\\u002fiuezuhhzKs  Amy (@amyreyrn) December 1, 2017The heckler yelled out a question about  Pizzagate She wasted no time in attacking the  right wing .

One of the GOP candidate s easiest lies to expose was his insistence that  stop and frisk wasn t ruled unconstitutional. He s wrong, it absolutely was.Debate moderator Lester Holt asked Trump about his recent arguments in favor of  stop and frisk  and mentioned that the court has declared the practice unconstitutional on the grounds that it is discriminatory. Stop and frisk  was ruled unconstitutional in New York, because it largely singled out black and Hispanic young men    Trump cut Holt off mid-sentence: No, you re wrong. It went before a judge who was a very against police judge. It was taken away from her and our mayor, our new mayor, refused to go forward with the case. They would have won an appeal. Factcheck: U.S. District Court Judge Shira A. Scheindlin ruled  stop and frisk  to be unconstitutional August 12, 2013. According to the Center for Constitutional Rights, Judge Shira Scheindlin found the NYPD s practices to violate New Yorkers  Fourth Amendment rights to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures and also found that the practices were racially discriminatory in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment, The Bloomberg administration did appeal the ruling. The order was then suspended by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals and the case was sent back to be tried again with a new judge presiding over the proceedings. However, the court shot down the city s motion and decided not to vacate Scheindlin s decision. The appeal was eventually dropped by the de Blasio administration.Trump, who has run a bigoted campaign right from the start, was completely undeterred by Holt s assertion of the facts and continued to argue vehemently in favor of the discriminatory policing practice.Watch Trump wrongly argue that  stop and frisk  wasn t ruled unconstitutional, even though it was, here:Featured image via video screen capture\"],[\"\\\"There are only three things for certain in this world: Death, taxes, and Trump golfing every weekend. Today featured all three in a way.Two days ago, Trump spent around $90 million in tax dollars to bomb an empty airbase in Syria. The symbolic attack did little to stop the Syrian government s ability to bomb its citizens   bombers were reportedly back to using the airstrip just hours later   but it had the effect of inflaming already high tensions between the United States and supporters of the Syrian regime in Russia and Iran.So covering death and taxes, Trump moved onto golf.The fact that he would go on vacation just days after creating an international crisis was so painfully obvious that protesters planned for it. When Trump s motorcade was spotted on route to his golf course in Florida, the signs came out to greet him.

Terrorists do not worship God. They worship death.    President Donald J. TrumpDonald Trump insisted in a speech addressing global  Islamic extremism  that Muslim leaders must scare would-be terrorists into submission, warning them about the impact suicide bombings will have on their immortal souls. Religious leaders must make this absolutely clear: Barbarism will deliver you no glory   piety to evil will bring you no dignity,  Trump said in a sumptuous Saudi ballroom that put Mar-a-Lago to shame. If you choose the path of terror, your life will be empty, your life will be brief, and your soul will be fully condemned,  he said. Heroes don t kill innocents,  a confident Trump declared at the King Abdulaziz Conference Center in Riyadh.  They save them. The president urged 55 world leaders from Arab and other Muslim nations to  drive out  terrorists from every corner of their lives   including mosques   in a zero-tolerance approach that lines up with his 2016 campaign rhetoric. Drive them out!  he said.  Drive them out of your places of worship, Drive them out of your communities. Drive them out of your holy lands, and drive them out of this earth,  he trumpeted.Trump s performance was forceful at times but largely a cautious, measured and presidential-sounding effort, raising his voice only once. With God s help this summit will mark the beginning of the end for those who practice terror and spread its vile creed,  the president said.Trump insisted that fighting terrorism is  a battle between good and evil,  not between  different faiths, different sects, or different civilizations. Terrorists do not worship God. They worship death,  Trump declared.  If we do not act against this organized terror, then we know what will happen and what will be the end result. He predicted that in the absence of multi-nation commitments to action,  peaceful societies will be engulfed by violence, and the futures of many generations will be sadly squandered. And if the world doesn t unite to fight ISIS, al-Qaeda, Hezbollah, Hamas and other groups, he said,  not only will we be judged by our people, not only will we be judged by history, we will be judged by God. Trump said Middle Eastern nations  can t wait  for the U.S. to solve the terror problem for them. Muslim-majority countries must take the lead in combating radicalization,  he said.Trump took pains to isolate Iran in his speech, saying the Islamic republican is spreading  destruction and chaos  throughout the Middle East and gives terrorists  safe harbor, financial backing and the social standing needed for recruitment. Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, too, declared on Sunday that  the Iranian regime has been the spearhead of global terrorism. Trump called defeating global terrorism  history s great test,  as he urged summit attendees to  vanquish the forces that terrorism brings with it every single time. Young Muslim boys and girls should be able to grow up free from fear, safe from violence and innocent from hatred,  Trump said. This is a battle between barbaric criminals who seek to obliterate human life, and decent people of all religions who seek to protect it,  Trump said, reading from teleprompters.Watch video here:King Salman seemed to agree with Trump s most aggressive and foreboding statement   that jihadi terrorists place their souls at risk. Our way to achieve the goals of our religion and win everlasting life in heaven is to promote the tolerant values of Islam, which are based in peace and moderation,  he said in introducing Trump from behind a desk onstage. There is no honor in committing murder,  he said through a translator.  Islam is the religion of peace and tolerance.   it considers killing an innocent soul tantamount to killing all of humanity. Salman called on Gulf Cooperation Council leaders to  reject extremism, work on fighting all forms of terrorism, stop its financing and its propagation, dry up its sources, and stand firm in confronting this scourge that poses a danger to all of humanity. And he pledged to prosecute terrorists and terror financing, to  eradicate  the ISIS terror army  and other terrorist organizations regardless of their religious, sect or ideology.

Gorsuch is specifically upset with Trump s statements about the judiciary branch of the government, and told Sen. Richard Blumenthal that in a meeting earlier today: He said very specifically that they were demoralizing and disheartening and he characterized them very specifically that way,  Blumenthal said of Gorsuch.  I said they were more than disheartening and I said to him that he has an obligation to make his views clear to the American people, so they understand how abhorrent or unacceptable President Trump s attacks on the judiciary are. For someone who sits on the bench, it s easy to see how that would be disheartening and demoralizing. An attack doesn t have to be directed squarely at you to still feel like an attack. Trump attacked our entire judicial system and insulted all the judges within it when he went off on Judge Robart for blocking his Muslim ban. Gorsuch told Sen. Chuck Schumer as much, too.The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals has been hearing arguments on the legality of the Muslim ban, and apparently the three judges hearing that case gave the lawyers arguing a really tough time. They grilled the lawyer representing the Department of Justice on whether the government even had evidence that the seven countries named in the ban are connected to terrorism.It s a pointed question because Saudi Arabia, which does have strong ties to terrorism and has exported terrorism to the U.S., is not included in the ban. When August Flentje refused to answer it and instead tried again to argue that Trump has broad authority in this area, Judge Michelle Friedland asked: Are you arguing then that the President s decision in that regard is unreviewable (by a court)? Flentje s answer was yes. In other words, Flentje argues that Trump can do what s necessary in his judgement to keep the U.S. safe, and a court can t say otherwise. That s part of what Robart weighed when he blocked the Muslim ban. The 9th Circuit will end up on Trump s radar here pretty quickly if they uphold Robart s decision.Then Gorsuch will have to determine whether he wants to serve on a court that s going to be the subject of juvenile attacks when they rule in a way that Trump doesn t like. His confirmation hearing is coming up. He probably won t withdraw, but he has a lot to think about right now.Read more:Featured image by Alex Wong via Getty Images\"],[\"Wouldn t it be nice if we could just kick bigots out of our country? Well, that s exactly what happened when anti-gay Arizona pastor Stephen Anderson stopped by Botswana for a visit and decided to preach hate.Anderson s road to Botswana was an eventful one, with the United Kingdom banning him from so much as getting on a connecting flight in their country. This forced him to find a  roundabout  way to get to Botswana, where he intended to spend quite some time preaching. But after he suggested that homosexuals be stoned to death in a radio interview, Anderson learned that his hatred is not tolerated everywhere. I have identified Steven Anderson as an undesirable person to travel to South Africa,  Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba told the BBC. The country s Constitution, unlike ours, prohibits hate speech against, among other things, the gay community (even though homosexual acts are illegal in Botswana)   and if you ve ever listened to Anderson speak for five minutes straight, you know hate speech is kind of his  thing.  The government even tweeted to inform everyone he had been declared a  prohibited immigrant :Pastor #StevenAnderson, a #USA citizen has been declared a Prohibited Immigrant and as such is being deported from #Botswana  Botswana Government (@BWGovernment) September 20, 2016What prompted his removal was a radio interview in which he said homosexuals should be  stoned to death.  Anderson also repeated his praise of the Pulse nightclub shooter. While he says he doesn t advocate violence, the victims were  disgusting homosexuals who the Bible says are worthy of death, the Bible says the government should put them to death, so why would I be sad if these horrible people died that the Bible says should die anyway. Anderson told his interviewer, who pointed out that the Bible supports slavery, that while he doesn t believe the Bible condones slavery (it does),  if it did then yes I would condone it  because  the Bible is always right and I am not smarter than God. In the past, Anderson has blamed the terrorist attacks in France earlier this year on the country s acceptance of  f*ggots, has called the Orlando massacre  good news  because a bunch of  f*ggots  died (he later expanded on that by adding that  perfect Christians  would  bathe  in the blood of the slaughtered innocents while singing praise to God), has prayed for the death of President Obama and asked God to rip out Caitlyn Jenner s heart and even suggested executing every gay person in the world  to cure AIDS.

According to Politico, the Clinton brain trust is considering offering Biden one of the most important roles in her administration if she wins the election. Joe Biden is at the top of the internal short list Hillary Clinton s transition team is preparing for her pick to be secretary of state, a source familiar with the planning tells POLITICO.This would be the first major Cabinet candidate to go public for a campaign that s insisted its focus remains on winning the election, and perhaps the most central choice for a potential president who was a secretary of state herself. The report indicates that a formal offer of the position has not been discussed yet between Biden and Clinton.Biden has years of experience with foreign policy, including time leading the Foreign Relations Committee when he was a U.S. Senator from Delaware, and he has been one of President Obama s closest advisors on the topic while serving as Vice President.Biden considered running for President this year, and some polls indicated he would have been a strong challenger to Clinton. After the death of his son Beau, he decided against the campaign and has endorsed Clinton. His speech in favor of Clinton at the Democratic Convention in Philadelphia was one of the highlights of the event.He has been holding campaign events on her behalf and is among the all-star team of surrogates including the President, First Lady Michelle Obama, and Senator Bernie Sanders that are promoting Clinton s campaign.Biden has also dedicated himself to leading the so-called  moon shot  project to cure cancer, a position that President Obama announced for him during his final State of the Union address.Featured image via Flickr\"],[\"As one of the most approachable presidents in history, President Donald Trump didn t hesitate to partake in a picture when two kids approached and asked for a photo. He s seen smiling in between a brother and sister duo in the picture. As soon as the photo hit the Internet, everyone noticed one shocking thing in it.The photo looks like every other fan shot out there, with two beaming children who happened to get the opportunity to meet the president. However, it s now gone viral after viewers realized who the children were and why their paths had crossed with the president s.Elijah and Gianna Lucas live in Fresno, California but were in Washington, D.C. on Monday to attend a ceremony in honor of National Peace Officers  Memorial Day. Like thousands of others, they sat in the crowd and listened to our Commander-in-Chief speak about the importance of police work in America and the sacrifice it often is, which has gone without recognition for eight years under Barack Obama. Trump not only showed deep appreciation for the men and women in law enforcement but their families as well, many of whom are left to pick up the pieces after losing their hero in the line of duty.While Obama routinely recognized thugs shot by cops and incited riots around it, Trump does just the opposite in addressing the senseless loss of life by those who work to serve and protect everyone and mentions them by name. This means more to Elijah and Gianna than it does for most since these siblings are two of five in their family who are now growing up without their father, who died while on duty on October 31, 2016. President Trump holds Fresno County Sheriff s Sgt. Rod Lucas  sheriff s identification card as he poses with Lucas  children, Elijah and Gianna Lucas, at the Capitol in Washington, D.C.I don t recall Obama ever announcing his condolences when an officer of the law was killed, let alone take time to meet personally with their families and take a selfie with their children. He did this for thugs  moms seeking vengeance in their criminal child s death by cop but refused to give the same attention and respect where it really belongs   on the true victims.What s seen in this shot of the president with Fresno officer Sgt. Rod Lucas  kids is a genuine joy that the Trump had to be a part of this day for them, to personally tell them that their dad was a hero who is appreciated for his service. Lucas died an accidental death at the hands of one of his law enforcement colleagues on October 31, 2016. They were shifting guns around, talking about different ways to carry a second gun, when a gun was accidentally discharged, and a bullet struck Lucas in the chest,  Breitbart reports.  Investigators determined no foul play was involved. Rather, Lucas, a 20-year-veteran of the force, was  having a conversation with a nine-year veteran detective about the various ways to carry backup weapons when the shot was fired . In years past during Police Week, families and children of fallen officers didn t get the recognition they deserved from our president. Now that Trump is in office, he s more than making up for that lost time under Obama and ensuring children who woke up to bad news that their mom or dad wasn t coming home, feel that they aren t forgotten.In an incredible moment at the same event on Monday, held in front of the U.S. Capitol in D.C., Trump turned his speech to a 6-year-old boy named Micah, who he saw in the audience. Micah had lost his officer father in a shootout he was involved in while on the job in Phoenix, Arizona. Trump wanted to give him something special and personal and did so by tossing the boy his hat he had under the podium, which he was saving for himself to wear after the event until he found a far better use for it.Until Trump took office, the presidency was more concerned about disarming our officers and sympathizing with the families of thugs who died in the commission of a crime. Whenever a cop was killed, the past president wouldn t have even addressed it. However, that era officially ended on Monday when Trump posed for a selfie with two fatherless kids and tossed his hat to this little boy before saying,  I want you to know that patriotic Americans of all backgrounds truly support and love our police. \"],[\" Republicans have been furious with Donald Trump lately. He blindsided them by ditching House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI), and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), for Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-NY), now dubbed his new friends,  Chuck and Nancy.  However, Bill Maher, host of HBO s Real Time, seems to think that there is a very simple answer to this: Trump relates to  Chuck and Nancy  because he has the big city life in common with them. Using the children s book  The Town Mouse and the Country Mouse  to illustrate his point, Maher says: Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi, they re city mice, and that s who a consummate New Yorker like Donald Trump relates to. Maher then goes on to say that, prior to running for the presidency as a Republican, Trump  would never be caught dead hanging around with a traveling Bible salesman like Paul Ryan, or a corny, countrified goober like Mitch McConnell. For Christ s sakes the man is from Kentucky. Jeff Sessions is from Alabama. When he talks, all Trump hears is a tiny little Earnest movie. Maher then takes on Vice President Mike Pence, saying: And Mike Pence? It must be torture for Trump to be in the White House every day with that homespun, Christian, tightly wound human hard on. He literally won t dine with an unchaperoned woman. Meanwhile, Trump has spent his entire life posing with a shit-eating grin that says look at all the pussy I m getting. At the end of the monologue, Maher gives a brutal message to so-called  Real Americans: I hate to break it to you, but what Trump likes about Chuck and Nancy, is that they re not you. This is absolutely true. Before running for president, Donald Trump was a typical New York Democrat. He doesn t give a shit about social issues or religion, and he sure as hell doesn t give a shit about the fools who put him in office. His own kids couldn t vote for him in New York s GOP primary because they were registered as Democrats. He s given bunches of money to Democratic politicians for years. Trump is no Republican. He just knew he could play that side of the aisle for fools, when he d never have had a chance running as a Democrat.Furthermore, Trump would never be caught dead hanging with any of the people who voted for him.

Before any apparent reaction from Carnegay, Officer King begins beating him repeatedly with his baton. Carnage hits the deck without retaliating.The beating was so severe that Officer King broke two bones in Carnegay s leg and ruptured an artery. He needed to be hospitalized and have a titanium rod implanted in his leg. He also remained handcuffed throughout his time at hospital, despite being the victim and not the perpetrator of an attack.He was later charged with simple battery against police and willful obstruction of law enforcement officers   and jailed for three days.It wasn t until the video of the attack was produced, along with the receipt for Carnegay s purchase of the tomato (which was in his pocket the entire time), that Carnegay was released and the charges dropped.Had Officer King simply asked him to produce the receipt before attacking Carnegay, the matter would have been cleared up in a moments. He is now taking up legal proceedings against local law enforcement for the injuries he sustained in the brutal attack. He told WSB-TV: As he s grabbing me, he s beating me at the same time, [saying]  Get on the ground, Beating me at the same time. Carnegay s attorney, Craig Jones added: The officer went into Robocop mode and beat the crap out of him, Officer King needed only to ask a simple question of Tyrone Carnegay, to establish whether or not he had purchased the tomato.

Politico revealed that Priebus is worried made-up stories from alt-right news sites are impacting Trump s already-shaky decision-making abilities.But it s unclear whether or not it s working since Trump seems to go out of his way to get the fake news he wants from Twitter and delivered by other staffers.The situation in the Oval Office is bad enough that Priebus has tried to put controls in place, but there s no way to stop the president. Trump s overarching narcissism and inflated ego means that he only wants to read and watch things that reinforce his point of view.One of the best examples of Trump s fake news addiction is the way that he parrots Fox s cringeworthy morning show, Fox and Friends.

Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 3\"],[\"Trump s young administration is fraught with trouble, but we all knew that already. Most of us probably haven t thought of just how to frame Trump s behavior since assuming the White House, but an enterprising writer at the Washington Post just did. Eugene Robinson, an opinion writer for the Post, wrote an entire op-ed based around the following question: Does Trump know he s president? Well, does he? One of the things that Robinson points to as evidence that he doesn t, or, at least, doesn t know what he s doing at all, is the fact that we had a bunch of government executives tell Europe, tell Iraq, even tell the U.N., not to listen to what Trump says. For instance, he said we re going to take Iraq s oil. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis told the press in Baghdad that we were absolutely not there to do that.U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley said that we absolutely support a two-state solution after Trump said we didn t. Mike Pence told NATO that we re fully devoted to them, after Trump has said repeatedly that NATO is obsolete and wants to cozy up to Russia.He said that rounding up undocumented immigrants is  a military operation,  which supposedly means a  non-military operation,  and he was just using  military  as an adjective, according to Sean Spicer.Not mentioned in Robinson s article is Trump s neverending Twitter temper tantrum, though he does mention Trump s feud with the press.  There s also the fact that Trump loves hobnobbing with his rich buddies in Florida, to the point where he had a meeting on North Korea in plain view of his VIPs, who pay him a ton of money. He won t divest from his businesses, which is creating massive conflicts of interest and may even be in violation of the Constitution.He rushed out his Muslim ban and the courts promptly halted it, and we have to wonder if he even consulted with anyone knowledgeable about the law with that. The 9th Circuit just rejected the Justice Department s request to put that case on hold pending a new order.So when the Post has to ask if Trump even knows he s president, we have to wonder the same thing. We also have to assume that Trump will be pissed if he hears about this op-ed because it makes him look like the buffoon he is, and he already hates the Post. Not as much as The New York Times or CNN, but he hates them enough.

In another of his strange post-election rallies, Trump brought up the topic of black voter turnout, and then proceeded to say that one set of blacks are not as good as another.President-elect Donald Trump claimed Friday night that African Americans came through for him  big league  in the November election and said those who stayed home were  almost as good  as those who voted for him.Trump s comments came during a rally in Grand Rapids, Mich., the latest stop on an ongoing  thank you  tour of states where the Republican prevailed against Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.As has been the trend for decades, Trump was trounced among black voters who voted for Clinton by a margin of 89 percent to 8 percent. It s an almost-standard part of Republican rhetoric to ignore the lopsided vote among this key set of Americans instead of denigrating the choices this group of citizens has made at the ballot box.During the campaign, Trump also generated a backlash among black voters, describing the black community as crime-ridden and uneducated, while telling black voters they had  nothing to lose  by voting for him. A vast majority of them evidently rejected his message, perhaps in large part coming from his decision to woo white supremacist support while also supporting the racist birther conspiracy against President Obama.While Clinton did not get as strong a turnout with black voters as Obama did, she earned enough of their vote to end up with a popular vote victory over Trump, leading him by 2.7 million votes and making him the second Republican in 20 years to win the presidency without getting most of the votes.Perhaps if Trump was less flippant or dismissive with black voters, his party would be competitive in that arena instead of the constant routs.Featured image via Flickr\"],[\" Persuasion is so important The Resistance has to become a church a church that seeks converts Huh???

When you think about 2017, I think resistance was incredibly important, frankly, from my point of view. This president shattered every Democratic norm that people on both sides take for granted,  he alleged.  But if the movement that has done such a good job in 2017 at protecting our institutions only protects our institutions, I think they are going to miss an opportunity. The plan for progressives, Giridharadas argues, should be to take the resistance movement to people who allegedly don t like them, tell those folks their way of thinking is wrong, and convince them to join forces against the president. The same president who just cut their taxes.Notice how not one person on the panel refuted what he said! No fair and balanced here!\"],[\"Try to process this: A woman running for President of The United States (whose entire career has been built on lies and deceit) has a  charity  that has now been placed on a  watch list  as a way to warn potential donors about investing in the Clinton Foundation The Clinton Foundation s finances are so messy that the nation s most influential charity watchdog put it on its  watch list  of problematic nonprofits last month. The Clinton family s mega-charity took in more than $140 million in grants and pledges in 2013 but spent just $9 million on direct aid. The group spent the bulk of its windfall on administration, travel, and salaries and bonuses, with the fattest payouts going to family friends. On its 2013 tax forms, the most recent available, the foundation claimed it spent $30 million on payroll and employee benefits; $8.7 million in rent and office expenses; $9.2 million on  conferences, conventions and meetings ; $8 million on fund-raising; and nearly $8.5 million on travel. None of the Clintons are on the payroll, but they do enjoy first-class flights paid for by the Foundation. In all, the group reported $84.6 million in  functional expenses  on its 2013 tax return and had more than $64 million left over   money the organization has said represents pledges rather than actual cash on hand. Some of the tens of millions in administrative costs finance more than 2,000 employees, including aid workers and health professionals around the world. But that s still far below the 75 percent rate of spending that nonprofit experts say a good charity should spend on its mission. Charity Navigator, which rates nonprofits, recently refused to rate the Clinton Foundation because its  atypical business model . . . doesn t meet our criteria.  Charity Navigator put the foundation on its  watch list,  which warns potential donors about investing in problematic charities. The 23 charities on the list include the Rev. Al Sharpton s troubled National Action Network, which is cited for failing to pay payroll taxes for several years. Other nonprofit experts are asking hard questions about the Clinton Foundation s tax filings in the wake of recent reports that the Clintons traded influence for donations.  It seems like the Clinton Foundation operates as a slush fund for the Clintons,  said Bill Allison, a senior fellow at the Sunlight Foundation, a government watchdog group once run by leading progressive Democrat and Fordham Law professor Zephyr Teachout. In July 2013, Eric Braverman, a friend of Chelsea Clinton from when they both worked at McKinsey & Co., took over as CEO of the Clinton Foundation. He took home nearly $275,000 in salary, benefits and a housing allowance from the nonprofit for just five months  work in 2013, tax filings show. Less than a year later, his salary increased to $395,000, according to a report in Politico. Braverman abruptly left the foundation earlier this year, after a falling-out with the old Clinton guard over reforms he wanted to impose at the charity, Politico reported. Last month, Donna Shalala, a former secretary of health and human services under President Clinton, was hired to replace Braverman. Nine other executives received salaries over $100,000 in 2013, tax filings show. The group also failed to disclose millions of dollars it received in foreign donations from 2010 to 2012 and is hurriedly refiling five years  worth of tax returns after reporters raised questions about the discrepancies in its filings last week.Via: NY Post\"],[\"Hillary has been stirring up the hateful movement Obama, Eric Holder and Al Sharpton started years ago, as a means to encourage blacks to come out to the polls on her behalf on November 8th.

It made the announcement shortly before Washington said it was suspending talks with Russia on trying to end the violence in Syria.The plutonium accord is not the cornerstone of post-Cold War U.S.-Russia disarmament, and the practical implications from the suspension will be limited. But the suspension, and the linkage to disagreements on other issues, carries powerful symbolism.Read more: Reuters\"],[\"Libertarian presidential candidate Gary Johnson has been seen as an alternative to Donald Trump for many Republicans and other right-leaning types who can t stomach their own party s nominee and don t want to vote for Hillary Clinton. However, that prospect likely just went right out the window for many people after a Thursday morning question that revealed Johnson s ignorance when it comes to foreign policy.Johnson appeared on MSNBC s Morning Joe, and when asked about what he would do about Aleppo, he actually asked,  What is Aleppo? Veteran columnist and frequent Morning Joe panelist Mike Barnacle looked at Johnson with the rest of the panel, visibly stunned. He responded,  You re kidding.  Johnson said, with a blank stare,  No. In case anyone here is as clueless as Gary Johnson is on this matter, Aleppo is the largest city in Syria, and the heart of the refugee crisis. It s the source of all of those heartbreaking images of children of war that have been ripping all of our hearts out. It s where the battle for Syria is being waged. It s essentially the epicenter of the war that ISIS is waging. To have a person who wishes to be President of the United States and Commander-in-Chief of our military not know these basic facts is not only breathtaking in its ignorance, but also disqualifying.In other words, just like Donald Trump, Gary Johnson is far too ignorant of world affairs to be considered for the position he seeks. Out of the viable candidates for the White House, the only person who has the knowledge of world affairs and policy issues to actually be able to effectively do the job is Hillary Clinton.

Obama is a liar His reckless and amateur decisions have made America more unsafe than we have ever been. Now he s asking Americans to vote for Hillary to ensure his lawless legacy lives on The Obama administration secretly organized an airlift of $400 million worth of cash to Iran that coincided with the January release of four Americans detained in Tehran, according to U.S. and European officials and congressional staff briefed on the operation afterward.Wooden pallets stacked with euros, Swiss francs and other currencies were flown into Iran on an unmarked cargo plane, according to these officials. The U.S. procured the money from the central banks of the Netherlands and Switzerland, they said.The money represented the first installment of a $1.7 billion settlement the Obama administration reached with Iran to resolve a decades-old dispute over a failed arms deal signed just before the 1979 fall of Iran s last monarch, Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.The settlement, which resolved claims before an international tribunal in The Hague, also coincided with the formal implementation that same weekend of the landmark nuclear agreement reached between Tehran, the U.S. and other global powers the summer before. With the nuclear deal done, prisoners released, the time was right to resolve this dispute as well,  President Barack Obama said at the White House on Jan. 17 without disclosing the $400 million cash payment.Senior U.S. officials denied any link between the payment and the prisoner exchange. They say the way the various strands came together simultaneously was coincidental, not the result of any quid pro quo. As we ve made clear, the negotiations over the settlement of an outstanding claim were completely separate from the discussions about returning our American citizens home,  State Department spokesman John Kirby said.  Not only were the two negotiations separate, they were conducted by different teams on each side, including, in the case of The Hague claims, by technical experts involved in these negotiations for many years. But U.S. officials also acknowledge that Iranian negotiators on the prisoner exchange said they wanted the cash to show they had gained something tangible.Sen. Tom Cotton, a Republican from Arkansas and a fierce foe of the Iran nuclear deal, accused President Barack Obama of paying  a $1.7 billion ransom to the ayatollahs for U.S. hostages. This break with longstanding U.S. policy put a price on the head of Americans, and has led Iran to continue its illegal seizures  of Americans, he said.Since the cash shipment, the intelligence arm of the Revolutionary Guard has arrested two more Iranian-Americans. Tehran has also detained dual-nationals from France, Canada and the U.K. in recent months.At the time of the prisoner release, Secretary of State John Kerry and the White House portrayed it as a diplomatic breakthrough. Mr. Kerry cited the importance of  the relationships forged and the diplomatic channels unlocked over the course of the nuclear talks. For entire story: Wall Street JournalAs a bonus, here is Rep.

As expected, he completely blew it and humiliated America once again.Earlier that day, German leader Angela Merkel had spoken at NATO HQ, where she took a shot at Trump when she said it wasn t the  building of walls that makes us successful.  Merkel and Trump already have a rocky relationship, as America s unworthy POTUS has publicly disrespected Merkel several times. Trump had responded by criticizing NATO for not putting enough money toward defense, but apparently he didn t get it all out of his system. While in Brussels, Trump continued to lash out at Merkel with his usual childish behavior and went off on a disgusting rant against the Germans.German publication Der Spiegel reported that as Trump spoke to EU Commissioner Jean-Claude Juncker and European Council President Donald Tusk, Trump further damaged America s standing with Germany by saying this: The Germans are bad, very bad. Trump also promised to put an end to German car sales in the United States: Look at the millions of cars they sell in the US, and we ll stop that. Junker tried to explain to incompetent Trump that free trade was beneficial, and EU attendees expressed concern that Trump actually had no idea how EU trade agreements actually worked, and that America couldn t isolate Germany in negotiations.Overall, Trump s statements about Germany were extremely embarrassing and a pathetic response driven by Trump s fragile ego. It couldn t be more clear that Trump has no idea what he s doing as POTUS, and has even less awareness about how America s relations with other parts of the world really work. Every time he meets with world leaders, he shames our country and his first overseas trip couldn t be better proof of that.Featured image via Sean Gallup \\u002f Getty Images\"],[\"We ve all seen pictures of the Trumps in their home surrounded by tacky gold decor, complete with their young son Barron in a suit with toys in front of him while he stares at the camera off to the side of his parents. It s a life most of us can never imagine while we re paying our monthly bills. So what s it like growing up with Donald Trump as a father? According to Scott Melker, a former classmate of Donald Trump Jr. s, at the University of Pennsylvania, being the former reality show star s son wasn t what one might imagine. Or, given Trump s temperament, it might be exactly what you d imagine.On Facebook, Mekler told of the animosity Trump s son had for this father. I was hanging out in a freshman dorm with some friends, next door to Donald Jr. s room. I walked out of the room to find Donald Trump at his son s door, there to pick him up for a baseball game,  he recalls.  There were quite a few students standing around watching, trying to catch a glimpse of the famed real estate magnate. Don Jr. opened the door, wearing a Yankee jersey. Then Mekler told of the moment Trump slapped his son in the face in front of others. Without saying a word, his father slapped him across the face, knocking him to the floor in front of all of his classmates. He simply said  put on a suit and meet me outside,  and closed the door,  Melker wrote. Donald Jr. was a drunk in college. Every memory I have of him is of him stumbling around campus falling over or passing out in public, with his arm in a sling from injuring himself while drinking,  he continued.  He absolutely despised his father, and hated the attention that his last name afforded him. His nickname was  Diaper Don,  because of his tendency to fall asleep drunk in other people s beds and urinate.   I always felt terrible for him,  he continued.Mekler said part of his reason for voting for Hillary Clinton is because  in light of what I saw that day, it is clear to me that Donald Trump lacks the temperament and basic social decency to run our country. To be clear, we are not demonizing Trump s son for having an alleged drinking problem during his college days. Whether Melker s story is accurate or not, we re not sure, but given Trump s awful temper, it s difficult to discount it.Photo by Saul Loeb-Pool via Getty.\"],[\"We ve become so accustomed to Donald Trump s Twitter rants that hardly anyone pays attention anymore. His formula for a social media  battle  is simple: If you make fun of or disagree with Donald Trump in any way he will attack you on Twitter.

Even Barack Hussein Obama must be surprised by how few hurdles have been placed in his way In less than 24 hours, our leftist US Supreme Court delivered not one, but two sucker punches to the heart of America. The acts of these radical judicial activists will have a dramatic effect on our society and culture in the United States of America.    The Supreme Court declared Friday that same-sex couples have a right to marry anywhere in the United States.Gay and lesbian couples already could marry in 36 states and the District of Columbia. The court s 5-4 ruling means the remaining 14 states, in the South and Midwest, will have to stop enforcing their bans on same-sex marriage.The outcome is the culmination of two decades of Supreme Court litigation over marriage, and gay rights generally. Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote the majority opinion, just as he did in the court s previous three major gay rights cases dating back to 1996. It came on the anniversary of two of those earlier decisions. No union is more profound than marriage,  Kennedy wrote, joined by the court s four more liberal justices.The four dissenting justices each filed a separate opinion explaining their views. But this court is not a legislature. Whether same-sex marriage is a good idea should be of no concern to us,  Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in dissent. Roberts read a summary of his dissent from the bench, the first time he has done so in nearly 10 years as chief justice.Justice Antonin Scalia said he is not concerned so much about same-sex marriage, but about  this court s threat to American democracy.  Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas also dissented.The ruling will not take effect immediately because the court gives the losing side roughly three weeks to ask for reconsideration. But some state officials and county clerks might decide there is little risk in issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples.The cases before the court involved laws from Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio and Tennessee that define marriage as the union of a man and a woman. Those states have not allowed same-sex couples to marry within their borders and they also have refused to recognize valid marriages from elsewhere.Just two years ago, the Supreme Court struck down part of the federal anti-gay marriage law that denied a range of government benefits to legally married same-sex couples.The decision in United States v. Windsor did not address the validity of state marriage bans, but courts across the country, with few exceptions, said its logic compelled them to invalidate state laws that prohibited gay and lesbian couples from marrying.The number of states allowing same-sex marriage has grown rapidly. As recently as October, just over one-third of the states permitted same-sex marriage.There are an estimated 390,000 married same-sex couples in the United States, according to UCLA s Williams Institute, which tracks the demographics of gay and lesbian Americans. Another 70,000 couples living in states that do not currently permit them to wed would get married in the next three years, the institute says. Roughly 1 million same-sex couples, married and unmarried, live together in the United States, the institute says.Via: AP News \"],[\"Donald Trump is a clear and present threat to the United States of America. That fact is indisputable at this point; after all, a Senator in his own party just said so in strikingly blunt terms. However, the GOP-controlled House has been silent on Trump s dangerous antics, because they fear his lighting them up on Twitter, and they also fear retaliation by his crazy base at the ballot box. But it seems that Rep. Al Green (D- TX) has had enough.On Wednesday afternoon, Rep. Green took the floor of the House of Representatives and formally introduced Articles of Impeachment against Trump. Green began: I rise today on behalf of the many who have concluded that enough is enough. Green went on to say that Trump s being in the White House is is fueling an alt-right hate machine,  which is currently  causing immediate injury to American society.  On top of that, Green introduced his Articles as  privileged,  meaning  that the House needs to take them up within the next two days.Now, obviously this will go nowhere. Those craven Republicans don t care that Trump is destroying the country, just as long as they get every bigoted right-wing fever dream they ve had for the last eight years codified into law, with a few tax cuts for rich people thrown in, oh, just for fun.In short, these Republicans KNOW that Trump is unfit, and could even land us in a nuclear holocaust if he can t be kept away from the nuclear codes. In fact, at this point, any responsible person will do what was done to President Nixon in his final days, when he reportedly was drinking heavily and wandering the halls of the White House conversing with portraits of dead presidents. At that time, Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and soon-to-be President Gerald Ford insisted that those responsible for launching nuclear weapons went through them rather than Nixon, because they knew Nixon to be dangerous.General John Kelly, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, and other adults in the room had better be doing the same with Trump, who is MUCH more dangerous than Nixon ever dreamed of being.Please, someone show some courage in the Republican House and go along with Rep.

In the letter published by the Huffington Post, the professors stated that they had  grave concern  about Trump s erratic behavior. They wrote: We are writing to express our grave concern regarding the mental stability of our President-Elect. Professional standards do not permit us to venture a diagnosis for a public figure whom we have not evaluated personally.His widely reported symptoms of mental instability   including grandiosity, impulsivity, hypersensitivity to slights or criticism, and an apparent inability to distinguish between fantasy and reality   lead us to question his fitness for the immense responsibilities of the office. We strongly recommend that, in preparation for assuming these responsibilities, he receive a full medical and neuropsychiatric evaluation by an impartial team of investigators. This letter is just a drop in the bucket, as questions about Trump s mental stability and personality have been raised since the beginning of his presidential campaign and are now becoming increasingly common as he continues to break down under the pressure. The mental states of Trump s followers have also been questioned.While the American Psychiatric Association has warned that its members should not try to diagnose Trump with mental illnesses from afar, this letter to Obama is stating a perfectly reasonable concern. Trump has acted out in ways that are unprecedented to any presidential candidate or future President of the United States. There is no question that Trump is unqualified to be President based on his lack of experience alone   but further evaluation might prove that it would be unhealthy for him to proceed in leading the country.Featured image via screenshot\"],[\"The Genie is out of the bottle. Europe will never be the same.

They are economic migrants with no more right to be called European citizens than anybody else in the world. Even Frans Timmermans, Vice President of the European Commission, made this point this week. In his accounting, at least 60pc of the people who are here are economic migrants who should not be here   are from North African states such as Morocco and Tunisia. As he told Dutch television:- These are people that you can assume have no reason to apply for refugee status. Swedish officials are coming to a similar conclusion, saying that as many as 80,000 of the mainly young men who have gone to Sweden as  refugees  in the past year alone are no such thing.Now there are the usual attempts to crowd-please from certain politicians and officials who are talking about how they might have to deport these people. But they won t, will they? Does anybody honestly believe that the Swedish authorities are currently preparing to deport 80,000 fake asylum seekers from their country?Or let us assume that the 60pc figure is correct for Germany and that 60pc of the people who have arrived in Germany in the past year alone should not be there. Given that it has taken in more than a million people in the last twelve months, is Germany now going to deport as many as three quarters of a million fake asylum seekers from its territory? Of course not. They will not even attempt it. Everybody in Europe knows that. And everybody following events and weighing up their chances from outside Europe knows that.Everybody on earth now knows that Europe s present leaders lack either the will or the means to enforce their own laws. So more people will come next year, and the year after that and the year after that. All in the knowledge that once you re in, you re in. If the facts were otherwise then Sweden, Germany and other countries across the continent would currently be preparing to ship hundreds of thousands of people out of Europe and back to their countries of origin. But they re not.And so the numbers coming in will increase, and the politicians will keep posing, and the European peoples will rightly get more and more enraged at the fact that their continent is being taken away from them. Eventually perhaps even the constant bogeyman warnings about the  far-right  will lose their capacity to scare. Not good times ahead, I d say.

The media has almost uniformly ignored the flurry of bombshells, preferring to devote its front pages to the Trump story. So let s review what amounts to a devastating case against a Clinton presidency.Start with a June 2015 email to Clinton staffers from Erika Rottenberg, the former general counsel of LinkedIn. Ms. Rottenberg wrote that none of the attorneys in her circle of friends  can understand how it was viewed as ok\\u002fsecure\\u002fappropriate to use a private server for secure documents AND why further Hillary took it upon herself to review them and delete documents.  She added:  It smacks of acting above the law and it smacks of the type of thing I ve either gotten discovery sanctions for, fired people for, etc. A few months later, in a September 2015 email, a Clinton confidante fretted that Mrs. Clinton was too bullheaded to acknowledge she d done wrong.  Everyone wants her to apologize,  wrote Neera Tanden, president of the liberal Center for American Progress.  And she should. Apologies are like her Achilles  heel. Clinton staffers debated how to evade a congressional subpoena of Mrs. Clinton s emails three weeks before a technician deleted them. The campaign later employed a focus group to see if it could fool Americans into thinking the email scandal was part of the Benghazi investigation (they are separate) and lay it all off as a Republican plot.Read more: WSJ\"],[\"The truth about the air strike on Syria.SHARE: https:\\u002f\\u002ft.co\\u002fABMiasgK6D pic.twitter.com\\u002feoEjPeb5w7  Paul Joseph Watson (@PrisonPlanet) April 8, 2017Watson argues that half of Trumps advisors are CFR globalists and that he has NOT yet drained the swamp.Watson also claims the airbase that was bombed was actually protected a nearby Christian town from being overrun by jihadists. He claims that that town will now be taken over by jihadists, and that the air strike on the air base only cleared the way from them to move in and take over.Watson also questions why Assad would have used chemicals to attack his own people when it would be completely self-defeating?

Scaramucci called Priebus a  paranoid schizophrenic  in an interview President Trump viewed as inappropriate, according to White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders.Kellyanne Conway would be a perfect choice for President Trump s new communications director. Conway is no stranger to dealing with the press. She is also no pushover. Conway has taken on almost every liberal hack at every leftist network in America, and each time she s walked away holding her head high, as she make her points in an eloquent but no holds barred way.Chris Cuomo of fake news network CNN interviewed Kellyanne Conway on Sunday. You would have thought by now, these hacks at CNN would have figured out they are no match for the brilliant Kellyanne Conway. At the opening of his interview with Conway, Cuomo attempted to convince the few viewers who still watch CNN that President Trump was  very squishy  on his meeting with Vladimir Putin. Kellyanne Conway snapped back in her usual calm but witty way,  Chris, let s back up. So you re saying you used the word squishy which, itself, is unusual to describe the president s state of mind. So somehow that makes people on CNN insist that the president is never going to raise this with Putin? Why are they still in there?  Cuomo responded,  It s not about CNN. It s about what the president said, Kellyanne.  Kellyanne immediately landed a right hook to fake news host Chris Cuomo when she asked him,  Aren t you the least bit reluctant, if not embarrassed that you now talk about Russia more than you talk about America? Watch the brilliant exchange here:Conway, currently a counselor to the president, served as Trump s campaign manager and was previously a Republican pollster. She currently is a visible face of the Trump administration through her frequent appearances on cable news and is often relied on by the White House to deliver its message to the press.

We also all know that Trump wouldn t be saying a damn thing if he were confident that possible recounts didn t have a hope in hell of overturning the election results. Regardless, where in the name of all that s profane is he getting this idea that millions of illegal votes were cast?Trump is a conspiracy theorist. He believes people like Alex Jones. And Alex Jones is probably the most prominent person to  report  on these supposedly illegal votes right now. According to Politifact, about six days after the election, InfoWars published a story with a headline that reading:  Report: 3 Million Votes in Presidential Election Cast by Illegal Aliens. That s a rather serious claim to make. This is Alex Jones, though, so wondering if he has legitimate supporting evidence for that claim is pointless. He actually got his number from a pair of tweets from Gregg Phillips, the founder of VoteStand. VoteStand is a voter-fraud detection app, and he says he s gone through 180 million voter registrations and found 3 million  non-citizens  on the rolls:Completed analysis of database of 180 million voter registrations.Number of non-citizen votes exceeds 3 million.Consulting legal team.

Despite being heavily out funded by Governor Cuomo, who received millions of dollars in campaign contributions from corporations and wealthy interests, Ms. Teachout received 34 percent of the vote, including winning many counties in the state, including Albany County, home of the state s capital. Although she lost, her campaign, the first she ever ran, was a blow to the myth that elected officials, particularly incumbents, are invincible in elections from their own political party.In January 2016, Ms. Teachout, currently as Associate Law Professor at Fordham University, announced she is running for New York s 19th Congressional District seat. I m running to raise up the voice that people have been shut out of politics. I think you can see across the political spectrum people are really frustrated by congress, and by politics that are increasingly driven by big money,  said Ms. Teachout in a phone interview.Ms. Teachout cited as one of the broad issues she plans to tackle in congress, is campaign finance reform, especially in regards to overturning the SCOTUS Citizens United ruling in 2010. I ve already been working in the last several years to promote Congressman John Sarbanes  (D-MD) bill, which is basically modeled off of the public financing system in New York City,  she said.  Congress unfortunately is trapped by congress members having to spend 50 percent of their time raising money. A public financing system like what Congressman Sarbanes has proposed, The Government by The People Act, would allow congress members to raise money from small donors and still have enough to reach all the voters. I think shutting down the revolving door between lobbyists and government is essential. In tandem to the issue of campaign financing being overhauled by corporations, the Trans-Pacific Partnership has received a lot of criticism from Republicans, Independents, and Democrats, including Ms. Teachout, for heavily favoring corporations and handing to them unprecedented leverage over governments. The TPP is a continuation of NAFTA ad even worse than NAFTA,  said Ms. Teachout.  Instead of changing direction and building towards a 21st century trade policy, the TPP doubles down on failed trade policy. Negotiations over Trans-Pacific Partnership between the United States and 11 other countries began during the Bush administration, and has been pushed by the Obama administration. Both Democratic Presidential candidates, Hillary Clinton, and Bernie Sanders have opposed the agreement, while Republican Presidential Candidates have expressed mixed feelings over it, with Donald Trump and Ted Cruz against it, but Governor Kasich in favor. Ms. Teachout added: I m actually quite hopeful we are going to stop it. I think a year ago you would have said  the big guns have this locked down , but there has been a truly extraordinary swelling of grassroots energy from Republicans, Democrats, and Independents all across the board against it. People are saying this is the wrong direction, we actually want more made in America, we want to buy locally owned goods and we want to be making law through a democratic process. One of the real problems of the TPP for me is it shuts you out of the process, and that is fundamental. Instead of making policy through congress which has its own problems, its making policy in the backroom, and that s no way to make international or basic economic policy in our country. New York s 19th Congressional District includes Sullivan, Ulster, Delaware, Otsego, Schoharie, Greene and Columbia Counties and parts of Montgomery, Rensselaer and Dutchess Counties. Current Representative of the district, Republican Chris Gibson announced he is retiring, leaving the seat wide open. Ms. Teachout is currently a favorite to win, she won almost every county in the district against Governor Cuomo in 2014. In the Democratic Primaries, she faces challenges from John Kehoe, a 29-year-old self-described moderate Democrat who runs a recording studio in the Hudson Valley, and Will Yandik, a town councilman from Columbia County, though popular consensus in the district s local Democratic Parties favor Ms. Teachout, according to the Poughkeepsie Journal.The Democratic Primaries take place on June 28th, 2016. On the Republican side, it will be a toss-up mainly between Andrew Heaney, a small businessman and graduate from Harvard Business School, and John Faso, a former New York State Assemblyman. Mr. Faso, who has hired Bill O Reilly as a communications consultant, has criticized Heaney for donating to President Obama s 2008 campaign. Mr. Heaney has also been accused of illegally coordinating with a Super-Pac he created, the New York Jobs Council.As progressivism has made its mark on the 2016 presidential election from the popularity of Senator Bernie Sanders  campaign, it has inspired progressive candidates across the country to run for office on similar platforms. Ms. Teachout s advice for those progressive candidates who are standing up to make their mark in a primary against an establishment backed candidate, as she did in 2014 against Governor Andrew Cuomo; spend as much time as you can on the ground listening to people, not in a closed room listening to donors. There s an extraordinary strength in the deep American grassroots and it s pretty exciting to see what could happen if you put a lot more trust in people.

Rosenstein. So, in an effort to move things along with Comey, he had them come to the White House.According to The Washington Post: The president already had decided to fire Comey, according to this person. But in the meeting, several White House officials said Trump gave Sessions and Rosenstein a directive: to explain in writing the case against Comey. And we all know what happened next. The memos were written by all parties and made public pretty fast. Faster than Comey could even become aware he was fired.Here s the thing, though. Deputy AG Rosenstein is pissed he s basically become the fall guy for Trump.WaPo reports: Rosenstein threatened to resign after the narrative emerging from the White House on Tuesday evening cast him as a prime mover of the decision to fire Comey and that the president acted only on his recommendation, said the person close to the White House, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter. You see, the narrative came out that Comey went to the Justice Department only days before he was fired requesting  more prosecutors and other personnel to accelerate the bureau s investigation into Russia s interference in the presidential election.  And this request was made to Rosenstein,  whose memo was used to justify Mr. Comey s abrupt dismissal on Tuesday. Now that Rosenstein is pissed, it s looking more and more likely that Trump may have planned it this way and made Rosenstein the fall guy for Comey s removal.The plot in this story of mayhem is definitely getting thicker and it will be interesting to see how things progress in the coming weeks and months.Featured Photo by Getty Images\"],[\"Make no mistake, the Muslim European invaders will not be satisfied until every woman in Europe is donning this head to ankle look on the beaches this summer. The radical Sharia Law adherents who have made the trek from some of the most radical Muslim countries in the world to the  accepting  shores of the EU are about to shake things up and it s going to be very ugly when that happens PARIS   Burkinis aren t showing up at the beaches on either side of the English Channel yet, but the thought that the full head-to-ankle swimsuit might catch on among Muslim women in Europe has already sparked lively debates in Britain and France.The modest Muslim beachwear, which looks like a loose-fitting wetsuit with a hoodie, has been around for about a decade. It has also been banned elsewhere, especially in public swimming pools in Europe and at some Moroccan beach resorts popular with foreign tourists.But most non-Muslims in Europe are only finding out about it now because the popular British department store chain Marks & Spencer has just launched its own burkini line in Europe to appeal to a growing niche market for  Islamic fashion,  combining modern design with Muslim principles of modesty.The arrival of burkinis in mainstream department stores has once again highlighted the differences between the pragmatic British approach toward multiculturalism and France s determined efforts to fend off any challenges to its official policies of secularism.There are about 2.7 million Muslims in Britain, or 4.5 percent of the population, and 5 million, or 8 percent of the population, in France.Marks & Spencer has stores across Europe, Asia and in the Middle East, where it has been selling burkinis for several years. Its online shop promotes two styles in English, French, German, Spanish and Dutch.House of Fraser, a rival British department store group, has come out with its own line. Both chains call the swimsuit burkini, a linguistic mashup of burka and bikini, but neither mentions religion in its advertising.In the  nation of shopkeepers,  as Napoleon is said to have called Britain, the burkini s defenders present it as a product that meets consumer demand.  We have sold this item for a number of years and it is popular with our customers internationally,  a Marks & Spencer spokeswoman said.The conservative tabloid Daily Mail called it  the ultimate proof Britain is truly multicultural  and noted that labels such as H&M, DKNY, Mango and Uniqlo had recently launched Muslim-themed fashion collections.Some critics decried the swimsuit as sexist; one asked why women had to  dress up like frogmen.  But others defended the right of Muslim women to choose.  If I want to buy a burkini from M&S, I bloody well will,  journalist Remona Aly wrote in an op-ed for the liberal Guardian newspaper.Across the channel in France, where the government worries about any sign that its Muslim minority is not fully adapting to the French way of life, the issue quickly escalated into political polemics that presented the burkini as the first step toward women s oppression and Muslim radicalism.Women s Rights Minister Laurence Rossignol said:  Sure, there are women who choose it, and there were American negroes who were for slavery.  She quickly apologized for using the word  negroes  but stood by her message.Advertisement (1 of 1): 0:09 Prominent feminist Elisabeth Badinter called for a boycott of shops that promote Islamic fashions. She said the French have forgotten their founding principle of equality for all, independent of faith, ethnicity or gender, and hesitate to criticize Muslims who stress their minority group status. We shouldn t be afraid of being called Islamophobes,  she argued. The French left has been too tolerant of Muslim communities that force their women to cover their hair and come up with novelties like the burkini, she said.Prime Minister Manuel Valls linked Muslim fashion to the strict Salafi movement, whose extreme fringe inspired the violent attacks in Paris last year, killing 147 people.At a conference on Monday, he said Muslim veils were not a fashion statement but  an enslavement of women  and declared that Salafism, which he described as a path to terrorism, might only represent 1 percent of French Muslims but was  winning the ideological and cultural battle  among them.Muslim community leaders complained that this tarred all Muslims with the terrorist brush, but their exasperated reactions got little coverage in the French media.Valls rarely speaks so bluntly about his concern that French society is being challenged by some of the country s Muslims who identify more as a discriminated religious minority than with the republic s universalist ideals of equality and secularism.Rooted in its 1789 revolution, these ideals have become France s civil religion, and they frame the stronger French reaction to Muslim issues from the more flexible treatment they get in Britain.The vigorous rejection of the burkini comes amid political tensions lingering from last year s bloody attacks.Only last week, President Fran ois Hollande had to abandon a tough law-and-order bill he and Valls suggested last November. The proposed law would have stripped French citizenship from terrorists who have a second passport, a small category of people who will be mostly Muslim immigrants.The conservative opposition and even important parts of his own Socialist Party rejected Hollande s plan.Air France touched this raw nerve recently when it advised stewardesses working on a newly reopened Paris-Tehran route that they would have to cover their hair and wear pants on arrival in Iran. Staff unions protested until the airline announced that only women who volunteer for the flights would be assigned to them.

Huntington Park is a city of opportunity and a city of hope for all individuals regardless of socioeconomic status, race, creed, or in this case, citizenship,  the councilman said in a statement.  Both these gentlemen have accomplished a great deal for the city. For that, on behalf of the city council, mayor, and our city, I want to say thank you to them both and I am confident they will do an excellent job on their commission posts.

Other commissioners receive a $75 monthly stipend on months when they hold meetings.Coming the same year that California allowed residents to apply for a driver s license, regardless of immigration status, this move is the latest in an effort to recognize an increasingly sizable demographic in the state.Pineda says at 13 years old he emigrated alone to the United States.

Case in point   the Kentucky state chair for Trump s 2016 presidential campaign.Tim Nolan is a member of the Board of Education of Campbell County in California, Kentucky. He is also a former judge, and he happened to run Donald Trump s state campaign there. On Friday, he was led away in handcuffs on a most disturbing charge: that he trafficked a child for sex. The local press, River City News, says that the indictment against Nolan accuses him of making a minor a victim of  commercial sexual activity.  This isn t any old scandal that just got dug up, either   Nolan allegedly was engaging in these activities while he was running Trump s campaign in the state of Kentucky in August of last year. Nolan has also been referred to by local reporters as an  outspoken and controversial  type who is constantly riding for the local Tea Party.In addition to being a child sex trafficker, Nolan is also an avowed racist who was removed from the Kentucky Boxing and Wrestling Commission after a Ku Klux Klan photo appeared on his Facebook page. Of course, since the Trump campaign was just fine with white supremacists, Klansmen and the like, they never bothered to do anything about Nolan s association with their election efforts.Nolan s supposed misdeeds were looked into with great interest by the Campbell County Police, which resulted in this indictment. Another interesting twist is that while the crimes and indictment occurred in Campbell County, the arraignment did not happen there. Why, you might ask? Well, because it would be a conflict of interest to have him appear in a courtroom where his daughter, Taunya Nolan, is a County Court Clerk.These scandals with people surrounding Trump just keep getting sicker and sicker.

Deliberate  flip flopping  on policy or problematic internal communication at the White House, which in the last 24 hours has seen a  scramble  to re-soften its approach via Rex Tillerson on Syria.More on this report from RT  RTUS Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has said the Syrian crisis can only be solved through a political process, claiming it s not regime change but the defeat of the Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS\\u002fISIL) terrorist group that Washington is seeking in Syria. Our strategy in Syria, our priority is first to defeat ISIS,  the US official said in an interview with ABC s  This Week  host, George Stephanopoulos, which was aired Sunday.Saying that once the battle with the terrorist group is concluded, which according to the US official is  going quite well,  Washington plans to turn its attention  to achieving ceasefire agreements between the regime and opposition forces. Bringing the parties to the table for political discussions  clearly requires the participation of the regime and the support of their allies,  Tillerson said in another Sunday interview to the American media, speaking to John Dickerson on CBS s  Face the Nation. Once a ceasefire becomes a reality in Syria,  we will have the conditions to begin a useful political process,  he said. It is through that political process that we believe the Syrian people will ultimately be able to decide the fate of Bashar Assad,  he told ABC.Tillerson reiterated the same on CBS, saying that Washington hoped to work with its coalition members and with the UN,  in particular through the Geneva process,  to be able to  navigate a political outcome in which the Syrian people will in fact determine Bashar Assad s fate and his legitimacy. The US Secretary of State underlined the Russian role in the process, saying that the US hoped it could work together with Russia  and use their influence,  and that Moscow  will choose to play a constructive role in supporting ceasefire through their own Astana talks, but also through Geneva.

The airstrike is only related to the alleged chemical attack, the US official claimed, adding that Washington has learned its lesson of  what it looks like when you undertake a violent regime change,  referring to Libya.

It is now clear that she won it by a margin larger than two candidates who went on to win the presidency.David Leonhardt, a columnist for The New York Times, noted on Friday that with a 1.7-percentage-point popular vote lead over Donald Trump,Clinton will have a larger margin of victory than Richard Nixon had over Hubert Humphrey in 1968 or John F. Kennedy had over Nixon in 1960. (Her edge is also larger than Al Gore s popular vote victory over George W. Bush in 2000, though he too was stymied by an electoral college loss.)In raw numbers, that amounts to an edge of roughly 1.8 million votes as of Saturday.The election is decided by the electoral college, not the popular vote, so Trump will be sworn in to the presidency. But it s telling that even in victory, Trump s supporters must lie to themselves and each other with these completely made up stories.

She often speaks passionately about ideas she feels very strongly about, but she rarely gets visibly pissed off. However, one particular Republican stooge managed to accomplish that feat, as you will see in the video below.Senator Warren was speaking during a hearing that was intended to discuss covering the  costs  to banks if they were regulated, in an effort to prevent them from completely imploding the American economy again. Republicans produced a  star witness, Leonard Chanin, who is one of the people most responsible for the 2008 financial crisis, to testify that banks should not have regulations places on them. As you may have already figured out, that was a bad idea. Senator Warren pointed out how his personal inaction, as well as that of the rest of the Federal Reserve, basically guaranteed a financial crisis.Mr. Chanin, as Sen. Brown mentioned from 2005 to 2011 you held top positions in the Federal Reserve s division of consumer and community affairs, and in those positions you had both the legal authority and the legal responsibility to regulate deceptive mortgages, including dangerous subprime lending that sparked the 2008 financial crisis. But you didn t do it, despite years of calls and even begging from consumer advocates and others asking you to act. Instead, you did essentially nothing.According to the Dallas Fed, that crisis cost the American economy an estimated $14 trillion. It cost millions of families their homes, their jobs, their savings. It devastated communities across America.Republicans simply do not give a sh*t about how much it costs regular Americans to allow banks to literally rob the entire middle class of everything they own. This was a point that was slammed directly in the face of Chanin.So when you talk now about how certain regulations are too costly or too difficult to comply with, you sound a lot like you did before the 2008 crisis when you failed to act. So my question is, given your track record at the Fed, why should anyone take you seriously now.As if the severe embarrassment that she just laid on him personally was not enough, Chanin went on to try to lie to Senator Warren s face, followed by refusing to answer even the most basic questions from her afterwards. That s when it all went wrong for the Republicans  star witness. If the guy keeps his job after this embarrassment it ll be shocking.Watch what happens when you lie to Elizabeth Warren below:Featured image via video screen capture\"],[\"Because people who scale border walls and break the law to get into our country deserve the same taxpayer funded benefits as legal citizens right?Caving into the demands of the open borders movement and pro-immigrant Spanish media, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) will refrain from enforcing immigration laws in areas of Flint, Michigan affected by a water crisis. The water amnesty is the latest of many reprieves issued by the Obama administration to help illegal immigrants nationwide. Judicial Watch has reported on many of them, including recent hurricane, earthquake, Ebola and  severe weather  amnesties.This one involves the widely reported water situation in Flint, which is located about 66 miles northwest of Detroit. Last year researchers discovered that the city s drinking water was contaminated with lead from decaying old pipes. The problem arose after a switch in 2014 in the city s water source to save money. Soon complaints mounted that the water smelled and looked strange and academic researchers discovered that it was toxic. This all occurred after a 7-1 vote by the Flint City Council to stop buying Detroit water and join a new pipeline project, according to a local news report.Now there s a state of emergency and the feds have stepped in, supplying the area with free bottled water and special filters to install at home until the local water supply is clean. For weeks immigrant rights groups complained that residents had to show identification to receive their free goods from the government and illegal aliens were being left out. National Spanish-language media outlets blasted the Obama administration for discriminating against illegal aliens. One reported that undocumented immigrants weren t getting help for fear of being deported, instead opting to drink contaminated water or pay out of pocket to buy some. Another major Spanish-language newspaper wrote that illegal immigrants and their children suffered lead poisoning and couldn t get clean emergency water because they didn t have identification cards.  When the National Guard went door to door distributing potable water, many were scared to open because they feared the uniformed persons were immigration agents who would deport them,  the paper wrote.The Anti-Defamation League (ADL), which claims to combat bigotry and protect civil rights for all, joined the cause expressing  horror  and  indignation  that the government denied undocumented immigrants free water and filters because they couldn t provide a photo ID or Social Security number. In a Spanish-language statement the group s Michigan chapter referred to news reports that Flint-area fire department stations distributing water were requiring identification. But even in places that aren t requiring ID, illegal immigrants are scared to come out and get their potable water out of fear that they will be deported, the ADL stresses in its announcement.  We are calling on the National Guard to order all fire departments and other centers distributing supplies that no one be rejected. Like a good lapdog the Obama administration obliged. This week DHS issued a statement in English and Spanish guaranteeing that U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) would not conduct enforcement operations at or near locations distributing clean water in Flint or surrounding areas.  Moreover, DHS officials do not and will not pose as individuals providing water-related information or distributing clean water as part of any enforcement activities,  the statement assures. The agency s priority is to support state and local government efforts to distribute clean water, the statement says, adding that DHS stands  ready to assist those in need.

Trump has been at war with Scotland for years over their offshore windfarms, but it s worse than simple repeated requests to Scotland to not do this to him and his poor golfers. According to The Guardian, Trump spent years sending former First Minister Alex Salmond letters full of insults, cajoling, and even threats.In one letter, dated February 9, 2012, Trump wrote: With the reckless installation of these [wind turbine] monsters, you will single-handedly have done more damage to Scotland than virtually any event in Scottish history! You seem hellbent on destroying Scotland s coastline and therefore Scotland itself I have just authorized my staff to allocate a substantial amount of money to launch an international campaign to fight your plan to surround Scotland s coast with many thousands of wind turbines. That s a direct threat right there, but he put a veiled one in another letter dated Sept. 14, 2011: In short, this wind farm should not be built, or alternatively, be relocated. If not, you should ask yourself if any other international developer would ever risk investing in Scotland after my experience and all the promises that were made to me! Another letter, addressed to Phillip Hammond, who was the U.K. s defense secretary at the time, said that Salmond had a  bloated ego.  That s rich   nobody s ego is as bloated as that of King Cheeto.On March 15, 2013, he ended yet another letter pleading with Salmond not to plunge ahead with ruining the views from his golf course with: I truly believe it is very important that you not destroy the beauty of Scotland, its land or its seas, by placing thousands of these horrendous looking industrial structures in so many places which will ruin the magnificence and beauty of Scotland. Do not be the man who destroyed Scotland   do not be  Mad Alex!' He would also try and cajole Salmond into caving to his demands. After saying that  the world s greatest leaders have always been those who have been able to change their minds for the good,  and blasting wind power yet again, Trump said: I will be your greatest cheerleader if you can change or modify your stance on at least the inappropriately placed turbines. Salmond made the mistake of letting Trump bulldoze away an environmentally protected area because he believed Trump s promise of bringing thousands of jobs to Scotland and investing hundreds of millions in their economy. The golf course only has 95 employees, most are part-time or seasonal, there s a single-story clubhouse and a small boutique hotel, and Trump spend a whopping  30 million. Trump promised a huge development with a premier hotel. Trump promised a lot more than the government previous to Salmond ever did, and he broke it all.How s Trump going to be in the White House, when other countries don t do what he wants them to do? This isn t about wind power itself   it s about Trump, his ego, and his willingness to harass another country s leader in an attempt to bend them to his will.Salmond only responded to one of the letters, in April 2012. It s hard to blame him for ignoring most of these because, quite simply, Trump is ridiculous. Salmond later warned U.S. voters not to vote for Trump. He noted Trump s immaturity and bullying nature, and flat-out called him a  man-child,  which, let s be honest, is true. These dealings with Trump over his golf course convinced Salmond that Trump does not have what it takes to be President of the United States.To read all of the letters in their entirety, click here.Featured image by Jeff J Mitchell via Getty Images\"],[\"PIGFORD has to be the biggest scam and fraud EVER but I ll bet most Americans haven t even heard about it. IT S ALL ABOUT FREE MONEY! Yes, free money for everyone EXCEPT you have to be a minority to get the $50,000 and it s taxpayer dollars so it s NOT free at all. Our government has spent over $4 BILLION dollars on what was to be a small program to help minority farmers who felt they were discriminated against:Essentially, the process encouraged people to lie and spawned a cottage industry. Claimants had only to file applications for a $50,000 payment by stating that they had  thought about  applying for loans to become a farmer. Where s Congress on this big taxpayer giveaway? Oh, they re voting for billions more to go to this scam of major proportions The Obama administration has again been protected from a troubling scandal by the mainstream media (MSM) using the tactic of omission to simply ignore the scandal, its reality, and the negative blowback attendant to a disturbing story. As sunlight began to illuminate the scandal s inconvenient and troubling facts, charges of racism were used to temporarily silence those sounding the alarm. Seemingly, the alarm-ringers  only crime was having the temerity to respond with a politically incorrect point of view to abuses.The underreported scandal referenced is generally identified as  Pigford.  Pigford s germination occurred in 1997 as a lawsuit (Pigford vs. Glickman) alleging that 91 African-American farmers were unfairly denied loans by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) due to racial discrimination which prevented the complainants from farming. In 1999, the black farmers won their case.Pigford has the distinction of being an out-of-control waste of taxpayer funds and\\u002for a cynical attempt by the Obama administration to curry favor with certain minority groups to which neither President Obama nor Attorney General Eric Holder can plead ignorance of involvement. Both have had knowledge since the court ruled on the Pigford lawsuit; in 2008, then-Senator Barack Obama supported and voted for the funding of the initial settlement. Since then, Eric Holder (and Obama) have been involved in overseeing and managing the Pigford  judgment fund. Yet can Pigford be fairly described as a scandal?Pigford began innocently enough: as a lawsuit to redress a perceived wrong against a group of 91. But then the number climbed to 400 .then 1,600 then The number of black farmers has metastasized   nay, exploded   and the aggrieved group now includes not only blacks, but Hispanics, Native Americans, and females. In fact over 90,000 people have filed claims seeking a payment under the terms of the original Pigford court ruling. That decision, now referred to as Pigford #1, was anticipated to cost approximately $120 million, including legal fees.Pigford #2 is the appellation used to identify an expanded payment regime that funds more payments to African-Americans, Native Americans, Hispanics, and females. This regimen grew out of the fact that thousands of claimants missed the original Pigford #1 filing deadline of October 12, 1999. Interestingly, Native American potential claimants were estimated at 5,300, while plaintiff lawyers pegged the exposure at an estimated 19,000 Native Americans. The judgment fund announced by Agricultural Secretary Thomas Vilsack and Eric Holder in 2010 was expanded from just over $120 million to $1.25 billion, given the expectation of many more filers.However, the explosion of claimants has caused payouts to reach $4.4 billion and has swelled legal fees to over $130 million. More importantly, the claim s process created a rush to get a share of the monies allocated to the judgment fund, even if no real claim existed. Essentially, the process encouraged people to lie and spawned a cottage industry. Claimants had only to file applications for a $50,000 payment by stating that they had  thought about  applying for loans to become a farmer. Proof of a claimant s intent to farm also included a statement from that petitioner saying he or she had attempted to farm by planting a batch of tomatoes in his or her backyard and having that statement verified by a family member. In essence, the need to be a farmer at the time of the alleged discriminatory actions by the USDA was not a requirement to share in the financial redress.Fraud was endemic to the claims process   for example, every apartment in a New York City building received a settlement of at least $50,000. Further, some families received checks of $50,000 for each family member.Read more: American Thinker\"],[\"It s no accident that President Obama named Vanita Gupta acting head of the Civil Rights Division of the DOJ. Gupta is beloved by the radical left for her militant hostility toward law enforcement officers. Here s a fantastic overview from J. Christian Adams who has intimate knowledge of what s going on at the DOJ. He worked  there and knows just how the DOJ has been turned into a politicized radical leftist entity of the Obama administration. Here s an example of that:Vanita Gupta, head of the Department of Justice Civil Rights Division, has told a lawyers group in Colorado that slavery and Jim Crow helped fuel the Ferguson and Baltimore riots.The last few days have seen a number of fanciful stories with the Obama administration seemingly questioning the authority of local police. I ve long maintained that the administration is nakedly seeking to federalize policing standards   but get rid of local police? No way, that sounds like something broadcast from a shortwave station in Austin, Texas. But then up steps Vanita Gupta to lend some credibility to the idea that some want to disband local police and replace police powers with the federal government. Speaking to a group of left-wing lawyers in Colorado, Gupta had this to say:The conversation in these rooms, however, is not about whether to have police or not but about what kind of policing communities want and deserve.There is no question that we need police in our communities.The conversation? What conversation is Gupta hearing that needs to be corrected? Who brought up the idea we might not need police? Nobody sane, for sure.If you read the entirety of Gupta s speech, you ll get a sense of what is going on in the mind of the anti-police left. Officials in this administration still think it is rational and acceptable to bring up the name Michael Brown in the context of anything other than a likely felon against whom deadly force was justifiably used. Behold Gupta:Eric Garner. Michael Brown. Tamir Rice. John Crawford. Walter Scott. Freddie Gray.These names and many others have become familiar to us under tragic circumstances in recent months. Their deaths and those of other unarmed African American men and women in encounters with police officers, have provoked widespread responses across the country and have fueled the Black Lives Matter movement. In communities of color, in particular, the reaction has been stark and sobering.In the seven months I have been at the Civil Rights Division, I have spent a lot of time with local leaders and community members in cities all across America, including with numerous mothers who have lost their children in officer-involved shootings. The pain, anger, frustration   the lack of trust in the police   is real, and it is profound.Gupta asks the question that many Americans have already asked and answered:It s worth asking, first, how did we get here? And second, what are we going to do about it?To most law-abiding Americans, the idea of fleeing from the police, or worse, charging at a policeman you have already punched, is simply beyond the realm of possibility.So how did we get here? Was it a breakdown of values? Perhaps a pervasive tolerance for lawlessness? Of course not. Says Gupta:Let s start with the first question and consider the source of the mistrust. Mistrust can t be explained away as the kneejerk reaction of the ill-informed or the hyperbolic. It s in part the product of historical awareness about the role that police have played in enforcing and perpetuating (wait for it! here it comes!) slavery, the Black Codes, lynchings and Jim Crow segregation.Read more: pjmediaRead more: pjmedia\"],[\"For years now, sane-minded individuals in Congress alongside President Obama have tried to enact common sense gun reform. And now, where those in Congress have failed to act, the president is doing what he can to tighten up existing gun laws and make sure those who shouldn t have guns don t get them.With Obama s bold actions to curb the epidemic of gun violence comes very open dissent from several members of Congress. They ve chosen to side with insanity and the gun lobby over common sense.One member of Congress, Rep. John Fleming (R-LA) decided to opt so far away from common sense, that he tweeted this regarding President Obama s actions: Under Obama s executive gun-control action, your doctor may report you to the FBI. Under Obama's executive gun-control action, your doctor may report you to the FBI. https:\\u002f\\u002ft.co\\u002fMOEAmQdgDa  John Fleming (@RepFleming) January 5, 2016Now, any human being with even the slightest bit of common sense would agree that doctors better damn well be reporting mentally ill patients to the FBI.Furthermore, the disclosure to the FBI from doctors restricts any form of revealing what a diagnosis would be, so privacy is still protected while safety concerns still reached. Starting next month, no legal repercussions can effect the doctors doing their due diligence. The new rule states: The disclosure is restricted to limited demographic and certain other information needed for NICS purposes. Chief executive of the mental health rights advocate Mental Health America, Paul Gionfriddo, even stated: That could be a barn door opened quite wide if an administration really wanted to open it, and they didn t. The administration has taken great pain to try to clarify that there is very limited information that would be reported only within a very limited group. All of this begs the question, who would be against such measures? And clearly Rep. Fleming raised his hand in enthusiastic agreement that doctors should keep their mouths shut and the mentally ill should have easy access to firearms.This goes directly against the NRA and right-wing aphorism that it s not the gun, it s the person. However, if you re against keeping guns out of the hands of the mentally ill, then you aren t following through with that logic, and now Rep. Fleming can forevermore be labeled a dangerous hypocrite.Thank goodness President Obama is in power and is taking action when Congress refuses to do their job. It is the job of those who represent us to act in our best interest. However, so many choose to act in the best interest of those lining their pockets with lobbying dollars, and in this case, it s the gun lobby.Shame on you, Rep. Fleming.Featured image via Flickr\"],[\"Update: Slate has pointed out that the Pentagon has  budgeted $4 billion in total spending through 2021 for two new Air Force ones from the company.  If one plane is four and earmarked R&D is the black-and-white cost of the project, he s right. It isn t, and he isn t. The Pentagon s earmarked funds are not the projected budget by Boeing. Donald Trump made news this morning for a Tweet stating:  Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order! Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016I don t know where he got that idea. Like many of Trump s ideas, it was likely pulled from the ether, or maybe from the ass of a white nationalist on Twitter. Boeing was quick to set him straight, however   considering the project is more than an order of magnitude less than Trump thinks it is. Here s Boeing s statement on the matter:We are currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the President of the United States. We look forward to working with the U.S. Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best planes for the President at the best value for the American taxpayer.According to Rueters, in January, when the contract was awarded,  Details about the total value of the new contract have not been released, but the Air Force has previously said that it had earmarked $1.65 billion for two replacement jets. Costs   and the number of jets   can change, but it s still not clear at all what Trump is talking about. Even various right wing publications which have blown up the cost over the last year have not reported a figure over three billion, and even that was not sourced to any budget sheet.And, no matter the cost, it s very clear that Donald Trump has no idea what is being paid for. There will be multiple planes, first of all   two or three   and even if the project DID run that far over budget (there is no evidence of that), it s not just the president s version of a private jet:What drives the price tag isn t the cost of the plane, it s all the costly modifications and equipment that must be installed on such a unique aircraft,  said Loren B. Thompson, a senior aviation analyst and industry consultant with the Virginia-based Lexington Institute.Air Force One is filled with communications gear and defensive equipment to evade airborne threats, such as anti-aircraft missiles. It s really not just about getting the president from point A to point B,  Buckley said.  It s adding communication equipment. It s adding defensive gear. It s adding everything that the president needs in order to execute his mission in that airplane. He has to be able to do everything in all his roles: commander in chief, chief executive, head of state, president of the United States. Boeing s 747 is the only U.S.-built jet that can support all the functions required of an airborne White House,  Thompson said.  The plane must be linked to all U.S. military forces worldwide and able to function even in the midst of a nuclear war.

And it would have prevented Mueller from investigating  matters  that occurred before Trump announced his presidential campaign.Also in August, DeSantis used an appearance at the Palm Beach County Republican Party s annual lobsterfest to advertise his pro-Trump credentials.As he delivered a combination political speech and invocation, the big screens at the front of the room flashed a picture of DeSantis, his wife, their infant daughter, the president and First Lady Melania Trump outside the White House.DeSantis said the president complimented his wife on her appearance.At that Palm Beach County appearance, and at events throughout the state, DeSantis has been laying the groundwork for a 2018 candidacy for the Republican nomination to run for governor.Here s Ron DeSantis blasting the press and our government agencies for giving Barack Obama a free pass over his support for Hezbollah:The Trump effect: DeSantis reflects the shifting type of Republican candidate under Trump: he s a Fox News contributor, a member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, a supporter of Trump s recent decision to make Jerusalem the home of the U.S. embassy in Israel, and he opposes Special Counsel Bob Mueller s Russia probe (even calling for it to end after just six months).\"],[\"PRESIDENT TRUMP CALLED THE TAX PLAN A  BEAUTIFUL CHRISTMAS PRESENT :Republican leaders announced their plan today that cuts taxes and shrinks the number of tax brackets:The tax plan released by House Republicans would shrink the number of tax brackets from seven to four.The seven currently in effect for joint filers are:Under the GOP House proposal, the brackets would be:President Trump on Thursday called the tax reform plan unveiled by House Republicans  a big beautiful Christmas present  for the American people.

One of the factors that we re looking at is a more positive U.S. manufacturing business environment under President-elect Trump and some of the pro-growth policies he said he s going to pursue. And so this is a vote of confidence.   FOX News\"],[\"This is not the first time Putin has warned the US to hurry up with its release of Hillary s emails. Biden better get the emergency campaign team ready. If Putin releases the unedited, corrupt version of Hillary s highly classified emails, Crooked Hillary will not likely be able to overcome the damage that will be done to what s left of her reputation. Reliable intelligence sources in the West have indicated that warnings had been received that the Russian Government could in the near future release the text of email messages intercepted from U.S. Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton s private e-mail server from the time she was U.S. Secretary of State. The release would, the messaging indicated, prove that Secretary Clinton had, in fact, laid open U.S. secrets to foreign interception by putting highly-classified Government reports onto a private server in violation of U.S. law, and that, as suspected, the server had been targeted and hacked by foreign intelligence services.The reports indicated that the decision as to whether to reveal the intercepts would be made by Russian Federation President Vladimir Putin, and it was possible that the release would, if made, be through a third party, such as Wikileaks. The apparent message from Moscow, through the intelligence community, seemed to indicate frustration with the pace of the official U.S. Department of Justice investigation into the so-called server scandal, which seemed to offer prima facie evidence that U.S. law had been violated by Mrs Clinton s decision to use a private server through which to conduct official and often highly-secret communications during her time as Secretary of State. U.S.Sources indicated that the extensive Deptartment of Justice probe was more focused on the possibility that the private server was used to protect messaging in which Secretary Clinton allegedly discussed quid pro quo transactions with private donors to the Clinton Foundation in exchange for influence on U.S. policy.The Russian possession of the intercepts, however, was designed also to show that, apart from violating U.S. law in the fundamental handling of classified documents (which Sec. Clinton had alleged was no worse than the mishandling of a few documents by CIA Director David Petraeus or Clinton s National Security Advisor Sandy Berger), the traffic included highly-classified materials which had their classification headers stripped. Russian (and other) sources had indicated frustration with the pace of the Justice Dept. probe, and its avoidance of the national security aspects of intelligence handling. This meant that the topic would be suppressed by the U.S. Barack Obama Administration so that it would not be a factor in the current U.S. Presidential election campaign, in which President Obama had endorsed Mrs Clinton. via: Oilprice.com\"],[\"Shawn Helton 21st Century WireYesterday, a wave of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks hit some of the top online companies websites including Amazon, Netflix, Twitter and Reddit. One cannot rule out the very real possibility that this a staged-managed event, especially when you consider The New York Times was listed among those affected. If recent US media and political themes are anything to go by, you can expect a cascading chorus of blame directed at Russia.In this age of America s new and improved trial by media format, you can expect a litany of unfounded accusations, along with the usual anti-Russia hyperbole and waving fingers at Washington s new go-to scapegoat   Russian president Vladimir Putin.The likelihood of Russia or any other country being involved in this heavily coordinated DDoS incident falls flat, when you consider that the US media has been floating the  blame Russia  meme for months now, and even more conveniently during this 2016 US presidential election cycle, led by Vice President Joe Biden, and of course, the Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, all blaming the Kremlin for both the DNC Leaks and the Wikileaks email dump.Indeed, as you look back at NY Times articles since the summer, the stage was being set to implant the idea of an alleged Russian cyber war being waged at the US, principally charging that they would  meddle  with the US presidential elections in 2016 by aiding Donald Trump. Here s the NY Times building the case for Washington, seemingly without the burden of proof: An unusual question is capturing the attention of cyberspecialists, Russia experts and Democratic Party leaders in Philadelphia: Is Vladimir V. Putin trying to meddle in the American presidential election?Until Friday, that charge, with its eerie suggestion of a Kremlin conspiracy to aid Donald J. Trump, has been only whispered. In August, the western media s claims against Russia hit overdrive, when the  New York Times s Moscow bureau was the target of an attempted cyberattack this month. But so far, there is no evidence that the hackers, believed to be Russian, were successful. Flash forward to September here and here, as well as early October in the lead up to President Obama s decree, the Clinton friendly outlet the NY Times had all but solidified the Russian cyber\\u002fhack claims   once again, without any definitive proof.If Russia is going to be the scapegoat for this recent DDoS attack, then consider the following   HACK ATTACK?    Who was behind the Black Friday internet outage in America? (Photo illustration 21WIRE s Shawn Helton)Immediately when the cyber attack story broke, the establishment quickly wheeled out their  experts , as CNN s chief gatekeeper Wolf Blitzer cued-up scripted questions to Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) advocate, Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn (R, TN), Vice Chair of the Energy and Commerce Committee. Not only is Blackburn is a staunch supporter of more draconian copyright laws (she once claimed that  Fair Use  was the same as  theft), she is also a fellow traveller on Washington s Anti-Russia bandwagon.In true propagandist fashion, Blitzer wasted no time asking her,  Do you think this be the work of a foreign government?  Blackburn immediately blamed the hack on the fact that the SOPA bill didn t pass, claiming that SOPA  would have blocked some of the bad actors ,  and went on to blame  cyber bots  (activists) for defeating the bill. From the obvious way that Washington oracle CNN had this story already cued up, it strongly indicates that the Washington was stage-managing this latest  cyber crisis.  WAITING IN THE WINGS: Tennessee  Republican Congressman Marsha Blackburn.As scapegoats go, blaming Russia is the gift that keeps on giving (and way past this Christmas). Last week, President Obama threw Hillary Clinton a campaign assist by formally accusing Russia of interfering with US elections process through Wikileaks. Suddenly, Washington had declared a Cyber War against Russia. The NY Times wrote: Since the Obama administration formally accused Russia about a week ago of trying to interfere in the election, there has been intense speculation about whether President Obama has ordered the National Security Agency to conduct a retaliatory cyberstrike.Despite all the White House and corporate media hype, no evidence at all has been presented by Washington that proves the Kremlin are hacking and  interfering with the US election process. Vice President Joe Biden, also spoke on matters of security and sent a telegraphed  message to Putin  through NBC s Meet the Press, just one day after Obama s own  Russian  declaration. Based on these latest developments, it s easy to see how this could have been an effort prime another back story to blame Russia for these DDoS attacks.The real question surrounding this apparent DDoS attack, should be directed at America s National Security Agency (NSA) and its bevy of contractors, many of whom are tasked with global and (illegal) domestic surveillance, through passive data collection and clandestine processing of communications. Surely they would know where this attack was originated (including in-house).Could this latest incident possibly be to further create a  climate of fear  during this, the most contentious presidential election in 40 years?Could this also be a government-coordinated cyber drill?Was this a government orchestrated false flag hack?It s no secret that the US government would like to pass a newer more potent version of 2011-2012 s  Stop Online Piracy Act otherwise known as SOPA. In fact, NextGov, reported the following in 2014: Nearly three years after a massive online protest derailed the Stop Online Piracy Act, many lawmakers are still nervous about even uttering the name  SOPA  in public.The bill, which once had broad bipartisan support and was a top priority for the entertainment industry, has become a dirty word. The backlash was a traumatic lesson for members of Congress about the danger of siding against tech companies and Internet activists, who warned the bill could break the Internet.Now, for the first time since SOPA crashed and burned in early 2012, the House Judiciary Committee is preparing to work on a major update of copyright law. As lawmakers cautiously return to the issue of copyright protection, the SOPA protest looms large in their minds. Tech outlet Wired described the incident in the following manner. It s crucial to note that the internet performance management company Dyn was front and center   weighing in on the situation prior to any US intelligence agency making an official statement. Dyn states: This morning s attack started around 7 am ET and was aimed at Dyn, an Internet infrastructure company headquartered in New Hampshire. That first bout was resolved after about two hours; a second attack began just before noon. Dyn reported a third wave of attacks a little after 4 pm ET. In all cases, traffic to Dyn s Internet directory servers throughout the US primarily on the East Coast but later on the opposite end of the country as well was stopped by a flood of malicious requests from tens of millions of IP addresses disrupting the system. Late in the day, Dyn described the events as a  very sophisticated and complex attack.  Still ongoing, the situation is a definite reminder of the fragility of the web, and the power of the forces that aim to disrupt it. Regardless of who was actually behind the widespread internet attack, judging by the rhetoric and the mainstream media talking points  this has to be about the government wanting to usher in new  ISP governance  (making ISP s bent to government wishes to  kick out the bad actors  off their networks) and rights-violating security protocols. Is it also possible that social media giant Twitter and mega-consumer brands like Amazon have been used as willing guinea pigs, just like Yahoo was recently when their mailable CEO Marissa Mayer handed over the backdoor keys to Yahoo customer email account to the NSA and FBI.Are the US government determined to gain complete access and have total control over the internet?The idea isn t that far-fetched Yahoo s Marissa Mayer: sold out to the NSA.After Yahoo recently admitted to creating a virtual backdoor for US intelligence agencies to spy on everyday citizen s email accounts, the government exposed its own Orwellian ambitions: Yahoo last year secretly built a custom software program to search all of its customers  incoming emails for specific information provided by US intelligence officials, according to people familiar with the matter.The company complied with a classified US government directive, scanning hundreds of millions of Yahoo Mail accounts at the behest of the National Security Agency or FBI, two former employees and a third person apprised of the events said. This is a very important issue moving forward, as a dip in consumer confidence could be a crushing blow to any company s overall brand after complying with new  1984  security measures   all at the behest of the FBI, NSA, CIA and their trusted partners.Back in March, individual privacy versus global security was at the heart of the case between Apple and the FBI. Here s a telling passage from that report as it relates to this most recent internet attack: The ongoing encryption saga between Apple and the FBI, we stated that there are no guarantees in the security world, especially if a digital master-key were to be created, as this would potentially make it easier for invaders (either the government, or various hackers) mining for data moving forward into the future.In a recent Guardian article, some of those involved in the technology and security sector offered their thoughts regarding the government s continued encroachment on individual privacy: Dan Kaminsky, the security expert who made his name with the discovery that one of the most basic parts of the internet, the domain name system, was vulnerable to fraud   disagrees:  Feds want final authority on engineering decisions, and their interests don t even align with fighting the vast bulk of real-world crime. Kaminsky further explained why Apple s security measures already help law enforcement, If my iPhone is stolen, my emails stay unread, my photos stay unviewed, and I don t need to notify anyone that the secrets they entrusted me with are going to show up on the internet tomorrow. Continuing, The Guardian interviewed former FBI agent Michael German, currently at judicial think-tank the Brennan Center. The following is a portion of that interview: After 9\\u002f11, you had this concept of total information awareness. The intelligence community was very enamoured of the idea that all information was available. Much like the NSA, they wanted to see it all, collect it all, and analyse it all. Additionally, there are many who believe weaker encryption may pose an even bigger security risk globally.In many ways, it appears as though federal agencies are seemingly searching for the right crisis to push public opinion in favor of the state when it comes to security.This is at the core of the perpetual privacy and security battle post 9\\u002f11 How could it be that such propaganda could happen in America? Well, it s worth another look at a Senate hearing discussing the CIA s tremendous influence on the United States media under the moniker Operation Mockingbird \"],[\"A week ago, Susan Sarandon attended the 2016 SAG awards looking absolutely fabulous.

The authorities also found that he had a cache of pipe bombs on his property when they raided his home in Oregon.John Martin Roos, a 61-year-old from Oregon, has been charged with communication of a threat in interstate commerce, and additional charges are likely forthcoming. Roos first came onto the federal government s radar after a  concerned citizen  brought Roos  Facebook and Twitter postings to the FBI s attention in February, according to an affidavit from Special Agent Jeffrey Gray.Roos also had a series of Facebook and Twitter posts with racist rants targeting the President. Obama you goat fffing fudgepacker, the refugees are men of fighting age. Black lives matter! Sure we need someone to pick cotton and wash cars. Paris, burn diseased muslim neighborhoods to the ground and start over with human beings. Obama you are on a hit list,  he wrote in a post that appears to have been removed.He is just the latest in a line of people, ranging from the truly dangerous to just out and out cranks, that have been apprehended since Obama s inauguration in 2009 for threats towards the first black president.His postings online definitely took cues from the targets of Donald Trump s ire. The Huffington Post reported that Roos used his online postings to attack  Attorney General Loretta Lynch, singer Beyonce, Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly and reporter Michelle Fields.  Roos also had praise for those who have supported Trump or been praised by the reality TV star:He praised Ann Coulter and Stacey Dash, and posted several links to posts on Breitbart.com.Coulter has identified herself as a Trump supporter, while on Fox News, Dash has defended and promoted Trump.Breitbart.com has been the most pro-Trump of the conservative media outlets, and an insider has actually alleged that Trump has been paying the site for favorable coverage.Featured image via Facebook\"],[\"A new report from RealClearPolitics is detailing what might be another illegal endeavor of Donald Trump at the behest of his  charitable foundation  (which has already been caught illegally using funds to pay off lawsuits).From 2011 to 2014, leading up to his presidential announcement (and speculation in 2012), the Trump Foundation donated nearly $300,000 to various conservative groups and organizations.IRS laws clearly state that charity executives may not use a foundation  funds to finance personal endeavors that benefit said executives.In 2011, Trump met with South Carolina conservative activist Oran Smith with the intent for, as Smith puts it,  laying the foundation for a   campaign.  After the meeting between the two, Trump, using foundation money, donated $10,000 to Smith s organization, the Palmetto Family Council.According to RealClearPolitics:In many cases, this flow of money corresponded to prime speaking slots or endorsements that aided Trump as he sought to recast himself as a plausible Republican candidate for president. Although sources familiar with the thinking behind the donations cautioned that Trump did not explicitly ask for favors in return for the money, they said the contributions were part of a deliberate effort by Trump to ingratiate himself with influential conservatives and brighten his political prospects.Talk about real pay-for-play.Using Foundation money to monetarily influence, even slightly, those who could (and would) catapult his political career (a personal endeavor) is still illegal under IRS laws   no matter how many technicalities Trump and his lawyers want to argue.In almost all instances, these conservative organizations, with considerable political influence, invited the billionaire mogul and provided endorsements after he donated thousands of dollars to their cause.Another high profile donation was made to The Family Leader organization, a socially conservative think tank that featured Trump as a keynote speaker at one of their most prestigious events in 2013. Trump was featured as the keynote speaker after giving $10,000 like he did with the Palmetto Family Council. RealClearPolitics points out that Trump may have broken IRS rules by giving directly to the organization and not its affiliated nonprofit branch, thus pitting Trump in a  double whammy  on unethical, illegal political meanderings.After Trump donated $100,000 to Citizens United, a Koch-backed political entity:In April 2014, when Citizens United hosted a  cattle call  of would-be Republican candidates for president in New Hampshire, Trump was there. In January 2015, at Citizens United s Freedom Summit in Iowa, Trump was again on the program.This won t bode well, especially for a guy who s  under audit  from the IRS. We now know why, apparently.While Republicans try to find something, anything, to pit Clinton against her foundation, the GOP is ignoring the obvious abuses of Trump and his. This double standard from the right should not surprise anyone   their candidate is failing and they need to divert any negative attention away from him. This is the party of  Christian values  at work.Featured image via Spencer Platt\\u002fGetty Images\"],[\"France s armed police officers were at least prepared to handle the terror attack after shooting the terrorist, thereby preventing any further acts of terror by what police believe to be a lone wolf incident.

Trump did this without offering any proof. After Trump s tweetstorm, his team twisted itself into a pretzel in order to try to defend Trump s unprecedented attack on his predecessor. Meanwhile, former President Barack Obama literally rolled his eyes after hearing of Trump s baseless claims.Trump s fact-free conspiracy theory even garnered the attention of House Intelligence Committee Chair Devin Nunes (R-CA) and Ranking Member Adam Schiff (D-CA), who gave him until Monday to produce evidence to back up his claim. It s worth noting that Nunes is a staunch defender of Trump s and even went as far as to try to cover up the amateur president s Russian influence scandal so he must find this indefensible.On Monday, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said that Trump  doesn t really think  that Barack Obama  tapped his phone personally,  in an attempt to walk back Trump s wild and unsubstantiated claim that his predecessor ordered an illegal wiretap of Trump Tower, Politico reports. He doesn t really think that President Obama went up and tapped his phone personally,  Spicer told reporters at the press briefing.Spicer tried to use Alt-words to defend his boss.Spicer tried to argue that Trump had accused the Obama administration of general  surveillance  activities, and not a literal wiretap, even though Trump himself had use the term  wire tapping  in one of several tweets making the claim without evidence on March 4. Spicer claimed that the fact that Trump put quotation marks around the words  wire tapping  in one tweet was proof that he was not speaking literally. I think there is no question that the Obama administration, that there were actions about surveillance and other activities that occurred in the 2016 election. That is a widely-reported activity that occurred back then,  Spicer said.  The president used the word wiretap in quotes to mean broadly surveillance and other activities during that. Ah, so if Trump used quotes (he did so only one out of three times) then we are not to take him literally. Weird. It is interesting how many news outlets reported that this activity was taking place during the 2016 election cycle, and now we re wondering where the proof is,  Spicer added.  It is many of the same outlets in this room that talked about the activities that were going on back then. No one knows what Spicer is talking about:It is unclear what reports Spicer was referring to. News outlets have reported that intelligence officials have been investigating whether there were inappropriate ties between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. As part of the probe into the country s suspected attempts to meddle in the election and regular surveillance on Russia s ambassador, they have reportedly intercepted communications between some campaign aides and Russian officials.There is no proof or credible source which has reported that Obama wiretapped and\\u002for surveilled Donald Trump during the campaign.As we said, Trump only used quotes in one of three tweets, not that that should matter. Is it legal for a sitting President to be  wire tapping  a race for president prior to an election? Turned down by court earlier. A NEW LOW!  Trump wrote in one tweet. I d bet a good lawyer could make a great case out of the fact that President Obama was tapping my phones in October, just prior to Election!  another tweet read. How low has President Obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process. This is Nixon\\u002fWatergate. Bad (or sick) guy!  Trump wrote in a misspelled tweet.So now, Trump  s Department of Justice has asked the chairman and vice chairman of the House Intelligence Committee for  additional time  to collect evidence to support Trump s crazy-time claims.

A very valid question, and one that our intelligence community probably grapples with daily considering, no, you can t torture people to gather intelligence.When posed with this question on CNN, Ben Carson replied that he would promote a much more humane  medical way  of intelligence gathering.Pressed on what this medical way would be by CNN s Poppy Harlow, Carson responded: I believe there are a number of ways to extract information. Including, you know, some medical ways of, you know, putting people into a less than conscious state which allows information to be extracted much more humanely. Carson was then asked to explain further, so he said: Well, the average person might understand it as truth serum. But, you know, there are ways where you decrease a person s conscious defenses and they might be much more willing to give up information. Seemingly perplexed by the concept of a truth serum as though it were coming from a Harry Potter novel, Harlow again asked Carson to explain in greater detail what he means. Carson explained: Sodium amytal, but you know there are a variety of different things we can use now. We ve made some advances in that kind of science. So, instead of torture people, Carson is advocating drugging them against their will. It may seem more humane, but it s not necessarily more ethical.Carson never did actually answer the question regarding if waterboarding should be used, and pivoted away into a non-answer of  I don t think we necessarily need to be broadcasting what we do.

Watch:Former UK ambassador to Uzbekistan Craig Murray, who is a close associate of Julian Assange, said he has met the DNC leaker and he s not Russian. h\\u002ft GPI have watched incredulous as the CIA s blatant lie has grown and grown as a media story   blatant because the CIA has made no attempt whatsoever to substantiate it. There is no Russian involvement in the leaks of emails showing Clinton s corruption. Yes this rubbish has been the lead today in the Washington Post in the US and the Guardian here, and was the lead item on the BBC main news. I suspect it is leading the American broadcasts also.A little simple logic demolishes the CIA s claims. The CIA claim they  know the individuals  involved. Yet under Obama the USA has been absolutely ruthless in its persecution of whistleblowers, and its pursuit of foreign hackers through extradition. We are supposed to believe that in the most vital instance imaginable, an attempt by a foreign power to destabilize a US election, even though the CIA knows who the individuals are, nobody is going to be arrested or extradited, or (if in Russia) made subject to yet more banking and other restrictions against Russian individuals? Plainly it stinks. The anonymous source claims of  We know who it was, it was the Russians  are beneath contempt.As Julian Assange has made crystal clear, the leaks did not come from the Russians. As I have explained countless times, they are not hacks, they are insider leaks   there is a major difference between the two. And it should be said again and again, that if Hillary Clinton had not connived with the DNC to fix the primary schedule to disadvantage Bernie, if she had not received advance notice of live debate questions to use against Bernie, if she had not accepted massive donations to the Clinton foundation and family members in return for foreign policy influence, if she had not failed to distance herself from some very weird and troubling people, then none of this would have happened.It is terrible that the prime conduit for this paranoid nonsense is a once great newspaper, the Washington Post, which far from investigating executive power, now is a sounding board for totally evidence free anonymous source briefing of utter bullshit from the executive.In the UK, one single article sums up the total abnegation of all journalistic standards. The truly execrable Jonathan Freedland of the Guardian writes  Few credible sources doubt that Russia was behind the hacking of internal Democratic party emails, whose release by Julian Assange was timed to cause maximum pain to Hillary Clinton and pleasure for Trump.  Does he produce any evidence at all for this assertion? No, none whatsoever. What does a journalist mean by a  credible source ? Well, any journalist worth their salt in considering the credibility of a source will first consider access. Do they credibly have access to the information they claim to have?Now both Julian Assange and I have stated definitively the leak does not come from Russia. Do we credibly have access? Yes, very obviously. Very, very few people can be said to definitely have access to the source of the leak. The people saying it is not Russia are those who do have access. After access, you consider truthfulness. Do Julian Assange and I have a reputation for truthfulness? Well in 10 years not one of the tens of thousands of documents WikiLeaks has released has had its authenticity successfully challenged. As for me, I have a reputation for inconvenient truth telling.Contrast this to the  credible sources  Freedland relies on. What access do they have to the whistleblower? Zero. They have not the faintest idea who the whistleblower is. Otherwise they would have arrested them. What reputation do they have for truthfulness? It s the Clinton gang and the US government, for goodness sake.The worst thing about all this is that it is aimed at promoting further conflict with Russia. This puts everyone in danger for the sake of more profits for the arms and security industries   including of course bigger budgets for the CIA.

So  I m suggesting that our sources take risks.Perhaps Obama should stop blaming the Russians and start asking the FBI and CIA to take a closer look at the unsolved murder of Seth Rich.

Denmark is a major pork producer and it is the most popular meat, but it is forbidden to Muslims and Jews. Most of the asylum-seekers who have arrived in the country in the past months are Muslim.Noergaard, a member of the anti-immigration, populist Danish People s Party that proposed the council motion, said Thursday that it wasn t meant as a  harassment of Muslims,  but added that he had received  several complaints about too many concessions  being made to Muslims in the small, predominantly Lutheran country. The signal we want to send here is that if you re a Muslim and you plan to come to Randers, don t expect you can impose eating habits on others. Pork here is on an equal footing with other food,  Noergaard told The Associated Press. He said that halal meat, vegetarian dishes and diets for diabetics would still be available.In 2013, then-Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt lashed out at some nurseries after they started serving halal-butchered meat instead of pork because Muslim children had refused to eat it.

Because he s too stupid to verbalize his position and too cowardly to take on anyone his own size or gender, he decided to express his displeasure with the GOP frontrunner by pepper spraying some women and children at a Pro-Trump rally.Here s the deal: Anaheim, CA city councilwoman Kris Murray introduced a resolution denouncing Donald Trump, which reads in part,  the divisive rhetoric of presidential candidate Donald Trump as contrary to the fundamental principles of the constitutions of California and the United States and as not reflecting Anaheim s guiding principles of inclusiveness and kindness. The LA Daily News reports that more than 50 pro-Trump supporters showed up at the Anaheim City Hall to protest this ridiculous resolution on Tuesday. As you know, wherever there are Trump supporters, there are anti-Trump agitators looking to start a violent confrontation. There s no word on the anti-Trump numbers, but there were enough to be noticed. The news notes that most of these anti-Trump forces were angry young men.As the anti-Trump thugs were yelling at the pro-Trump supporters, one asshole decided to attack a group of women and children, including a 53-year-old grandmother. All I remember is a young man jumped on one of my friends and I told him to get off. Then I got pepper sprayed,  said Linda Reedy.That pepper spray was wielded by the Latino in the Seahawks shirt. Not only did he hit Reedy but also her two young grandchildren and another woman.Paramedics were seen pouring water on their eyes to try and remove the stinging spray. A young girl about 8 years old cried hysterically.It would appear as if someone, possibly Seahawks guy, also punched Reedy in the face as paramedics gave her an icepack for an unspecified facial injury.To recap: one guy attacked a woman and then the Latino pepper sprayed her, a grandmother, and two young children all because they support Donald Trump. If there are a bigger couple of pussies I d like to know who they are because these guys have the #1 and #2 spots locked up in my opinion.Despite the fact that the news was able to capture a very clear picture of the chickenshit pepper sprayer, the dozens of police on the scene were unable to identify or arrest him. No seriously, there were a dozen cops in riot gear, plus many more guarding City Hall, as well as police helicopters overhead and they couldn t apprehend this coward?Let s remember that the reason why everyone was at Anaheim City Hall was because some uppity leftist councilwoman was denouncing Trump for being intolerant. Somehow I think attacking and pepper spraying old women and young children for their beliefs is a million times less tolerant than anything Donald Trump has ever said. Will Anaheim also denounce this Latino asshole and his cohort for what they did? I doubt it.A better question is: will the national media report this assault with the same vigor that they do any time a disruptive idiot gets thrown out of a Trump rally? Again, I doubt it. The official media narrative is that Donald Trump supporters are the violent ones and anti-Trump protesters are peaceful victims of their hate.Via: DownTrend\"],[\"Many on the left and in the liberal media are hoping President Trump will butt heads with his new chief of staff, former general John Kelly, proving he is incapable of getting along with senior officials in his administration. But if Trump s experience in the New York Military Academy is an indicator, he will surely excel with his new Chief of Staff John Kelly and his disciplined military style.Donald Trump s freewheeling, off-the-cuff campaign style can sometimes make him look like he s winging it. Playing by the rules is not what the billionaire presidential candidate is known for. But during a little-known time in his childhood   military school   playing the game meant following the rules. And Trump learned how to win at it.When Rules Were Meant To Be BrokenBefore military school, Trump was famous for breaking the rules. Long before buildings would be named after him, schoolmates used the Trump name as shorthand for getting into trouble. We used to refer to our detention as a  DT    a  Donny Trump    because he got more of them than most other people in the class,  said Paul Onish, one of Trump s grade school classmates.Onish calls Trump one of his best friends at the Kew-Forest School in Forest Hills, Queens. Trump attended the school through seventh grade, and the two of them got into trouble together constantly   talking out of turn during class, passing notes and throwing spitballs. Onish remembers a few stunts on the soccer field, too. There was even a couple of incidences during half-time when we would eat whole oranges without peeling them in front of the competition to show them how tough we really were,  Onish said.Getting Sent Up The RiverIt was the late 1950s   and in the quiet, well-to-do community of Jamaica Estates, Queens, the nonstop antics became embarrassing for Trump s parents.So right before eighth grade, Trump s father sent him literally up the river to New York Military Academy in the Hudson Valley. Trump would spend the next five years there.Retired Col. Ted Dobias remembers the tall, lanky kid who showed up at his dormitory. I put [him] down at the end of the hall. He didn t know how to make a bed. He didn t know how to shine his shoes. He had a problem, you know, with being a cadet. You know, being a cadet, you gotta take care of yourself,  Dobias said.And Trump the cadet didn t quite know how, at first. Dobias had a reputation for being one of the school s toughest instructors. He was a hardened World War II veteran who made it clear to Trump   he didn t care who his daddy was. When he got out of line, he got the same treatment like everybody else. His name was Donald Trump, like Johnny Jones. It was all the same,  Dobias said.  Nobody was different. We treated everyone alike. When Following The Rules Becomes The GameNew York Military Academy, or NYMA, is tucked in a small speck of a town called Cornwall-on-Hudson. It s a short drive from West Point. Arriving here is like stepping back in time. Antique cannons squat on green fields. Buildings date back to the 1800s.Back in Trump s day, cadets would wake up near the crack of dawn, hurry into their uniforms and march in formation to breakfast. First-year cadets had to eat their meals squared-off   lifting their forks in a right angle path into their mouths. And after breakfast, they d scurry back to clean their rooms for inspection. Dobias said it was a place where kids who didn t like following the rules learned to like it. It s a hell of a thing for a kid to go to a military school   especially when you have to say,  Yes sir,   No sir,  have to learn how to salute, how to do about-face, how to march, how to carry a gun,  said Dobias.But instead of recoiling from the discipline, Trump thrived under it. In her book The Trumps: Three Generations of Builders and a Presidential Candidate, Gwenda Blair notes how  Donald seemed to welcome being in a place with clear-cut parameters, a place where he could focus on figuring out how to come out on top and get what he wanted. Mike Kabealo, one of Trump s roommates at NYMA, said in the confines of the school s rigid rules, Trump wanted to be a standout. Cocksure, positive and anything-you-can-do-I-can-do-better kind of stuff   you know, he was very competitive,  Kabealo said.And friends say Trump channeled that competitiveness into everything at military school. When he was in charge of the rifle rack, he cleaned the rifles obsessively. He was meticulous about his uniform. When it was his turn to do inspections in the barracks, he whipped other cadets into shape. My bed wasn t really made right, and he ripped it,  said Ted Levine, another student who roomed with Trump at NYMA.Trump tore Levine s sheets off during inspections one morning. Levine s bed hadn t passed muster.Trump became captain of the baseball team, and Dobias was his coach. He was very coachable,  Dobias said.  If I told him,  Do this,  he ll do it. If I told him to do it the other way, he ll do it that way. So that s what made him a good baseball player. He accepted criticism. He wanted to be best. Not better. Here s a picture of Trump with his soccer team:Donald Trump s New York Military basketball team photo :Trump was made a cadet captain at NYMA   one of the highest honors for graduates. I don t think he had a handful of loyalists, you know?  Levine, his former roommate, said.  Because he was so competitive that everybody who could come close to him he had to destroy. But now, more than 50 years later, Levine says he and the other guys still kind of admire Trump.Today Levine s office is littered with Donald Trump knickknacks. Like a talking Trump doll that belts out Trumpisms such as  Brand yourself and toot your own horn,  and  Have an ego   there s nothing wrong with ego. Sometimes, Levine said, he squeezes the doll for advice. It s reinforcement   positive reinforcement of true values that are very important for businessmen,  he said.Values like winning   how to fight back and win.Levine gave the doll another squeeze. Never give up,  the doll squawked.  Under any circumstances, never give up. Levine said he didn t learn that one from Trump   they both learned that one in military school.For entire story: NPR \"],[\"We live near this once great tourist destination of Hamtramck, a city with a vibrant nightlife, authentic polish food and a city where the beer flowed freely. All that was special about this unique little welcoming enclave just outside of the depressed Detroit neighborhoods surrounding it, is about to change dramatically Karen Majewski was in such high demand in her vintage shop on a recent Saturday afternoon that a store employee threw up her hands when yet another visitor came in to chat. Everyone wanted to talk to the mayor about the big political news.Earlier this month, the blue-collar city that has been home to Polish Catholic immigrants and their descendents for more than a century became what demographers think is the first jurisdiction in the nation to elect a majority-Muslim council.It s the second tipping for Hamtramck (pronounced Ham-tram-ik), which in 2013 earned the distinction becoming of what appears to be the first majority-Muslim city in the United States following the arrival of thousands of immigrants from Yemen, Bangladesh and Bosnia over a decade.In many ways, Hamtramck is a microcosm of the fears gripping parts of the country since the Islamic State s attacks on Paris: The influx of Muslims here has profoundly unsettled some residents of the town long known for its love of dancing, beer, paczki pastries and the pope.Majewski, whose family emigrated from Poland in the early 20th century, admitted to a few concerns of her own. Business owners within 500 feet of one of Hamtramck s four mosques can t obtain a liquor license, she complained, a notable development in a place that flouted Prohibition-era laws by openly operating bars. The restrictions could thwart efforts to create an entertainment hub downtown, said the pro-commerce mayor.And while Majewski advocated to allow mosques to issue calls to prayer, she understands why some longtime residents are struggling to adjust to the sound that echos through the city s streets five times each day. There s definitely a strong feeling that Muslims are the other,  she said.  It s about culture, what kind of place Hamtramck will become. There s definitely a fear, and to some degree, I share it. Saad Almasmari, a 28-year-old from Yemen who became the fourth Muslim elected to the six-member city council this month, doesn t understand that fear. I don t know why people keep putting religion into politics,  said Almasmari, who received the highest percentage of votes (22 percent) of any candidate.  When we asked for votes, we didn t ask what their religion was. Hamtramck s exceedingly low home prices and relatively low crime rate have proved especially attractive to new immigrants, whose presence is visible everywhere. Most of the women strolling Joseph Campau Avenue wear hijabs, or headscarves, and niqabs, veils that leave only the area around the eyes open. Many of the markets advertise their wares in Arabic or Bengali, and some display signs telling customers that owners will return shortly   gone to pray, much in the same way Polish businesses once signaled that employees had gone to Mass.Many longtime residents point to 2004 as the year they suspected that the town s culture had shifted irrevocably. It was then that the city council gave permission to al-Islah Islamic Center to broadcast its call to prayer from speakers atop its roof. The Polish people think we were invading them,  said Masud Khan, one of the mosque s leaders, recalling that time in an interview earlier this month.  We were a big threat to their religion and culture. Now their days are gone. The mosque, which attracts about 500 people for its Friday prayer services, has purchased a neighboring vacant limestone building in the heart of the city that once was a furniture store. The mosque s leaders plan to put a minaret   a spire   on the building and use it to continue broadcasting a call to prayer five times a day.The private sale enraged city leaders, including the mayor, who sees the area as key to commercial growth. Mosque leaders estimate that the 20,000-square-foot building will hold up to 2,000 people once the renovation is finished next year.The town s transformation caught Mike Bugaj off guard. When the Hamtramck native left to join the Air Force in 1972, the city was widely referred to as  Little Warsaw.  When he returned from the military in 1995,  the Muslims were here,  said Bugaj, who is of Polish and Native American descent.The new majority Muslim council has Bugaj worried that old traditions, like the Polish festival and Fat Tuesday s paczki day, soon will be wiped away.He and other residents are  concerned about what they would want to change, that they could mistreat women,  said Bugaj, who wore feather earrings and a T-shirt with wolves on it.  Don t come over to America and try to turn people to your way of thinking. Wayne Little, who has been a pastor for nearly 40 years at Corinthian Baptist Church, said many of the city s African American residents are also waiting to see whether the new Muslim-majority city council will represent their interests.  They are clannish and stick together. . . . The jury is out on them.  Little said.The discord intensified in the weeks before the election, beginning when several senior citizens living in an apartment complex complained about the volume of the 6 a.m. call to prayer from a nearby mosque.Susan Dunn, who was on her fifth unsuccessful run for city council, raised the issue before the governing body. I have my own rights, as well,  she said while baking her son s birthday cake in her kitchen.  I m not a hater. It wasn t a calculated move.  At one point as she spoke, a mosque close to Dunn s house began broadcasting the call to prayer.  You try reading a book in your back yard while your dog is barking to that,  Dunn said, clearly exasperated.

McCain is a war hero who was a prisoner of war. He was brutally tortured after being shot down during a mission. As a result, McCain can no longer lift his arms above his shoulders.Ever since the election, Trump has been whining about not being treated like a legitimate president. Of course, that s because Trump lashes out at anyone who criticizes him like a petulant child who isn t getting his way. It s also because Russia helped him win the election and because he has done nothing but hurt people across the nation and all around the world with his policies.For instance, Trump s assault on Obamacare threatens the healthcare of 30 million Americans, including veterans.Well, one veteran had a message for Trump in an amazing ad released on Monday.As a bearded man lifts weights, the camera pulls away to reveal that he only has one leg. He lost the other leg fighting for our country. President Trump, I hear you watch the morning shows,  he began.  Here s what I do every morning. He then tells Trump that if he wants to be considered a legitimate president he should act like one by not killing Obamacare and banning Muslims from entering the nation. Look, you lost the popular vote. You re having trouble drawing a crowd. And your approval rating keeps sinking. But kicking thousands of my fellow veterans off the health insurance by killing the Affordable Care Act and banning Muslims won t help. That s not the America I sacrificed myself for. You wanna be a legitimate president, sir? Then act like one. Here s the video via Twitter.New TV ad running today: Wounded veteran tells Trump:  You wanna be a legitimate president, sir?

He is a selfish bully who only cares about himself and his rich friends. It s only been a little over two weeks since he took over the White House and he is already destroying the very foundation of this country while alienating our allies. His decisions are ruining lives. And he has even gotten a Navy SEAL killed in response to a video that is several years old, proving that he is completely inept. At some point, the military will have to refuse to follow Trump s orders, especially if he continues to escalate confrontations with Iran and China.

Please share this and stop the false story being reported to try and bring down Trump. It s bad enough that the lefty media is trying to take down Trump with big lies, but now it s the establishment Republicans like Kasich who re doing the Trump Trashing. Shame on them!TRANSCRIPT OF RUSH LIMBAUGH EXPLAINING THE BIG LIE TOLD ABOUT TRUMP: RUSH: Now, I don t know if you have seen it yet today. There are stories all over the Drive-By Media   the Associated Press, Yahoo News, I mean, it s everywhere   that Donald Trump supposedly is calling for the registration of all Muslims in America. Trump is demanding that they all be registered and that a massive database be collected. CNN is all over reporting this. Even the Wall Street Journal has picked up on it. There s a problem, though: Trump didn t say it. I m gonna tell you what happened. At a recent public appearance Trump s coming off the stage after one of his usual one hour to 90-minute appearances.He s probably worn out and spent, and there s the usual crowd of autograph seekers and supporters and fans, and amongst them is a Drive-By Media reporter who says to Trump,  Should there be a database system that tracks the Muslims that are in this country?  Trump says,  There should be a lot of systems, beyond databases. We should have a lot of systems, and today you can do it. But right now we have to have a border. We have to have strength, we have to have a wall, and we cannot let what s happening to this country happen again.  Reporter:  Is that something your White House would like to implement? There s no specificity there. The question is just,  Is that something your White House would like to implement?  Trump has given a multifaceted answer. She says,  Is that something,  without specifying what she s asking about. Trump said,  Oh, I would certainly implement that, absolutely,  and that s how they report that Trump  demands a database and registration for all Muslims,  when he didn t say it! He never said it. It s a Journalism 101 trick. It s right out of the manual they teach you at the first year of journalism school in how to destroy political opponents or powerful people you don t like. It s that common a technique.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Now, I m not sure, but I think that the reporter that asked Trump the question and has totally, totally twisted this purposefully to convey something that did not happen, I think the reporter works for Business Insider. I think the reporter is Hunter Walker. If that s who it is, you need to know that this guy is a major backer of Hillary Clinton, as most in the Drive-By Media are. He has written endless articles championing her, and now I think he writes for Yahoo News and is the Business Insider politics editor.So here is how this happened. This is in Newton, Iowa, yesterday after a campaign event. Trump s leaving the stage, and a reporter says,  Should there be a database system to track Muslims in this country?  Now, nobody has suggested that, keep in mind. Trump has not suggested it. So the reporter s not asking a question bouncing off anything Trump has said. It s just a question thrown at Trump, and it comes to him in the midst of autograph seekers and fans and supporters wanting to meet him after his performance is finished.TRUMP: There should be a lot of systems beyond database. We should have a lot of systems. And today you can do it. But right now we have to have a border. We have to have strength. We have to have a wall. And we cannot let what s happening to this country happen.REPORTER: But is it something your White House would like to implement?TRUMP: Oh, I would certainly implement that, absolutely.REPORTER: What do you think the effect of that would be? How would that work?TRUMP: It would stop people from coming in illegally. We have to stop people from coming into our country illegally.REPORTER: Muslims specifically, how do you actually get them registered into a database?TRUMP: It would be just good management. What you have to do is good management procedures. And we can do that.REPORTER: Would you go to mosques and sign these people up into the system?TRUMP: Different places. You sign  em up at different   but it s all about management. Our country has no management.RUSH: Okay. Now, two things about this. The first is, as I said, everybody in the Drive-By Media is running with this because they think they ve got Trump again. They re salivating out there, folks, they are hoping, they ve got their fingers crossed, they ve doubled down, they re putting this story everywhere: Trump sexist, Trump bigoted, Trump anti-Muslim, wants a database; wants to go to their mosques to sign  em up; wants to have them carry around symbols on their clothes to tell everybody who they are. And he never said it.This reporter, Hunter Walker, retweeted the headline from the AP. The AP headline:  Trump Says He Would Absolutely Implement Muslim Database.  This little know-nothing reporter is so proud of his work today. This, as I say, journalism 101. This is what they teach you when you want to take out a political opponent or a powerful person you don t like, this is how you do it, with innuendo.Again, here s what happened. Trump comes offstage,  Should there be a database system that tracks Muslims that are in this country?  It s a setup question from the get-go. Nobody has suggested it. Trump said there should be a lot of systems beyond databases. We should have a lot of systems. And today you can do it, but right now we have to have a border. We have to have strength. We have to have a wall, and we can t let what s happening to this country happen again.He has not confirmed a database. He has not confirmed registration of Muslims. He s changed the question to his favorite subject, the wall and the border and keeping illegal immigrants out. The reporter says,  Is that something your White House would like to implement?  Not specifying. If anything, the guy s talking about the border. The last thing Trump said in his answer was talking about the border, strength, a wall. The reporter says,  Is that something your White House would like to implement?  There is nothing specified. The use of the word  that,  the reporter then can say,  Well, I meant Muslim registration, look what Trump said, Trump knew what I was talking about. But Trump s answer was,  Oh, I would certainly implement that, absolutely. Reporter:  What do you think the effect of that would be? It would stop people from coming in illegally.  Trump s still talking about the border. He s still talking about the wall. He says,  We have to stop people from coming into this country illegally.  So how in the world can Trump be talking about the registration of Muslims or anybody when he s still talking about keeping people out of the country? Muslims are here. This is a good, old-fashioned hatchet job by this low-rent reporter named Hunter Walker who s got everybody in the media reporting it the way he wants because this is what they want people to believe about Trump. This is what they believe about all Republicans. We re bigots, we re racists, sexists and so forth, and Trump s just come along and confirmed it. And I guarantee you there s a contest inside the Drive-By Media to see who can be the one to take Trump out.Here is what they are forgetting. This isn t gonna hurt Trump. Even their journalistic malpractice is not gonna hurt Trump. They haven t figured that out. They keep applying standard, ordinary, everyday tactics on hit pieces to Donald Trump, and all that happens as a result is that Trump increases his support. Trump s support gets stronger. It gets deeper every time they try something like this because Trump is dead serious about protecting this country and its borders and keeping terrorists and so forth out of the country. He makes no bones about it. He s one of the only candidates that s unwavering on it. It s the number one issue.And you combine what s happening with ISIS in Paris and border security, national security, protecting and defending the country and the people who live here is far and away the number one most important issue because everything descends from it. The economy descends from it. Jobs descend from it. Everything that matters descends from this country remaining a country. It has to have a border. That border has to be enforced. Trump s the only guy talking about. They think they ve got him. They re gonna be crying in whatever it is they drink. This is not going to rip the bottom out of Trump s campaign. It s not gonna destroy Trump s campaign no matter how much they re lying, no matter how they try to distort this, because Trump did not say he s in favor of registration or a database of all Muslims in America.And once again, what s gonna happen here is an ever increasingly aware and sophisticated public is gonna just get angrier and angrier at the usual childish tactics of the very unrespected Drive-By Media. Once the public learns what s happened here, the anger is not gonna be at Trump. There wouldn t have been that much anger at Trump anyway among his supporters. That s what they don t understand. You people in the media have got to understand something. You re gonna have to go about this a different way. You didn t make Trump; you can t destroy him. There s nothing you can do. And look at the lengths they re now going to try. Exactly what they did to Romney, by the way. This is no different than Harry Reid saying,  Mitt Romney hasn t paid his taxes in ten years.   Hey, look at Mitt Romney putting the family dog on top of the station wagon.   Hey, Mitt Romney, one of his employees  wives died of cancer, Romney didn t care, went ahead and canceled the health care plan, didn t care. I don t think this guy s questions were even registering with Trump. I think Trump continued to talk with his own framework in mind, meaning his focus on the wall. Because if you continue on with the sound bite   keep in mind here that Trump s never talked about registering or having a database of Muslims. The reporter asks a fake question:  Is that something your White House would do, like to implement?  Trump answers,  Yeah.  He keeps talking about the wall. He keeps talking about the border.  Oh, I would certainly implement that, absolutely.  Trump s still talking about the border.The reporter says,  What do you think the effect of that would be? How would that work? Trump:  It would stop people from coming in illegally.  He s still talking about the border. He s still talking about his wall.  We have to stop people from coming in illegally. Reporter:  For Muslims specifically, how do you actually get them registered in your database?  Trump has never said that he wants to register them in his database. He s talking about the wall. He s talking about the border. This idiot, talentless reporter says,  Well, for Muslims specifically, how do you actually get them registered in your database?  Trump says,  It would be good management. What you have to do is good management procedures, and we can do that.  He s still talking about the wall. He s not even listening to this kid. He s walking out of there, he s answering the question, he s got it answered, he s on the wall, he s on the border, that s what he s talking about.When it s all over the reporter makes it up that Trump s talking about registration of Muslims and a database. Totally makes it up. Anyway, I gotta take a break here. I just wanted you to see this. I wanted you to hear it, the reporter s own words, Trump s own words because it s been picked up everywhere, and, mark my words, the next poll that comes out, Trump s just gonna jump even higher and they re not gonna know what to do with themselves in the Drive-Bys. But you people in the media are gonna have to learn something. When you don t make somebody, you can t destroy him. And you haven t made Trump. The media has nothing to do with why Trump s where he is, and therefore you can t take him out. You can try, you may think you can, but he s got a bond, a connection with his supporters and his audience that you people are not gonna be able to break no matter how hard you try.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: So you know how this works? I just got an e-mail from a friend of mine who plays around on Facebook, and he sent me a screenshot of his Facebook post that he sent out, and he wants me to know that he s on top things. He says,  Yeah, Trump wants to register all Muslims. The last guy that wanted to do that was Hitler with the Jews! Come on, folks! We re going backwards.  So I just had to write him back:  Hey, buddy, you ve got it 180 degrees wrong. Trump didn t say it!  This is a guy that reads the news all day. This is exactly how this happens. You ve got every Drive-By news source now reporting this.originalI m not sure who the reporter was that actually got this whole thing started, but there are the suspects who have taken what that kid did and expanded it are all over the place. You could mention any Drive-By name out there and you d be pretty close to being accurate about who did this. I m not exactly sure who the reporter was at the Trump event. I was told one thing and now I m told that that s not necessarily true. But the guy s name I gave you is still responsible for expanding, amplifying, and leading this. That Hunter Walker is who kicked it all off. Doesn t really matter.I mean, they re all the same stripe, and they ve all got the same objective here. And this e-mail I just got from a friend of mine   who s not an idiot, and you know, he s not a casual consumer of news. It s in the Wall Street Journal. This guy s a financial guy. He read it in the Wall Street Journal, and the Wall Street Journal to these guys is gospel. I have tried to tell every friend of mine, and it s probably gone for naught. I ve tried to tell them just based on the way I get covered, and they know me and they know what s written about me is all bogus. I said,  Could you not apply that to every story you hear, particularly about people you support? Could you just learn to not believe anything you read if it s defaming Republicans in the Drive-By Media? Could you just learn to be suspicious of it and try to confirm it on your own? (sigh) But it doesn t work that way. People believe it.  There it is! It s in print. It s right there,  or,  It s on my screen, Rush! I mean, they can t write stuff that isn t true!  I can t tell you how often I hear that. So Trump s gonna  I don t know how he s gonna deal with this. He will, but  (sigh) Let me  I m gonna go ahead and get in trouble myself here. Can I give you what I think might have happened with a lot of people when they first saw this BS story?What do you think? You re driving around or you re reading or whatever and you hear,  Trump wants to register all Muslims!  (interruption) Yeah. (chuckles) Get my drift? So I m just marveling here. I m thankful for the opportunity. I m thankful I haven t retired. I m thankful I ve still got this program and a chance to come here every day and illustrate the dishonest, the reprehensible, the just scummy way these people work. And each time I see something like this, I focus even more on,  They re not media!  This isn t media! This isn t the news. The media is the Democrat Party. The media is all part of the left-wing establishment that s trying to advance the Democrat Party agenda.Every time I see a story like,  Trump has to fight media here or overcome media,  I ask: Why would you have to overcome the media? The media s just a bunch of journalists telling people what happened who weren t there. (thumps table) Of course, this is the exact opposite. Everybody knows now, or many people. And even people who know what the media is, still get sucked in and believe this stuff. But when you read the transcript of what Trump said, when you actually read it or hear it and then compare it to the news being reported, you can t escape the fact that the media s making it up; that Trump never said it.Read more: Rush Limbaugh\"],[\" Thank you, President Trump, for those words of comfort and for denouncing those who promote violence and hatred  -Susan Bro, mother of Charlottesville attack victim Heather Heyer.Susan Bro, mother of Charlottesville attack victim Heather Heyer, thanks Pres.

Abdullah Muflahi owns the Triple S Food Mart, where the events of that fateful night took place. Now, he has filed a lawsuit against the police. The suit alleges that in the aftermath of the murder of Alton Sterling, whom Muflahi allowed to sell his CD s out front of the store, Muflahi was taken into custody like a common criminal, where the cops took his cell phone, along with surveillance video of the shooting. All of this was done without a warrant, which is definitely illegal, and reeks of a cover-up. The suit says of what happened: At all times defendants knew that plaintiff Muflahi was only a witness to the events at his store and that being a witness did not entitle police to hold plaintiff in custody or seize or commandeer his store and store equipment. Of course, the cops are not talking about these new developments. Muflahi is suing the cops who shot Sterling, as well as the city of Baton Rouge itself. Also named in the lawsuit are the investigating officers and the Baton Rouge police chief. There was no warrant for any of the store s surveillance footage until roughly five hours after the cops murdered Alton Sterling, so they had no right to immediately take that footage, and at no point should Abdullah Muflahi been taken into custody for any reason. He was a witness to a crime committed by the Baton Rouge police. He is not the criminal here.The document that requested the warrant claimed that Sterling did not put his hands on the hood of a car when he was told to do so, and therefore tasers were used. They saw what they believed to be a gun sticking out of Sterling s pocket, and therefore they tased him. Now, anyone with knowledge of tasers knows that they incapacitate the average person pretty well. There was no need to shoot and kill him, but of course the cops claim otherwise: When the subject attempted to reach for the gun from his pocket, the officers fired their police-issued duty weapon at the subject to stop the threat. I d be willing to bet they erased what footage they could, along with any video on the cell phone they unlawfully took from Abdullah Muflahi. It will be just as doctored as the stories they are telling regarding the shooting itself. This is nothing more than the police doing their damndest to keep their murderous brothers in blue out of an indictment and possible prison time.Featured image via Mark Wallheiser\\u002fGetty Images\"],[\"Planned Parenthood workers are sick and tired of being harassed by conservative pricks, and they aren t taking it anymore.Damien is an employee at a Planned Parenthood in Oregon and he was asked by the aunt of a teen boy to give her nephew the sex talk because the boy s mother didn t feel comfortable teaching the boy about sex and the his school lacks a sex ed program.And so, Damien gladly took up the task and later wrote about the experience on Tumblr. Today a 16-year-old boy was brought into the clinic by his aunt to  have the talk  because his school didn t teach sex ED and his mother wouldn t talk to him about sex. She spent 40 bucks so he could get tested for the first time. I spent an hour talking to this young boy about sex. I got to have the sex talk with him. I showed him how to properly use a condom and protect himself and his partners. We talked about STDs and pregnancy prevention. We even talked about pubic grooming and ways to avoid razor burn. This poor boy has never had someone talk to him about anything related to the changes his body is going through. And then we spent 20 minutes talking about consent and how important it is. Growing up I never, ever had someone talk to me about consent and its importance. I even had sex ED in school! This shit is important ya ll. Of course, it didn t take long for a conservative troll to notice the post and start harassing Damien and trash talking Planned Parenthood. It is the parents  duty to have  the talk  with their kids, not a government funded organization that murders babies,  the troll commented.Damien didn t sit back and allow the right-wing troll to get away with it. He ruthlessly fired back. First of all f*cktruck: I am not a government employee. My wages are not paid by the government. Second: zero babies have ever been murdered in a planned parenthood. I didn t say a god damn word about abortion but you had to get your f*cking tighty whiteys in a bunch because an organization that you know nothing about is doing good things for millions of people and you hate it. Shut your face up about shit you don t understand you f*cking dump truck. Abortion is murder, just because they re in the womb doesn t change the fact you re killing an innocent human being,  the right-wing troll continued to insist.  As I said, it s not a faceless organization s job to provide sex ed while simultaneously killing unborn children. The right-wing troll has slapped Damien with a glove so he picked up a gauntlet and smacked back on behalf of women everywhere. Listen up kiddo: Abortion isn t murder. Murder is illegal. Abortion is not illegal. IE abortion is not murder. As I said (and we ll go with what I said as not total bullshit because it s obvious you have absolutely no real knowledge when it comes to sex or reproduction and i think we can thank your parents for that) this young man had a single mother that didn t feel comfortable talking to him about sex. So i did it. I provided medically accurate and up to date information unlike so many parents today. And by the way, planned parenthood isn t some shadowy faceless organization. For example, this is my face. The face i made while reading your stupid ass response.

Obama will undoubtedly choose a radical to replace one of the most conservative voices on the US Supreme Court. This would be the final nail in America s coffin, as  Obama s fundamental transformation of America would be complete. This nomination is every bit as serious as the person we nominate for President of the United States. When you have a court loaded with justices who have no regard for our US Constitution and choose to instead, legislate from the bench, our freedoms will no longer be protected and our nation will be doomed WATCH OBAMA PUBLICLY BULLY and attempt to embarrass anyone who stands in his way: https:\\u002f\\u002fyoutu.be\\u002f1ITQXYyNo1wPresident Obama called on Senate Republicans Tuesday to give his eventual Supreme Court nominee a fair hearing in his bid to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia, as cracks emerged in the Republican leadership s position of automatically blocking any nominee. I expect them to hold hearings. I expect them to hold a vote,  Mr. Obama said at a press conference.  There s no unwritten law that says it can only be done on off years. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican, and others including presidential candidates Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Marco Rubio of Florida have vowed to block any Obama nominee, saying the next president should select Justice Scalia s replacement.Mr. Obama blasted that rationale. This is the Supreme Court, the highest court in the land,  the president said.  It s the one court where we would expect elected officials to rise above day-to-day politics. I understand the stakes. I understand the pressure that Republican senators are undoubtedly under. This would be a deciding vote. But that s not how the system is supposed to work. Even before Mr. Obama stated his case, there were signs that Republican unity was wavering on the notion of blocking any nominee out of hand.Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, Iowa Republican [Phone: (202) 224   3744], didn t rule out confirmation hearings and a vote by his panel on an Obama selection.You can voice your opinion on Senator Chuck Grassley s Facebook page by clicking HERE. I would wait until the nominee is made before I would make any decision,  Mr. Grassley said Tuesday in a conference call with Iowa radio reporters.  In other words, take it a step at a time. Asked whether he thought the controversy over filling the court vacancy might endanger his re-election chances this fall, Mr. Grassley said,  I think I have a responsibility to perform, and I can t worry about the election. I ve got to do my job as a senator, whatever it is. And there will be a lot of tough votes between now and the next election. His comments appeared to be a softening from a statement shortly after Justice Scalia s death, when Mr. Grassley said it was  standard practice  not to nominate or confirm candidates for the Supreme Court in an election year. It only makes sense that we defer to the American people who will elect a new president to select the next Supreme Court Justice,  Mr. Grassley said in a statement Saturday.Sen. Thom Tillis, North Carolina Republican [Phone: (202) 224-6342] , voiced caution about blocking any Obama nominee automatically.You can voice your opinion on Senator Thom Tillis  Facebook page by clicking HERE. I think we fall into the trap if [we] just simply say, sight unseen, we fall into the trap of being obstructionists,  Mr. Tillis said on Tyler Cralle s radio show.But Mr. Tillis added of the president,  If he puts forth someone that we think is in the mold of President Obama s vision for America, then we ll use every device available to block that nomination. A top aide to Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, Nevada Democrat, responding to Mr. Tillis  comments, predicted that Mr. McConnell will eventually retreat from his stance of blocking any Obama nominee without a hearing.

Jim Jordan (R-OH) went on CNN in an attempt to promote Trumpcare. Unfortunately, he didn t anticipate being taken to the woodshed by host Chris Cuomo.Cuomo pushed back on Jordan s agenda and absolutely refused to let him get away with praising the new Republican health care plan without acknowledging the fact that literally MILLIONS of Americans will lose their health insurance thanks to Trump and the GOP. Cuomo also railed against Jordan s vision, stating that a  free market  for health insurance has never been executed anywhere else in the world, because all other developed countries make sure their citizens have health coverage. Cuomo said: You use government as if it s a bad word in this context, but to be fair, there is no place that you ll find that has this kind of marketplace when it comes to health insurance. You re saying it like it s something that should be understood. It s never existed anywhere else that you can point to, and remember, you have to be okay with having less people having health insurance to get some people to have it cheaper. Jordan tried to say that he wanted all people to have better insurance,  but Cuomo saw right through his bullsh*t and promptly called him out: They will lose coverage. The way you re fixing it right now millions of people may lose their coverage, you need to own that. Jordan could barely come up with a response to that other than a pathetic promise that those who got their health coverage through Obamacare would eventually be transitioned into the new system.You can watch Cuomo rip Jordan apart below:Featured image is a screenshot\"],[\"Two avid Democrats took to Twitter this week to bring a little more public exposure to an issue far too many people are beginning to ignore: party infighting. Susan Sarandon and Deborah Messing, women well-known for being champions of liberal causes, ended up in a Twitter battle that could only be referred to as unfortunate.The incident occurred when Sarandon, in an interview with MSNBC, seemed to come out in support of the  Bernie or Bust  movement that has huge numbers of Bernie Sanders supporters vowing to either stay home or support Donald Trump if Sanders loses the Democratic nomination:Susan Sarandon backing Bernie Sanders is no secret, and certainly there s nothing wrong with it. Unfortunately, the growing movement inside the Sanders support base to take such a harsh stance of another Democrat to the point that you would cut off your own nose to spite your face by allowing a Republican   especially Donald Trump   into the White House just doesn t make sense. The language Sarandon used seemed to say she would go so far as to support Donald Trump, which fellow actress Jamie Lee Curtis just couldn t let slide:I respect but disagree with @SusanSarandon. A possible support of Trump over @HillaryClinton is dangerous 2 women, minorities & immigrants.  Jamie Lee Curtis (@jamieleecurtis) March 29, 2016Sarandon cleared that up immediately, tweeting back:Of course I would never support Trump for any reason.

Sarandon is suggesting that Bernie supporters aren t necessarily Democrats but Independents and even Republicans. Her support for her candidate is unwavering. It s unfortunate that she felt the need to attack Secretary Clinton the way she did, but she is entitled to her opinion. Messing was also sticking to her convictions, which seem to be more consistent with putting a Democrat in the White House regardless of the nominee.#BernieOrBust is perhaps the most absurd political movement considering if the senator loses the primaries he will undoubtedly throw his support behind Clinton. Clinton has already proven what she will do if she loses when she not only supported Barack Obama in 2008 but called for a quorum call nomination at the Democratic National Convention that both ended the voting and united the party around a single candidate.The candidates will continue their battle because that s what candidates do. Their supporters will continue to support them because that s what they do.

He s attracted the most extreme elements of the Republican Party, and even the Ku Klux Klan is on board with his demonization of minorities and women. Now, Trump s extremist fan base has gone international with an endorsement from  Golden Dawn members, a far right neo-Nazi party in Greece which has a presence in the Greek parliament. In the new video, Trump is praised as a man who  doesn t fear to speak the truth. Watch video here:[youtube https:\\u002f\\u002fwww.youtube.com\\u002fwatch?v=oCwXFVhe6DE]Ilias Panagiotaros is a leading member of the party and he s on board with Trump s policies. Penagitaros has praised Hitler for having a  great personality.  Panagiotaros, along with Golden Dawn, has been linked to multiple offenses like murder, aggravated assault, trafficking, kidnapping, money laundering and extortion by the Greek government.Of particular excitement to Panagiotaros is when Trump infamously used a Mussolini quote to describe himself and then defended himself from the outrage, saying,  What difference does it make if it was Mussolini or somebody else,  Trump said.  It s a very good quote. As a result of the Greek economic collapse and the Syrian refugee crisis, Golden Dawn, which has an anti-capitalist platform and is anti-immigration, has gained more of a following. Thus, it should be of no surprise that Donald Trump has some racist fans in the international arena since his platform of denying Muslims entry into the US and building a wall to keep Mexicans out are comparable to that of this organization.The hope is that Donald Trump, along with the creepy Ted Cruz, who is likely even more racist than Trump with his personal brand of xenophobia, will never get to the presidency because if one of these men do, this country and its people are in deep trouble.

Similar rulings were later issued in Virginia, Massachusetts and Washington state.U.S. District Court Judge Ann Donnelly ruled in favor of a habeas corpus petition filed by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) on behalf of two Iraqi men who were detained at John F. Kennedy International Airport on Friday after Trump signed his order.Donnelly, who was nominated by former President Barack Obama and confirmed to her judgeship in 2015, ruled in the Eastern District of New York that  there is imminent danger that, absent the stay of removal, there will be substantial and irreparable injury to refugees, visa-holders, and other individuals from nations subject  to Trump s order.

The Clinton family s mega-charity took in more than $140 million in grants and pledges in 2013 but spent just $9 million on direct aid. The group spent the bulk of its windfall on administration, travel, and salaries and bonuses, with the fattest payouts going to family friends. On its 2013 tax forms, the most recent available, the foundation claimed it spent $30 million on payroll and employee benefits; $8.7 million in rent and office expenses; $9.2 million on  conferences, conventions and meetings ; $8 million on fund-raising; and nearly $8.5 million on travel. None of the Clintons are on the payroll, but they do enjoy first-class flights paid for by the Foundation. In all, the group reported $84.6 million in  functional expenses  on its 2013 tax return and had more than $64 million left over   money the organization has said represents pledges rather than actual cash on hand. Some of the tens of millions in administrative costs finance more than 2,000 employees, including aid workers and health professionals around the world. But that s still far below the 75 percent rate of spending that nonprofit experts say a good charity should spend on its mission. Charity Navigator, which rates nonprofits, recently refused to rate the Clinton Foundation because its  atypical business model . . . doesn t meet our criteria.  Charity Navigator put the foundation on its  watch list,  which warns potential donors about investing in problematic charities. The 23 charities on the list include the Rev. Al Sharpton s troubled National Action Network, which is cited for failing to pay payroll taxes for several years. Other nonprofit experts are asking hard questions about the Clinton Foundation s tax filings in the wake of recent reports that the Clintons traded influence for donations.  It seems like the Clinton Foundation operates as a slush fund for the Clintons,  said Bill Allison, a senior fellow at the Sunlight Foundation, a government watchdog group once run by leading progressive Democrat and Fordham Law professor Zephyr Teachout. In July 2013, Eric Braverman, a friend of Chelsea Clinton from when they both worked at McKinsey & Co., took over as CEO of the Clinton Foundation. He took home nearly $275,000 in salary, benefits and a housing allowance from the nonprofit for just five months  work in 2013, tax filings show. Less than a year later, his salary increased to $395,000, according to a report in Politico. Braverman abruptly left the foundation earlier this year, after a falling-out with the old Clinton guard over reforms he wanted to impose at the charity, Politico reported. Last month, Donna Shalala, a former secretary of health and human services under President Clinton, was hired to replace Braverman. Nine other executives received salaries over $100,000 in 2013, tax filings show. The group also failed to disclose millions of dollars it received in foreign donations from 2010 to 2012 and is hurriedly refiling five years  worth of tax returns after reporters raised questions about the discrepancies in its filings last week.Via: NY Post\"],[\"Donald Trump just couldn t wish all Americans a Happy New Year and leave it at that.

Many conspiracy theories are built on the notion of  cui bono    who benefits   without following up the supposed motive with facts.But that is essentially what the U.S. intelligence community has done regarding the dangerous accusation that Russian President Vladimir Putin orchestrated a covert information campaign to influence the outcome of the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election in favor of Republican Donald Trump.Just a day after Director of National Intelligence James Clapper [image, left] vowed to go to the greatest possible lengths to supply the public with the evidence behind the accusations, his office released a 25-page report that contained no direct evidence that Russia delivered hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton s campaign chairman John Podesta to WikiLeaks.The DNI report amounted to a compendium of reasons to suspect that Russia was the source of the information   built largely on the argument that Russia had a motive for doing so because of its disdain for Democratic nominee Clinton and the potential for friendlier relations with Republican nominee Trump.But the case, as presented, is one-sided and lacks any actual proof. Further, the continued use of the word  assesses    as in the U.S. intelligence community  assesses  that Russia is guilty   suggests that the underlying classified information also may be less than conclusive because, in intelligence-world-speak,  assesses  often means  guesses. The DNI report admits as much, saying,  Judgments are not intended to imply that we have proof that shows something to be a fact. Assessments are based on collected information, which is often incomplete or fragmentary, as well as logic, argumentation, and precedents. But the report s assessment is more than just a reasonable judgment based on a body of incomplete information. It is tendentious in that it only lays out the case for believing in Russia s guilt, not reasons for doubting that guilt.A Risky BetFor instance, while it is true that many Russian officials, including President Putin, considered Clinton to be a threat to worsen the already frayed relationship between the two nuclear superpowers, the report ignores the downside for Russia trying to interfere with the U.S. election campaign and then failing to stop Clinton, which looked like the most likely outcome until Election Night.If Russia had accessed the DNC and Podesta emails and slipped them to WikiLeaks for publication, Putin would have to think that the National Security Agency, with its exceptional ability to track electronic communications around the world, might well have detected the maneuver and would have informed Clinton.So, on top of Clinton s well-known hawkishness, Putin would have risked handing the expected incoming president a personal reason to take revenge on him and his country. Historically, Russia has been very circumspect in such situations, usually holding its intelligence collections for internal purposes only, not sharing them with the public.While it is conceivable that Putin decided to take this extraordinary risk in this case   despite the widely held view that Clinton was a shoo-in to defeat Trump   an objective report would have examined this counter argument for him not doing so.But the DNI report was not driven by a desire to be evenhanded; it is, in effect, a prosecutor s brief, albeit one that lacks any real evidence that the accused is guilty. Further undercutting the credibility of the DNI report is that it includes a seven-page appendix, dating from 2012, that is an argumentative attack on RT, the Russian government-backed television network, which is accused of portraying  the US electoral process as undemocratic. The proof for that accusation includes RT s articles on  voting machine vulnerabilities  although virtually every major U.S. news organizations has run similar stories, including some during the last campaign on the feasibility of Russia hacking into the actual voting process, something that even U.S. intelligence says didn t happen.The reports adds that further undermining Americans  faith in the U.S. democratic process, RT broadcast, hosted and advertised third-party candidate debates.  Apparently, the DNI s point is that showing Americans that there are choices beyond the two big parties is somehow seditious. The RT hosts asserted that the US two-party system does not represent the views of at least one-third of the population and is a  sham,  the report said. Yet, polls have shown that large numbers of Americans would prefer more choices than the usual two candidates and, indeed, most Western democracies have multiple parties, So, the implicit RT criticism of the U.S. political process is certainly not out of the ordinary.The report also takes RT to task for covering the Occupy Wall Street movement and for reporting on the environmental dangers from  fracking,  topics cited as further proof that the Russian government was using RT to weaken U.S. public support for Washington s policies (although, again, these are topics of genuine public interest).Behind the CurtainThough it s impossible for an average U.S. citizen to know precisely what the U.S. intelligence community may have in its secret files, some former NSA officials who are familiar with the agency s eavesdropping capabilities say Washington s lack of certainty suggests that the NSA does not possess such evidence.Binney, in an article co-written with former CIA analyst Ray McGovern, said,  With respect to the alleged interference by Russia and WikiLeaks in the U.S. election, it is a major mystery why U.S. intelligence feels it must rely on  circumstantial evidence,  when it has NSA s vacuum cleaner sucking up hard evidence galore. What we know of NSA s capabilities shows that the email disclosures were from leaking, not hacking. For instance, that s the view of William Binney, who retired as NSA s technical director of world military and geopolitical analysis and who created many of the collection systems still used by NSA.There is also the fact that both WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and one of his associates, former British Ambassador Craig Murray, have denied that the purloined emails came from the Russian government. Going further, Murray has suggested that there were two separate sources, the DNC material coming from a disgruntled Democrat and the Podesta emails coming from possibly a U.S. intelligence source, since the Podesta Group represents Saudi Arabia and other foreign governments Continue this article at Consortium NewsREAD MORE  RUSSIAN HACK  NEWS AT: 21WIRE Russia Files\"],[\"One of the many targets of the opposition research firm Fusion GPS is accusing them of assisting the Kremlin in its effort to have him  imprisoned and killed. The strong allegation comes from Bill Browder, a London-based banker who spearheaded the Magnitsky Act, a sanctions law vehemently opposed by the Russian government.Browder made the allegation in response to the recent revelation that Fusion GPS and its founder Glenn Simpson compiled what he says is false information about him that was given to Yuri Chaika, Russia s prosecutor general, and to Donald Trump Jr. during the infamous June 2016 Trump Tower meeting. If it is true that Glenn Simpson was supplying information about me to the Russian government, it s far more serious than smear campaigning or Foreign Agents Registration Act violations,  said Browder, the head of Hermitage Capital. It would mean that Simpson was assisting the Putin regime in their plot to get me back to Russia to have me imprisoned and killed.It was previously known that the Washington, D.C-based Fusion GPS s investigation of Browder was beneficial to the Russian government and its effort to reverse the Magnitsky Act. But it was revealed only last week that information Fusion collected on Browder was shared directly with Chaika, whose position is the Russian equivalent of the U.S. attorney general.Natalia Veselnitskaya, the Russian attorney who attended the Trump Tower meeting, is who provided both Chaika and Trump Jr. with the Fusion-generated information on Browder. She took a four-page report into the June 9, 2016 Trump Tower meeting, which was attended by Jared Kushner and then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort.Veselnitskaya worked with Simpson, a former Wall Street Journal reporter, on the anti-Browder project. Reuters reported on Thursday that Simpson compiled the research for the Trump Tower memo. And NBC News reported on Friday that similar research put together by Simpson was given by Veselnitskaya to Chaika in Oct. 2015.Browder, who was born in Chicago but is a British citizen, is a target of the Kremlin s ire because of his role in pushing through the Magnitsky Act, which passed Congress in 2012. The Russian government recently issued an Interpol arrest in an attempt to apprehend Browder. Vladimir Putin reportedly approved the move against the 53-year-old money manager, who wrote a book about his travails called  Red Notice,  a reference to the term used for Interpol warrants.Fusion GPS, which is based in Washington, D.C., became involved in the Browder matter after being hired by BakerHostetler, a law firm representing Denis Katsyv, a Russian businessman who faced penalties because of the Magnitsky Act.Simpson worked closely on the investigation with the Moscow-based Veselnitskaya, who represents Katsyv and his firm, Prevezon Holdings.Veselnitskaya s affiliation with Simpson is one of the stranger story lines arising from both the Trump Tower meeting and the dossier, which was funded by the Clinton campaign and DNC.Theories have circulated that Fusion GPS arranged the Trump Tower meeting in order to compromise the Trump campaign or that Simpson relayed details of the meeting provided by Veselnitskaya to Christopher Steele, the former British spy who wrote the dossier.Fusion was being paid for its dossier work at the same time it was being paid by BakerHostetler to investigate Browder.Adding even more fuel to those theories was a report this week that Simpson and Veselnitskaya met just before and just after she attended the Trump Tower session:BUSTED! MEETING BETWEEN FUSION GPS AND RUSSIAN LAWYER BEFORE AND AFTER:The co-founder of Fusion GPS, the firm behind the unverified Trump dossier, met with a Russian lawyer before and after a key meeting she had last year with Trump Jr. The contacts shed new light on how closely tied the firm was to Russian interests, at a time when it was financing research to discredit then-candidate Donald Trump.The opposition research firm has faced renewed scrutiny after litigation revealed that the DNC and Hillary Clinton s campaign paid for that research. Congressional Republicans have since questioned whether that politically financed research contributed to the FBI s investigation of Russian collusion with the Trump campaign   making Fusion s 2016 contacts with Russian interests all the more relevant.DNC MONEY FUNNELED THROUGH LAW FIRM TO FUSION GPS?The June 2016 Trump Tower meeting involving Donald Trump Jr. and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya occurred during a critical period. Bank records show Fusion GPS was paid by a law firm for work on behalf of a Kremlin-linked oligarch while paying a former British spy Christopher Steele to dig up dirt on Trump through his Russian contacts.But hours before the Trump Tower meeting on June 9, 2016, Fusion co-founder and ex-Wall Street Journal reporter Glenn Simpson was with Veselnitskaya in a Manhattan federal courtroom. Court records show email correspondence and published reports corroborate the pair s presence together. They also were together after the Trump Tower meeting.Read more: Fox NewsRead more: Daily Caller\"],[\"Hillary Clinton s State Department was one of those agencies which signed off on the deal.Nine shareholders connected to Uranium One contributed a combined $145 million to the Clinton Foundation before or during the time the review took place.

The department said many federal prosecutors appointed in the Obama administration have already left their positions, but that Sessions is now seeking the resignations of 46 holdovers.It is customary, though not automatic, for the country s 93 U.S. attorneys to leave their positions once a new president is in office. The Obama administration allowed political appointees of President George W. Bush to serve until their replacement had been nominated and confirmed.The federal prosecutors are nominated by the president, generally upon the recommendation of a home-state senator.One U.S. attorney appointed by Bush, Rod Rosenstein of Maryland, remained on the job for the entire Obama administration and is the current nominee for deputy attorney general.U.S. attorneys are responsible for prosecuting federal crimes in the territories they oversee. They report to Justice Department leadership in Washington, and their priorities are expected to be in line with those of the attorney general.Via: AP \"],[\"There is no reason to believe the welfare of our veterans would be a priority for Obama after he leaves office, considering they were never a priority for the 8 years he occupied the White House.A charity group that helps homeless military veterans on Chicago s South Side says the city is trying to take control of the meager facility to make way for the restaurants, shops and other commercial venues that would complement the proposed Obama presidential library and museum.Group leaders said the RTW Veterans Center is the last privately-owned property on a stretch of S. King Boulevard near the proposed Washington Park site for the Barack Obama Presidential Center and that city building inspectors unexpectedly arrived last April to find an overwhelming 32 code violations at the facility. We don t appreciate being muscled out and put in the situation of having to negotiate from a position of despair,  facility center Director Jah Ranu Menab told FoxNews.com on Saturday.Menab thinks the University of Chicago, which is working with the Obama Foundation to bring the presidential center to the South Side, is also part of an apparent effort to ultimately force the facility into receivership.The fate of the veterans  facility   which officials say serves more than 3,000 meals monthly   may well be decided Tuesday, when officials return to Cook County Circuit Court for a hearing on the efforts to fix the building s problems.Menab admits that the facility is in disrepair, with some violations related to a fire hazard, rats  nests and raw sewage flowing onto the basement floor.However, he says the situation, which includes fines of $16,000 daily, looks like an attempted  land grab  and that the prestigious university, where Obama was a law professor,  exerts a tremendous amount of influence  over the city and its future.The university strongly denies any involvement in the city s dealings with the center and its building and on Friday issued the following statement: The mission of providing support for veterans is extremely important, and numerous University of Chicago community members have volunteered their time at the RTW Veterans Center. The university is not engaged in discussions regarding the center s property and has no plans to purchase it. Veterans  center co-founder Daniel  Doc  Habeel, a Vietnam War veteran, acknowledged Saturday that people associated with the university have indeed volunteered time. But he also expressed uncertainty about the university s involvement. The not-for-profit facility, which receives no government funding, cited in a press release Wednesday a history of building inspectors in other places forcing a worn-out building into receivership so a prospective developer is  eventually able to acquire the property without having to negotiate. The city says the fines are not being enforced and that the case landed in court because numerous 311 calls led inspectors to visit the facility, where they learned about the severity of the problems, including a structurally unsafe porch.

The Root had its own take: Perhaps Spicer needed some time to compose the  alternative facts  he knew he d have to present after Salmon-Skin Stalin said Tuesday that the new budget has enough money for a down payment on the wall, and Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), the Senate Appropriations Committee s ranking Democratic member, responded on Twitter with,  To be clear, there is NO funding in this bill for ANY kind of down payment on construction of a new border wall. Or, maybe Spicer was nervous about responding to Trump s tweets from earlier Tuesday insisting that the government needed a  good shutdown.' While some blindly loyal Trump supporters are saying that he just owned the press, unfortunately for their narrative and for Spicey here, answering questions he doesn t necessarily like or want to answer is part and parcel of his job. He doesn t get to run away when he doesn t want to talk, or without explaining that his time is getting cut short for something else. Really, Spicer just got owned here.Featured image via screen capture from embedded video\"],[\"FBI agents say the bureau is alarmed over Director James Comey s decision to not suggest that the Justice Department prosecute Hillary Clinton over her mishandling of classified information.According to an interview transcript given to The Daily Caller, provided by an intermediary who spoke to two federal agents with the bureau last Friday, agents are frustrated by Comey s leadership. This is a textbook case where a grand jury should have been convened, but was not. That is appalling,  an FBI special agent who has worked public corruption and criminal cases said of the decision.  We talk about it in the office and don t know how Comey can keep going. The agent was also surprised that the bureau did not bother to search Clinton s house during the investigation. We didn t search their house. We always search the house. The search should not just have been for private electronics, which contained classified material, but even for printouts of such material,  he said. There should have been a complete search of their residence,  the agent pointed out.  That the FBI did not seize devices is unbelievable. The FBI even seizes devices that have been set on fire. Another special agent for the bureau who worked counter-terrorism and criminal cases said he is offended by Comey s saying:  we  and  I ve been an investigator. After graduating from law school, Comey became a law clerk to a U.S. District Judge in Manhattan and later became an associate in a law firm in the city. After becoming a U.S. Attorney in the Southern District of New York, Comey s career moved through the U.S. Attorney s Office until he became Deputy Attorney General during the George W. Bush administration.After Bush left office, Comey entered the private sector and became general counsel and Senior Vice President for Lockheed Martin, among other private sector posts. President Barack Obama appointed him to FBI director in 2013 replacing out going-director Robert Mueller. Comey was never an investigator or special agent. The special agents are trained investigators and they are insulted that Comey included them in  collective we  statements in his testimony to imply that the SAs agreed that there was nothing there to prosecute,  the second agent said.  All the trained investigators agree that there is a lot to prosecuted but he stood in the way. He added,  The idea that [the Clinton\\u002fe-mail case] didn t go to a grand jury is ridiculous. According to Washington D.C. attorney Joe DiGenova, more FBI agents will be talking about the problems at bureau and specifically the handling of the Clinton case by Comey when Congress comes back into session and decides to force them to testify by subpoena.DiGenova told WMAL radio s Drive at Five last week,  People are starting to talk. They re calling their former friends outside the bureau asking for help. We were asked today to provide legal representation to people inside the bureau and agreed to do so and to former agents who want to come forward and talk. Comey thought this was going to go away.

Still, after so many other similar events recorded throughout recent history   all followed by similarly predictable political fall-outs and effects   the general public are still slow to grasp what is really happening before their eyes. The event in Dallas falls into a similar pattern of other high-profile  sniper  attacks, all of which were stage false flag events designed with a particular political, or geopolitical purpose in mind.Regarding last night, here s what we know so far The plot: According to law enforcement officials, at least 5 police officers were shot and killed with another 7 wounded, after 3 or 4 alleged snipers described as  radical left-wing  and armed  militant black activists , fired from surrounding buildings into an 800-strong  Black Lives Matter  protest crowd who were marching in downtown Dallas, Texas. Amazingly, we re told that only one civilian was reportedly injured. IMAGE: #BlackLivesMatter protesters rally around recent victims Philando Castile and Alton Sterling (Photo: Indian Express\\u002f Reuters).Protesters are said to have been marching against the recent police shootings of two black men in the cities of Baton Rouge, Louisiana and also in St. Paul, Minnesota.The following onlookers  videos were released from the Dallas incident. Watch: Amazingly, by late last night and early this morning, police Chief David Brown reported that at least 3 of suspected snipers were already in custody.Brown stated early on that he believed the four suspects were working as a unit, using long-range rifles,  triangulated at elevated positions at difference places in the downtown area. The fourth suspect, Micah Xavier Johnson (the media referred to him as  Micah X  to intentionally prompt a Malcolm X tone to the event), we are told was a  military-trained  US Army veteran, who was said to be caught in a shoot-out with police from the second floor of the El Centro parking garage. He was upset about Black Lives Matter, the recent police shootings, he was upset at white people. He wanted to kill white people, especially police officers,  Brown said. (NY Post)  Bizarrely, according to police, Johnson (photo, above) was finally summarily executed by police after an unprecedented  risk assessment  by the Dallas police   who deployed a  robot carrying a bomb.  Chief Brown claimed that his officers  had no choice  but to use the bomb to kill the suspect:  Other options would have exposed our officers to grave danger. The political ripple effects of this unlikely and highly improbable event were felt immediately, as the mainstream media siege was underway, and the politicians began lining up to weigh-in and jockey for political position on any number of issue ranging from gun control, to race relations, and police brutality, but also debating the whether or not public marches and demonstrations are indeed  safe for the public  to attend in the face of this latest  security threat. On the police side of this dialectic, law enforcement are also queuing up to decry the violence against police and calls are omnipresent for increased police powers and security measure in order to  combat the rising threat of domestic extremism. Coincidentally, yesterday s event just happened to all on July 7th, or  7\\u002f7  ala London 7\\u002f7.  Following on that theme, the media and law enforcement began floating the term  terrorist attack  and CNN leading the pack by claiming that Dallas 7\\u002f7 was the police s  worst loss since  9\\u002f11  (Sept 11, 2001). So one can see how the spin is already being applied to this media event.The Maidan MassacreBack February 2014, events transpired in Kiev, Ukraine which sparked international outrage and calls for  regime change  in Kiev, and served as the key catalyst for a coup d etat and the ouster of Ukraine s democratically elected president Viktor Yanukovych.  A leaked phone call between EU foreign affairs chief Catherine Ashton and Estonian foreign affairs minister showed how there was knowledge at the highest levels of European government, but western leaders opted to maintain a disinterested stance in the face of this new evidence. Listen to the phone call here: Earlier this year, in January 2016, one such academic investigation concluded that the sniper event at Maidan Square was in fact a  false flag  event which was used to create a false public perception of events and usher in a shift in political power in that country. Canadian political science professor Dr. Ivan Katchanovski of Ottawa University concluded that This academic investigation concludes that the massacre was a false flag operation, which was rationally planned and carried out with a goal of the overthrow of the government and seizure of power,  wrote Katchanovski in his study, called  The  Snipers  Massacre  on the Maidan in Ukraine. Despite all these revelations, the US, UK and the EU are still standing by their earlier narrative of the sniper massacre as a,   Euromaidan democratic, peaceful mass-protest movement and a  color  revolution led by pro-Western parties. Ukraine s own internal investigation into the matter has been shown to be a highly political exercise, which appears to have resulted in a comprehensive cover-up of what really happened on the day.Snipers in Homs, SyriaIn the early days of what western governments and media were portraying as an  Arab Spring  color uprising in Syria in 2010 and 2011, unknown snipers played a crucial role in advancing a  strategy of tension  and fomenting civil unrest, particularly in the city of Homs. Snipers were reported as firing on citizens and also shooting at police indiscriminately. The western media s policy was not to report on this, but only to report on the state security reaction and crack-down triggered by these mysterious and seemingly random acts of violence.Some independent writers and researchers have reported on the anomalies of the Homs shootings, but as yet, no in-depth investigation has taken place.However, the testimony of Father Frans Van der Lugt in Homs, provided a look into what was happening during this ugly phase of a western and GCC-backed rebellion being waged in Syria: From the start, the protest movements were not purely peaceful. From the start I saw armed demonstrators marching along in the protests, who began to shoot at the police first. Very often the violence of the security forces has been a reaction to the brutal violence of the armed rebels. It s clear now after looking back at numerous reports about these incidents, that they were designed to instigate a crisis, which would ultimately lead to either a political instability and civil unrest.The other aspect of these false flag  events, is that they have the potential to also redefine the relationship between the public and the state and its security apparatus.In each instance, a  regime change  was expected, although this was not completely successful in the case of Syria.The Dallas DeceptionThe Dallas Shooting is significant on a number of levels.Firstly, Dallas will further accentuate the artificial divide between what Americans perceive as the  Left  or liberal wing of political society, and the what is sold as America s  Right  or conservative wing. In this dialectic, Democrat is set against Republican, young against old, black is pitted against white, wealthy against poor, upper class against middle class, and even middle class against lower class. In the run-up to the Presidential election in November, this division will be important in order to polarize America along a prefabricated dialectical line and thus keeping the national discourse down at a base, or emotional level   and through this binary process avoid any real examination of America s fundamental issues, policy flaws and the federal government s unsustainable bloated borrow & spend habit   effectively kicking the can down the road another 4 years (which seems to be the norm). Ultimately, this serves the state, its bureaucratic stakeholders and the power structure as a whole. Secondly, this event can be used to nudge the  left-wing  and Democrat party s own gun control agenda, which is being aggressively pursued at the moment. This wing of the political establishment has already demonstrated that it has no qualms about using a national incident or tragedy, like the Orlando Shooting, as warm PR leverage to push their  emergency  legislative agenda. Ironically,  left-wing  and black activists will be blamed for this latest act of political violence and will be used in this case to further advance the political left s own bespoke gun control agenda   much to the dismay of  Conservative America. As a result of this staged event carried out by agent provocateurs,  anti-police  or  anti-government  African-American  militant , or  Black Power  activists will be painted a poor light, and effectively marginalized. Once this process is complete, the state can then move in to extend that marginalization to any  anti-government  protests   further neutering any real grass-roots opposition for what is obviously a rapidly growing police state in the US.Thirdly, this event is being used to increase tension between the public and law enforcement. Note the differences between the short and the long-term narratives at play here. In the short-term, this Dallas Sniper event is originally designed as a  reaction  to US police killing poor unarmed black men on the streets of America, but in the long-term the pendulum will swing back to the state in order to  restore law and order , thus further consolidating power into a more concentrated police state. This is evidenced already by US law enforcement are already rallying in solidarity, in an  us against them  dialectic by placing the nation s police as the protagonist and the public as the antagonist.This obvious dialectical theme is already being echoed internationally on Twitter, as police in the US and the UK advance the term  Thin Blue Line :The Thin Blue Line stretches across the country tonight. We stand by you @DallasPD #Dallas #ThinBlueLine pic.twitter.com\\u002fzyiFJWYFDh  NYPD 108th Precinct (@NYPD108Pct) July 8, 2016It should be noted here that the colloquial policing term Thin Blue Line is derived from the term Thin Red Line , which describes as an inferior, outnumbered force holding back the hordes. The original reference of this comes from a Battle of Balaclava   fought by the Highland Infantry Brigade for the British Army during the 19th century Crimean War. Explained: The Thin Red Line has become an English language figure of speech for any thinly spread military unit holding firm against attack. The phrase has also taken on the metaphorical meaning of the barrier which the relatively limited armed forces of a country present to potential attackers.  (Wiki)It s important to understand the symbolism behind this term  Thin Blue Line  which is currently being invoked by law enforcement. It implies an  us against them  dialectical narrative, arguably, quite far and remote from the familiar peace officer-oriented slogan  Protect and Serve.   Finally, this event will be used to reinforce and heighten the ever-increasing profile of America s bizarre new post-9\\u002f11 Cult of the First Responder, which appears to be an extension of the  Cult of Our Boys , a lionization campaign which was developed by the Pentagon over years of mass US troop deployment in two highly unpopular wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The main thrust of the effort to glorify and assert to preeminence of the First Responder is part and parcel of a wider US agenda to fully militarize US domestic society, and to characterize US public life as a combat zone, or domestic war zone which society devolves its authority and constant crisis management over to America s new unified command structure and Gendarmerie   the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and the FBI.Between the 1960 s and 1990 s, Operation GLADIO saw numerous staged terror events carried out in Europe in order to advance a  strategy of tension . All of the alleged  terrorist  attacks during this time were later proven to be the work not of terrorists, but of the security and intelligence services. Many innocent civilians died, and still to date, no one has been convicted, much less brought before a court or public hearing on a dirty state-sponsored program which many believe is still running to this day, albeit in one form or another.Expect the political rhetoric to spin out of control with each media cycle over the next 72 hours, before fading into Monday. Such is the nature of the Daily Shooter in these troubled and fleetingly real times.Stay tuned here for more stories and updates on the Dallas Deception.READ MORE DALLAS SHOOTING NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Dallas Shooting FilesSupport our work by subscribing and becoming a member @21WIRE.TV\"],[\"From the White House website:First Lady of the United States Melania Trump is the wife of President Donald J. Trump, and was born on April 26, 1970 in Slovenia.The official White House portrait of the graceful and elegant First Lady Melania Trump: Melania Knavs began her modeling career at the age of sixteen. She would pursue a degree at the University of Ljubljana in Slovenia, but paused her studies to advance her modeling career in Milan and Paris before moving to New York in 1996. As a model, Melania has appeared in high profile ad campaigns and worked with some of the top photographers in the fashion industry, including Patrick Demarchelier, Helmut Newton, Arthur Elgort, Ellen Von Unwerth, Peter Arnell, Antoine Verglas and Mario Testino. She has graced the covers of Vogue, Harper s Bazaar, British GQ, Ocean Drive, Avenue, In Style, and New York Magazine. Her major layouts include the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue, Allure, Vogue, Self, Glamour, Vanity Fair, and Elle. In addition, Melania has appeared in numerous television commercials and television programs, including co-hosting The View with Barbara Walters.With a penchant and passion for the arts, architecture, design, fashion and beauty, Melania has thrived on the cultural diversification of New York City. This passion can only be surpassed by her dedication to helping others, and her generosity has been noted. She was Honorary Chairwoman for Martha Graham Dance Company in April 2005, is an active member of the Police Athletic League which honored her with Woman of The Year 2006, has been an Honorary Chairwoman for The Boy s Club of New York for five consecutive years, and in 2005 The American Red Cross awarded her with Goodwill Ambassador which she has proudly served for four years. In April of 2008, she was asked by Love Our Children USA and NASDAQ to participate in the Fifth Annual National Love Our Children Day and the beginning of National Child Abuse Prevention month by ringing the closing bell at NASDAQ. In 2010, Melania was the Chairwoman for The American Heart Association which raised $1.7 Million for research. Melania s philanthropic interests represent her humanitarian side, and she remains an indefatigable and dedicated New Yorker.Melania married Donald Trump in January 2005. In March of 2006 they welcomed their first child, Barron William Trump.Melania is also a successful entrepreneur. In April 2010, Melania Trump launched her own jewelry collection.In 2006, Melania Trump proudly became a citizen of the United States of America. She is only the second First Lady born outside of the United States. The first was Louisa Adams, wife to John Quincy Adams, the nation s sixth president.Mrs. Trump cares deeply about issues impacting women and children, and she has focused her platform as First Lady on the problem of cyber bullying among our youth.We don t recall seeing Michelle Obama s official portrait, but we re guessing it looked something like this:The scowl on her face pretty much symbolized Michelle Obama s 8 torturous years, as the most angry First Lady to ever occupy our White House. \"],[\"No matter what you think about Buzzfeed publishing a dossier of unverified information about Trump, threatening the free press with  consequences  should never be tolerated.But that s exactly what Donald Trump did during his first press conference in six months after the contents of the report went viral.On Tuesday, Buzzfeed released a dossier of alleged information gathered by Russia to use against Trump, which included a claim that he was videotaped at the Ritz Carlton in Moscow paying prostitutes to pee on the bed in the presidential suite that President Obama had used during previous visits to the nation.Predictably, Trump lashed out on Twitter.Russia just said the unverified report paid for by political opponents is  A COMPLETE AND TOTAL FABRICATION, UTTER NONSENSE.

As far as BuzzFeed, which is a failing pile of garbage   writing it   I think they re going to suffer the consequences,  Trump said.Here s the video via YouTube.Trump went on to have a shouting match with CNN s Jim Acosta and accused the news organization of being  fake news  as his minions applauded.Donald Trump is a serious threat to the free press. And he s only making things worse for himself by making such accusations.Fox News politics editor Chris Stirewalt warned Trump to be careful earlier on Wednesday, basically noting that Trump only has himself to blame. I would caution Trump and his supporters about this: This is what they asked for when they praised Julian Assange and Wikileaks to the high heavens and said,  We don t care where it came from. We don t care if it s verified. It s been stolen but it s bad for the Democrats and now the truth is out so here you go. Featured Image: Screenshot\"],[\"Here s a 1999 video of Jesse Jackson praising Donald Trump for his contribution to the black community, awarding him with a lifetime achievement award for African Americans:What a difference a few years (and an [R] behind your name can make:WFB   While speaking to a crowd at the  Ministers March for Justice  Rev. Jesse Jackson suggested that President Trump should be worried about gaining citizenship in heaven. Trump says you must be able to speak the language of English, [be] qualified, and have a job skill,  Jackson said Monday.  Jesus would not qualify to come in Trump s country he would not qualify to get into Jesus  kingdom. It s difficult to understand Jackson in the video below, as he mumbles through much of his commentary. (For translation, see quotes above):The  Ministers March for Justice,  was spearheaded by Rev. Al Sharpton and featured ministers from various traditions united in opposing the Trump administration. The event took place on the 54th anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr. s March on Washington, and Jackson did not shy away from using religious language to judge the president.After judging Trump s ability to enter heaven, he quoted part of a passage from the Gospel of Matthew, in which Jesus says what he will tell his followers at the Final Judgment.Is the notorious shake down artist Jesse Jackson really one to be deciding who will and who will not be given admittance to heaven? In 2006, government watchdog Judicial Watch released a report that revealed new details about the intimidation and shakedown tactics of Jesse Jackson s Rainbow Push Coalition.WND   The report,  Jesse Jackson Exposed,  claims Jackson is  an extortionist who uses his influence as a civil rights leader to essentially blackmail wealthy corporations with absurd discrimination threats. Included, the group says, are  incriminating admissions from Jackson made under oath at trial. Among the tactics highlighted in the report are:Jackson lobbied the Federal Communications Commission to block companies seeking government approval to merge until they donate money to Rainbow Push.Jackson publicly chastised Toyota for running an ad Jackson deemed  racist.  After Toyota pulled the ad, Jackson threatened a boycott the automaker to force it to launch a $7.8 million  diversity program. Jackson installed one of his friends, J.L. Armstrong, in a management position at Toyota to determine which organizations would receive $700 million in contracts awarded by Toyota.Minority businesses pay Jackson s  Trade Bureau  a fee to help extort lucrative contracts from corporations. During the trial, Jackson compared the Trade Bureau to  Noah s Ark,  claiming minority businesses and organizations had to be inside the  ark  to survive. Judicial Watch brought the lawsuit against Jackson, his son Jonathan Jackson and Rainbow Push Coalition on behalf of Rev. Jesse Lee Peterson, a black minister and founder of the Los Angeles-based Brotherhood Organization for a New Destiny.Peterson wrote a book titled,  Scam,  that takes Jackson to task as one of America s  self-appointed  black leaders. I don t recall the entire black race in this country taking a national vote to elect Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton, Louis Farrakhan, the NAACP, California Congresswoman Maxine Waters, the Congressional Black Caucus or liberal black preachers as our leaders,  Peterson writes,  yet they ve seized the mantle of leadership and claim to speak for all blacks in this nation. Another expose of Jackson, Kenneth Timmerman s book  Shakedown: Exposing the real Jesse Jackson,  goes back several decades, including his ordination as a reverend. I describe a two to three year process for earning that title,  Timmerman said.  Jesse Jackson got himself ordained two months after Martin Luther King was shot. It was essentially a  political ordination,  a  shotgun ordination.  He did not go through the long procedure. He was not licensed to preach, as far as I could determine. I went to the church where he was ordained. He did not go through this two-year process. He never submitted himself to the authority of the church. He has never had a church himself, and he has been accountable to no one.  Timmerman asserts Jackson  is not doing things to help the black community. Jesse Jackson is   to help himself first. \"],[\" The person who received the most votes free from interference or tampering needs to be in the White House. It may well be Donald J. Trump, but further due diligence is required to ensure that American democracy is not threatened. 21st Century Wire says Although the election was called on Nov 8th, the Democratic Party s ongoing campaign to delegitimize the new incoming President is still ongoing. For those of us with long enough memories, the Democratic Party, their media operatives and the Clinton Campaign were claiming that Trump and the GOP would be engaged in this very same behavior after Hillary Clinton won the Presidency (as expected).Notice how the shoe is now on the other foot.It s interesting reading past stories by  news  sources linked to the Clinton Campaign and John Podesta as Politico has, who ran a feature on Aug 16th entitled,  Why the GOP Will Never Accept President Hillary Clinton  which lays out the case of Hillary s lock on the White House and how the evil Republicans will not accept her eventual election victory. Will Donald Trump respect the peaceful transition of power?  howled CNN s Wolf Blitzer in the run-up to the election. The question now is: will the Democrats respect the result, and simply  Move On,  as they say?Of course, we now know that  journalists  like Wolf at CNN were getting their talking points directly the Clinton Campaign.As it turns out, the only thing illegitimate about the 2016 Election  was the mainstream corporate media. More form the Guardian  John Swane The GuardianA growing number of academics and activists are calling for US authorities to fully audit or recount the 2016 presidential election vote in key battleground states, in case the results could have been skewed by foreign hackers.The loose coalition, which is urging Hillary Clinton s campaign to join its fight, is preparing to deliver a report detailing its concerns to congressional committee chairs and federal authorities early next week, according to two people involved.The document, which is currently 18 pages long, focuses on concerns about the results in the states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. I m interested in verifying the vote,  said Dr Barbara Simons, an adviser to the US election assistance commission and expert on electronic voting.  We need to have post-election ballot audits.  Simons is understood to have contributed analysis to the effort but declined to characterise the precise nature of her involvement.A second group of analysts, led by the National Voting Rights Institute founder John Bonifaz and Professor Alex Halderman, the director of the University of Michigan s center for computer security and society, is also taking part in the push for a review, and has been in contact with Simons.In a blogpost early on Wednesday, Halderman said paper ballots and voting equipment should be examined in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, warning that deadlines were rapidly approaching. Unfortunately, nobody is ever going to examine that evidence unless candidates in those states act now, in the next several days, to petition for recounts,  he said.The developments follow Clinton s surprise defeat to Donald Trump in the 8 November vote, and come after US intelligence authorities released public assessments that Russian hackers were behind intrusions into regional electoral computer systems and the theft of emails from Democratic officials before the election Continue this article at The GuardianREAD MORE ELECTION NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire 2016 Files \"],[\"The Republican Party has long claimed that  states  rights  mean that states can do as they like according to their own values, regardless of what the federal government wants. Of course, this is something that has just been used for southern states to do horrible things   like, you know, own people. They used the states  rights argument to justify segregation, to outlaw interracial marriage and abortion, and to basically strip citizens of personal liberty to satisfy the bigots in their citizenry and voting base. Well, comedian Bill Maher of HBO s Real Time has turned all of that on its head in the Trump era.During his  New Rules  segment on Friday night s program, Maher turned it around on the Republicans, pointing out how California s governor, Jerry Brown, is busily defending California s liberal way of life in defiance of Trump s regressive and dangerous administration. Gov. Brown has decided to sign a climate treaty with China, giving a big middle finger to Trump s foolish decision to pull out of the Paris Accord. Maher also pointed out that California will not move to enforce Trump s racist deportation force through its police departments, and nor would there be any attacks on LGBTQ Americans.The real kicker came when Maher adopted a country accent and mocked the insanity of the bigotry of Trump voters   only using it to promote progressive values, such as legalized marijuana and lesbian weddings. He even mocked the tiki torches used last month in a horrifically violent white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, that left 32-year-old Heather Heyer dead and injured many others.In short, Bill Maher is right.

This is because Trump s own staffers are sick of his erratic, lawless behavior, his intemperate late night rants on Twitter, and the general chaos of this White House. Now that the cloud of suspicion and scandal hanging over the White House due to the investigation into possible collusion between the 2016 Trump campaign and the Russian government to fix an election has darkened considerably over the last few weeks, the leaks just keep coming.The latest one is hilarious, because it was a set of talking points to deal with the news cycle regarding the revelation that Department of Justice Special Counsel Robert Mueller is now investigating Trump himself for obstruction of justice.

The First Amendment separates church from state for two reasons: to protect the church and the state. Religious Freedom is the ability to worship how you choose on your own time. However, if a public school, funded by public taxpayer dollars that is for all citizens regardless of religion, has something that puts one faith over another, that s not  freedom,  it s promoting a Theocracy.So, when the Freedom From Religion Foundation sent a letter about removing a Bible verse from a website to the Troup Independent School District in Troup, Texas   mind you, a public school district open to all   this sent many ill-informed people into a tizzy.One of those ill-informed people, who still has every right to worship her God on her time, is Brittany Taylor. Taylor is the parent of two kids that go to Troup ISD. She was beyond angry that the public school district would take down the Bible verse that read,  As Goliath moved closer to attack, David quickly ran out to meet him.  She thinks that even though public and held to the Constitution to separate any church from any state-run place, the school should be able to promote Christianity.Taylor said: We support our school fully, they kind of had their hands tied in the situation. We wanted to fight back for them. There s literally nothing to fight back about. Yet, what did she do? Make T-Shirts that read  Our God is bigger  for students, including her own children, to wear. She s literally putting out the argument that many often satirize of  my God is bigger than your God  in the clash over religion and religious freedom.Sam Grover, Freedom of Religion Foundation, said: Under the federal constitution, a government entity like a school district can t endorse one religious belief over others or religion generally over non religion. Which is exactly correct.Quite honestly, her kids should be free to wear whatever they want, but the school itself cannot and should not promote any religion. Public school is not a church, and thus not the time nor place for public worship of any God. Yet everyone is still perfectly free to worship on their own time. No one is losing any form of freedom. No one.Of course, Taylor believes she s being  told  what to do, because you know, she doesn t understand how the Constitution actually works. She said,  It will be in our children s hearts and they will not stop praising God because a group told them to.  No one told your kids not to worship. Nope. Not at all, but okay.All that these parents are doing is making a point they clearly don t need to make. But really, if you re gonna be stupid, the least you could do is leave your kids out of it.Watch the coverage of this story via KYTX: Featured image via video screen capture\"],[\"This is totally unpresidential behavior.Throughout the campaign, Donald trump repeatedly attacked Senator Elizabeth Warren by calling her  Pocahontas  just because Warren has Native American ancestry.Warren fired back on multiple occasions and often destroyed Trump to the point where he stopped attacking her.Trump s nasty attacks on Warren were outrageous during the campaign, and they are even more outrageous now that he occupies the White House as the so-called  President of the United States. During a meeting with Republican and Democratic senators on Thursday, Trump brought up Warren s effort to read a letter by Coretta Scott King to the Senate in which King condemned Jeff Sessions  racism and voiced her opposition to his nomination for a federal judgeship back in 1986.As Warren tried to read the letter, Mitch McConnell silenced her and Republicans voted to basically censure her because they claim the letter impugned Sessions   character.  You know, because calling out a racist has somehow become a bad thing in our society.Politico reports,According to participants in Thursday s meeting, Trump referred to Warren several times as  Pocahontas,  the moniker he gave her during his campaign, and told the Democrats he was glad Warren is becoming the face of  your party. Seriously. Trump actually referred to a sitting United States Senator as  Pocahontas,  which at this point should be considered a racial slur the way he is using it. Republicans apparently had no problem with Trump s disgraceful attack on Warren.Trump is no longer a bombastic political candidate trying to get attention. He is the f*cking president now and this kind of behavior is embarrassing and stains the dignity of the office.Make no mistake, Donald Trump not only owes Warren and the Democratic Party an apology, he owes America an apology.This kind of behavior is intolerable and he should be ashamed of himself.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla\\u002fGetty Images\"],[\"The social rot continues in a city that was miraculously cleaned up on Mayor Giuliani s watch.

It passed by a 40-9 vote in the liberal-leaning council.It aims to keep offenders from getting a permanent criminal record and requires the NYPD to  develop guidance  for cops on when to issue criminal instead of civil summonses.\"],[\"The San Jose Police Department has been plagued with accusations of racism and racial profiling, and now they re getting sued for it. A black family alleges that an officer followed them home from picking up their seven-year old daughter, and held them at gunpoint for absolutely no reason other than they were black, and the father, Emmanuel Stephens, might have matched the description of a  suspicious black man  in the area. The family is suing for an unspecified amount in damages.The first question that many people will ask themselves when faced with a like this is, what did this family do that caused the officer to draw his gun?According the lawsuit, they did nothing, and it s that kind of question that perpetuates racism in the justice system, because nobody asks themselves that when the victim is white. Officer Alexander Keller followed them home, and then when they got out of their car, he got out of his and drew his gun. The officer also put Stephens in handcuffs and held him in the back of his patrol car for a while. Their car was searched, and Stephens was cited for possession of a small amount of pot, despite having it for medical reasons and producing a prescription to prove it.Worse, when their 14-year old daughter came out, she was threatened with a trip to Juvenile Hall if she went back to get her cell phone and record the whole sordid incident.Their lawyer said: What happened to my clients happens all the time and is a real problem.This type of police misconduct only gets attention when someone ends up dead, but this type of non-lethal harassment is much more widespread and also need to be brought to light and stopped. The department, however, says that there isn t any bias in their policing methods despite strong evidence to the contrary, and this situation would seem to be another piece of that evidence. Another cop later said that someone had reported a suspicious black man with a purple backpack in that area, but Stephens had no such backpack. Keller proceeded to profile him anyway.Even if Stephens did have such a backpack, there was no way for this officer to see that from his car when he decided to follow them, hold them at gunpoint, detain Stephens, and search their car without a warrant and without probable cause. Being black does not constitute probable cause.San Jose s police department is like many others, though. Black people are guilty until proven innocent, and are treated as such. Had this been a white family, and someone had reported a suspicious white man in their area, would Keller still have followed them home and drawn his gun on them? Searched their car without a warrant or evidence of wrongdoing? Cited him for medical marijuana for which he had a prescription?Very likely not.Featured image by David Paul Morris\\u002fGetty Images\"],[\"On Saturday, the internet was shocked to learn of the apparent sudden death of former Happy Days and Joanie Loves Chachi star, Erin Moran, who was only 56.

I m sorry if that s cold, but God gave you a brain, gave you the will to live and thrive and you gotta take care of yourself,  Baio told the radio hosts.  I m saddened by what happened. I don t know if it was drugs that killed her, I read one report said it might have been and I hope it   I don t know what I hope. It s what it is. What can you do? She was just an insecure human being and fell into this world of drugs and alcohol.

What was offensive was his harsh judgment of, regardless of how she died, a sick woman.

Shoppers have been spending at a pace not seen since the Great Recession, says Craig Johnson, president of retail consulting group Customer Growth Partners. The Wall Street Journal reported sales were up for retailers like Macy s and Wal-Mart. The Wall Street Journal even mentioned that spending was up in all income categories, as shoppers were encouraged by rising wages and low unemployment, but failed to attribute any of the retailer s success to President mention Trump:Retailers are enjoying some extra Christmas cheer.Fueled by high consumer confidence and a robust job market, U.S. retail sales in the holiday period rose at their best pace since 2011, according to Mastercard SpendingPulse, which tracks both online and in-store spending.Sales, excluding automobiles, rose 4.9% from Nov. 1 through Christmas, compared with a 3.7% gain in the same period last year, according to the Mastercard Inc. unit, which tracks all forms of payment. E-commerce continued to drive the gains, rising 18.1%. Overall, this year was a big win for retail,  Ms. Quinlan said.That newfound buoyancy is a relief to retailers from department-store giants like Macy s Inc. to mall favorites like Gap Inc. that struggled through a difficult year of store closures, declining foot traffic and bankruptcies by chains including the Sports Authority, Toys  R  Us and Payless Shoes.Investors, who have abandoned many retail stocks even as the broader stock market surged, have started to return. Shares of Macy s and Gap, for example, have jumped 24% and 18%, respectively, in the past month, compared with a 3% gain in the S&P 500. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. has rallied 40% on the year and, like online nemesis Amazon.com Inc., is trading near all-time highs. Unlike in past years, when spending was driven by high-income shoppers, this holiday season a broader swath of the population opened their wallets, encouraged by rising wages and low unemployment, analysts and economists said. Fewer people are living paycheck to paycheck,  said Chris Christopher, executive director of economic-research firm IHS Markit.  There is a lot more spending from the lower- and middle-income groups, while the upper-income groups are splurging. Fox Business News reported the amazing Christmas season sales, but neglected to mention President Trump s positive effect on the economy:Retailers are finally enjoying some Christmas cheer.Fueled by high consumer confidence and a robust job market, U.S. retail sales in the holiday period rose at their best pace since 2011, according to Mastercard SpendingPulse, which tracks both online and in-store spending.Sales, excluding automobiles, rose 4.9% from Nov. 1 through Christmas Eve, compared with a 3.7% gain in the same period last year, according to the Mastercard Inc. unit, which tracks all forms of payment. E-commerce continued to drive the gains, rising 18.1%. It started with a bang in the week leading up to Black Friday,  said Sarah Quinlan, a senior vice president of marketing insights at Mastercard. She added that retailers benefited this year from Christmas Day falling on a Monday, giving shoppers a full weekend to scoop up last-minute purchases. Dec. 23 ranked next to Black Friday in terms of spending, according to Mastercard.Via: Gateway Pundit\"],[\"It s no secret Hispanics hate Donald Trump. He has record low favorability with them, and there are no signs that support with them will rise in the coming months. GOP Hispanic leaders and pundits alike, from Republican governor Susana Martinez to CNN s Ana Navarro, have been chastising and distancing themselves from the Republican nominee for President.And another influential Hispanic group is distancing themselves from the nominee in the most public way possible.The Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, which endorsed Ohio governor John Kasich, will be publicly backing Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, and will announce their endorsement live from Cleveland at the RNC.Talk about the ultimate trolling.President of the Chamber, Javier Palomeraz, denounced Trump to the Huffington Post, saying his divisive and racist rhetoric is the reason the group will be backing Clinton:We believe it is appropriate for us to weigh in and say enough is enough   What we re hearing from Donald Trump in his campaign: divisive, mean-spirited language [that] has marginalized Hispanics, immigrants, American POWs, Muslims, women, the disabled   and the list goes on.After public spats with Palomeraz, in which Trump cancelled events planned, the Clinton campaign was right there to attend, listen, and learn about the needs of Hispanic business owners. The Clinton campaign also was repeatedly in touch with the Chamber in an effort to reach out to communities using a slew of business leaders familiar with their needs.No wonder they re endorsing Clinton. It s no secret that the U.S. Chamber of Commerce is pro-Republican, pro-Conservative. But their opinion isn t the only representation of business in America.While Trump flunks the presidential test (yet again), Clinton picks up the pieces and offers her hand in support. It s no wonder more unions and business leaders have endorsed her than Trump. The Republican nominee looks out for one person and one person only   himself.Featured image via Ethan Miller\\u002fGetty Images\"],[\"Two years ago, 15-year-old Monique Tillman and her brother, like kids everywhere across the country, were riding their bikes. Unlike kids everywhere, Tillman was stopped for nothing more than the apparent crime of Riding While Black.Tillman and her brother made the mistake of cutting through a mall parking lot and running into Tacoma Police Officer Jared Williams, who was moonlighting as mall security. Williams then stopped the pair, telling them they were trespassing and that they might be banned from the mall.The children tried to explain that they ride through that parking lot all the time and they tried to leave. What happened after that might not be suitable for work.Here s the video:If you don t have the stomach to watch the video, the girl is snatched from her bike by the off-duty officer and slammed up against a car while he appears to be choking her. He then grabbed her hair and began throwing her around. He even tased her. He was choking me, grabbed me by my hair and tried to slam my face into the concrete. The next thing I know, I m on the ground being tased,  Tillman said.Source: Free Thought ProjectThen, after it was clearly shown in the video that the girl never even raised a hand toward the officer, she was charged for resisting arrest and assault on an officer for allegedly attempting to kick him. That s right, she was charged for assault. Fortunately, those charges were thrown out after there was no evidence that she tried to kick at all, and a lawsuit has been filed against Officer Williams, the security company and the people who own the mall. A child riding a bike should not have to worry that a police officer will stop her without legal cause and brutalize her,  said (Tillman s attorney, Vito) de la Cruz.  Our communities are weary of another African American child being hurt by unwarranted and excessive police force. Tillman, who is now a digital media student at Bates Technical College, had this to say: I feel like I was targeted because I am a person of color,  Tillman told the Seattle Times.  It was frustrating because I knew I didn t do anything wrong, but I couldn t stop them. Here s Tillman, now 17, talking about the incident, saying all she wants is an apology:Williams still has his job.Featured image via video screen captures\"],[\"On December 9, an unidentified 41-year-old mother was killed in a hotel room during an attempt by five family members to exorcise a demon which they claim was possessing her.According to authorities, the woman s family exerted massive force on her chest and stomach area,  as well an extreme amount of  violence to her neck.  A towel and a clothes hanger were shoved down her throat, reportedly to keep her from screaming.Prosecutors say that the woman was subjected to at least two hours of  pain and agony,  before she finally died from a combination of asphyxiation and traumatic injuries, all of which were sustained during the  exorcism. The killers include a 44-year-old female relative, along with the relative s children, a 21-year-old son, 19-year-old daughter and 15-year-old son. The 15-year-old son of the woman who was killed is also suspected of participating in the violence.Instead of calling police or paramedics after the woman died, the family called a priest.The priest immediately notified authorities, who ultimately discovered the woman s body at the Frankfurt InterContinental hotel.A second victim was later found, another 41-year-old woman, who is believed to be another family member. She was discovered inside a garage.According to Fox 10 in Phoenix, the second victim was taken to a hospital, where she was treated for hypothermia, dehydration and undisclosed injuries.The family involved in the woman s murder is South Korean, and had recently relocated to the Frankfurt, Germany area.The practice of exorcising demons, known as anchal-gido, is common among Charismatic Christians living Korea.As reported here and here, the western media often refers to these exorcisms as  Shamanism  when in fact they are legitimized by the Protestant Church in Korea.As Kyung Hong explains in the International Journal of Religion and Spirituality: anchal gido rituals are their own kind of abuse, since they often involve forms of physical violence against those deemed to be possessed.  The intensity of the healing prayers for cleansing demonic spirits also often accompanies intense physical contact in the belief that physical assaults intimidate and assist to expel demons. Thus, the healing ritual may well become so intense as to involve physical striking, beating, poling, or choking the possessed individual, though each action is viewed by the healers as attacking the demon, not the person. There is a similarity between Korean exorcism and shamanic rituals, but the latter often lacks the violence and is more about appeasing unfriendly nature or ancestral spirits than outright spiritual warfare. Religion Watch reports that in Korea, protestant women  who are seen as demon possessed are often viewed as disobedient to their husbands and are subject to shame and condemnation, even in their deaths. The facts about anchal-gido don t fit in with the western narrative of the Christian religion.When 18-year-old Rayoung Kim was killed in her home during a similar exorcism in Fairfax County, Virginia, the media reported that her death was due to a  Shamanistic exorcism,  although the facts in the case show that she died during the type of violent exorcism that is associated with anchal-gido, not kut or mudang, as the media routinely reported.The Shamanistic ritual of Kut involves singing, dancing and offering sacrifices. It is not associated with the violent  driving out of demons,  seen in these cases.That is far more typical of Korean Charismatic Christianity.In the case of the women killed in Frankfurt, the most telling sign that the family was conducting the kind of violent, Christian exorcism associated with anchal-gido is that the first person they called was a priest.Here in the U.S. we are constantly subjected to right-wing propaganda about the violent nature of the Muslim religion. At the same time, the media often presents us with a filtered version of current events, especially as they pertain to the Christian religion.Whether this is done purposely or out of ignorance and unconscious bias is up for debate.Either way, had this family killed a relative during a religious ceremony associated with Islam, the right wing would be all over that. In this case, however, the narrative will no doubt seek to shift the blame away from the Christian church and onto  Shamanism,  without a shred of evidence or single fact to support that theory.*Featured image credit: Michal via Flckr, CC 2.0\"],[\"Donald Trump recently gave a speech to the American Legion about the plans he has in mind for the children of America, and if he got his way it would affect every single one of them. But it would also break the law.Trump, playing to an audience with obvious military ties, brought up the idea of enforcing patriotism on children as part of the school curriculum.Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump signaled Thursday plans to seek nationwide changes to school curricula with the goal of  promoting American pride and patriotism in America s schools. In a Trump administration, I plan to work directly with the American Legion to uphold our common values and to help ensure they are taught to America s children,  Trump said, speaking at the American Legion s annual convention in Cincinnati.While the candidate argued that  We want our kids to learn the incredible achievements of America s history, its institutions and its heroes,  doing so from the presidency would, in fact, break the law.Military Times, in their coverage of Trump s remarks, points this fact out:The comments suggested a federal government intervention in the programs of locally run schools, which is prohibited under federal law.The comment is also ironic, as Trump has repeatedly claimed that he is opposed to Common Core because it supposedly imposes a top-down federal program in schools. In reality, the Common Core seeks to raise educational standards by rewarding local schools for improvements in their curriculum devised in the way they see fit, not as a top-down federal mandate.It is also unclear what brand of patriotism Trump would decide to enforce on American children. Throughout the campaign, he has advocated the idea that in his view certain races and faiths   particularly the Latino race and Muslim religion   are inferior and not worthy of Constitutional protections, when the actual Constitution makes no such distinctions. How could someone with that view seriously define patriotism for American children in all 50 states?Featured image via Flickr\"],[\"Speaker of the House Paul Ryan is officially a total sellout! He agreed to a $1.1 trillion omnibus spending bill with Obama late Wednesday night that increases unskilled guest workers allowed into America significantly. Under the bloated $1.1 trillion bill, the number of H-2B visas will nearly be up as much as four times as the previous levels. This allows unskilled illegals into this country to drive down wages. There is always the chance terrorists are embedded in the increase in visas as well. So it s business as usual in Washington where the american people come last #FIREPAULRYAN! The year-end spending deal unveiled early Wednesday morning includes a provision that would increase the number of guest worker visas available to unskilled foreign nationals seeking employment in the U.S.According to Ian Smith, an attorney with the Immigration Reform Law Institute, language inserted into the omnibus spending deal would nearly quadruple the number of H-2B visa workers admitted to the U.S. next year to about 250,000.The section of the more than 2,000-page omnibus bill that contains the provision, the immigration reduction group NumberUSA reports, is on page 701. It reads: SEC. 565. Section 214(g)(9)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1184(g)(9)(A)) is amended by striking  2004, 2005, or 2006 shall not again be counted toward such limitation during fiscal year 2007.  and inserting  2013, 2014, or 2015 shall not again be counted toward such limitation during fiscal year 2016. H-2B visas are intended for low-skilled foreign nationals to work temporarily in nonagricultural positions when American workers are unavailable. According to recent reports, however, some employers have abused the system, devising strategies to hire H-2B visa holders over American workers.Via: Breitbart\"],[\"Donald Trump Jr. is so furious over Johnny Depp s bad assassination joked that he wants Disney to fire the actor.Speaking in England on Thursday, Depp made a joke about actors assassinating presidents. When was the last time an actor assassinated a president? I want to clarify,  he continued,  I m not an actor. I lie for a living. However, it s been awhile, and maybe it s time. By the way, this is going to be in the press and it ll be horrible,  Depp acknowledged.  It s just a question; I m not insinuating anything. Well, the Pirates of the Caribbean star was right about the last part. His comments did end up  in the press  and it was  horrible.  Depp quickly realized that this bad joke was a mistake and apologized just hours later. I apologize for the bad joke I attempted last night in poor taste about President Trump,  he said in a statement to PEOPLE magazine.  It did not come out as intended, and I intended no malice. I was only trying to amuse, not to harm anyone. To be clear, no, jokes like this are not acceptable, especially in today s tense political climate.

President Obama, who believed in the diplomacy that Trump s immature machismo says is simply weakness (because why try diplomacy when you can fan your peacock feathers and strut?), always spoke eloquently on U.S. foreign policy and on war, and emphasized the necessity of working with the rest of the world to neutralize threats: Our greatest generation fought and bled and died to build an international order of laws and institutions that could preserve the peace and extend prosperity and promote cooperation among nations. And for all of its imperfections, we depend on that international order to protect our own freedom.In other words, we are a nation that, at our best, has been defined by hope, and not fear.

Three U.S. service members were injured and a Navy SEAL was killed.So what went wrong? Everything.Trump reportedly decided to go ahead with the raid over dinner after his cabinet convinced him it was the right thing to do by telling him that Obama would not have the balls to go through with him (seriously, that s all it took). According to a senior U.S. intelligence official,  almost everything went wrong  once the team arrived. Officials say Trump approved the attack without sufficient intelligence, ground support or adequate backup preparations.  On top of failing to kill his target, slaughtering civilians wholesale, murdering a U.S. citizen, and getting a SEAL killed with his bumbling mess of an operation, the intel that was gathered is garbage. The military is touting three videos they recovered from the raid as evidence of success   but the videos are a decade old and available on YouTube.Because of all this, Yemen has decided that they don t want Trump coming in and wrecking their living room again. The New York Times reports:Angry at the civilian casualties incurred last month in the first commando raid authorized by President Trump, Yemen has withdrawn permission for the United States to run Special Operations ground missions against suspected terrorist groups in the country, according to American officials.Grisly photographs of children apparently killed in the crossfire of a 50-minute firefight during the raid caused outrage in Yemen. A member of the Navy s SEAL Team 6, Chief Petty Officer William Owens, was also killed in the operation.While the White House continues to insist that the attack was a  success    a characterization it repeated on Tuesday   the suspension of commando operations is a setback for Mr. Trump, who has made it clear he plans to take a far more aggressive approach against Islamic militants. The fool of the White House got slapped at the beginning of his road in your lands, al-Rimi said in a video following Trump s failed raid. Yemen s decision not to let Trump play with his toys in their house is a bit uncomfortable for The Donald, who promised to step up our approach to fighting terrorism. Now that he is President, he has done nothing but hurt that effort.Watch a report on the raid below:Featured image via Getty Images\\u002fPool\"],[\"How many times will our lawless president plead his unconstitutional positions before our Supreme Court? For a Constitutional lawyer, Obama sure does have a difficult time understanding how our laws work President Barack Obama s executive action to shield millions of undocumented immigrants from deportation suffered a legal setback on Monday with an appeal to the Supreme Court now the administration s only option.The 2-1 decision by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans to uphold a May injunction deals a blow to Obama s plan, opposed by Republicans and challenged by 26 states.The Obama administration has said it is within its rights to ask the Department of Homeland Security to use discretion before deporting nonviolent migrants with U.S. family ties.The case has become the focal point of the Democratic president s efforts to change U.S. immigration policy.Seeing no progress on legislative reform in Congress, Obama announced last November he would take executive action to help immigrants. He has faced criticism from Republicans who say the program grants amnesty to lawbreakers.In its ruling, the appeals court said it was denying the government s appeal to stay the May injunction  after determining that the appeal was unlikely to succeed on its merits. Republicans hailed the ruling as a victory against the Obama administration.John Scalise, the No. 3 Republican in the House of Representatives, said in a Twitter message that the court decision was  a major victory for the rule of law.

He is anything but a  lame duck The United States could give control of one of the internet s underlying systems to the United Nations after pledging not to, it has been claimed.The government has announced plans to relinquish control of the online addressing and numbering system, turning it over to a private international organization.For years, the US Department Of Commerce has been responsible for managing URLs and ensuring they lead to the proper web pages.It has subcontracted the task to a private nonprofit, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (Icann).But the US government, which funded much of the internet s early development, has so far retained veto power.Although the US role has been minimal over the years, many foreign governments have complained that the internet can never be truly international if the US retains veto power.They have sought instead to shift responsibility to an inter-governmental body such as the UN International Telecommunication Union.But business, academic and civil-society leaders balked, worried that UN involvement would threaten the openness that has allowed the internet to flourish.Concerns were also raised that UN control would give authoritarian states like China and Iran equal votes among other countries in influencing policies that affect free speech.Lawrence E. Strickling, assistant secretary for communications and information at the Commerce Department, said the endorsed plan won t replace Commerce s role with a government-led or inter-governmental solution.But the UN could end up managing the addressing system after all, according to Wall Street Journal columnist L Gordon Crovitz. He based his theory on an inquiry by Americans For Limited Government, an advocacy group that sent a Freedom Of Information Act request related to Icann s future.Icann had asked for  all records relating to legal and policy analysis  concerning antitrust issues for Icann, Crovitz reported. Icann currently benefits from an antitrust exemption because it operates under government control, he said.The contract between Icann and the US government is expected to expire on September 30.

And some of it is by anti-establishment types trying to discredit American institutions with false reports.But as we document below   the government and mainstream media are by far the biggest purveyors of fake news.The Government s Been Deploying Propaganda On U.S. Soil for Many YearsThe United States Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities found in 1975 that the CIA submitted stories to the American press: After 1953, the network was overseen by Allen W. Dulles, director of the CIA. By this time, Operation Mockingbird had a major influence over 25 newspapers and wire agencies. The usual methodology was placing reports developed from intelligence provided by the CIA to witting or unwitting reporters. Those reports would then be repeated or cited by the preceding reporters which in turn would then be cited throughout the media wire services.The Office of Policy Coordination (OPC) was funded by siphoning off funds intended for the Marshall Plan [i.e. the rebuilding of Europe by the U.S. after WWII]. Some of this money was used to bribe journalists and publishers.In 2008, the New York Times wrote:During the early years of the cold war, [prominent writers and artists, from Arthur Schlesinger Jr. to Jackson Pollock] were supported, sometimes lavishly, always secretly, by the C.I.A. as part of its propaganda war against the Soviet Union. It was perhaps the most successful use of  soft power  in American history.A CIA operative told Washington Post owner Philip Graham  in a conversation about the willingness of journalists to peddle CIA propaganda and cover stories: You could get a journalist cheaper than a good call girl, for a couple hundred dollars a month. Famed Watergate reporter Carl Bernstein wrote in 1977: More than 400 American journalists  in the past twenty five years have secretly carried out assignments for the Central Intelligence Agency, according to documents on file at CIA headquarters. ***In many instances, CIA documents show, journalists were engaged to perform tasks for the CIA with the consent of the managements of America s leading news organizations.***Among the executives who lent their cooperation to the Agency were [the heads of CBS, Time, the New York Times, the Louisville Courier Journal, and Copley News Service. Other organizations which cooperated with the CIA include [ABC, NBC, AP, UPI, Reuters], Hearst Newspapers, Scripps Howard, Newsweek magazine, the Mutual Broadcasting System, the Miami Herald and the old Saturday Evening Post and New York Herald Tribune.***There is ample evidence that America s leading publishers and news executives allowed themselves and their organizations to become handmaidens to the intelligence services.  Let s not pick on some poor reporters, for God s sake,  William Colby exclaimed at one point to the Church committee s investigators.  Let s go to the managements.***The CIA even ran a formal training program in the 1950s to teach its agents to be journalists. Intelligence officers were  taught to make noises like reporters,  explained a high CIA official, and were then placed in major news organizations with help from management.***Once a year during the 1950s and early 1960s, CBS correspondents joined the CIA hierarchy for private dinners and briefings.***Allen Dulles often interceded with his good friend, the late Henry Luce, founder of Timeand Life magazines, who readily allowed certain members of his staff to work for the Agency and agreed to provide jobs and credentials for other CIA operatives who lacked journalistic experience.***In the 1950s and early 1960s, Time magazine s foreign correspondents attended CIA  briefing  dinners similar to those the CIA held for CBS.***When Newsweek was purchased by the Washington Post Company, publisher Philip L. Graham was informed by Agency officials that the CIA occasionally used the magazine for cover purposes, according to CIA sources.  It was widely known that Phil Graham was somebody you could get help from,  said a former deputy director of the Agency.  Frank Wisner dealt with him.  Wisner, deputy director of the CIA from 1950 until shortly before his suicide in 1965, was the Agency s premier orchestrator of  black  operations, including many in which journalists were involved. Wisner liked to boast of his  mighty Wurlitzer,  a wondrous propaganda instrument he built, and played, with help from the press.)***In November 1973, after [the CIA claimed to have ended the program], Colby told reporters and editors from the New York Times and the Washington Star that the Agency had  some three dozen  American newsmen  on the CIA payroll,  including five who worked for  general circulation news organizations.  Yet even while the Senate Intelligence Committee was holding its hearings in 1976, according to high level CIA sources, the CIA continued to maintain ties with seventy five to ninety journalists of every description executives, reporters, stringers, photographers, columnists, bureau clerks and members of broadcast technical crews. More than half of these had been moved off CIA contracts and payrolls but they were still bound by other secret agreements with the Agency. According to an unpublished report by the House Select Committee on Intelligence, chaired by Representative Otis Pike, at least fifteen news organizations were still providing cover for CIA operatives as of 1976.***Those officials most knowledgeable about the subject say that a figure of 400 American journalists is on the low side  . There were a lot of representations that if this stuff got out some of the biggest names in journalism would get smeared   .An expert on propaganda testified under oath during trial that the CIA now employs THOUSANDS of reporters and OWNS its own media organizations. Whether or not his estimate is accurate, it is clear that many prominent reporters still report to the CIA.A 4-part BBC documentary called the  Century of the Self  shows that an American   Freud s nephew, Edward Bernays   created the modern field of manipulation of public perceptions, and the U.S. government has extensively used his techniques.John Pilger is a highly-regarded journalist (the BBC s world affairs editor John Simpson remarked,  A country that does not have a John Pilger in its journalism is a very feeble place indeed ). Pilger said in 2007:We now know that the BBC and other British media were used by the British secret intelligence service MI-6. In what they called Operation Mass Appeal, MI-6 agents planted stories about Saddam s weapons of mass destruction, such as weapons hidden in his palaces and in secret underground bunkers. All of these stories were fake.***One of my favorite stories about the Cold War concerns a group of Russian journalists who were touring the United States. On the final day of their visit, they were asked by the host for their impressions.  I have to tell you,  said the spokesman,  that we were astonished to find after reading all the newspapers and watching TV day after day that all the opinions on all the vital issues are the same. To get that result in our country we send journalists to the gulag. We even tear out their fingernails. Here you don t have to do any of that. What is the secret? Nick Davies wrote in the Independent in 2008: For the first time in human history, there is a concerted strategy to manipulate global perception. And the mass media are operating as its compliant assistants, failing both to resist it and to expose it.The sheer ease with which this machinery has been able to do its work reflects a creeping structural weakness which now afflicts the production of our news. I ve spent the last two years researching a book about falsehood, distortion and propaganda in the global media.The  Zarqawi letter  which made it on to the front page of The New York Times in February 2004 was one of a sequence of highly suspect documents which were said to have been written either by or to Zarqawi and which were fed into news media.This material is being generated, in part, by intelligence agencies who continue to work without effective oversight; and also by a new and essentially benign structure of  strategic communications  which was originally designed by doves in the Pentagon and Nato who wanted to use subtle and non-violent tactics to deal with Islamist terrorism but whose efforts are poorly regulated and badly supervised with the result that some of its practitioners are breaking loose and engaging in the black arts of propaganda. ***The Pentagon has now designated  information operations  as its fifth  core competency  alongside land, sea, air and special forces. Since October 2006, every brigade, division and corps in the US military has had its own  psyop  element producing output for local media. This military activity is linked to the State Department s campaign of  public diplomacy  which includes funding radio stations and news websites. In Britain, the Directorate of Targeting and Information Operations in the Ministry of Defence works with specialists from 15 UK psyops, based at the Defence Intelligence and Security School at Chicksands in Bedfordshire.In the case of British intelligence, you can see this combination of reckless propaganda and failure of oversight at work in the case of Operation Mass Appeal. This was exposed by the former UN arms inspector Scott Ritter, who describes in his book, Iraq Confidential, how, in London in June 1998, he was introduced to two  black propaganda specialists  from MI6 who wanted him to give them material which they could spread through  editors and writers who work with us from time to time .The government is still paying off reporters to spread disinformation. And the corporate media are acting like virtual  escort services for the moneyed elites, selling access   for a price   to powerful government officials, instead of actually investigating and reporting on what those officials are doing.One of the ways that the U.S. government spreads propaganda is by making sure that it gets its version out first. For example, the head of the U.S. Information Agency s television and film division   Alvin A. Snyder  wrote in his book, Warriors of Disinformation: How Lies, Videotape, and the USIA Won the Cold War: All governments, including our own, lie when it suits their purposes. The key is to lie first. ***Another casualty, always war s first, was the truth. The story of [the accidental Russian shoot-down of a Korean airliner] will be remembered pretty much the way we told it in 1983, not the way it really happened.In 2013, the American Congress repealed the formal ban against the deployment of propaganda against U.S. citizens living on American soil. So there s even less to constrain propaganda than before.One of the most common uses of propaganda is to sell unnecessary and counter-productive wars. Given that the American media is always pro-war, mainstream publishers, producers, editors, and reporters are willing participants.It s not just lying about Saddam s non-existent weapons of mass destruction   the corporate media is still selling lies to promote war. While the older generation that pioneered these domestic propaganda techniques has passed from the scene, many of their prot g s are still around along with some of the same organizations. The National Endowment for Democracy, which was formed in 1983 at the urging of CIA Director Casey and under the supervision of Walter Raymond s NSC operation, is still run by the same neocon, Carl Gershman, and has an even bigger budget, now exceeding $100 million a year.Gershman and his NED played important behind-the-scenes roles in instigating the Ukraine crisis by financing activists, journalists and other operatives who supported the coup against elected President Yanukovych. The NED-backed Freedom House also beat the propaganda drums. [See Consortiumnews.com s  A Shadow Foreign Policy. ]Two other Reagan-era veterans, Elliott Abrams and Robert Kagan, have both provided important intellectual support for continuing U.S. interventionism around the world. Earlier this year, Kagan s article for The New Republic, entitled  Superpowers Don t Get to Retire,  touched such a raw nerve with President Obama that he hosted Kagan at a White House lunch and crafted the presidential commencement speech at West Point to deflect some of Kagan s criticism of Obama s hesitancy to use military force.***Rupert Murdoch s media empire is bigger than ever  .Another key to American propaganda is the constant repetition of propaganda. As Business Insider reported in 2013:Lt. Col. Daniel Davis, a highly-respected officer who released a critical report regarding the distortion of truth by senior military officials in Iraq and Afghanistan  .From Lt. Col. Davis:In context, Colonel Leap is implying we ought to change the law to enable Public Affairs officers to influence American public opinion when they deem it necessary to  protect a key friendly center of gravity, to wit US national will. The Smith-Mundt Modernization Act of 2012 appears to serve this purpose by allowing for the American public to be a target audience of U.S. government-funded information campaigns.Davis also quotes Brigadier General Ralph O. Baker   the Pentagon officer responsible for the Department of Defense s Joint Force Development   who defines Information Operations (IO) as activities undertaken to  shape the essential narrative of a conflict or situation and thus affect the attitudes and behaviors of the targeted audience. Brig. Gen. Baker goes on to equate descriptions of combat operations with the standard marketing strategy of repeating something until it is accepted:For years, commercial advertisers have based their advertisement strategies on the premise that there is a positive correlation between the number of times a consumer is exposed to product advertisement and that consumer s inclination to sample the new product. The very same principle applies to how we influence our target audiences when we conduct COIN.And those thousands of hours per week of government-funded radio and TV programs  appear to serve Baker s strategy, which states: Repetition is a key tenet of IO execution, and the failure to constantly drive home a consistent message dilutes the impact on the target audiences. Government Massively Manipulates the Web, Social Media and Other Forms of CommunicationOf course, the Web and social media have become a huge media platform, and the Pentagon and other government agencies are massively manipulating both.Documents released by Snowden show that spies manipulate polls, website popularity and pageview counts, censor videos they don t like and amplify messages they do.The CIA and other government agencies also put enormous energy into pushing propaganda throughmovies, television and video games.Cross-Border PropagandaPropaganda isn t limited to our own borders  Sometimes, the government plants disinformation in American media in order to mislead foreigners. For example, an official government summary of America s overthrow of the democratically-elected president of Iran in the 1950 s states,  In cooperation with the Department of State, CIA had several articles planted in major American newspapers and magazines which, when reproduced in Iran, had the desired psychological effect in Iran and contributed to the war of nerves against Mossadeq  (page x).The CIA has also bribed leading foreign journalists.And CNN accepted money from the brutal Bahrani dictatorship to run pro-monarchy propaganda.Everyone Who Challenges the Status Quo Is Labeled As a Purveyor of  Fake News  Or WorseThe First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution protects the freedom of the press from censorship by government.Indeed, the entire reason that it s unlawful for the government to stop stories from being printed is because that would punish those who criticize those in power.Why? Because the Founding Father knew that governments (like the British monarchy) will always crack down on those who point out that the emperor has no clothes.But the freedom of the press is under massive attack in America today  For example, the powers-that-be argue that only highly-paid corporate media shills who will act as stenographers for the fatcats should have the constitutional protections guaranteeing freedom of the press.A Harvard law school professor argues that the First Amendment is outdated and should be abandoned.When financially-savvy bloggers challenged the Federal Reserve s policy, a Fed official called all bloggers stupid and unqualified to comment.And the government is treating the real investigative reporters like criminals   or even terrorists:READ MORE MSM LIES AT: 21st Century Wire MSM Files\"],[\"\\\"Liberal actor and close friend of Hillary Clinton, Ben Affleck, came out with a statement of disappointment over another one of his close friends, the disgraced sexual predator, and Hollywood kingpin producer, Harvey Weinstein.After Affleck released his statement of shock over the Weinstein allegations, he was quickly shot down by actress Rose McGowan who claimed he knew all about Harvey Weinstein s antics, despite his statement of fake outrage and disgust.

You can be certain the Feds are more concerned about those  peaceful  Muslims in America who want to kill me than they are about anything I might say or do that hurts the feelings of islamic (sic) terrorists. -Jan MorganOn Saturday, Breitbart.com s AWR Hawkins said the Department of Justice is  monitoring  Jan Morgan, the owner of Gun Cave Indoor Firing Range in Hot Springs, Arkansas, who banned Muslims from her business in 2014, citing safety concerns. But Morgan isn t backing down and told Examiner.com Saturday she would close her business before putting her clients  safety at risk.The Washington Post said the monitoring is the result of demands by the Council on American-Islamic Relations and the Arkansas chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union. Both groups demanded a federal investigation after Morgan declared her range to be a  Muslim-Free Zone. CAIR and the ACLU argue that Morgan s  Muslim-free  policy violates the public accommodation provision of the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Times said. But Morgan disagrees, saying her range is a private club with dues-paying members.The DOJ confirmed it was monitoring Morgan, the Times added. The agency, however, did not say if it has plans to launch an investigation. CAIR said it was pleased with the action. We welcome this positive development and hope it leads to a thorough investigation of clear violations of the civil rights of American Muslims and those perceived to be Muslim by the gun range owner,  said CAIR s civil rights litigation director Jenifer Wicks. But Morgan told Examiner there is a huge difference between monitoring and investigating.In fact, she said at her website, she has  been under the watchful eyes of federal law enforcement authorities for a long time  as a result of  years of death threats  from Muslims. The threats, she added, began long before she owned the range. Now, she lives her daily life  under a federal microscope. I have nothing to hide,  she said.  I have no secrets from the federal government. Last year, she added, FBI counter-terrorism agents met with her and said ISIS is in Arkansas.  The agency feared I was going to be a target of opportunity, and I was directed to take EVERY SECURITY PRE-CAUTION necessary to protect my life and the lives of all people in my presence at all times,  she wrote.Morgan said that like the French cartoonists at Charlie Hebdo, she has had her life threatened many times over her articles. She also acted  upon the directive of the ATF to all FFL holders to err on the side of caution and not engage in any firearm transactions with anyone we suspect might use that firearm in the commission of a crime. So, CAIR and the ACLU, do you really think the idea of  more monitoring  of my daily life is somehow new or a threat to me in any way?  she asked on Facebook.  Of course the feds are monitoring me,  she added.  You can be certain the Feds are more concerned about those  peaceful  Muslims in America who want to kill me than they are about anything I might say or do that hurts the feelings of islamic (sic) terrorists. Morgan told Examiner she is prepared to deal with a federal investigation should one be launched against her.  I was prepared to fight this from day one,  she said.The  bottom line,  she added,  is this: I will close my business before I will make any compromises that could jeopardize the safety and security of the members who shoot here.  On her site, Morgan said she  will continue to follow the advise of two agencies within the DOJ to protect and defend my own life, as well as the lives of innocent American citizens in my presence, from any and all threats of violence connected to, and or associated with any and all terrorist organizations.  Anything less, she added,  would be irresponsible, reckless, and life threatening. Via: Joe Newby, The Examiner\"],[\"The Trump campaign is definitely a racist one, because the guy at the helm of the whole thing, Donald Trump, is a flaming racist. After all, as we all know, Donald Trump s first entrance into mainstream American politics was his very public leading of a charge to prove that President Obama was not born in this country. That issue keeps coming up now, during this campaign, because Trump s surrogates have been all over the television airwaves insisting that he is no longer a birther. However, when Trump himself was asked by the Washington Post whether or not he actually believes that the President is an American, he refused to answer, just giving the standard answer that he no longer discusses the issue.Well, seeing that things were about to get ugly surrounding this, Trump s campaign issued a gross, racist statement full of self-congratulations and outright lies, as if Trump s questioning of the president s birth was in any way a service to the country or in any way appropriate. The statement begins by refusing to admit any wrong doing on the part of Trump and his fellow birthers, and instead suggesting that Trump s racist  show me your papers  campaign was somehow the right thing to do: In 2011, Mr. Trump was finally able to bring this ugly incident to its conclusion by successfully compelling President Obama to release his birth certificate. Mr. Trump did a great service to the President and the country by bringing closure to the issue that Hillary Clinton and her team first raised. Then, Trump spokesman Jason Miller, the despicable goon behind this travesty of a statement, closes the whole thing off by acting like the public questioning of the origins of the first black American president is some kind of golf course deal Trump closed: Inarguably, Donald J. Trump is a closer. Having successfully obtained President Obama s birth certificate when others could not, Mr. Trump believes that President Obama was born in the United States. No, you guys aren t getting off this easy, Miller. The only acceptable response here is to have your candidate say, FROM HIS OWN MOUTH, that he knows that he was wrong, that he is sorry, and that President Obama is an American and a legitimate president. Nothing less will do. Further, you will have to retract this deplorable statement, and admit that everything you have said here is awful, that it was NOT Hillary Clinton s campaign who started or led the birther movement, and that it was Donald Trump himself who gave it legs.I won t hold my breath on any of that, though.

Here s a transcript of what Darweesh said: First of all I want to thank the people that take care of me and support me. They leave their family, their business, and they come to support me.

The lefty Boston Globe is using the 2017 Solar Eclipse to make a case for a Clinton presidential win. The over-the-top article goes out of its way to make the claim that Trump lost to Clinton It s delusional and twisted that the Globe would use an article about the eclipse to continue down this path of delusion The Globe asked: : Is the eclipse throwing shade at Clinton supporters?The path of ideal viewing spots for this month s highly-anticipated total solar eclipse cuts overwhelmingly through places that voted for President Trump in November.IT STARTS OUT NICE ENOUGH TO TRUMP BUT THEN IT S  WHAM! THEY PIVOT TO MAKE THE CASE FOR HOW THEY SILL BELIEVE CLINTON WON IN 2016!And about 92 percent of those counties swung in Trump s favor, while fewer than two dozen counties voted for his opponent, Hillary Clinton.Trump won many of those counties by a wide margin, securing an average of 71 percent of the vote in counties he won along the path. Clinton, by comparison, got only about 56 percent of the vote in counties she won along the eclipse path.And of the more than 6.2 million votes cast in those counties for one of those two candidates, 59 percent were for Trump, while 41 percent were for Clinton.That stands in stark contrast to the overall results of the 2016 election, in which about 51 percent of votes cast for either candidate went to Clinton, while about 49 percent went to Trump.The eclipse on Aug. 21 will be visible to people across the United States, but in most areas, the view will be of a partial eclipse. People will only be able to see a total eclipse if they re located along the  path of totality,  which will start near Lincoln City, Ore., and end near Charleston, S.C.Still, it s not entirely surprising that the eclipse s path of best perspective could slice through the entire country while mostly avoiding areas that backed Clinton.WHAM! THE CASE IS MADE FOR WHY THEY STILL BELIEVE CLINTON WON! While she won the popular vote, Trump won the Electoral College and about 84 percent of the country s 3,100-plus counties.Clinton won more voters overall because she captured densely populated urban areas, including New York City, Los Angeles, and Boston. Trump, by contrast, won many rural areas with small populations.FUN FACT OF THE DAY Perhaps it s not a surprise that the solar eclipse is passing over Trump strongholds given that the president himself was born during a lunar eclipse.On June 14, 1946, the day Trump was born, there was a total lunar eclipse, though it wasn t visible from the United States, NASA records show.

While running for her Senate seat in Massachusetts, her lie was uncovered, and shortly after that, the name  Pocahontas  was born, and it has stuck with her ever since.On Monday, the president decided to air the attack one more time alongside aging Native American veterans who helped fight fascism, in a White House ceremony attended by White House chief of staff John Kelly and other officials. Trump told the honorees,  You were here long before any of us were here. Although we have a representative in Congress who they say was here a long time ago. They call her Pocahontas.

So far the network is standing by Kelly, stating that it wouldn t give into  terrorizations toward any of our employees.  But it appears that Fox might not be genuine, as it is still secretly trying to get Trump back in by using two secret weapons   Trump s wife and daughter.On Wednesday morning, Morning Joe host Joe Scarborough exposed Fox News CEO Roger Ailes for trying to get Ivanka and Melania Trump to change The Donald s mind about skipping the debate, but Trump refused to speak with him and insisted that he d only speak with network owner Rupert Murdoch. Scarborough stated: Per our sources, Roger Ailes was calling Ivanka, he was trying to get in touch with Trump, he was calling Melania, people that he s got a good relationship with, they love Roger. They have a great respect for him. But at this point, Trump s only gonna talk to Rupert, and they re going to figure it out. In response to Trump s childish boycott, there s been an outpouring of controversy in the media, even from Kelly s side. Earlier this week, Kelly welcomed liberal filmmaker Michael Moore onto her show, where the documentarian mocked Trump and congratulated the Fox host for scaring Trump out of the debate   a task that not even his Republican rivals could pull off. Moore said,  In all seriousness, let me say this, you ve done something that Jeb Bush, Chris Christie, Rubio, Cruz   none of them have been able to do. Which is to, essentially, frighten him. Meanwhile, Trump has continued to bash Kelly on social media, signaling that his immature, mostly one-sided feud with her is far from over. Solidifying Kelly s point during the first GOP debate that Trump had zero respect for women, Trump tweeted:TwitterFeatured image via Donald Trump Facebook\"],[\"You know how the NRA constantly tells us that their army of  good guys with guns  are ready to swoop in at the first sign of danger to save those in distress? Well, as an incident from Hollis, Maine, shows us, sometimes it may be better if they just don t.30-year-old Joshua Weldon had good intentions when he saw a woman s boyfriend assaulting her and made the decision to step in and stop it. According to police, 32-year-old Andria Richardson was being attacked by her boyfriend, 30-year-old Ryan Gilliken, on Wednesday when Weldon drew a firearm in an attempt to defend the woman. Unfortunately, his bravado did not work out well for anyone but the assailant.Weldon fired his weapon multiple times, hitting Richardson in the stomach twice and the leg three times. Richardson is recovering from her wounds, but family members say she is lucky. Notably, neither the attacker nor the  savior were injured by the gunfire.Last year, another  good guy with a gun  made headlines when he tried to help a carjacking victim by shooting the people stealing her car. He missed the criminals, but shot the victim in the head.It s nice to think of people with a firearm as heroes who will be there to save us when things go bad   but the thing is that the average gun owner is not trained or conditioned to handle, say, close-range combat against an unarmed attacker (with a victim nearby), without causing some form of  collateral damage.  In this case, our hero almost killed the person he was trying to save.Gilliken has been charged with domestic violence assault, a Class C felony.

The 2016 GOP platform is easily one of the most explicitly anti-LGBTQ in history. They plan to do all they can to discriminate openly, and with control of the entire federal government, they have no one to stop them.However, there are a few things that happened on President Obama s watch that the Republicans will find that their hands are tied on. Firstly, the bigots like Mike Pence and others in Trump s administration can gnash their teeth all they want, but the Supreme Court already ruled on marriage equality. It s done.The only potential caveat here is that, with the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, there s a vacant seat that the GOP obstructionists refused to allow President Obama to fill, though it was rightfully his. Even so, it takes a 60-vote majority for the Senate to confirm a SCOTUS justice, and no way will the Democrats go for some right-wing, homophobic nut on that one. They could try the nuclear option, of course. To that end, let s just make sure we keep Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg in tip-top shape until we get rid of Trump, Pence, and their cabinet of horrors.Secondly, President Obama was forceful with the issue of repealing Don t Ask, Don t Tell. The United States Armed Forces now has openly LGBTQ soldiers serving in all branches, and transitions for transgender folks are covered as well. President Obama famously told his military chiefs that they could step down if they had issues with his repeal. This is a done deal, and what are they going to do, waltz in and kick all the gay soldiers out? Didn t think so. Even Pence can t be that stupid.Next is the fight for transgender rights. While a lot of the legal stuff was by executive order, and Pence will likely DEMAND that it all be undone immediately, what they cannot undo is public perception. If this extremist administration goes aggressively after transgender people   who are easily the most vulnerable in our society   they will face swift and immediate backlash. Trump is already entering office as the least popular president in modern history, with the scandal of an investigation into his ties to Russia already hanging over his head. He isn t going to want to make himself even less popular by going after a group of people whose issues are front and center for the first time in history.President Obama also made a point of appointing hordes of openly gay judges to federal judgeships. These folks will smack down anything unconstitutional done against us in the name of Trump and Pence s bigotry, and there isn t a damn thing they can do about it. Absent violating the law, federal judges stay on the bench as long as they damn well please.Lastly   but perhaps most importantly   President Obama s open support of LGBTQ people pushed our issues to the forefront and changed public perception of us. The bigoted views of the people in Trump s cabinet of extremists are far outside the mainstream. We have President Obama to thank for that. He aggressively promoted equality here at home and on the world stage. He wasn t afraid to call out the bigotry of politicians in the United States, nor those abroad. He deliberately sent gay United States delegates to Russia s Sochi Olympics, in a blatant rebuke of Vladimir Putin s campaign of hate against LGBTQ citizens. He also smacked down the Kenyan president over his country s brutal homophobia. And, in a last nod to our community, President Obama made clear his feelings on the brutal treatment of transgender prisoners by commuting Chelsea Manning s sentence on the way out the door.Thank you, President Obama, for protecting our community. Who knows where we d be without you? We re going to miss you so much.Featured image via screen capture from Twitter\"],[\"Donald Trump s candidacy has been very concerning to experts and leaders on national security. His erratic and aggressive philosophies on war and security would likely get thousands of Americans and others killed, while destabilizing the world and making the entire planet less safe.To address those concerns, a new ad has been produced by the veterans group VoteVets starring Major General Paul D. Eaton highlighting why he cannot support Trump for president.Referencing his father s military service, and the men and women who served under them during his time in the military, General Eaton says,  for all of them, and for our country, I cannot support Donald Trump. Eaton points out that  Donald Trump does not have the temperament or judgement to be our commander-in-chief, that s why I m speaking out. Trump s agenda presents key dangers for America s military, including his expressed desire to renew the torture program that began under Bush\\u002fCheney. Trump has said he would expand waterboarding, which is a violation of the Geneva Conventions, and said he would make the military attack and kill the families of terrorists   a likely war crime.The presumptive Republican nominee was widely criticized for a speech in which he praised dictator Saddam Hussein   the so-called  butcher of Baghdad  for what he described as  good  policies against terrorism. Later fact checks pointed out that in addition to being an oppressive authoritarian dictator, Hussein actually provided shelter and refuge for terrorists.Eaton served as Commanding General of the military coalition section that trained soldiers in Iraq between 2003-4. He served in the military for over 36 years, then later became a critic of the Bush administration s reckless policies in Iraq. Eaton since then has served as a military adviser to Hillary Clinton s 2008 presidential campaign, and as a supporter of Obama later that year.Featured image via YouTube screen capture\"],[\"Bryce Williams   aka Vester Flanagan   sued his former bosses at a TV station in Florida back in 2000   claiming his bosses verbally abused him because of his race, and even called him a  monkey.

The Baltimore police officers who are directly responsible for the death of Freddie Gray last year attended, were brought up on stage, and applauded and honored and giving a standing ovation for their work, all while a right-wing talking head glossed over the problems of police brutality.Deneen Borelli, a frequent Fox News contributor, complained loudly that these cops  lives and careers were ruined by the  lies  surrounding Freddie Gray s death. Gray died after his spine was nearly severed due to a rough and unsecured ride in the back of a van. He was handcuffed and put in leg irons, but not belted in at all. Later, officers said he d suffered a medical emergency, but they failed to get him help.Borelli lamented: These five men and one woman, all veteran police officers, were now in handcuffs, fighting for their lives, their careers destroyed, bankrupted, humiliated No one apologized for ruining their lives. No one thanked them for their service or recognized their honor. Who will thank these officers? Who will thank all police officers   at a time they are being so vilified? Tonight, ladies and gentlemen, we will. This is disgusting.Patently disgusting.The media doesn t jump to vilify the police   we have a serious problem with police brutality, particularly against the black community, and the media is shining a light on it. In Baltimore, officers who were witnesses to the case were also on the team investigating Gray s death. Lead detectives started their own counter-investigations to disprove the state s case. The system works for officers, and against their victims.Victims like Freddie Gray. While Borelli whines that nobody s apologized to these officers who, in her view no doubt, were merely doing their duty and then braved the aftermath with grace and courage, Gray is still dead. He died as a direct result of these officers  actions.To point this out, though, makes us anti-police. We re police-haters when we point out brutality. Idiots like Franklin Graham say the best way to stop this is for people to just comply with police orders, and yet, many of the black people who die are complying with police orders.Seriously, the Media Research Center ought to be ashamed of itself for this. These cops  lives and careers wouldn t have been ruined if they d actually done their entire job.Watch Borelli s remarks below, beginning at the 1:11:50 mark:Featured image via screen capture\"],[\"In the coming days, a creationist conspiracy theorist who thinks President Obama is a gay prostitute, could be in a position to rewrite school textbooks and decide what is taught in class.Mary Lou Bruner has promised voters that, if elected to the State Board of Education in Texas, she will promote conservative curriculum standards aligned with Texas values.

Sadly, this is not the case in Texas.Far from being some outsider, no-chance candidate, she has been endorsed by none other than the Former Chairman of the Texas State Board of Education Gail Lowe, and a raft of others.

As far as the debates are concerned, the system is being gamed because everybody said that I won the debate, you know, the so-called forum that your group put on,  Trump said.

These glorious figures, Sent from God herself,  act as paladins of justice, dispensing it in the form of hot pieces of lead at a speed of 2,500 feet per second. Unfortunately, at a moment s notice, someone thought to be a  good guy  could easily reveal himself to be anything but that.Police in Murray, Utah were called after a McDonald s drive-thru customer pulled a gun out and threatened to shoot employees. The unidentified man can be seen on video arguing with an employee. At first, a white Subaru Outback can be seen pulling away, but the vehicle stops about 40 feet from the window. Three men exit the car and the driver of the vehicle walks back to the window, pointing his gun inside. I don t need this,  the gunman yelled, apparently failing to realize that he probably didn t need to bring a Second Amendment Solution to an argument over food.Fortunately, one of his friends pulls him away before he has a chance to open fire.

Watching the video, she remarked that it   looks like he was actually serious about to do something  right before the man in the gray-hooded sweatshirt pulls the angry ammosexual away from the confrontation.It s nice to think that the average human is responsible enough to carry around a weapon that can end numerous lives in seconds. Unfortunately, all too often guns are used to resolve minor conflicts, to chase down shoplifters, end abortion forever, solve disputes over roadkill, express displeasure at getting stuck behind a snow plow during a blizzard, or check who s downstairs. Everyone wants to think of themselves as a  good guy.  In fact, in many situations, the  bad guy  still views himself as the opposite. Think about it: the average man can t be trusted to put the toilet seat down reliably, and we re trusting him to carry around something that gives him the power to decide life or death? [Author s Note: If you accept this as a scientific argument, you re an idiot.]A study published in the American Journal of Public Health notes that for  each percentage point increase in gun ownership, the firearm homicide rate increased by 0.9%.  Researchers could not determine causation, but  found that states with higher rates of gun ownership had disproportionately large numbers of deaths from firearm-related homicides. Of course, it s also important to consider that the presence of a gun in the first place increases the likelihood of this sort of incident. Guns not only permit violence, they can stimulate it as well,  Leonard Berkowitz, Emeritus Professor of Psychology, University of Wisconsin, said after conducting a 1967 study on the effect of weapons on aggression.  The finger pulls the trigger, but the trigger may also be pulling the finger. Psychology Today notes:In 1967, Leonard Berkowitz and Anthony LePage conducted a fascinating study. First, participants were angered by a person pretending to be another participant (called a confederate). Next, participants were seated at a table that had a shotgun and a revolver on it or, in the control condition, badminton racquets and shuttlecocks. The items on the table were described as part of another experiment that the researcher had supposedly forgotten to put away. The participant was supposed to decide what level of electric shock to deliver to the confederate who had angered them, and the electric shocks were used to measure aggression. The experimenter told participants to ignore the items on the table, but apparently they could not. Participants who saw the guns were more aggressive than were participants who saw the sports items. This effect was dubbed the  weapons effect. Fortunately a  good guy without a gun  stepped in and prevented his friend from doing real harm.Watch a report on the incident below:Featured image via screengrab\"],[\"\\\"Batman fans who have been looking forward to the upcoming Batman sequel,  Justice League , a Harvey Weinstein movie, that is set to be released before Christmas of 2017, have taken to social media, demanding that the studio replace the Batman actor Ben Affleck.

Seven years later, police raided his closet and found the  composted  body of his ex-girlfriend inside a trunk.A self-proclaimed environmental activist, Einhorn made a name for himself among ecological groups during the 1960s and  70s by taking on the role of a tie-dye-wearing ecological guru and Philadelphia s head hippie. With his long beard and gap-toothed smile, Einhorn   who nicknamed himself  Unicorn  because his German-Jewish last name translates to  one horn   advocated flower power, peace and free love to his fellow students at the University of Pennsylvania. He also claimed to have helped found Earth Day.But the charismatic spokesman who helped bring awareness to environmental issues and preached against the Vietnam War   and any violence   had a secret dark side. When his girlfriend of five years, Helen  Holly  Maddux, moved to New York and broke up with him, Einhorn threatened that he would throw her left-behind personal belongings onto the street if she didn t come back to pick them up.And so on Sept. 9, 1977, Maddux went back to the apartment that she and Einhorn had shared in Philadelphia to collect her things, and was never seen again. When Philadelphia police questioned Einhorn about her mysterious disappearance several weeks later, he claimed that she had gone out to the neighborhood co-op to buy some tofu and sprouts and never returned.It wasn t until 18 months later that investigators searched Einhorn s apartment after one of his neighbors complained that a reddish-brown, foul-smelling liquid was leaking from the ceiling directly below Einhorn s bedroom closet. Inside the closet, police found Maddux s beaten and partially mummified body stuffed into a trunk that had also been packed with Styrofoam, air fresheners and newspapers.After his arrest, Einhorn jumped bail and spent decades evading authorities by hiding out in Ireland, Sweden, the United Kingdom and France. After 23 years, he was finally extradited to the United States from France and put on trial. Taking the stand in his own defense, Einhorn claimed that his ex-girlfriend had been killed by CIA agents who framed him for the crime because he knew too much about the agency s paranormal military research. He was convicted of murdering Maddux and is currently serving a life sentence.

WASHINGTON   A federal judge in Texas on Saturday issued a nationwide injunction halting enforcement of Obama administration protections for transgender and abortion-related healthcare services just one day before they were due to go into effect. The lawsuit   brought by Texas, a handful of other states, and some religiously affiliated nonprofit medical groups   challenges a regulation implementing the sex nondiscrimination requirement found in the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The Health and Human Services (HHS) regulation  forbids discriminating on the basis of  gender identity  and  termination of pregnancy  under Obamacare, as US District Court Judge Reed O Connor wrote in his opinion halting enforcement of those provisions in the rule.Specifically, the ACA provision   Section 1557   prohibits discrimination in federally-funded health benefits, including based on sex. Over the course of 2015 and this year, HHS proposed and finalized a regulation interpreting the definition of  sex  in that provisions to include  gender identity    defined as  internal sense of gender, which may be male, female, neither, or a combination of male and female    as well as  sex stereotyping  and  termination of pregnancy. Explaining the lawsuit, O Connor wrote,  Plaintiffs claim the Rule s interpretation of sex discrimination pressures doctors to deliver healthcare in a manner that violates their religious freedom and thwarts their independent medical judgment and will require burdensome changes to their health insurance plans on January 1, 2017.  The states and nonprofits in the healthcare lawsuit allege that the regulation violates the Administrative Procedure Act (APA)   which sets the rules for federal government rule-making   and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA). O Connor found that the plaintiffs had standing to bring the lawsuit because they  have presented concrete evidence to support their fears that they will be subject to enforcement under the Rule.

The former Secretary of State is under federal investigation for potentially violating the Espionage Act by allowing people without a security clearance to access classified information. The fact that Hillary was sharing an email network with a private foundation means that people without a security clearance almost certainly had physical access to her server while she was working at the State Department.Here s what we know:The Servers Have The SAME IP AddressHillary s clintonemail.com server and the Foundation-run presidentclinton.com email server have exactly the same IP address, and the same SSL certificate (which an organization purchases for an email server to verify its trustworthiness).mail.clintonemail.com and mail.presidentclinton.com both have an IP address of 64.94.172.146, according to an SSL Certificate Checker.The two servers both have that same IP address, 64.94.172.146, according to DNS records. (Here are records for Hillary s server, and here are records for Bill s server).Both servers have the same IP address, according to another independent Internet records database, robtex.net.The fact that both of these email servers have the same IP address means that they were operating on the same network, and sharing physical space. A computer expert tells Breitbart News that the servers were probably operating on the same machine. It is also possible that they were operating on different machines on the same network, which still means that the machines would have to be close enough to exist in the same physical location.President Clinton s server was created in 2002, while Hillary s was created in 2009, which means that Hillary s server was simply added to Bill s Foundation-run server network.They Had The SAME IP Address When She Was Secretary of StateHillary s server and Bill s Foundation-run server also shared a different IP address during her tenure as Secretary of State.From September 8, 2009 until June 24, 2011, Bill Clinton s Foundation-run mail.presidentclinton.com server had an IP address of 24.187.234.187, according to DNS records.Hillary s mail.clintonemail.com server had the same exact IP address, 24.187.234.187, from the dates May 21, 2010 until October 21, 2010, according to DNS records.Their Shared IP Address Can Be Traced to Midtown ManhattanA geographical search for the IP address that both servers shared at registration traces to Midtown Manhattan, according to three different databases: infosniper.net, which locates a Midtown latitude\\u002flongitude point, ip-tracker.org, which also gives a Midtown latitude\\u002flongitude point, and whatsmyip.org.Clinton Foundation headquarters are currently located at 1271 6th Avenue in Midtown. Bill Clinton s office is at 55 West 125th StreetThe Denver-based firm Platte River Networks told Breitbart News that it physically moved Hillary Clinton s private email server out of the basement of her Chappaqua home in 2013. But the Clintons could have moved the server from Manhattan to Chappaqua before Platte River got there.Clinton Founation Employees Had presidentclinton.com email addressesThe employees who have used presidentclinton.com email addresses included former Bill Clinton right-hand man Doug Band, as well as Justin Cooper, a Hillary aide who has worked with the Foundation, Terry Krinvic, Laura Graham, and John Zimmerebner.Was Chelsea Clinton On The Server?The email server for mail.chelseaoffice.com, which is no longer active, resolves to clintonemail.com, according to DNS records. Wikileaks confirms that the chelseaoffice.com server was used by Chelsea Clinton employees.Hillary Even Admitted That She Used Her Husband s  System Well the system we used was set up for President Clintons office and it had numerous safeguards it was on property guarded by the Secret Service and there were no security breaches, so I think that the use of that server which started with my husband proved to be effective and secure,  Hillary Clinton said in a March 2015 press conference.Clinton has not returned to that talking point since.The Clinton Foundation and Hillary Clinton s campaign did not return requests for comment by press time.

John Kasich,  and that it did not comply with federal regulations for political advertising. No disclaimer appears at the end of the advertisement paid for by Donald Trump,  Matt Carle, executive director of New Day for America, wrote in the complaint.  Consequently, this advertisement is in violation of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, and it must be removed from the air. It is amazing in this day and age, when almost any sort of political advertising is allowed for the highest bidder, that an ad would get pulled like this.As the New York Times explains:The Federal Election Commission says that political ads must include a  clearly readable  written statement that appears at their end  for a period of at least four seconds  with a  reasonable degree of color contrast  between the background and the disclaimer statement.This is a standard thing to do for any real, serious presidential campaign, but it is a symptom of the sort of basic failure that happens every day with Trump.His campaign often issues conflicting positions on basic issues, contradicting what is said in a speech with a press release or a statement by a campaign spokesperson on TV. They issue inaccurate press releases, with wrong or misspelled names and locations, and the candidate himself has often misstated the dates and times when instructing his supporters on where and when they should be voting.Trump is already months into his campaign and still making amateur hour screw-ups. He has such a lead on the rest of the Republicans, this won t hurt. But if he makes these kinds of mistakes in the fall against the Democrats, it will weaken his already shaky campaign.Featured image via YouTube\"],[\"This is a perfect example of how the left is able to decide which laws they follow and which laws the rest of America follows Kim Davis, the Democrat Kentucky county clerk who refused to issue same-sex marriage licenses because of religious objections, was ordered to jail for contempt of court last Thursday. She suggested a compromise of removing her name from the licenses, but Federal District Court Judge David Bunning wouldn t even grant that reasonable compromise.Contrast this with Cathy Lanier, chief of the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia, refusing to issue concealed weapons permits to people unless they can arbitrarily show a  good reason,  nothing required by law. A federal judge issued a preliminary injunction in May stopping her from denying the permits, although notably he did not send Lanier to jail for contempt.Similarly, county sheriffs in California had been denying concealed weapons permits to applicants who failed to show a need beyond self-defense. Last November, the Ninth Circuit ruled that the sheriffs were violating the law. None of those sheriffs were sent to jail, despite the fact that people around the country have died unable to obtain a permit to carry concealed.Or contrast it with the irony of San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom ordering clerks to issue same-sex marriage licenses in 2004, contrary to state law. The California Attorney General sued him and the California Supreme Court ultimately put an end to the practice, but Newsom was never sent to jail.Newsom also violated federal law by making San Francisco a sanctuary city in 2007, contrary to existing federal law, but nothing happened to him. The city s sanctuary status resulted in the death of Kate Steinle in July, who was shot by an illegal immigrant who had been deported five times and had seven felony convictions. This is a far more drastic result than a clerk who merely does not want her name on marriage licenses, yet nothing is being done to the current mayor of San Francisco, Ed Lee. In 2012, Tonya Parker, a lesbian judge in Texas said she would not issue marriage licenses to heterosexual couples until same-sex marriage was legalized. She wasn t put in jail for violating the law, nor does it appear she was even disciplined at all.Not everyone would have taken the position Davis did, some Christians might have resigned rather than deal with a huge battle. Others might not have had such strong objections, viewing matters of sexuality best left alone and without government interference. When I was an Assistant Attorney General for the State of Arizona, I represented agencies like the Arizona Commission on the Arts. Philosophically, I disagreed with its very existence. But I was able to separate my personal views from government laws to perform my job.The one thing all reasonable people can agree upon is that Davis was singled out and punished disproportionately compared to other public officials who didn t comply with controversial laws.This isn t about same-sex marriage, nor is it even about gay issues. It is merely one tactic in a larger goal to remove Christianity from the public sphere. There are reasonable compromises that could have been made between those Christians with conscientious objections and the LGBT community   plenty of gays consider themselves Christians   but the left is deliberately pushing for maximum conflict between the two groups in order to push one out of society.An Oregon judge announced on Friday that he will not perform same-sex marriages. Unlike the lesbian judge who said she would not perform heterosexual marriages, Judge Vance Day was immediately put under an ethics investigation by the Oregon Commission of Judicial Fitness and Disability, which plans to hold a hearing in November.This won t end with public employment. As the public sphere goes, so goes the private sphere. If companies balk, anti-discrimination laws can be used to force them to comply. The left intends to stamp religion out of society, until Christians are left secretly worshiping in their homes, hiding their status outside of the home. This is because the left fundamentally disagrees with Judeo-Christian ethics, which contradict its foundation of anything goes.Until conservatives wake up and start realizing the judicial branch, controlled by the left, has become the most lethal branch, the biggest threat of the three branches to our country and freedom, it will continue abusing the legal system to stamp out conservatism and religion from society.

The official requested anonymity said they were not authorized to speak on behalf of the party.McNeely was stopped while trying to enter an area where Trump had been greeting supporters, the sources said. Neither Phillips, the Trump campaign, nor the Georgia Republican Party returned messages seeking comment.Trump s campaign has been continually plagued with racial problems, largely brought on by the candidate and his belligerent attitude towards everyone who isn t a white male. Trump recently caused heads to shake when he singled out a black man at a rally as  my African-American,  and again prompted furrowed brows by indicating that only blacks in America were in dire financial straits.Over his media career, Trump has had racist incidents. He argued in favor of the death penalty for The Central Park Five, a group of black men accused of rape who were eventually all proven innocent after serving time in prison for most of their lives. Even when the men were found innocent, Trump took out ads calling for them to be executed.Trump was also accused by the federal government of engaging in discriminatory housing practices when operating his apartment buildings.The candidate also has an odd verbal tick in which he often refers to  the blacks,  rather than  blacks,   black people,  or  African-Americans.

If any case was brought to court by 9\\u002f11 families to sue Saudi Arabia for  state-sponsored terror  regarding the attacks in New York City on September 11, 2001, the court would find there is no real forensic case proving Saudi involvement in this event. Other problems will crop up too. For starters, at least 7 of alleged hijackers were actually found to be alive after their faces were plastered on US TV screens after 9\\u002f11. As it stands, the US government s official story of 9\\u002f11 is so flimsy and full of holes, including the complete omission or mention of the collapse of WTC Building 7 (which was hit by nothing, and yet collapsed into its own footprint in 7 seconds) and the lack of any plane wreckage at the Pentagon (we re meant to believe that the passenger airliner evaporated into thin air on impact, and no real CCTV footage has been provided to back the government s own wild explanation). In actuality, the US government would love a dead-end lawsuit against Saudi Arabia which could only result in some out-of-court settlement anyway   because this would supply a nice diversion away from any further scrutiny of the US government s bogus explanation of what really happened that day.More to the point, however, is the real potential story here. If passed, this bill would allow a number people, particularly those in Syria, to sue the US, British, French, Dutch, Norwegian, Polish, Turkish and Saudi Arabia and Qatar too, all of who are actively involved in supplying money, equipment, arms and military training to a number of known Salafist Terrorists fighting groups in Syria.KEY POINT: Why is Obama protecting Saudi Arabia? One of Obama s top financial partners in the dirty war on Syria is Saudi Arabia, who has also paid for  off-the-books  CIA operations there. Unlike Saudi and 9\\u002f11, by definition, this is state-sponsored terrorism.The House is expected to hold a vote later this week. It could be the first override of a Presidential veto during the Obama administration . Karoun Demirjian Washington PostThe Senate on Wednesday voted to override President Obama s veto of legislation that would allow 9\\u002f11 victims  families to sue the Saudi Arabian government over its alleged support for the terrorists who carried out the attacks. The vote was 97 to 1.The House is expected to vote later in the day and if successful, it will be the first time Congress has overridden a veto during the Obama administration. Overriding a presidential veto is something we don t take lightly, but it was important in this case that the families of the victims of 9\\u002f11 be allowed to pursue justice, even if that pursuit causes some diplomatic discomforts,  Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), who co-authored the bill with Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.), said in a statement.Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) cast the lone vote to sustain the veto after receiving a letter from Obama arguing the consequences could be  devastating,  and urging him  to vote to sustain the veto.  Reid voted against the override despite telling reporters earlier this month that  I support that legislation  and Schumer s efforts. He s always had the president s back,  said Reid spokesman Adam Jentleson.Both chambers passed the legislation without dissent earlier this year, but now several lawmakers are echoing the White House s argument that the legislation could set a dangerous precedent, inviting other nations to respond by suing American diplomats, military personnel and other officials in foreign courts.Critics of the bill are now focusing on how to scale back the measure once it becomes law.

Bugg admits that at this point, he flipped some chairs on his way out the door. I flipped a few chairs,  Bugg told PennLive, adding he yelled at the owner,  That s not the way to treat people.  He said the manager told him that now Donald Trump is president,  I can say what I want. He left and got some friends for support and returned to confront the racist store owner, but found that the police had been called. Unfortunately for the Trump fan, police were on Bugg s side. According to Bugg, police  reassured  him that the manager is  known for doing stuff like this. A quick search on Facebook reveals that the owner, Chris Behney, has quite a reputation: Others stopped by the comment section of PennLive to share their experiences and information:  An investigation into the incident is ongoing, but in a world where Trump supporters start a national incident because they thought Starbucks  delay in making their coffee was discrimination because the barista magically knew they were conservatives or think they shouldn t have to pay for a reusable bag because Trump won (and dissolve into a rage-filled racist rant), it s not exactly outside the realm of probability that the incident unfolded just as Bugg says.Featured image via Getty Images (Win McNamera)\\u002fscreengrab\"],[\"Last night, the Republican primary went where no debate has ever gone before when it literally became a contest about penis size.This happened less than fifteen minutes into the eleventh GOP debate, when Trump addressed rival Marco Rubio s comments about his unnaturally small hands by assuring America that there was  no problem with the size of his junk. No one could believe that a presidential debate could devolve into such an immature, petty discussion   but you can always count on Trump to help the country sink to new lows.While many of us were probably stuck in a depressive state, wallowing over the fact that a nationally-televised event to vet the future president of the country has just been overtaken by a penis joke, Twitter swooped in to save the day. As soon as Trump made his ill-timed joke, Twitter was flooded with the most clever, hilarious reactions and gave everyone some much-needed perspective to keep us afloat as Trump continues to dominate the Republican polls.Here are some of the most amazing responses to Trump, to momentarily distract you from the fact that the guy who made a penis joke at the GOP debate might actually win the nomination:TwitterTwitterMany were anticipating what the media was going to do with this disastrous frat boy moment.TwitterThe New York Post and Huffington Post didn t disappoint:Twitter TwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterLast night s GOP debate was less about policy and the future of America than it was about Trump and his innate ability to made any serious political matter an absolute circus and spectacle. America cannot risk having someone like him fronting the GOP. Even though it would be an easy win for the Democrats, the fact that Trump has been able to gather the support of so many Americans is depressing. For most Americans watching the GOP debate last night, this tweet sums it up:Twitter Featured image via screenshot\"],[\"In case you haven t heard, God s chosen candidate, Ted Cruz, either disproved God s existence or showed the world that the Big-Guy-in-the-Sky REALLY hates smarmy, bigoted douchebags. Yes, the embarrassment to America that was Ted Cruz s campaign is finally over. Fate swallowed his chances up like that throat booger he ate on national television during a debate. You can all rest assured knowing that the Republican Party s destruction is finally complete in that Donald Trump is considered the most qualified candidate for the office of President.What better way to end his presidential campaign than to elbow his wife in the face? You may be staring at your screen wondering,  Did he just say what I think he said?  Yes, by punching and elbowing his wife in the face. While it was almost assuredly as much an accident as abstinence-only advocate Bristol Palin s multiple out-of-wedlock pregnancies, it actually happened.Still don t believe me? Watch:As Cruz was hugging his father, while his bigoted, homophobic, and hateful supporters looked on, the now-former presidential candidate accidentally did what most of America wants to do to him: he accidentally popped Heidi in the jaw then followed up with an elbow to the face.His campaign, which was built on catering to the absolute worst people in society s hatred and stupidity (the ones Trump had not already snagged up anyway), was truly an embarrassment to our nation   almost as embarrassing as the fact that his own daughter hates him just as much as the rest of us.But what will Cruz do now? Will he commit himself to the Senate, where he can continue to attempt to install a theofascist regime in America and fight diligently to take away the rights of anyone he thinks God tells him to hate? Will he come to terms with the fact that he, as the candidate he himself has stated God  chose  to lead America into the Promised Land, probably isn t the super-Christian he thinks he is? Will he continue his alleged career as the Zodiac Killer?No matter what Cruz does, one thing is for certain: he s probably going to spend some time in the  dog house  rather than the White House.Featured image via screengrab\"],[\"Secret Service personnel removed the alarm sensors along an area of fence line when the agency raised its height in response to previous fence-jumping incidents as a way to make it harder to scale. Ironically, the very effort to prevent fence jumping appears to have permitted a particularly egregious intrusion.One source said superiors in the Uniformed Division told Secret Service personnel to remove the sensors and piece them together for use elsewhere. They were never replaced.There are at least 10 to 12 officers and agents, including supervisors from the Presidential Protective Division, monitoring these sensors at any given time. They do so from the Joint Operations Command Center or JOCC, which is located outside of the White House complex.Some agents and officers also are questioning why Secret Service never released the K-9 unit to try to find an intruder after the alarms on the first fence the intruder scaled went off.Rep. Jason Chaffetz weighs in below on details of what the intruder did in those 17 minutes: The White House fence jumper who lingered on the ground unnoticed for 17 minutes was literally just hanging out in plain view with alarms blaring, and the Secret Service had no clue.Congressman Jason Chaffetz tells TMZ he met with the Director of Homeland Security and the Acting Director of the Secret Service for an hour and a half Tuesday, and his conclusion    It was even worse than I thought. Chaffetz says the surveillance video is shocking   the intruder was not darting around. Rather, he was  lingering,   hanging out  on the grounds. At one point he took the time to bend down and tie his shoes.The intruder at times peered through windows of the building, where Trump was inside. As we previously reported, he also jiggled a doorknob.Chaffetz says some of the alarms failed but some went off, yet the intruder was not detected.Secret Service agents did check the grounds, but not with any urgency. Alarms frequently go off for various reasons, and this time it was met with an inadequate response.And Chaffetz says the video shows agents were simply  lackadaisical.  As he put it,  Everything went wrong.  The congressman says he was promised there would be  big changes,  adding,  There better be.

He responded by claiming  mass shootings  are a something specifically American a problem not witnessed in other countries then criticized Congressional inaction toward passing more gun control.According to Bloomberg, Obama said:In the United States we have the power to do more to prevent what is just a regular process of gun homicides, that is unequaled by multiples of five, six, [or] ten, and I think the American people understand that. So my hope is that, once again, this spurs a conversation and action.He said that  Congress, states, and local governments  need to act, and he made it clear he  will continue to focus on what [he] can do administratively,  which is something he has been threatening to do since a gunman opened fire in the gun free zone at Umpqua Community College on October 1.On November 12 CBS News reported that Obama has given a team of  White House lawyers  the job of finding a way that executive action can be used to expand background checks. And Breitbart News reported that part of what is being sought is an arbitrary threshold that can be set on private gun sales. Citizens who sell more than the allowable level will be forced to do background checks on every sale.Obama and the Democrat Party have been obsessed with expanding background checks since Adam Lanza attacked Sandy Hook Elementary on December 14, 2012. Yet it is interesting to note that expanded background checks would not have hindered that attack in the slightest, because Lanza stole the guns he used he did not buy them.Moreover, background checks are already expanded in Colorado. Breitbart News previously reported that expanded background checks and a  high capacity  magazine ban are the law of the land in Colorado, but neither were effectual in stopping the Planned Parenthood attack or the high profile public shooting that took place in CO Springs on Halloween day.

President Trump has chosen instead to spend the evening connecting with the voters who shocked the nation when they overwhelmingly turned out for him on election day in the formerly blue state of Pennsylvania.Trump made the announcement on Twitter:  Next Saturday night I will be holding a BIG rally in Pennsylvania. Look forward to it! Next Saturday night I will be holding a BIG rally in Pennsylvania. Look forward to it!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 22, 2017Only 6 years ago, hundreds of leftist media hacks were doubled over in laughter while Barack Obama openly mocked Donald Trump at the 2011 White House Correspondents dinner.Little did the media at that White House Correspondents Dinner know, that the man they were so thrilled to see being mocked by our former Community Organizer in Chief would be our next President. They never dreamed that the man they were mocking while he sat defenseless that night would literally turn the once  trusted  media on its head. For the first time ever, Trump forced the media to play defense instead of assuming the offensive posture they d been used to taking against Republicans and conservatives for decades. Trump shamed them for using their publications and networks to promote the Democrat Party and their radical agenda, and America cheered.McKay Coppins of Buzzfeed wrote about the mistake Obama made that night when he brought the  birther  nonsense to a head which (according to her) overrode Obama s better judgment and led him to tear into Trump to his face:On the night of the dinner, Trump took his seat at the center of the ballroom, perfectly situated so that all 2,500 lawmakers, movie stars, journalists, and politicos in attendance could see him .But as soon as the plates were cleared and the program began, it became agonizingly clear that Trump was not royalty in this room: He was the court jester.The president used his speech to pummel Trump with one punchline after another When host Seth Meyers took the mic, he piled on with his own rat-a-tat of jokes, many of which seemed designed deliberately to inflame Trump s outer-borough insecurities:  His whole life is models and gold leaf and marble columns, but he still sounds like a know-it-all down at the OTB.  The longer the night went on, the more conspicuous Trump s glower became. He didn t offer a self-deprecating chuckle, or wave warmly at the cameras, or smile with the practiced good humor of the aristocrats and A-listers who know they must never allow themselves to appear threatened by a joke at their expense. Instead, Trump just sat there, stone-faced, stunned, simmering   Carrie at the prom covered in pig s blood. Watch:Obama, of course, had his reasons for wanting petty vengeance over the birth certificate controversy, which he not-unreasonably regarded as racist. But he s also the prime example of a guy who has always been the coolest kid in the room ( I m LeBron, baby ), and the spectacle of him using the platform of an event originally designed for l se-majest  to lock arms with a TV comic and gang-tackle Trump s ego to his face to the laughter of a crowd that Obama fit into and Trump didn t is one of the more graceless things he s done. His speechwriters, John Favreau and Jon Lovett, express some remorse now for having let the  circus-like atmosphere  goad them, and Obama, into it. One doubts that the president has any second thoughts; he rarely does.But what comes off clearly is that the WHCD has become just another vehicle for amplifying, rather than leavening, the presidential megaphone and the bitterness of our present politics, while widening the gulf between the DC  cool kids  and the rest of the country. It s a tradition that has outlived its usefulness, and should die.  National ReviewObama used his last White House Correspondents dinner to joke about it possibly being  perhaps the last White House Correspondents Dinner . It may have been the only thing he said that night that may actually turn out to be true.\"],[\"Conform or pay the ultimate price Police seized ten children from an  off grid  homeschool family in Kentucky on Wednesday after receiving an anonymous tip about the family s traditional lifestyle.The nightmare story began when sheriff s officers set up a blockade around Joe and Nicole Naugler s rural property before entering the premises. Eight of the kids were out with their father but Nicole and two of her oldest children were at home. Nicole attempted to drive away but was subsequently stopped and arrested for resisting (attempting to prevent officers from taking her two boys away).The sheriff then demanded Joe Naugler turn over the other eight children by 10am the next day or face felony charges, an order with which he complied. They are an extremely happy family,  said family friend Pace Ellsworth, who asserts that the Nauglers were targeted because of their  back to basics life  and their decision to homeschool their children.Friends reported no concerns about how the children were being treated by the parents, who follow an educational model called  unschooling  where the children decide their own curriculum based on the subjects that interest them and what their strengths are. This is the natural way to live,  said Ellsworth.  It s actually a growing movement. They want to have a personal education and not a factory education. They are completely open about their life. Everyone is learning by living. They are all extremely intelligent. The family s Facebook page   entitled  My Blessed Little Homestead,  is a charming testament to their way of life. The Naugler children are obviously living a blissful  free range  lifestyle amongst 26 acres of land in Breckinridge County. They frequently post pictures and videos of their children, animals and their off-grid life,  reports Off the Grid News.  A May 5 post showed a video of a toddler, Mosiah, learning to walk. An April 24 post showed a happy family, gathering around a campfire, roasting marshmallows. The family have set up a GoFundMe page to try and raise money for legal expenses.A website for the family spells out their plight with the heart-wrenching words;  This Kentucky family of 12 people, 6 dogs, 2 farm cats and a few random farm animals was just torn apart. Their crime: Living a simple, back to basics life. This shocking story once again illustrates how families attempting to simply get on with their lives in a traditional manner are being treated as extremists by other Americans, snitched on, and targeted by authorities.Here is a Facebook link to the Nagger family business: Blessed Little Grooming Company, LLCVia: InfoWars\"],[\"Donald Trump at this point is known for spewing crazy statements, but in an interview with TIME, The Donald somehow managed to outdo himself in attempting to defend some of his more batsh*t insane lies.Asked about his claim that President Obama put a  tapp  on his  wires  at Trump Tower, The Donald explained that he has  articles saying it happened.  The random, word salady string of words Trump threw together to support this one is so impressively moronic that Sarah Palin seems like a genius by comparison: No, I have, look. I have articles saying it happened. But you have to take a look at what they, they just went out at a news conference. Devin Nunes had a news conference. I mean I don t know, I was unable to see it, because I am at meetings, but they just had a news conference talking about surveillance. Now again, it is in quotes. That means surveillance and various other things. And the New York Times had a front-page story, which they actually reduced, they took it, they took it the word wiretapping out of the title, but its first story in the front page of the paper was wiretapping. And a lot of information has just been learned, and a lot of information may be learned over the next coming period of time. We will see what happens. Look. I predicted a lot of things that took a little of bit of time. Here, headline, for the front page of the New York Times,  Wiretapped data used in inquiry of Trump aides.  That s a headline. Now they then dropped that headline, I never saw this until this morning. They then dropped that headline, and they used another headline without the word wiretap, but they did mean wiretap. Wiretapped data used in inquiry. Then changed after that, they probably didn t like it. And they changed the title. They took the wiretap word out. Devin Nunes did indeed have a  news conference  in which he did attempt to push Trump s lies by pointing out that many of The Donald s associates had been caught up in perfectly legal  incidental collection  while the FBI and other agencies were looking into foreign suspects. Nunes, a prominent member of Trump s transition team, also completely skipped telling his fellow Russia investigators of this development and ran directly to Mr. 45 with the information.Though Nunes has previously said there is no evidence that Obama  tapped  Trump s  wires,  The Donald took the incidental collection of information   a term he admits he does not understand   as proof that he was correct about that dastardly President Obama: Well, he just got this information. This was new information. That was just got. Members, of, let s see, were under surveillance during the Obama Administration following November s election. Wow. This just came out. So, ah, just came out. Trump also told TIME that he will be  proved right  about his wacky claim that three million undocumented immigrants voted for his opponent, swinging the popular vote in Hillary Clinton s favor. Despite the completely false nature of Trump s allegations, he says he s  forming a committee on it  and it may be  more than  three million   a  serious problem. Asked about his completely unfounded claim that thousands of Muslims celebrated in the streets of New Jersey after 9\\u002f11, Trump claimed that it was in the Washington Post. This claim has been disputed by literally everyone with any sense.Trump even defended his blatantly incorrect claim that Ted Cruz s father helped kill JFK by saying it was in a  newspaper.  It wasn t, but that didn t stop him from lying again: Well that was in a newspaper. No, no, I like Ted Cruz, he s a friend of mine. But that was in the newspaper. I wasn t, I didn t say that. I was referring to a newspaper. A Ted Cruz article referred to a newspaper story with, had a picture of Ted Cruz, his father, and Lee Harvey Oswald, having breakfast. In fact, according to The Donald, he is not responsible for any of his lies because someone else made the numerous false claims elsewhere and he simply repeated them: Why do you say that I have to apologize? I m just quoting the newspaper, just like I quoted the judge the other day, Judge Napolitano, I quoted Judge Napolitano, just like I quoted Bret Baier, I mean Bret Baier mentioned the word wiretap. Now he can now deny it, or whatever he is doing, you know. But I watched Bret Baier, and he used that term. I have a lot of respect for Judge Napolitano, and he said that three sources have told him things that would make me right. I don t know where he has gone with it since then. But I m quoting highly respected people from highly respected television networks. This is perhaps the most insane interview conducted with the President of the United States.

The Turkish MP who broke this story was then charged with treason by the Erdogan government. If that wasn t enough, Turkey then began a campaign of state oppression by targeting journalists and newspapers who were critical of leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan s political machine (still clinging to power in Ankara). The embattled authoritarian regime then took its act on the road, to a city which always welcomes its dictators with open arms  Washington DC.Unfortunately, Erdogan s henchmen thought they were still in Ankara when they attacked journalists and protesters yesterday in the nation s capital. Erdogan s thugs forgot they were in the US, where some press and citizens still have rights.As expected, total silence on the incident by President Obama and his US State Department. Silence is consent. Of course, if this happened at a Donald Trump event, we would never hear the end of it from the media and the Obama administration   but because it s by a NATO member (and an actual fascist government), well then, that s perfectly acceptable for mandarins in Washington.Clearly, Turkey s media crackdown knows no borders  RTThe security detail for Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan clashed with opposing activists for the second day in a row in Washington, DC, removing journalists and even confronting city police after law enforcement refused to remove protesters from the area.With Erdogan set to give a speech at the Brookings Institute on Thursday, a group of protesters opposing his crackdown on free speech in Turkey, his government s treatment of the country s Kurdish population, and what they say is his tolerance of Islamic State, gathered near the DC-based think tank to express their opposition.Protesters chanting\\\"\\\" #Erdogan is commander in chief of ISIS\\\"\\\" outside the Brookings where he is speaking soon pic.twitter.com\\u002fEE1akSSHeO  Paulina Leonovich (@Polly_evro) March 31\"],[\"In yet another example of Trump s inability to maintain even a slight bit of tact while representing America s interests overseas, the White House reportedly canceled plans to visit a historic landmark during his visit to Israel   one of the nation s biggest tourist attractions. The reason: Trump wanted to land his helicopter directly on the ancient mountain fortress and was told no.President Donald Trump has canceled a planned visit and speech at the ancient mountain fortress of Masada in Israel after authorities told him that he could not land his helicopter on top of the UNESCO-listed site.Instead, Trump will now deliver a speech at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem. It comes after an Israeli Air Force (IAF) regulation that prevents helicopters landing at the summit of the Masada site, according to Israel s Channel 2 broadcaster.Unlike former presidents who have made the trip, such as George W. Bush and Bill Clinton, Trump declined to land the helicopter at a base of the historic site and then take the cable car up, preferring to cancel the visit altogether.The reasons not allowing helicopters near the 2,000-year-old ruins should be obvious: For starters, the dust and sand that characterize the mountaintop are extremely rough on helicopter motors. Secondly, the wind and sand kicked up by the powerful blades can destroy the ancient structures, costing archaeologists priceless artifacts. Avoiding those issues by simply getting in a cable car was apparently too much energy.It may be another sign that Trump is hoping to breeze past this trip while doing minimal work. Sources close to Trump say he is extremely upset about having to travel abroad for a multi-day trip to the Middle East and already begged his staff to cut the number of days he d be gone. Keen observers of Trump s habits might note that Trump will be missing at least two weekends during the trip, days he typically reserves for golfing at his various private courses.Trump s demands on his overseas guests have raised eyebrows before. Earlier this year, Trump created a stir in England when reports leaked that he had requested Queen Elizabeth pick him up in a golden chariot:The White House has made clear it regards the carriage procession down the Mall as an essential element of the itinerary for the visit currently planned for the second week of October, according to officials.The request frustrated royal planners who described the situation as a logistical and financial nightmare.It s unclear how Israelis will react to Trump s show of laziness during his trip. Already the country s mood toward Trump is souring after the president is said to have leaked classified information provided by Israeli intelligence services to the Russians. He hasn t even left the White House and already his trip is shaping up to be trouble.Featured image via Mark Wilson\\u002fGetty Images\"],[\"Here s just one more piece to the puzzle Hillary was able to delete the money trail with bleach bit The owner of BleachBit was tipped off that his product was used by Clinton when Trey Gowdy mentioned it in a TV interview:  Gowdy said Clinton s emails had been so thoroughly scrubbed that  even God can t read them. How transparent of her!BleachBit s creator says Hillary may have chosen that program to scrub emails because it doesn t leave a  money trail .Hillary Clinton s decision to use BleachBit to scrub her private email server could have been based on the fact that the free software can be downloaded and used with complete anonymity, the program s developer said.Andrew Ziem, the creator of BleachBit, pointed to a recent CNN report about his software in which a computer security expert had speculated that Clinton s team would have selected a more expensive, more sophisticated service if it truly sought to conceal records. While there may be some merit to that, there is also an argument to be made for hoping that this doesn t leave a money trail. :Ziem said he was not aware Clinton had applied BleachBit to her server until Rep. Trey Gowdy said so on Fox News Thursday, because downloads of the program are anonymous and untraceable.Gowdy said Clinton s emails had been so thoroughly scrubbed that  even God can t read them. It seems probable that the intent was to erase information,  Ziem said of Clinton s use of BleachBit.The open-source software can also be used to clear space on a computer with a cluttered memory, the BleachBit creator said.But in a post on his website Saturday, Ziem noted the program is an effective way to delete emails beyond recovery short of the  physical destruction  of servers with  a hammer or blow torch. Millions of people have downloaded BleachBit since its creation in 2008, Ziem said. He noted his website has experienced a spike in traffic since Clinton s use of BleachBit was revealed.Read more: Washington Examiner \"],[\"A longtime Republican Party donor based in Florida vowed not to contribute any more money to candidates or electioneering groups until they pass legislation banning the sale of assault weapons to civilians.Al Hoffman Jr., a real estate developer and former ambassador to Portugal, has donated millions to Republicans over the years. On Saturday he sent an email to a half-dozen Republican donors, encouraging them to boycott candidates who oppose new gun legislation, the New York Times reported.  FOX The New York Times reports that Hoffman made this announcement via an email that he sent to Jeb Bush and Gov. Rick Scott (R), among others. Hoffman was a major contributor to the George W. Bush presidential campaign. He also donated more than $1 million to a PAC supporting Jeb Bush s failed presidential campaign bid.Hoffman wrote,  For how many years now have we been doing this   having these experiences of terrorism, mass killings   and how many years has it been that nothing s been done? It s the end of the road for me.  He added,  I will not write another check unless they all support a ban on assault weapons. Enough is enough! Predictably, the leftist media has now embraced the mega-Republican Party donor. CNN s Ana Navaro tweeted her praise for Hoffman s ultimatum.

At least that s what he keeps telling people. And when you re running in an election for a party that constantly uses the service of men and women and uniform as political props, you re going to tout the line that you love veterans as much as possible. However, actions speak louder than words, and Trump apparently doesn t realize that people actually remember the actions he took back in 1991 when he tried to remove veterans from 5th Avenue in New York City. You see, Trump Tower is on 5th Avenue, and those gosh darn veterans trying to make a living as vendors were just too unsightly for Trump to have anywhere near his precious building.In a letter Trump wrote to the New York state Assembly in 1991, it said: While disabled veterans should be given every opportunity to earn a living, is it fair to do so to the detriment of the city as a whole or its tax paying citizens and businesses? Do we allow Fifth Avenue, one of the world s finest and most luxurious shopping districts, to be turned into an outdoor flea market, clogging and seriously downgrading the area? And then again to NYC Mayor Mike Bloomberg in 2004: Whether they are veterans or not, they [the vendors] should not be allowed to sell on this most important and prestigious shopping street he image of New York City will suffer  I hope you can stop this very deplorable situation before it is too late. And in case that s not bad enough for you, he also wanted to make sure no one sat down near his building that may have taken away from the  beautiful ambience.  According to the New York Times he had large planters placed on benches. He said in 1984: We have had tremendous difficulties with respect to the bench   drug addicts, vagrants, et cetera have come to the atrium in large numbers. Additionally, all sorts of  horrors  had been taking place that effectively ruined the beautiful ambience of the space which everyone loves so much. To be blunt, Donald Trump is exactly what s wrong with the United States of America, and for him to even remotely be coming close to gaining the Republican nomination for president is outright horrifying. He only loves veterans when it s politically convenient for him to do so. To pander to a bunch of folks who are apparently so dumb to think he would actually make a decent president. His actions in the past with veterans only prove the continuing line that Trump is only out for himself and what s best for Trump. He doesn t want America to be great, because guess what, America is already pretty damn great. Trump wants Trump to be great, and he wants to stroke his ego inside the Oval Office. Smart Americans know better, and we need to make sure he stays as far away from the White House as possible.Featured image: Flickr\\u002fWikimedia\\u002fphotoshop\"],[\"AP News  The regulars amble in before dawn and claim their usual table, the one next to an old box television playing the news on mute.Steven Whitt fires up the coffee pot and flips on the fluorescent sign in the window of the Frosty Freeze, his diner that looks and sounds and smells about the same as it did when it opened a half-century ago. Coffee is 50 cents a cup, refills 25 cents. The pot sits on the counter, and payment is based on the honor system.People like it that way, he thinks. It reminds them of a time before the world seemed to stray away from them, when coal was king and the values of the nation seemed the same as the values here, in God s Country, in this small county isolated in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains.Everyone in town comes to his diner for nostalgia and homestyle cooking. And, recently, news reporters come from all over the world to puzzle over politics   because Elliott County, a blue-collar union stronghold, voted for the Democrat in each and every presidential election for its 147-year existence.Until Donald Trump came along and promised to wind back the clock. He was the hope we were all waiting on, the guy riding up on the white horse. There was a new energy about everybody here,  says Whitt. I still see it. Despite the president s dismal approval ratings and lethargic legislative achievements, he remains profoundly popular here in these mountains, a region so badly battered by the collapse of the coal industry it became the symbolic heart of Trump s white working-class base.The frenetic churn of the national news, the ceaseless Twitter taunts, the daily declarations of outrage scroll soundlessly across the bottom of the diner s television screen, rarely registering. When they do, Trump doesn t shoulder the blame   because the allegiance of those here is as emotional as it is economic.It means God, guns, patriotism, saying  Merry Christmas  and not Happy Holidays. It means validation of their indignation about a changing nation: gay marriage and immigration and factories moving overseas. It means tearing down the political system that neglected them again and again in favor of the big cities that feel a world away.On those counts, they believe Trump has delivered, even if his promised blue-collar renaissance has not yet materialized. He s punching at all the people who let them down for so long   the presidential embodiment of their own discontent. He s already done enough to get my vote again, without a doubt, no question,  Wes Lewis, a retired pipefitter and one of Whitt s regulars, declares as he deals the day s first hand of cards.He thinks the mines and the factories will soon roar back to life, and if they don t, he believes they would have if Democrats and Republicans and the media   all  crooked as a barrel of fishhooks    had gotten out of the way. What Lewis has now that he didn t have before Trump is a belief that his president is pulling for people like him. One thing I hear in here a lot is that nobody s gonna push him into a corner,  says Whitt, 35.  He s a fighter. I think they like the bluntness of it. He plops down at an empty table next to the card game, drops a stack of mail onto his lap and begins flipping through the envelopes. Bill, bill, bill,  he reports to his wife, Chesla, who has arrived to relieve him at the restaurant they run together. He needs to run home and change of out his Frosty Freeze uniform, the first of several work ensembles he wears each day, and put on his second, a suit and tie. He also owns a local funeral home and he s the county coroner, elected as a Democrat.The Whitts, like many people here, cobble together a living with a couple jobs each   sometimes working 12 or 15 hours a day   because there aren t many options better than minimum wage. There s the school system, and a prison, and that s pretty much it. Outside of town, population 622, roads wind past rolling farms that used to grow tobacco before that industry crumbled too, then up into the hills of Appalachia, with its spectacular natural beauty and grinding poverty that has come to define this region in the American imagination.Whitt slides a medical bill across the table. Looks like this one is the new helmet,  he says, and his wife tears the envelope open and reports the debt: $3,995. They will add it to a growing pile that s already surpassed $40,000 since their son was born nine months ago with a rare condition. His skull was shaped like an egg, the bones fused together in places they shouldn t be. Tommy, their baby boy with big blue eyes, has now outgrown three of the helmets he s been required to wear after surgery so his bones grow back together like they should.They pay $800 a month for insurance. But when they took their baby to a surgeon in Cincinnati, they learned it was out of network. In-network hospitals offered only more invasive surgeries, so they opted to pay out of pocket. At the hospital they were told that if they d been on an insurance program for the poor, it would have all been free.This represents the cracks in America s institutions that drove Whitt, a lifelong Democrat, from supporting President Barack Obama to buying a  Make America Great Again  cap that he still keeps on top of the hutch. Many of their welfare-dependent neighbors, he believes, stay trapped in a cycle of handouts and poverty while hardworking taxpayers like him and his wife are stuck with the tab and can t get ahead. Where s the fairness in that?  he asks.But Whitt doesn t blame Trump for the failure this year to repeal the health care law and replace it with something better. He blames the  brick wall  in Washington, the politicians he sees as blocking everything Trump proposes while  small people  like them in small places like this are left again to languish.A third of people here live in poverty. Just 9 percent of adults have a college degree, but they always made up for that with backbreaking labor that workers traveled dozens of miles to neighboring counties or states to do, and those jobs have gotten harder to find.Many here blame global trade agreements and the  war on coal    environmental regulations designed by Obama s administration to curb carbon emissions   for the decline of mining and manufacturing jobs. When Trump bemoans the  American carnage  of lost factories and lost faith, it feels like he s talking to the people in these Appalachian hills. When he scraps dozens of regulations to the horror of environmentalists and says it means jobs are on the way, they embrace him.Coal has ticked up since Trump took office; mining companies have added 1,200 jobs across the country since his inauguration, more than 180 of them in Kentucky. But industry analysts say that was tied largely to market forces and dismiss Trump s repeated pledges to resuscitate the coal industry as pie in the sky. Coal has been on the decline for many decades for many reasons outside of regulation: far cheaper natural gas, mechanization, thinning Appalachian seams. With the opposition he s had, I think he s pulling the plow pretty good,  offers Wes Lewis from the card table. A few months ago, he says, he saw four brand-new coal rigs going through town.  For the longest time, under Obama, all we saw were trucks being pulled on wreckers, because people turned belly up, they went broke. Lewis says he s heard about friends of friends being called back to work. He s noticed new trucks in people s driveways, too, which he takes as evidence that his neighbors are feeling confident about their futures. These tiny signs stack up to him as proof. Lewis fishes the tag out of the bib of his overalls:  Made in Mexico,  it reads. Trump s bringing them back,  he says.Lewis, a registered Democrat, trusts Trump because he trusts his values. And because of that, he trusts Trump s other promises   so strongly he can t think of anything that would shake that faith in him. If the factories and mines don t come back, he ll blame the opposition. If there isn t a wall on the Mexico border, he says, it won t be because Trump didn t try. If investigators find his campaign colluded with Russians, it s because so many people are so determined to bring him down.Go HERE to read entire story.\"],[\"Only supporters of Donald Trump could say something so stupid that a news anchor smacks their own head in frustration.When CNN host Alisyn Camerota organized a discussion with a bunch of Trump supporters, she apparently didn t expect the monumental stupidity she was about to receive.The group of Trump supporters, which included Susan DeLemus, Paula Johnson, and others whom Camerota has spoken to before throughout the 2016 Election, were totally ignorant of Trump s picks for his administration and repeatedly spouted falsehoods in order to defend him.DeLemus claimed that Trump only picked  top  people to fill his cabinet. People that I m looking at that Trump has appointed or nominated have all been top of the class, number one in their field, extremely talented, great leaders on their own,  she said.Of course, any reasonable person with a functioning brain understands that Trump has been scraping the bottom of the conservative barrel to fill government positions. After all, no one can say with a straight face that Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions is the best attorney in the country.And no one can say that Sarah Palin is even remotely qualified to be Secretary of anything, much less Secretary of Veterans Affairs. Trump s pick to run the Department of Education, Betsy DeVos, is staunchly anti-public schools and funds a group that wants to dismantle child labor laws because mining would be  exciting  for kids. In other words, she is definitely unqualified to shape the future of education in this country.But when the subject of protests against Trump came up, Camerota was flooded with idiocy spearheaded by Johnson. Voting is a privilege in this country and you need to be legal, not like California where three million illegals voted,  she claimed. Where are you getting your information?  a confused Camerota asked.Johnson claimed she got the information from the media, including CNN, which means Johnson probably took reports on Trump s tweet about 3 million people voting illegally for Hillary Clinton as the truth because the media reported on it.Johnson repeatedly insisted that California let 3 million undocumented immigrants vote and claimed that President Obama encouraged them to vote. All of the panelists agreed, with one even daring Camerota to  Google it  because it s on Facebook. Well, Camerota did and found that Fox Business deceptively edited a clip of President Obama to make it sound like he encouraged undocumented immigrants to vote when, in fact, he did not.But that didn t sway Johnson from continuing to insist that California allows undocumented immigrants to vote, which caused Camerota to smack her own head in frustration because the stupid was clearly strong in this one.Here s the video via YouTube.Seriously, Donald Trump claim about 3 million illegal voters has been thoroughly debunked and has been trashed by members of his own party because it is so absurd. This segment proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that Trump supporters are completely ignorant and have been brainwashed to believe anything that Trump says. And yet they wonder why they are constantly mocked.Featured image via screenshot\"],[\"This double standard surprises no one who s paying attention to the radical leftist media who decides is a legitimate target and who is not Seattle Mariners catcher Steve Clevenger has been suspended for criticizing Black Lives Matter and President Obama.

Comey said in July that agents found 110 classified emails containing emails that were classified at the time they were sent or received. That included eight marked  top secret. Although Comey labeled Clinton s behavior  extremely careless,  he added that it did not warrant prosecution.We do assess that hostile actors gained access to the private commercial e-mail accounts of people with whom Secretary Clinton was in regular contact from her personal account. We also assess that Secretary Clinton s use of a personal e-mail domain was both known by a large number of people and readily apparent. She also used her personal e-mail extensively while outside the United States, including sending and receiving work-related e-mails in the territory of sophisticated adversaries. Given that combination of factors, we assess it is possible that hostile actors gained access to Secretary Clinton s personal e-mail account.  James Comey on Hillary s server  Lifezette And here is the hilarious version of Comey Vs. Clinton. Enjoy! All kidding aside Even if we assume Comey didn t botch the Clinton email investigation   which is quite an assumption to make, especially considering how outraged so many investigators in the FBI were in the weeks and months following Comey s announcement   why did the FBI director continue to comment on ongoing investigations? Why did he continue to feed red meat to wolves on both sides of the aisle in Congress?The FBI, regardless of Comey s intentions, has now become a blunt political tool that s being wielded by some of the most dishonest, power-hungry people in the country: politicians. That s not only foolish and reckless, it s dangerous to liberty and undermines the credibility of a group of people that must appear credible in the minds of the people for justice to be served and for liberty to endure.The American people deserve better from their FBI director, and if Comey proves to be incapable of exercising greater prudence, perhaps it s time for someone more careful and considerate to take the helm at one of the world s most powerful government agencies. -The Blaze\"],[\" Any agreement or disagreement with a president s politics, policies or agenda can be expressed in other ways    PITTSBURGH PENGUINSLike voting?Why do these sports clowns feel the need to bring politics into a sport that all Americans watch and support? This all started with a disrespectful protest against our law enforcement and has snowballed into a protest against President Trump.

The Pittsburgh Penguins respect the institution of the Office of the President, and the long tradition of championship teams visiting the White House,  the team said in a statement issued Sunday morning.

Like healthcare, education is a sclerotic, overexpensive, underperforming industry. Both have strong parallels: they re dominated by government subsidies and controls, though not entirely socialized; they re perhaps the only growth industries in our moribund economy; and they dominate the thought life of the nation. As Arnold Kling and Nick Schulz pointed out in 2011:These are our foremost growth sectors   the ones most central to employment and consumption; the ones that, increasingly, drive our economy. And it is in precisely these two sectors that the case for extensive government intervention and planning, if not outright control, is dominant   and becoming ever more so.If there is to be any hope of reversing this trend, champions of market economics must come to see these two sectors as the front lines in the battle for capitalism. At stake is not only an ideological or theoretical point, but also American prosperity. The historical record makes this clear: In the nations where it was practiced, government control of the old commanding heights of the economy made those industries less efficient and less innovative   bringing overall economic performance down with them.Today, Hillary Clinton is touting her plan for Obamacare-izing higher education. Competing Democratic presidential candidates Martin O Malley and Bernie Sanders have already proposed essentially socializing college straight up. Clinton s proposal, like Obamacare, is also collectivist and unjustified wealth redistribution, but with a more complicated, less direct, crony capitalist flavor. In other words, it s not direct socialism, but it might as well be.By mucking around this way, Clinton gains the benefit of deception: She can argue that  both the left and the right  (by  right,  she of course means the craziest of Republicans, not actual conservatives) have proposed elements of her plan. So she gets to smear her Frankenstein with pretty  bipartisan  makeup. And the average voter won t care, because the average voter doesn t give jack about enslaving his children (or other people s children) to the unseen but growing monstrosity of federal debt, as long as he gets feel-goodies now, regardless of whether they actually benefit anyone. But it s still a Frankenstein.What Does Hillary Clinton Propose, Exactly? Before we get into the mud-slinging, let s do what most journalists do not and give some actual hard facts about Clinton s proposal. (Do any of you also scan news articles looking for actual facts instead of paid spokespeople s lying spin? It s hard to find those, isn t it?) The full proposal doesn t seem available (probably so they can tweak its details in response to initial criticism); reporters have gotten  three fact sheets,  MSNBC says. Inside Higher Ed kindly posted them. A news summary of the major points: Under the plan, which was outlined by Clinton advisers on Sunday, about $175 billion in grants would go to states that guarantee students would not have to take out loans to cover tuition at four-year public colleges and universities. In return for the money, states would have to end budget cuts to increase spending over time on higher education, while also working to slow the growth of tuition, thought the plan does not require states to cap it.  (NYT) military veterans, lower-income students and those who complete a national service program, like AmeriCorps, would go to school for free in the Clinton plan  (AP). She would also expand income-based repayment programs, allowing every student borrower to enroll in a plan that would cap their payments at 10 percent of their income with remaining debt forgiven after 20 years.  (AP) Student borrowers would be expected to work at least 10 hours a week to contribute, while their families would continue contributing under the current income-based model. Clinton s plan would also expand a tax credit from $1,000 to $2,500 for families paying for college.  (MSNBC) Her campaign says she will create a dedicated fund for Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and will expand AmeriCorps from 75,000 to 250,000 members.  (MSNBC) Mrs. Clinton would pay for the [supposedly $350 billion] plan by capping the value of itemized deductions that wealthy families can take on their tax returns.  (NYT)So more income redistribution and more federal micromanagement because, clearly, central planners know better how to manage college costs than colleges and families. Topped off, of course, by (what else?) playing self-appointed Robin Hood against people who earn lots less money than she does. Envy and greed are our society s favorite sins, after all.Federal Meddling Is the Problem, Not the AnswerThe most expensive portion of Clinton s proposal involves bullying states into following federal marching orders in order for them to receive cash the feds scooped from taxpayers.For entire story: The Federalist\"],[\"Randy Bryce, known as @IronStache on Twitter, launched a campaign to oust Paul Ryan from Wisconsin s 1st District. Bryce is a union ironworker who has been campaigning for all of one day, and he s already raised $100,000. That is a lot for a new face who s a Democrat living in Republican-land and running in a district that s gone to Paul Ryan every two years since 1999.Bryce isn t just a union ironworker in Republican-land, Wisconsin, though. He s an Army veteran who enlisted right after high school, and then worked his way up to being an ironworker through apprenticeship. His mother suffers from multiple sclerosis, his father is in an assisted living facility, and Randy himself is a cancer survivor. He s campaigning primarily on healthcare right now, and he says on his website: What Paul Ryan and the Republicans are doing to take health care away from millions of us, to make it cost more and cover less, and to allow the protections we ve gained to be stripped away   it s just unacceptable. Bryce has an uphill battle to fight. Ryan is very well-connected both in the 1st District and across America. However, Bryce will work to tie Ryan to Donald Trump as much as possible, working off Democrats  hopes that the Trump effect will help flip Congress next year.But it may not be that terrible a climg. Paul Ryan is already wildly unpopular around the country, with an approval rating below 30 percent. That could very well pull down his popularity in his own district. He s also starting to get a reputation for making every excuse in the book for Trump. Regarding obstruction of justice, Ryan lamely claimed that Trump is new and doesn t know what s appropriate and what s not when it comes to interacting with various agency heads, particularly those in the law enforcement and intelligence communities. Ryan gave him a pass as though he s a little child navigating his way through the world for the first time.He s also confident that Trump will approve of the massively unpopular GOP healthcare bill whatever form that ends up taking and once again blasted the ACA while claiming that their bill is ever so much better.Ryan is almost inextricably linked to Trump right now, and as Trump s base shrinks, so will Ryan s. What Bryce is doing and clearly, what many are hoping he can do is taking advantage of the possibility that a hole will open up in the 1st District because of Trump.Featured image via Win McNamee\\u002fGetty Images\"],[\"Over the last few weeks, I ve watched as the last shreds of the Republican Party s  family values  rotted away.As Alabama voters prepare to go to the polls in December they have two choices before them.They can vote for the Democrat and prove that they refuse to tolerate an accused child molester and sexual predator being in their party and in the Senate, or they can put political power over the morality they have long preached about.In other words, they can either put power over principles or put principles over power.They can t do both.And while they are damned if they do and damned if they don t, choosing the latter of those two options would be a far better and more honorable choice.Some things go above politics, and sexual assault is, and rightfully should, be one of them.Voting for Moore for the sake of political power throws every sexual assault victim under the bus. It will especially be a slap in the face of women across the country, a major voting block that has already been overwhelmingly voting Democrat for many years.If Republicans want to have any chance of surviving as a legitimate political party for many more decades to come, it is critical that they start by drawing a line in the sand when it comes to Moore and the people who defend him such as Donald Trump.This starting point alone can restore a little of the respect the GOP has lost. Perhaps then, they ll even be courageous enough to rejects the racists and the sexists and the Nazis, which will do more to grow the ranks of the party than the Southern Strategy ever did.And then the Republican Party can get past being a haven for extremists and anti-government zealots and get on the road to becoming a sane party with real ideas instead of simply opposing and obstructing at every turn, which has not been good for the country at all.America has lost its respect of the international community and our reputation has been seriously sullied. Letting Moore step inside the Senate would send a message to the world that America supports child molestation and the sexual assault and harassment of women.Such a message from the Republican Party smacks of hypocrisy. After all, we are talking about the same party that constantly bring up the sexual assault allegations against Bill Clinton.But just like how they constantly bring up Abraham Lincoln in an attempt to claim that the Republican Party must still be great, their rhetoric about Bill Clinton is old and tired and not really that relevant today. The GOP is far removed from the days of Lincoln. And Bill Clinton was president two decades ago and if he were running today he would not win. The sexual assault allegations alone would prevent him from even getting on the ballot.However, by supporting Donald Trump, who was accused by a dozen women of sexual assault during the 2016 campaign, Republicans committed a serious hypocrisy that undermines their Bill Clinton talking point.If Moore wins next month, Republicans will only be doubling down on that hypocrisy and they ll be past the point of no return. And the consequences will be severe.America is more diverse than ever before. Women have emerged as a force to be reckoned with after decades of old white guys running the show. Minorities are also set to become the majority of the population, and once that scale tips, the GOP will no longer be able to be the party of white people. It just won t work.It s just a matter of time, and time is running out for the Republican Party.And that s why they must rise above politics and stand for something bigger than themselves.Sexual assault and child molestation should not be rewarded with power and prestige. And that should go beyond the political arena as well, whether the behavior is coming from a corporate CEO or the part-owner of a website or a church leader or any other position of power.Republicans need to start practicing the  morality  they preach and they can do that by putting politics aside and do the right thing.That s what Republicans did in 1860 when they voted for a dark horse candidate as their flagbearer. Lincoln then put politics aside to assemble one of the greatest Cabinets in our history, bringing together liberal and conservative Republicans and even a Democrat or two.And even though Lincoln remained neutral at first and the politics of day made it really difficult, he made the decision to put politics aside and pushed for the passage of the 13th Amendment. Such a move at the time could have cost Lincoln a second term, but he did it anyway.Lincoln put principle over power in the face of an even more contentious and hateful political environment than we are experiencing today. It s time for Republicans to do the same now.Seven years ago, my first article for this site explained how Republicans have put power over principles for decades to the detriment of our progress towards a better future for everyone.Today, I want inform my loyal readers that this will be my final article for Addicting Info.It has been an honor and a privilege to write here for so many years.

As Democrats try to create mass hysteria over the Republican tax reform bill, left-wing news organizations like CNN have admitted that the tax bill is going to give working families  damn good money. On Wednesday, CNN host John King said,  The Republicans are making a big bet, taking a big risk. Will over time the American people say,  Oh, actually I like having more money in my pocket.

Protesters and police have been clashing repeatedly at Standing Rock in North Dakota over the possibility that the pipeline will contaminate water supplies for the Standing Rock Sioux.The Daily Beast is reporting that the Army Corps of Engineers denied the easement pending an environmental impact study. NBC 4 Washington has just released a statement from Sioux chairman David Archambault II that says: I heard the army Corp [sic] of engineers will not grant the easement and they will reroute.

For the first time in hisopry [sic] native American, they heard our voices. This is something that will go down in history and is a blessing for all indigenous people. Protesters have been gathering at Standing Rock for months to support the Sioux in their fight against the pipeline, and within the last few days, military veterans began heading out in support of the protests and to form a shield around the camp.

However, effective Feb. 1, sheriff s officials will honor so-called immigration holds or  detainers  placed by federal authorities only when a suspect is booked into the Travis County Jail on charges of capital murder, aggravated sexual assault and  continuous smuggling of persons. Otherwise, federal agents must have a court order or arrest warrant signed by a judge for the jail to continue housing a person whose immigration status is in question, according to Hernandez s policy, which she released Friday. The public must be confident that local law enforcement is focused on local public safety, not on federal immigration enforcement. Our jail cannot be perceived as a holding tank for ICE or that Travis County deputies are ICE officers,  Hernandez said in a video announcement.

They are so furious, in fact, that they will be using an old tactic from the 1960s Civil Rights Movement to force Gov. Pat McCrory to repeal the law: sit-ins.Matt Barber, who is the president of the North Carolina NAACP, says he is giving McCrory until April 21st to get rid of this terrible law, or there will be sit-ins until he does. Barber says of the law: We cannot be silent in the face of this race-based, class-based, homophobic and transphobic attack on wage earners, civil rights, and the LGBTQ community. Together with our many allies, we will coordinate a campaign of nonviolent direct action along with other forms of nonviolent protest that will instruct our legislators with respect to the rights of all people. Because the next session of the House doesn t start until the 25th of April, they would need a special session to meet Barber s demands by his April 21st deadline. Barber s Forward Together Moral Movement is behind the organization of the sit-ins, and more information will be forthcoming. They are also the group responsible for North Carolina s now-famous Moral Monday activist activities.Of course, the bigots on the wrong side of history are not going quietly into the dustbins of history where they belong, either. The Christian Action League of North Carolina has already planned a rally in Raleigh, the state s capitol, to stand in solidarity with the bigoted lawmakers who made discrimination legal.

And do the rules of engagement only apply to the US Military? A retrial is set to begin Monday at Camp Pendleton for a Marine convicted in the 2006 killing of an Iraqi civilian   one of the most high-profile and legally and politically complex court martials of the Iraq war.Sgt. Lawrence Hutchins was convicted in 2007 by a Marine jury of unpremeditated murder in the killing of a 52-year-old former Iraqi police officer in Hamandiya, west of Baghdad.The killing was meant as a warning to Iraqis to stop planting roadside bombs and cooperating with insurgent snipers attacking U.S. troops.Six other Marines and a Navy corpsman were also convicted in what was called the Pendleton 8 case. As the squad leader, Hutchins got the longest sentence, 15 years, later reduced to 11.Appeals courts twice have overturned Hutchins  conviction: once on grounds that the NCIS illegally obtained a confession, once because his lawyer was allowed to retire on the eve of trial. The Marine Corps has opted for a retrial.Hutchins has spent more than six years behind bars, first at the federal prison at Ft. Leavenworth, Kan., and then the brig at Miramar Marine Corps Air Station in San Diego. Since mid-2013, he has been free on appeal, restored to his rank of sergeant and assigned to Camp Pendleton, living with his wife and children.The legal case has provoked strong, contrasting opinions among Marines.Several of Hutchins  co-defendants, all of whom are long since freed and returned to civilian life, believe the killing, while brutal, saved American lives because attacks on U.S. troops declined in the following months.Other Marines believe the Marine Corps must retry Hutchins to prove that it can hold its ranks accountable for the unauthorized use of deadly force. The Marine Corps is doing what justice demands,  said Gary Solis, a retired Marine and now an adjunct law professor at Georgetown University. It is being neither unfair nor harsh,  Solis said.  An innocent Iraqi male was taken prisoner by Hutchins and his squad and, while he was bound, repeatedly shot in the face [and] murdered. Much of the evidence against Hutchins will come from squad members who were convicted in the case, Solis noted:  Given the unusually strong case against Hutchins   the Marine Corps would be derelict were it to walk away from the murder of a defenseless Iraqi. But Bing West, former Marine, former assistant secretary of Defense and author of books about combat Marines in Iraq and Afghanistan, said that, given the chaos facing Marine  grunts  during the Iraq war, a retrial is unwarranted. In a savage war, Sgt. Hutchins, mistakenly believing he was protecting his squad, killed an innocent Iraqi,  West said.  He has spent several years in the brig. Further punishment would be unjust. It is time to allow him and all of us to move on. Marine prosecutors would not comment.Christopher Oprison, a former Marine and Hutchins  defense attorney, has promised a vigorous defense in which he will assert that the Marine Corps is continuing to pursue his client for political purposes. The case, he said,  is an indictment of the entire military justice system. The prosecution is basing its case on the information obtained by rogue NCIS agents who forced these young Marines to confess under threats and coercion. Oprison insists that comments made by Navy Secy. Ray Mabus in 2009 alleging guilt by the Pendleton 8 have tainted the case and prevented Hutchins from getting a fair trial. The political pressure to make an example out of Sgt. Hutchins is palpable,  Oprison said.  Enough is enough. The gloves are off. We hope to have Sgt. Hutchins home with his wife and children on Father s Day   a free man. Under military rules, the jury will include officers and enlisted, most of whom, if not all, have served combat tours in Iraq, Afghanistan or both. The jury will decide guilt or innocence, and punishment.Via: LA Times\"],[\"It s not the first time that the name of Vladimir Putin has been brought up in the US presidential campaign, but this time the US president used this  argument  while openly campaigning for Clinton against Trump. The situation has become  really ludicrous and it borders on the ridiculous,  believes Gregory R. Copley, editor of Defense & Foreign Affairs. In my 50 odd years covering the US government, I have never seen this level of partisanship within the administration where a sitting president actually regards the opposition party as the enemy of the state,  Copley told RT.The analyst said that the democrats are  blaming the messenger to revert the attention from the message. The message which Donald Trump delivered on RT was unambiguous in his campaign. Just like the fact that WikiLeaks revelation of the hacked emails was very explicit in showing up what the Democratic party itself was doing,  Copley added.The US establishment is  sacrificing key bilateral relationships in order to win [a] domestic election,  believes Copley. He added that neither Obama nor Clinton are interested in unifying the country, but they are rather  interested in winning and engaging in what modern democracy seems to have become   the tyranny of the marginal majority over the marginal minority. When you think about the number of times that the Clinton campaign has brought up President Putin and the alleged Russian hacking of Hillary Clinton s service, it makes you wonder just how desperate they are,  Copley noted.  President Obama has lost literally all prestige in an international community with the loss of prestige he has become desperate.

Provided by an anonymous representative of a hacker, Guccifer, the 500 megabytes detail the DNC s information technology infrastructure and internal reports on donors.Forbes reports that on Tuesday in London at the Future of Cyber Security Europe conference, Guccifer addressed cybersecurity experts through an unknown and remote transcriber.The notorious hacker then shared a trove of documents ostensibly obtained via a breach of the DNC s cybersecurity. According to Forbes, a password and login was given to them, and the documents they accessed appeared to show details of DNC donors and finances as well as the information technology setup to protect the sensitive data.In July, just as the Democratic National Convention was getting underway, WikiLeaks released the results of the first DNC hack carried out by Guccifer. That hack revealed signs of bias in favor of Hillary Clinton over her primary opponent Bernie Sanders, and consequently led to the resignation of the DNC chair, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, as well as several other top officers.The DNC responded to the latest hack claim Tuesday through its Interim Chair Donna Brazile, who stated that the  DNC is the victim of a crime,  which she blamed on  Russian state-sponsored agents,  while also cautioning that the hacked documents were still being authenticated by the DNC legal team, as  it is common for Russian hackers to forge documents.  \"],[\"A recent poll from Quinnipiac University has stunned the political world when it showed Hillary Clinton losing serious ground against Donald Trump in key swing states like Ohio, Florida, and Pennsylvania.However, what the media isn t reporting on is an even newer poll that shows Clinton s strong numbers against Trump in swing states (including Florida).A new NBC News\\u002fWall Street Journal poll shows Secretary Clinton crushing Donald Trump in Florida, Colorado, North Carolina and Virginia.In Colorado, she beats Trump by eight points, 43-35. In Florida (which the Quinnipiac Poll had Trump beating her by 3 points), Clinton is beating the Republican nominee by seven points, 44-37. Then there s north Carolina, where the former secretary is beating Trump by six points. It should be important to remember that President Obama lost North Carolina in 2012 after winning it in 2008.Finally in Virginia, in which the state s senator, Tim Kaine, is rumored to be a V.P. pick   Clinton beats Trump by nine points, 44-35, her biggest lead in a swing state.All these states make up 66 electorate votes, a sizeable chunk in the electoral tally.Not only does Clinton lead Trump in these states, she is also more well liked than their billionaire blowhard. The only thing Trump leads in is in unfavorability.While the media continues to harp on and on about Clinton being an unfavorable and disliked candidate, they somehow ignore the fact that Trump is losing in key battleground states because he is even more disliked.For someone who describes themselves as  the king of polls,  Trump has certainly been quiet about his losing edge against Clinton in the states that matter the most. The Clinton campaign has not brushed off the Trump campaign. They expect a close race.

We re actually looking for a candidate who is willing to stand up to politicians who ve forgotten who they came to Washington DC to represent We really do love much of what Rand stands for, but his comments about Senator Cruz couldn t have been more off base.Sen. Rand Paul on Tuesday said fellow Republican presidential candidate Ted. Cruz is  done for  in the Senate. Ted has chosen to make this really personal and chosen to call people dishonest in leadership and call them names, which really goes against the decorum and also against the rules of the Senate, and as a consequence, he can t get anything done legislatively,  Paul told Fox News Radio.  He is pretty much done for and stifled and it s really because of personal relationships, or lack of personal relationships, and it is a problem. Don t get us wrong We happen to agree with Senator Rand Paul on a lot of things. Picking on one of the most courageous men in Washington DC however, was not a very good idea especially when there is video footage like this that can be easily accessed:Paul, a Kentucky Republican who has had the backing of his home-state senior senator, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, despite some tough policy differences, had been asked about Cruz s inability to even muster the support of 11 senators to secure a roll call vote on a procedural motion designed to amend the continuing resolution to keep the government running.The Senate s set to vote on passage of that measure at 10 a.m. on Wednesday, the last day of the federal government s 2015 fiscal year. I approach things a little different, I am still just as hardcore in saying what we are doing, I just chose not to call people liars on the Senate floor and it s just a matter of different perspectives on how best to get to the end result,  Paul said in the interview.Paul backed McConnell s 2014 re-election bid. Cruz had accused McConnell of lying to him about the way forward for the revival of the Export-Import Bank in the Senate.Like Cruz, Paul opposes the CR advanced by McConnell to avoid a shutdown later in the week. But Paul has focused his criticism on the use of the stopgap spending vehicles. Paul would have rather seen more pressure put on Democrats to advance the dozen individual appropriation bills. I would defund not only Planned Parenthood but hundreds and hundreds of regulations, hundreds and hundreds of wasteful programs. I would take them all out, put them on the table and say  You know what Democrats, it doesn t take 60 votes to defund something, it s actually going to take 60 votes to fund any of these programs,  vote on them one at a time and we will see how many of these crazy programs get 60 votes. My guess would be very few, but that would take the courage to let the spending expire and start anew and let new programs all require 60 votes to pass,  Paul said.McConnell signaled Tuesday he intends to call additional votes on the regular fiscal 2016 spending bills, though there was no evidence Democrats accede to that proposal without a big budget agreement between the two parties. Via: Roll CallIf you want to see why Ted Cruz isn t the most popular guy in Washington DC, watch this video that was taken only two days ago on the Senate floor.

We know he regularly insults women and Muslims and Latinos and immigrants and African-Americans. Earlier in the week, he insulted veterans. He s mocked the disabled, and his latest tactless comment was directed toward literally on their death beds.In a rally in Nevada on Wednesday, Trump begged those who were dying to vote for him. Yes, those who were dying.I don t care how sick you are. I don t care if you just came back from the doctor and he gave you the worst possible prognosis, meaning it s over. You won t be around in two weeks. Doesn t matter. Hang out till November 8. Get out and vote. Then, Trump said he was kidding\\u002fnot kidding.Mr Trump added:  I say kiddingly, but I mean it. He also reassured dying people that after they are gone,  All we re going to say is:  We love you and we will remember you always .Here s the video:People are not happy:One terminally ill person did respond, and it wasn t to support Trump:This one pretty much gets to the heart of it (or the lack of heart of Trump):As deeply offensive as this is, especially for anyone who either is sick or those who take care of the sick, there is a bit of refreshing honesty in Trump s joke\\u002fnot joke.  I don t care  is perhaps the most truthful line he s uttered during his campaign full of lies. He genuinely doesn t care if people are sick. He doesn t care if people are suffering. He doesn t care if people are poor. He doesn t care about people at all.Donald Trump has a compulsive need for constant validation. He received fawning validation on the Apprentice. Now, he s taken his show to the American public and he expects the same from us.

What greater ego validation is there?Featured image via Ethan Miller\\u002fGetty Images.\"],[\"Just in case anybody s wondering just how dangerous Trump s love of Putin is, here s a little reminder: When Putin was running for election in 2011, he hosted a big, lavish banquet where he spoke to a variety of leaders on a variety of topics. When he addressed the Americans there, he said that the only reason the U.S. was interested in a relationship with Moscow was because Russia could destroy the U.S.  in a half hour or less. That s according to two authors of The Russia-China Axis, who concluded from Putin s thinly-veiled threat: It would be difficult to find a statement more revealing about Putin s true position regarding the United States. This is a man that Donald Trump repeatedly praises as a strong leader, and over whom he fawns because Putin likes him. Putin and Trump are two of a kind in terms of demagoguery, but it s never been a secret that Putin isn t a fan of the U.S. It seems the only way he ll become a fan of us is if Trump is elected.Why?He likely believes he can pull Trump s puppet strings. Trump might think that Putin is just a good negotiator, but he fails miserably at understanding the naked fact that Putin sees us as his number one enemy.If Putin is actively working to undermine our democratic process (and there is credible evidence suggesting exactly that), then a President Trump is very likely to just hand us over, knowingly or unknowingly, to a hostile leader who believes he can destroy us on a whim.Russia has a squillion nuclear weapons   that s never been a secret. We have roughly 4,100 of the damn things that aren t awaiting dismantlement while Russia has roughly 2,700 in that state. In total, we have 7,100 while Russia has 7,300. However, Russia has managed to negotiate cuts in our arsenal while they work to strengthen theirs. Some reports say that their military exercises center around nuclear strikes now.In other words, their nuclear arsenal might be a bigger threat than ours, and they are more prepared for a nuclear war than we are. Compare all of that to North Korea s eight and Iran s nonexistent nuclear arsenal, and one has to wonder why our leaders seem to focus all our energy on those two countries when Russia is currently led by a man who said he could destroy us in a half hour, and we have a presidential candidate who is in love with that man.This is so frightening to many in the GOP that some feel they re in the awkward position of having to rationalize Trump s love affair with Vladimir Putin while quietly quaking in their boots. But others aren t fooled, like Lindsey Graham: Other than destroying every instrument of democracy in his own country, having opposition people killed, dismembering neighbors through military force and being the benefactor of the butcher of Damascus, he s a good guy. And the ghostwriter of Trump s best-selling Art of the Deal, Tony Schwartz: To undecided voters: Trump wants to be Putin, a despot & dictator. The world may not recover. Save your children and grandchildren. Yeah. Putin s a great guy. So s Trump. Two peas in a pod.

To address his ousted national security adviser Michael Flynn s scandal, Trump said that the former aide was subjected to  criminal  leaks in the  fake media. I think he s been treated very, very unfairly by the media   as I call it, the fake media, in many cases,  Trump said at a joint press conference Wednesday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.  I think it s really a sad thing he was treated so badly. Trump needs to get his story right with his team.

Those conversations took place the day that then-President Obama imposed sanctions on Russia for its interference in the election.

The ghosts of Hillary s defeat continue to haunt the halls of Washington and media headlines, as party operatives and their media surrogates conjure up old plots, as well as new and innovative ways to change the election results.Since Hillary Clinton s devastating defeat at the hands of underdog Republican nominee, and now President-Elect, Donald Trump, both the Clinton campaign and the Democratic Party leadership have been desperately trying to claw-back the election result, or at least damage and delegitimize the incoming Trump Administration. After blaming FBI Director James Comey for Clinton s loss, party operatives, in conjunction with George Soros-backed MoveOn.org, then went on to organize street protests which turned into riots, before backing Green Party leader Jill Stein in her frantic attempt to stage a voter recount in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania   all designed to somehow reverse, or discredit Trump s historic presidential win.The only problem with this leg of the Establishment s subscribed conspiracy theory   is that it is based on a lie. Media hype aside   there is no actual evidence, beyond speculation that Russia hacked US Elections, or even hacked Clinton chief of staff John Podesta s emails posted on Wikileaks. That lie is evident right there plain sight, as Democratic Party leaders falsely state that the CIA has concluded the  Russians  hacked or interfered in the US Presidential election. The CIA never concluded anything, they simply said  the Russians probably did it.  Regardless, here s what Democrats are putting out as their lead talking point: We now know that the CIA has determined Russia s interference in our elections was for the purpose of electing Donald Trump. This should distress every American.  (see full letter below).Despite the lack of any actual proof, the same Clinton media operatives that skewed campaign coverage, polling in their candidate s favor, and who also fabricated Trump scandals throughout the election   are now running a hysterical PR campaign  are pushing the Russian hacking conspiracy theory  with absolutely no proof to substantiate their incredible claims.Desperate to rescue his collapsed reputation, John Podesta, along with Democrat minority leader Nancy Pelosi (image, left) are now lobbying the CIA to release  evidence  it doesn t actually have   and give it to state delegate voters in the US Electoral College before they cast their official Presidential votes on December 19th.It seems as if disgraced party operative Podesta might just be digging a deeper hole for himself and his party The HillMore Democratic electors are joining the call for an intelligence briefing on Russian interference in the presidential election before they cast their votes for president on Monday.Twenty-nine electors now are pressuring Director of National Intelligence James Clapper to disclose more information about the CIA s conclusion that Russian interference helped sway the election in President-elect Donald Trump s favor.On Monday, 10 electors   spearheaded by Christine Pelosi, the daughter of House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi (Calif.)   wrote an open letter to Clapper, demanding more information ahead of next week s vote. The Electors require to know from the intelligence community whether there are ongoing investigations into ties between Donald Trump, his campaign or associates, and Russian government interference in the election, the scope of those investigations, how far those investigations may have reached, and who was involved in those investigations,  the letter reads.  We further require a briefing on all investigative findings, as these matters directly impact the core factors in our deliberations of whether Mr. Trump is fit to serve as President of the United States. Twenty-eight Democrats and one Republican have now signed the letter.On Monday, the Clinton campaign voiced support for the effort. Each day that month, our campaign decried the interference of Russia in our campaign and its evident goal of hurting our campaign to aid Donald Trump,  said John Podesta, Hillary Clinton s campaign chairman, in a statement.  Despite our protestations, this matter did not receive the attention it deserved by the media in the campaign. We now know that the CIA has determined Russia s interference in our elections was for the purpose of electing Donald Trump. This should distress every American.

The media has created the perception that the voters choose the nomination. That s the conflict here,  Curly Haugland, an unbound GOP delegate from North Dakota, told CNBC s  Squawk Box  on Wednesday. He even questioned why primaries and caucuses are held.Haugland is one of 112 Republican delegates who are not required to cast their support for any one candidate because their states and territories don t hold primaries or caucuses.Even with Trump s huge projected delegate haul in four state primaries Tuesday, the odds are increasing the billionaire businessman may not ultimately get the 1,237 delegates needed to claim the GOP nomination before the convention.This could lead to a brokered convention, in which unbound delegates, like Haugland, could play a significant swing role on the first ballot to choose a nominee.Most delegates bound by their state s primary or caucus results are only committed on the first ballot. If subsequent ballots are needed, virtually all of the delegates can vote any way they want, said Gary Emineth, another unbound delegate from North Dakota. It could introduce Paul Ryan, Mitt Romney, or it could be the other candidates that have already been in the race and are now out of the race [such as] Mike Huckabee [or] Rick Santorum. All those people could eventually become candidates on the floor,  Emineth said.Read more: CNBC\"],[\"You know things are getting bad on the campaign trail when you have to appeal to the child in everyone by offering French fries for everyone.

This is the stuff you have to do when you don t really have any accomplishments to speak of besides shutting down the government and pissing people off.In a lame attempt at throwing First Lady Michelle Obama under the bus, Ted Cruz decided healthy food is for suckers, we need to bring back all the stuff that makes our kids fat and lazy, so Cruz says: Let me say something to the school-aged kids here.

After Sessions announced that the Justice Department would be doubling down on leakers, Trump tweeted this: After many years of LEAKS going on in Washington, it is great to see the A.G. taking action! For National Security, the tougher the better! That s right   Trump is seriously acting like he hasn t been attacking Sessions for weeks because the A.G. decided to recuse himself from Trump s Russia investigation. Most notably, Trump stated that if he d known Sessions was going to recuse himself, he wouldn t have hired him as Attorney General in the first place. Things were getting so heated that there were even rumors that Trump might fire Sessions. Now, Trump is trying to kiss up to Sessions in a pathetic attempt to get the A.G. on his side.Trump is not a man of integrity. He will literally do anything to get ahead and advance himself   he won t even stand by his own word. We ve seen this time and time again as Trump walks back his previous comments, proving that he is extremely unstable and nothing he says can be trusted. He will lie about anything to get people on his side or protect himself from having to answer to his faults. It is up to Americans not to forget Trump s prior transgressions, and hold him accountable whenever he tries to disguise himself as a somewhat decent human being. Hopefully, Sessions doesn t forget what Trump did to him either, because Trump is one person who doesn t deserve to brown-nose his way out of this.Featured image via Tom Pennington and Win McNamee \\u002f Getty Images\"],[\"On Sunday, Meet the Press host Chuck Todd revealed more specifics that help make the case that Donald Trump is raking in big money from his campaign   or at least his businesses are.During the segment, Todd explains that since much of Trump s lavish campaign spending is being spent buying products his and his family s businesses make, or at properties they own, Trump s found a legal way to funnel campaign contributions back into his private business. Rachael Maddow first made the case that Trump s campaign was a money making scheme earlier this week. Now, Todd is making a very similar case, while providing even more examples of Trump s campaign spending. Todd explained: We ll start with Eric Trump s businesses. The Trump campaign paid nearly $5,000 to Eric Trump Wine Manufacturing. It spent over $91,000 to rent out three different Trump golf clubs in Florida for events. $136,000 to Trump restaurants including Trump Grill and Trump Cafe in Trump Tower. Over $420,000 to rent Trump s Mar-a-Lago club in Florida. That also doubles as his vacation home.There s been more than $430,000 of Trump campaign money spent on rent at the Trump Tower. Of course, it s his Fifth Avenue skyscraper that does double as Trump s campaign headquarters.And the biggest expense of all has been $4.6 million the campaign has paid to Tag Air, which is the name of Trump s private airline.All told, the campaign has spent over $6 million at Trump-owned businesses out of about $63 million spent through the end of May.So 10 percent of all campaign spending has gone back to Trump or Trump affiliated businesses. Again, none of what Trump is doing is illegal. Todd also points out that while the world was reacting to Brexit, Trump flew to Scotland to promote his new golf course there   hardly offering more than a few idiotic sentiments on one of the biggest political shocks of the 21st century. That s not something a true presidential candidate would do. Combined with his campaign s lack of direction and well, a complete lack of campaigning the past month, evidence is quickly piling up that Trump s campaign has never been about anything other than publicity, while making him and his family a ton of money at the same time.You can watch the segment below.Featured image from video screenshot\"],[\"What the heck! Senator John McCain just admitted that he doesn t answer to President Trump! Can you imagine if a Senator had done this to Obama? McCain s OpEd in The Washington Post is a horrible hit on Trump. Shame on him!It starts out with a statement about how horrible the white supremacists are and then goes on to discuss Congress getting back to order. It s a snoozer of an OpEd until you get to the last part In a shocking slam on President Trump s character and knowledge of government, McCain shows his bitterness towards Trump. He claims that,  We don t answer to him   but also say that,  We must respect his authority WTH!MCCAIN: IT S TIME CONGRESS RETURNS TO REGULAR ORDER: We can fight like hell for our ideas to prevail. But we have to respect each other or at least respect the fact that we need each other.That has never been truer than today, when Congress must govern with a president who has no experience of public office, is often poorly informed and can be impulsive in his speech and conduct.We must respect his authority and constitutional responsibilities. We must, where we can, cooperate with him. But we are not his subordinates. We don t answer to him. We answer to the American people. We must be diligent in discharging our responsibility to serve as a check on his power. And we should value our identity as members of Congress more than our partisan affiliation.I argued during the health-care debate for a return to regular order, letting committees of jurisdiction do the principal work of crafting legislation and letting the full Senate debate and amend their efforts.We won t settle all our differences that way, but such an approach is more likely to make progress on the central problems confronting our constituents. We might not like the compromises regular order requires, but we can and must live with them if we are to find real and lasting solutions. And all of us in Congress have the duty, in this sharply polarized atmosphere, to defend the necessity of compromise before the American public.SEE WHAT HE DID THERE? He basically said our president is clueless and impulsive so we don t need to listen to him. Unreal! Is McCain bitter and trying to get back at Trump?

The problem is the behavior of some evangelical leaders,  Moore wrote. I have watched as some of these who gave stem-winding speeches about  character  in office during the Clinton administration now minimize the spewing of profanities in campaign speeches, race-baiting and courting white supremacists, boasting of adulterous affairs, debauching public morality and justice through the casino and pornography industries. Moore wasn t finished though. He also slammed evangelicals, a term he is too embarrassed to use to describe himself any longer, because they are flocking to candidates who pretend to be Christians. I watched one evangelical leader pronounce a candidate a Christian, though he explicitly states that he has never repented of sin, because he displays the fruit of the Spirit in job creation. That s not a political problem; it s a gospel problem.Why are many evangelical leaders, including some who pontificate on nearly everything else, scared silent as evangelicalism is associated with everything from authoritarianism and bigotry to violations of religious freedom? How can they look the other way in silence when politicians praise Planned Parenthood and demur about white supremacists and neo-Nazis? And then he admitted that liberals have been right about evangelicals for years and they have been vindicated by evangelicals who have flocked to Trump s campaign. For years, secular progressives have said that evangelical social action in America is not about religious conviction but all about power. They have implied that the goal of the Religious Right is to cynically use the  moral  to get to the  majority,  not the other way around.This year, a group of high-profile old-guard evangelicals has proven these critics right. Indeed, evangelical Christians have only sought power and they ve had no problem rewriting or flat-out ignoring parts of the Bible that do not fit with their agenda in order to achieve it.It s been all about money and power, and evangelical leaders have fleeced their congregations so they can keep trying to topple the government and establish religious tyranny. But evangelicals have grown more and more desperate over the years as Americans continually reject them and their radical agenda that would confine women to the home and sentence gay people to death as well as declare America a Christian state governed by the Bible instead of the constitutional principles we hold dear.And Donald Trump may not be an evangelical Christian, but evangelicals are increasingly supporting his campaign because he is saying exactly what they want to hear and they see him as their last chance to take power. It s never been about the gospel or morality to evangelicals. It has always been about gaining power and using it to persecute and indoctrinate those they disagree with. And by supporting Trump, evangelicals are telling the world that they are precisely the fake Christians that liberals have been fighting against for decades.Featured image via screen capture\"],[\"The ultimate guide to who really is the worst candidate in this election.On a night when the Chicago Cubs won their first World Series title since 1908, Seth Meyers  Closer Look segment went largely unnoticed at a time when millions of Americans are trying to make their final decision on who they will vote for on November 8th.For months, these undecided voters have written off the contest as one between two equally awful candidates. They say it doesn t matter who wins because both are the same.But as Meyers hilariously pointed out on Wednesday night, Hillary Clinton is not nearly as bad as Donald Trump. It s not even close. I mean, do you pick someone who s under federal investigation for using a private email server? Or do you pick someone who called Mexicans  rapists,  claimed the president was born in Kenya, proposed banning an entire religion from entering the U.S., mocked a disabled reporter, said John McCain wasn t a war hero because he was captured, attacked the parents of a fallen soldier, bragged about committing sexual assault, was accused by 12 women of committing sexual assault, said some of those women weren t attractive enough for him to sexually assault, said more countries should get nukes, said he would force the military to commit war crimes, said a judge was  biased  because his parents were Mexicans, said women should be  punished  for having abortions, incited violence at his rallies, called global warming  a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese,  called for his opponent to be jailed, declared bankruptcy six times, bragged about not paying income taxes, stiffed his contractors and employees, lost a billion dollars in one year, scammed customers at his fake university, bought a six-foot-tall painting of himself with money from his fake foundation, has a trial for fraud coming up in November, insulted an opponent s looks, insulted an opponent s wife s looks, and bragged about grabbing women  by the pussy.

BAMN is perhaps best known, however, for a 2016 incident in which they showed up to a rally held by the white-nationalist Traditionalist Workers Party outside the California state capitol building in Sacramento. The militant group was confrontational with the white-nationalists within minutes of arrival, and ten people were stabbed and hospitalized in a bloody fight. Police have verified through videos taken by members of the group, news organizations, and bystanders, that BAMN initiated the violence. Falarco was caught on camera at the event repeatedly punching a man in the stomach and throwing him to the ground.Arreguin, a far-left liberal, made headlines in February for his tweets prior to BAMN organizing a riot to prevent right-wing political commentator Milo Yiannopoulos from speaking at the city s University of California campus. Using speech to silence marginalized communities and promote bigotry is unacceptable. Hate speech isn t welcome in our community,  Arreguin had tweeted.The mayor also referred to Yiannopoulos as a  white supremacist,  and was forced to issue an  apology. I consider much of what Mr. Yiannopoulos says to be hateful. But I regret and apologize for the white national label,  Arreguin tweeted.Hours after his tweet, supporters of President Donald Trump who hoped to listen to Yiannopoulos speak were under a violent attack. People were assaulted with pipes, a generator-powered spotlight was firebombed, and looters destroyed several businesses in the area including a Starbucks.The rioters smashed windows, spray painted violent messages all over the area   including  Kill Trump    and began committing arsons. It was estimated that the rioters caused $100,000 in damage to the MLK Student Union, and $400,000 to $500,000 in damage to the area surrounding the university.It was immediately alleged that the mayor had ordered the police to stand down and allow the violence and destruction.Arreguin denied the accusations, saying that the police strategy was ordered by the department, not him.

While that s pretty scary, there s something that might be even creepier: if one of Trump s minions wants to volunteer for Trump s campaign phone bank, they re required to sign a six-page binding contract that says they will never insult Trump (or his family members, businesses or campaign) for the rest of their lives! Should they use their constitutional rights to speak poorly against him, Trump will sue.Given how sensitive Trump is to insults nowadays (remember the fuss he made when former rival Marco Rubio insulted his hands?), it s not really shocking that Trump would make volunteers sign a loyalty oath. That, and the fact that Trump is absolutely egotistical and power-hungry.Last week, NBC reported that Trump was actually forcing campaign volunteers to sign contracts before they could begin helping him get elected after a strange email came to light. NBC said: In a Thursday email inviting supporters for phone-banking at Trump Tower, the campaign tells supporters to attend a briefing and then sign your NDA before volunteering begins. Here s a screenshot of that email:Via NBCA few days ago, The Daily Dot was able to obtain one of these free speech violating contracts. And yes, the contents are just as ludicrous as they sound: Promise and agree not to demean or disparage publicly the Company, Mr. Trump, any Trump Company, any Family Member, or any Family Member Company or any asset any of the foregoing own, or product or service any of the foregoing offer, in each case by or in any of the Restricted Means and Contexts and to prevent your employees from doing so. Part of Trump s contract, via Daily DotAlso in the contract are guidelines that volunteers are basically legally bound to Trump   they re prohibited to volunteer for any other presidential candidate, should they suddenly become sane and change their minds. There s no end date to these contracts, so Trump is pretty much making these people sign their lives away to him. Talk about making a deal with the devil The Daily Dot dug deeper and asked Davida Perry, an employment lawyer in New York City, if these contracts would actually be respected in court. Perry said that they wouldn t, and added: I guess [Trump] doesn t know about the First Amendment. This is really shocking. He s apparently so afraid that people would say something bad about him after spending some time on his campaign that they have to sign some sort of agreement. I don t see how this stands up. I don t see how a court enforces this. Well, Trump actually knows tons about free speech, but only acknowledges those rights when it will benefit him.

Clinton made the remarks while speaking to at a November 2015 closed-door fundraiser for Hillary Clinton in Canton, Ohio.Echoing a theme of Republican nominee Donald Trump s campaign, the former president expressed his concern that white, working-class Americans have been left behind over the last eight years.Clinton expressed his frustration with the most recent (at that time) Democratic debate, which he said lacked a single mention of the fact that  84 percent of the American people, after inflation, had not had a raise of 1 cent since the financial crash. We have incredible debates all over America that shouldn t exist between people in different racial groups because they don t trust law enforcement anymore,  he continued.  And in the middle of all this we learned, breathtakingly, that middle-aged, non-college-educated white Americans  life expectancy is going down and is now lower than Hispanics, even though they make less money. And the gap between African Americans and whites is closing, but unfortunately not because the death rate among African Americans is dropping but because the death rate among white Americans is rising.  Clinton continued.  Why? Because they don t have anything to look forward to when they get up in the morning. Because their lives are sort of stuck in neutral.

This tragedy happened on Donald Trump s home turf, if his campaign was on top of their game, they d be all over this Ahead of the Pennsylvania primary Bernie Sanders was asked about Philadelphia s proposed soda tax during a recent interview with  Meet The Press . Hillary Clinton favors the tax but Bernie opposes it because he says it taxes the poor who are already struggling enough. Chuck Todd didn t buy that answer and pressed Sanders to explain why he opposes the soda tax but favors cigarette taxes (which are much, much higher). Bernie explained that he thinks  cigarettes are different than soda  and that  there s almost a question as to why [cigarettes]remain a legal product in this country . Apparently, Bernie Sanders doesn t realize that the cigarette taxes he favors are what got Eric Garner killed.Unfortunately, Chuck Todd didn t catch that statement and moved on to other topics. He should have jumped on it given that it s quite the hypocritical line coming from someone trying to gain the support of the Black Lives Matter movement. Bernie Sanders even has the support of Eric Garner s own daughter who starred in a three minute campaign ad just a couple months previous.One wonders whether or not Erica Garner approves of Bernie Sanders  support of the cigarette taxes that killed her father.Recall that Eric Garner was accused of selling un-taxed cigarettes in New York City. The Federal government already imposes a $1.01 tax, which the New York state government adds a $4.35 tax to, and the New York City government tacked another $1.50 onto. That brings the total cigarette tax in New York City to more than $6.85 cents which is more than the cost of the cigarettes themselves. These excessively high taxes that Bernie Sanders supports double the price of pack of cigarettes and creates a black market for un-taxed cigarettes.It was this black market that Eric Garner was accused of taking part in. Un-taxed cigarettes are a lucrative business in New York City and account for tens of millions of dollars in sales. Many people try to make a living selling these un-taxed cigarettes as Eric Garner was allegedly doing when he was stopped by the police.Situations like this are the inevitable result of high taxes. If people refuse to pay taxes this is how they will be enforced. People with guns will show up. People will die.Via: A Libertarian Future \"],[\"21st Century Wire says In 1983, US President Ronald Reagan launched the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), a space-based anti-missile system which came to be known as  Star Wars.  At the time, SDI was meant to give the US a nuclear first-strike against advantage against its geopolitical rival the Soviet Union by using various weaponized technologies including lasers, to intercept Soviet ICBM missiles in space. In the end, the program proved to be too costly, too complicated for a practical role out, and ineffective against non-space faring weapons like cruise missiles, submarine based missile batteries and long range bombers.  Now in 2017, as the Cold War is being re-heated again, the West is potentially looking at the complete militarization of outer space. This time the US nemesis is both Russia and China. But what really driving this new  space race  agenda?Consortium News Exclusive: As a backdrop to the Russia-gate hysteria and the heightened fear of China is a budget war over how much U.S. taxpayer money to pour into space warfare, explains Jonathan Marshall By Jonathan MarshallThere s a civil war being fought on our nation s soil, right in our capital. It pits the Secretary of Defense and senior generals against a bipartisan band of militant legislators who accuse the Pentagon of standing pat while Russian and China work to achieve military superiority over the United States in space.No doubt these bureaucratic warriors will eventually call a truce. But in the meantime, the American people will almost certainly become less secure and more indebted (in budget terms) as a result of both sides  macho posturing for new warfighting capabilities in space (differing mostly on how far and how fast to go).Eager congressional advocates of space warfare have attached an amendment to the House defense authorization bill requiring the Pentagon to create a new U.S. Space Corps to join the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines and Coast Guard by 2019. Currently, the Air Force oversees most space warfare projects.The amendment has sent senior Pentagon leadership into a tizzy. Secretary of Defense James Mattis  strongly  urged Congress to rescind the requirement, stating in a letter that  it is premature to add additional organization and administrative tail to the department at a time I am trying to reduce overhead. Similarly, Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson protested that the proposal will simply  add more boxes to the organization chart.  Meanwhile, Gen. John W. Raymond, commander of Air Force Space Command, insisted that his service has space matters well in hand. (He should be happy   the Pentagon recently raised his position to a 4-star rank.)Upping the AnteIn response, Rep. Mike Rogers, an Alabama Republican and chairman of the Strategic Forces subcommittee, announced that he was  pissed  and  outraged  at the Air Force for fighting the new Space Command, saying its obstructionism would  set back efforts to respond to adversaries and space threats  and allow Russia and China  to surpass us soon. The Air Force leadership would have us trust them: I don t think so,  Rogers sneered, as if speaking about the Russians.  They just need a few more years to rearrange the deck chairs: I don t think so. This is the same Air Force that got us into the situation where the Russians and the Chinese are near-peers to us in space.  He vowed,  We will not allow the status quo to continue. Behind all the fiery argumentation lies a bipartisan consensus that the United States must sharply increase its spending on the militarization of space to maintain global supremacy. Gen. Raymond applauded Congress for recognizing the  national imperative  of his mission to  normalize, elevate, and integrate space as a war-fighting domain. Secretary Wilson published an op-ed column last month on her new initiatives to  develop space airmen who have the tools, training, and resources to fight when   not if   war extends into space.  She fully expects Congress to follow through on her request for a 20 percent increase in Air Force space funding. (Total military spending on space, including non-Air Force programs like the National Reconnaissance Office, came to about $22 billion last year.)What s driving all this activity   aside from baser motives of bureaucratic advantage and financial gain  are  intelligence assessments  that  China and Russia have aggressive programs to both demonstrate and produce eventual operational capability to . . . attack our space assets across the spectrum,  in the words of David Hardy, acting deputy undersecretary of the Air Force for Space. While we re not at war in space, I don t think we can say we re exactly at peace, either, said Navy Vice Adm. Charles A. Richard, deputy commander of U.S. Strategic Command, in March. Gen. John Hyten, head of the Pentagon s Strategic Command, recently declared that the United States needs not only a good defense, but  an offensive capability to challenge  space threats from Russia and China.The High Stakes in SpaceThe stakes are potentially huge because the United States uses space for all manner of command, control, and intelligence missions, not to mention civilian applications. Orbiting satellites provide near-real-time images of conflict zones, sense missile launches and nuclear tests, provide precise positioning coordinates to guide weapons systems, and route secure communications to remote regions of the globe Continue this story at Consortium NewsREAD MORE SPACE NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Space FilesSUPPORT 21WIRE  SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV\"],[\"While science doesn t quite have the technology to give Donald Trump the ability to read our minds, his justice department is doing the next worst thing.

It s clearly an attempt to gather evidence against Trump s opposition, even if that opposition is just regular citizens.It s not the first time they have tried going after protesters through internet history. 200 people were arrested during the January 20th protests and prosecutors have tried to go through Facebook to get information about those people Federal prosecutors have sought a range of electronic information related to the Jan. 20 arrests, including defendants  social media accounts. In a mostly sealed case that the Electronic Frontier Foundation and other digital rights groups believe is related to the Jan. 20 arrests, Facebook is fighting an order blocking the company from alerting users about search warrants for account information. That case is before the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, the city s highest local court.This is all a disgusting violation of privacy. Visiting a legal website is evidence of nothing, yet it s clear that Trump is gathering a list of people who disagree with him. What he will do with that list is still a mystery, but remember, it wouldn t surprise me if people on that list started seeing letters from the IRS or one of our law enforcement agencies.At the very least, this as an attempt to control dissent and perhaps make people afraid to organize online, which is by far the most effective way to organize. Just like his attempt to gather voter data from states is an attempt at making people afraid to register to vote.Featured image via Pool\\u002fGetty Images.\"],[\"Is it possible the French have lost their appetite for our pro-open borders Hollywood liberals misrepresenting the truth about the inundation of Muslim men into their towns and communities? CANNES   Another day, another dud. In its early days, the 69th Cannes Film Festival was one of pleasant surprises, including a three-hour German-language art-house comedy, Toni Erdmann, that had critics applauding during as well as after the film. Then there was Paterson, a Jim Jarmusch creation starring Adam Driver as a bus driver who writes poetry. The well-received film plays out like something of a poem itself. And even if it doesn t win any official prizes, it has already captured the  Palme Dog  for best canine performance, by a bulldog named Nellie.But many of cinema s big names have proven less reliable. Woody Allen s Caf  Society and Stephen Spielberg s The BFG, both opening out of competition, were solid but hardly the directors  best work. A Thursday night screening of The Neon Demon, written and directed by Nicolas Winding Refn and starring Elle Fanning, drew jeers for its lurid, over-the-top stew of vampirism, cannibalism and a touch of necrophilia.That was followed the next morning by The Last Face, Sean Penn s fifth film as a director and his first since 2007 s Into the Wild. It s a story of refugee crises and humanitarian aid (subjects with which the activist Penn is intimately familiar) but also, as an opening text explains with a thud:  about the love (pause)   between a man (pause)   and a woman.  You could hear the groans from the crowd.Charlize Theron and Javier Bardem lead an international cast that includes Britain s Jared Harris and French star Jean Reno. They are aid workers whose tumultuous love affair plays out over a decade and many explosions   and, lest we doubt their passion, through a variety of slow-motion scenes, soft-focus lenses and choral music.Penn had little to say about the negative reaction to The Last Face.  I ve finished the film so it s not a discussion that I feel I can be of any value to,  he said.  I stand behind the film as it is, and everybody is going to be well entitled to their response.

According to  White House press secretary Sean Spicer, though, the threat wasn t really a threat.  That s not a threat,  Spicer said during the crazy-time press briefing.  He simply stated a fact. The tweet speaks for itself.  Well, former CIA official Philip Mudd somewhat agrees with Spicer. He said he s  breathing a sigh of relief  after Trump s Twitter storm because it can t be taken seriously. Mudd said that Trump cannot intimidate the FBI. You feel like you have to give the President of the United States a pacifier and a rattle and put him in the crib,  he told CNN s Kate Bolduan.Mudd called Trump s tweets  a joke. Believe me, I know this is going to sound facetious but I m breathing a sigh of relief. You can t take this seriously,  Mudd said.  You could have taken this seriously from President Bush or President Obama, from President Bush s father, from President Clinton. You can t take this seriously. Mudd was referring to Trump s tweet this morning.  James Comey better hope that there are no  tapes  of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!  he wrote.For someone who called Trump s tweets a  joke,  Mudd certainly wasn t laughing. In fact, he seems pissed off at Trump s attempt to threaten the former FBI Director. You re threatening the FBI, who s in the midst of an investigation of presidential aides? The FBI s been around since 1908. The President of the United States has been around for three and a half months,  Mudd said. If you think you re going to intimidate the former FBI director and the dozens of people in the workforce who are conducting this investigation with the Department of Justice, you ve got another thing coming,  he added. Don t worry about it,  Mudd said while addressing anyone who is concerned about Trump s recent behavior.  Nobody in the investigation would take this seriously.

I do believe that there is a left-leaning bias in news and most of news,  Kelly somehow managed to blurt out without her nose growing like Pinocchio s. You don t believe there is a right-wing bias at Fox, a conservative bias at Fox?  Rose asked even though Kelly s answer was predictable even before he uttered the question. No, I don t. I think that Fox News is fair and balanced. And I think the conservatives who are on air here make no bones about their ideology. Again, Kelly s nose remained the same even though Fox News does, indeed, have a clear right-wing bias and is the propaganda machine of the Republican Party and the evidence of that has piled up over the years.Here s the video via YouTube.In November 2014, Fox News did more than just report that Republicans had taken over the Senate, they openly celebrated about it.In April 2014, Fox head honcho and Kelly s boss Rupert Murdoch actually bragged that his network saved the Republican Party. A Gallup poll even confirms that an overwhelming 94 percent of Fox viewers lean or identify as Republicans.Additionally, even one of the most conservative senators in Congress has repeatedly pointed out that Fox is  totally not fair and totally not balanced. Oklahoma Senator Tom Coburn urged his constituents to stop believing everything they hear on Fox because  There are certain shows on Fox I can t watch because they re totally not fair and totally not balanced. Coburn said the same thing to constituents four years earlier in 2010 after Fox News tried to scare people by demonizing the Affordable Care Act and painting Nancy Pelosi as a bad person. The intention is not to put anybody in jail,  Coburn said of the Fox claim that people would go to jail for not purchasing health insurance.  That makes for good TV news on Fox, but that isn t the intention. What we have to have is make sure we have a debate in this country so that you can see what s going on and make the determination yourself,  Coburn continued before blasting Fox for besmirching Pelosi s character.  So, don t catch yourself being biased by Fox News that somebody s no good. Late last year, a Fox News HOST actually had the gall to claim that  everyone benefited  from locking up more black people in a racist statement that drew outrage.Fox News has even told blatant lies on the air about Muslims that they had to publicly apologize for telling.Next up, take a look at just one broadcast of Sean Hannity s show on Fox as an example of his own work to make the network a pit of right-wing bias even as he claims to be  fair and balanced  in the same breath. As one of my colleagues wrote,During a two-minute opening to the segment in which he makes his ludicrous claim, Hannity used the following words and phrases to describe President Obama: liberal, left wing, all out assault on the 2nd Amendment and the rights of law abiding Americans, trampling on your rights, What s his next target? The First Amendment, The Anointed One, failed on the economy, failed to create jobs, failed to reign in radical extremism abroad.Here s the video via Media Matters.Last time I checked, President Obama has not taken anyone s gun away, the economy is stronger than it was eight years ago, and jobs are being created at a record pace. Yet, Fox employees like Hannity still repeat the same accusations over and over again.And finally, let s take a look at Bill O Reilly, who got his ass handed to him by a group of high school students early last year for his lack of journalistic ethics. In their final report after watching a segment of the host s show, the students found that Fox  News  is not  practicing journalism  as much as they are  practicing rank propaganda. In short, Fox News has never been  fair and balanced  and if Megyn Kelly wanted to be known as a credible journalist she should have had the courage to admit it rather than try to sell us another lie like Fox hosts do on a daily basis.Featured image via Myside s Spew\"],[\"New York is critical for both Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders but only one of them seems poised for a big win. The other is predicted to suffer a serious setback in one of the few remaining states with a large delegate count.As of Sunday, the polling shows Donald Trump crushing Ted Cruz and John Kasich with 52 percent of the vote while Hillary Clinton Leads Bernie Sanders with 57.2 percent of the vote. If these numbers hold up, that will give Clinton an additional 39 delegates over Sanders, expanding her lead from 206 to 245.It s important to make note of this in advance because the last several races that Clinton has won have been met with howls of  election fraud.  Aside from the sour grapes aspect, this constant drumbeat of alleged  cheating  is a shallow attempt to delegitimize Clinton as a candidate. Republicans have been doing it to President Obama for years and it should be condemned as the shameful tactic it is.Regardless, there are a few obvious reasons that Hillary is poised for an easy win. First, New York is a primary state, not a caucus state. While Hillary has under-preformed in caucuses, on average, she s seriously over-preformed in primaries. In essence, the more people that vote, the better Hillary does. A hard fact to swallow but a fact nonetheless.Second, New York is a closed primary, meaning only registered Democrats can vote. This has been a source of outrage among Independents who have demanded the  right  to vote for the Democratic nominee. This, of course, begs the question of why people who chose not to join the party should have the  right  to dictate who that party selects as the nominee. If you think the answer is  democracy,  allow me to point out that caucuses exclude people that cannot spend 2-3 hours on a weeknight voting for a candidate. In terms of participation, millions vote in primaries while only thousands vote in caucuses.Glass houses and all that.Third, and most importantly, New York is a demographically diverse state that closely resembles the racial makeup of the Democratic Party as a whole. In states where Democratic voters are overwhelmingly white, Sanders has a strong  advantage. Everywhere else? Not so much. Here s an interesting data set for you to digest: In November, it s expected that about 54 percent of Democratic voters will be white, 24 percent will be black, 11 percent will be Latino and 7 percent will be Asian\\u002feverything else.In the Southern states where the majority of Democratic voters are black, Clinton crushed Sanders. Conversely, in states where the overwhelming majority of Democratic voters are white, Sanders crushed Clinton. Neither of these group of states is particularly representative of the Democratic Party so neither is a good predictor for more evenly mixed states.But, when you look at the 20 states most closely aligned with the demographic makeup of the party, you find an abundance of good news for Clinton: Of the 12 states that have voted, Hillary lost one by a hair, won two by a tiny margin, tied in another and utterly dominated the rest   5 of them by 29 points or more.Take a look:Even better for Clinton, all of the remaining states with large delegate counts are part of those 20. New York, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and California represent 1,132 of the reaming 1,647 delegates. In order to close the significantly large delegate gap, Bernie can t just win those states, he has to win them big. But they re all closed primaries except for California. And even then, of the 18 open primaries\\u002fcaucuses held so far, Hillary s won 11 of them so California dreaming is not much comfort to the Sanders campaign.And just to top it all off, Hillary is dominating the polls in all five states, anyway.It s possible that one or two of those states will have a Michigan style upset but considering how historically wrong the polling was going into that election, it seems more than a little more unlikely that we ll be seeing more of that. Does this mean Clinton voters should be complacent? Hellllll no. The more she wins by, the stronger her position and the longer her coattails will be going into the general election. Eyes on the prize.Everything else is just noise.Featured image via Eric Thayer\\u002fGetty Images\"],[\"The Russians have wanted a puppet in the White House for decades, and now they have one after successfully helping Donald Trump win the election.Last week, the CIA concluded along with over a dozen other intelligence agencies that Russia interfered in the election to get Trump elected. Trump refused to acknowledge that Russia meddled. In fact, he has been desperately defending Russia as his legitimacy is increasingly doubted. Republicans have largely sat on their hands because they don t care if a foreign power rigged our election as long as their candidate wins.But now Russia has a measure of control over the United States that they have never had before and that means Vladimir Putin was able to execute a coup in this nation without firing a single shot   and the unwillingness of Trump and Republicans to do anything about it enraged Keith Olbermann, who tore them to shreds for it. We are at war with Russia,  Olbermann began.  Or perhaps more correctly, we have lost a war with Russia without a battle. We are no longer a sovereign nation, we are no longer a democracy, we are no longer a free people, we are the victims of a bloodless coup. Indeed, if Russia and the GOP are allowed to get away with this coup, nothing stops Republicans from seeking help from foreign powers in any election. Democracy would be dead, and our government would no longer be chosen by the people.Olbermann shamed Republicans for not taking Russia s espionage seriously and wondered  if the Russians hacked the RNC and have kept what they found there to make sure Trump and the Republicans obeyed. That would certainly be an explanation for why Republicans have been defending Russia.And that s why Olbermann called for the immediate appointment of a special prosecutor and called for preventing Trump from taking office until we know what Trump knew and when he knew it. After all, Trump did encourage Russia to continue hacking our political process during the campaign. There is no time for a full review or a measured analysis or recommendations to prevent interference in our future elections. Because permitting Donald Trump to assume the office of president reduces the chance that we will have any future elections. The nation and all of our freedoms hang by a thread, and the military apparatus of this country is about to be handed over to scum who are beholden to scum   Russian scum. Trump is already stocking his cabinet with pro-Russia officials, including Putin s personal friend Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State. And because Trump wants to build a hotel in Moscow and owes Russia for getting him elected, it s likely Trump will be beholden to Putin, which means a weaker NATO and a weaker America as Russia grabs for power around the world with no United States to challenge them. It will not be a peaceful change of power   it will be a usurpation,  Olbermann concluded.  And the usurper has no validity, no credibility and no authority under the Constitution. This is a reality, and this will be the only reality until this country rids itself of Donald John Trump. He is not a president   he is a puppet. Here s the video via YouTube:Donald trump and the Republican Party are ignoring Russia s meddling because they won the election. If the situation were reversed and Hillary Clinton has won with Russia s help there is no denying that Republicans would be crying foul right now. So they need to stop being hypocrites and start standing up for the integrity of our election system. They need to keep Trump from taking office and the best way to do that is to get the Electoral College to vote against him. Our nation s future is at stake.Featured image via screenshot\"],[\"In 2016, celebrities came together to create an emotional video that minimized crimes committed or incidents that led to the death of black men and women, both young and old, across America.

The University is a beacon   a promise that Texas will continue to produce citizens who care about its future. However, the removal of the Jefferson Davis statue from the Main Mall demonstrates that the university values its current students more than it does its future ones.I believe that society does well to relegate the memory of the Confederacy to museums. Its legacy haunts the United States in ways that many will never understand. Recent events demonstrate that our nation may never fully heal from the wounds that the Civil War inflicted. However, removing a statue does not equate to progress particularly when other symbols of Confederacy continue to stand on the South Mall.In fact, the crowd of students and professors that gathered to witness the statute s removal serves as clear evidence that the University worries more about public appearances than it does encouraging future generations to remember the achievements of the past. Much like the university, the Main Mall serves as more than a beautiful area of the campus. The university commissioned the mall as a memorial to the reconciliation of the North and South. Less than 50 years after the end of the Civil War, sons of Union and Confederate soldiers fought together on the fields of France during World War I. Their parents had taught them to hate each other, yet they persevered together to defeat a common enemy.The South Mall s designers arranged the statues in such a way that the sun set on the faces of the Confederacy, a sign that the era of Jefferson Davis, Robert E. Lee, and Albert Sidney Johnston would no longer govern Texas. However, the sun rises on the faces of men who stood as symbols of Texas  hope for a progressive future: President Woodrow Wilson, Gov. Jim Hogg, and Senator John Reagan   a former Confederate sympathizer who encouraged Texas to rejoin the Union.The statues look center toward a statute of George Washington, the preeminent founder who warned of the dangers of national division. The Littlefield Fountain bears a Latin inscription that translates to read:  Short is the life given, but the memory of a life nobly surrendered is everything. Ultimately, the South Mall reminds viewers not to honor the errors of the past, but rather that Texas can triumph in spite of its past. Yet rather than explain the Main Mall s history and purpose to the public, the University allowed errant voices to rule the day. As a result, future generations will likely forget the Main Mall s importance altogether. The moral of the story will be no more.Longhorns, do not continue wasting time by fretting over appearances. Fight for worthwhile causes, and remember your history. It will make you better, and thereby prompt you to change the world.McMichael lives in Waco.

In the first hour we re joined by investigative, Shawn Helton to discuss his thoughts and reflections on 9\\u002f11, and also the release of Reagan gunman John Hinckley Jr. Also in the first hour, we ll connect with Syria-based independent correspondent Tom Duggan to hear more of his eyewitness account of The Battle of Aleppo and what is happening with the latest Syria ceasefire agreement signed between Russia and the United States in Geneva this week. In the third and fourth hour, we re joined by writer and analyst, Jay Dyer, author of Esoteric Hollywood, to talk about  September 11th  and what it means in terms of American mythology, the national and global psyche, the madness of Neoconservative operative Paul Wolfowitz, and what this means in American society and the geopolitical theatre in the 21st century.SHOUT POLL: Should US\\u002fUK\\u002fEU-funded White Helmets receive a Nobel Peace Prize?Strap yourselves in and lower the blast shield   this is your brave new world  *NOTE: THIS EPISODE MAY CONTAIN STRONG LANGUAGE AND MATURE THEMES*Direct Download the Most Recent Episode\\u002f\\u002f \\u003c![CDATA[ broadstreet.zone(46707); \\u002f\\u002f ]]&gt;Sunday Wire Radio Show Archives   \"],[\"While fecklessness towards the emerging North Korean threat characterized the Clinton and Bush  43 administrations, we find ourselves needlessly exposed to its present magnitude in no small measure because Obama s so-called strategic patience was characterized by inaction on two, vital fronts: advancing the U.S. missile defense capabilities and protecting the grid against electromagnetic pulse and other perils.Barack Obama and his subordinates brought to office a visceral enmity towards missile defense, born of an ideological attachment to the obsolete Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with the Soviet Union, which prevented the United States from having any effective anti-missile systems. While George W. Bush formally withdrew us from the ABM Treaty in 2002, the capabilities of such defenses as have been put into place have been deliberately limited   so much so that they were reportedly not up to the task of shooting down the ballistic missile Pyongyang fired over Japan last week.Team Obama was convinced that it would rid the world of nuclear weapons and so declined to take seriously, let alone do anything appreciable about, the danger that one or more detonated outside the atmosphere over the United States could destroy our most critical of critical infrastructures: the electric grid. Late in his presidency, Mr. Obama did evince concern about a similar, nation-ending effect being caused by intense solar storms, but did little to make the grid resilient against that source of destructive electromagnetic pulses, either.   Frank J. Gaffney, Jr., former Assistant Secretary of Defense for the Reagan administration, and President of the Center for Security PolicyWashington Examiner   Congress was warned Thursday that North Korea is capable of attacking the U.S. today with a nuclear EMP bomb that could indefinitely shut down the electric power grid and kill 90 percent of  all Americans  within a year.At a House hearing, experts said that North Korea could easily employ the  doomsday scenario  to turn parts of the U.S. to ashes.In calling on the Pentagon and President Trump to move quickly to protect the grid, the experts testified that an explosion of a high-altitude nuclear bomb delivered by a missile or satellite  could be to shut down the U.S. electric power grid for an indefinite period, leading to the death within a year of up to 90 percent of all Americans. Two members of the former congressional EMP commission said the threat to the U.S. has never been higher, in part because of the current high level of saber-rattling by both sides and North Korea s surprising display over the past six months of its ability to deliver on its threats. With the development of small nuclear arsenals and long-range missiles by new, radical U.S. adversaries, beginning with North Korea, the threat of a nuclear EMP attack against the U.S. becomes one of the few ways that such a country could inflict devastating damage to the United States. It is critical, therefore, that the U.S. national leadership address the EMP threat as a critical and existential issue, and give a high priority to assuring the leadership is engaged and the necessary steps are taken to protect the country from EMP,  the experts told a House Homeland Security subcommittee.Watch the discussion about the threat of an EMP attack on the United States with congressional members here: \"],[\"Just when you didn t think the Trump campaign could sink any lower, it does. Twitter lit up on Wednesday evening, because it appears that lawmakers from numerous countries have been being spammed with emails from the Trump camp begging for campaign donations. None of them are too happy about this. First, British MP s tweeted out their frustrations and outrage regarding this, and many referenced the horrifying nature of Donald Trump s campaign trail rhetoric. Australian Parlimentarian Tim Watts tweeted the fact that it was MP s from bunches of countries that were on the receiving end of the Trump fundraising email assault to TPM s Josh Marshall:@joshtpm @PatrickRuffini from what I can see, every Australian MP too.

Several lawmakers in the United Kingdom tweeted their aggravation. The best, though was from Natalie McGarry, who actually took the time to respond to Donald Trump, Jr., who it seems sent the email. She was kind enough to tweet images of both the email and her absolutely awesome response:May be Donald Trump bought lists   bizarre for grassroots campaign   but how does he opt out of foreign donations? pic.twitter.com\\u002fjVwfdFnI6U  Natalie McGarry MP (@NatalieMcgarry) June 27, 2016McGarry said, in part, to Trump: Quite why you think it appropriate to write emails to UK parliamentarians with a begging bowl for your father s repugnant campaign is completely beyond me. Given his rhetoric on migrants, refugees and immigration, it seems quite extraordinary that he would be asking for money; especially people who view his dangerous divisiveness with horror. BOOM! The fact that this was the response that Mini Trump received when he dared to beg for money from foreign leaders should have been a cue to cease and desist. Instead, they expanded the effort to multiple other countries. It also bears noting that it is illegal for other foreign lawmakers and other political types to donate to U.S. elections. Further, it is also a violation of the law to solicit such donations as well. Trump has already been issued with a Federal Elections Commissions complaint over this activity.Trump s campaign is pathetic, but this is a new low. Do the world a favor and leave this race, Mr. Trump. You re an embarrassment to Americans on the world stage.Featured image via Ralph Freso\\u002fGetty Images\"],[\"A desperate Jeb Bush held a campaign rally at a South Carolina golf course on Wednesday, and all his supporters wanted to do was give him advice on how to fix his struggling campaign.Bush was probably hoping to come out swinging as the South Carolina primary approaches, but his worried fans had different concerns.Like a child being advised on how to deal with being bullied, one Bush supporter named Edward Scott told Bush that he should  raise the bar  and rise above the bullying by Trump because his message is being lost the more Bush gets frazzled by the billionaire mogul. Your message doesn t resonate with the national community.   I was wondering because of your civility if you could raise the bar in the next session and try to be beyond the bully because I think that s who you are and I think they try to knock you off center. It appears you do get knocked off center, like anyone would, because of the insults to your family. I don t think I feel shaken up by the bully,  Bush replied.  I m the only guy going after the guy who I believe is hijacking the party. David Villinger also voiced concern about Trump taking over the race while Bush desperately focuses on attacking him instead of focusing on delivering his own message. I think the campaign has been co-opted by the P.T. Barnum of our time. And I think he is getting you off your good message and all the times that you ve shared with us today. But I think I would encourage you to emphasize those things. Indeed, Jeb Bush is currently polling in a distant fourth place behind Trump, who leads the field with 34 percent while Bush only has under 10 percent.Cruz clocks in at second place with 17 percent and Rubio is a close third place with 16 percent. Clearly, nobody is really all that excited about Jeb.In the end, Jeb Bush not only received advice, he got bad news because South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley endorsed Marco Rubio even after Jeb sent his brother to meet with her. Jeb could only give reporters some parting sarcasm. It s all been decided, apparently. The pundits have already figured it out. We don t have to go vote. I should stop campaigning maybe. And that s probably the best idea Jeb Bush has had throughout his entire campaign. Featured image from Flickr\"],[\"It can easily be said that Donald Trump doesn t live in reality. He lives in his own world filled with delusion and a narrative that he s created on his own. Why? Who knows, really. Maybe because his fragile ego doesn t allow him to see the fact that he lost the popular vote by three million votes and the majority of America doesn t like him at all.Since Trump took office there have been protests nationwide to let him know that both he and his agenda are not welcome. These protests have garnered millions of people outraged and offended that he s in the Oval Office, especially knowing that his campaign allegedly colluded with Russia to put him there.To make his ego feel better, Trump supporters, the vile bunch that they are, decided that they would come out on March 4, and throw  support rallies  for Trump.Let s not forget that this was at his request:Maybe the millions of people who voted to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN should have their own rally. It would be the biggest of them all!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 25, 2017So, his supporters listened, jumped on their motorized scooters with American flag decals, and  rallied  for their supreme leader. Then, after a handful of people showed up in a number of places in varying states, Trump decided in his own delusional brain that this was  tremendous support    you know, whatever helps him sleep at night.He wrote on Twitter: Thank you for the great rallies all across the country. Tremendous support. Make America Great Again! Thank you for the great rallies all across the country. Tremendous support. Make America Great Again!  Donald J.

It s as if the GOP believes saying the words will magically make the terrorists go away. What exactly would using this language accomplish?  President Obama demanded to know in remarks made last week.  What exactly would it change? Would it make ISIL less committed to try and kill Americans? Would it bring in more allies? Is there a military strategy that is served by this? The answer is none of the above. Calling a threat by a different name does not make it go away. But Republican Senator Roy Blunt is now accusing his Democratic opponent of being weak on terrorism because he also hasn t said the words.Blunt, who cowardly dodged the draft during the Vietnam War through the use of student deferments posted the accusation against Jason Kander on Twitter. Despite Ft.

Among those who are slamming the GOP for this despicable act are doctors, who know just how bad this will be for their patients.Following the passage of the American Health Care Act, the American Medical Association issued a scathing statement. The AMA, which is the largest group of its kind in the U.S. and represents more than 20,000 physicians, slammed the bill for leaving millions without access to medical care. The bill passed by the House today will result in millions of Americans losing access to quality, affordable health insurance and those with pre-existing health conditions face the possibility of going back to the time when insurers could charge them premiums that made access to coverage out of the question,  AMA President Andrew Gurman said.The group conceded that action is needed to improve the current health care insurance system.  After all, no one has ever claimed that Obamacare was perfect. However, the GOP s bill is not the answer we need. The AMA urged the White House and  the Senate to work toward  bipartisan solutions. The AMA urges the Senate and the Administration to work with physician, patient, hospital and other provider groups to craft bipartisan solutions so all American families can access affordable and meaningful coverage, while preserving the safety net for vulnerable populations,  he said.The CBO has estimated that 24 million people will lose their healthcare coverage under the Republican plan. The elderly and sick (you know, the people who need medical care the most) will be hit the hardest by the GOP bill. Under the AHCA, states will be able to gut protections for pre-existing conditions and tell insurance companies that they can charge sick people as much as they want, even if that means these people are priced out of coverage altogether.Featured image via Alex Wong\\u002fGetty Images\"],[\"Another unhinged Democrat has been arrested for attacking someone with political views that are in opposition to his yawn Kentucky State Police have arrested a person accused of assaulting Sen.

Senator Paul is fine. The suspect was identified as 59-year-old Rene Boucher of Bowling Green, Kent., according to a statement from Kentucky State Police reported by the Bowling Green Daily News.  True PunditBoucher is an anesthesiologist and pain specialist. He got his medical degree from Des Moines University College of Osteopathic Medicine after being pre-med at Providence College in Rhode Island, according to Doximity. Boucher has practiced medicine in since 1982 and attended high school in New Bedford, Massachusetts. Between 1985 and 1993, Boucher was pain management specialist at the Letterman Army Medical Center in San Francisco where he also did his residency.In 2005, Boucher appeared on QVC marketing a rice-filled vest that was designed to alleviate back pain, reported the Bowling Green Daily News. The vest retailed at $30 and had to be microwaved before use. The website for Therm-a-Vest is no longer active. WAVE reports that Boucher retired in 2015.In May 2017, Boucher shared a story on Facebook about Republican Congressman Greg Gianforte assaulting The Guardian s Ben Jacobs in Bozeman, Montana. The assault was described as a  body slam  at the time. Boucher writes in his Facebook bio that he is in a relationship. The Bowling Green Daily News article about Boucher s pain relieving vest saw him city his wife, Lisa, as a reason for its success.Boucher is a registered Democrat. Since Trump s ascendency to the president, Boucher has been severely critical the GOP on Facebook. Boucher is shown to be an advocate for gun control and healthcare reform.

Donald Trump s recent statements disparaging immigrants make it impossible for my company and I to move forward with opening a successful Spanish restaurant in Trump International s upcoming hotel in Washington D.C.,  Andres said in a statement.  More than half of my team is Hispanic, as are many of our guests. And, as a proud Spanish immigrant and recently naturalized American citizen myself, I believe that every human being deserves respect, regardless of immigration status. Andres s statement comes after Washington DC resident Erick Sanchez started a Change.org petition asking the chef to pull his planned restaurant from Trump s hotel. The petition had gathered 2,750 signatures by Wednesday afternoon, but it was unclear whether it had played a role in Andres s decision.In an email to the Washington Post, Trump s son Donald Trump Jr. said that Andres had  no right  to back out of what he said is a 10-year lease the chef signed with the hotel and threatened legal action:Our relationship with Jos  Andr s has always been a good one, but simply put, Jos  has no right to terminate or otherwise abandon his obligations under the lease. In the event Mr. Andres defaults in the performance of his obligations, we will not hesitate to take legal action to recover all unpaid rent for the entire 10 year term together with all attorneys  fees and additional damages we may sustain. We will also enforce the exclusivity provisions preventing Mr. Andr s from opening a competing restaurant anywhere in the D.C area. Mr. Andr s  obligations under the lease are clear and unambiguous. More importantly, construction is ahead of schedule at Trump International Hotel, Washington D.C. and when completed in 2016, will be a crown jewel within the Trump Hotel Collection.Andres has been a vocal advocate for immigration reform. In a 2013 op-ed for the Post, the chef, who became a naturalized American citizen after living in the United States for decades, lobbied Congress to pass an immigration bill that had stalled in the legislature. The fellow immigrants I ve known and worked with over the years, those with legal status and those without, are here for the right reasons,  Andres wrote.  They don t want to cause any trouble, take any handouts or steal anyone s job. Many already pay taxes and have jobs   tough, dirty, exhausting work that America depends on, such as picking our tomatoes, cleaning our fish or canning our products on cold factory floors for low wages and no benefits. Andres s decision to cut ties with Trump follows other individuals and companies who have backed away from the real estate mogul and presidential candidate in recent weeks. NBC, Univision, Macy s, PGA Golf, the Miss Universe pageant, and ESPN have all distanced themselves from Trump following his comments.Via: Breitbart News\"],[\"Last week, Private Investigator Rod Wheeler appeared on Fox5 news in DC with an update in the unsolved murder of DNC IT expert Seth Rich, claiming proof exists on Rich s laptop proving he was Julian Assange s source for leaked DNC emails during the 2016 election   an account in direct conflict to the Russian hacking narrative based on a discredited IT firm s report.Wheeler walked back his statements the next day, however the fuse was already lit  Weaponized autists on Reddit and 4chan began furiously digging back into the Seth Rich case for clues in the still unsolved murder   and they went deep.Among the findings were Seth Rich s Reddit account, email addresses, and Twitter accounts   one of which was in support of candidate Bernie Sanders. As an aside  before joining the DNC, Rich moved to Washington DC to take a job with polling and research firm Greenberg Quinlan Rosner  whose founder Stanley Greenberg was a senior advisor to President Bill Clinton.Reddit s the_donald goes darkAs Seth Rich posts reached a crescendo Friday night  dominating the front page of \\u002fr\\u002fThe_Donald, the Conde Nast-linked website shut the  subreddit  down for around 12 hours following a moderator s unrelated declaration of war on the rest of Reddit over censorship  completely killing the Seth Rich momentum. When The_Donald was reopened, officially  to aid the Seth Rich effort   the offending moderator had been banned and two other mods were removed from their positions. Seth Rich posts, however, are notably sparse. Oh, and Reddit edited Seth Rich s account during the lockout.Meanwhile in New ZealandKim Dotcom is pissed   and has been plotting revenge against Hillary Clinton, Obama, and Hollywood after being targeted in the biggest copyright infringement case in history  which included a massive illegal (and then legal) raid on his New Zealand mansion by 76 armed officers and two helicopters.Dotcom tweets that Democrats attacked his family and stole his assets in a copyright infringement case and appears to be suggesting that he was paying them back by sending Rich s DNC emails to Wikileaks:Democrats destroyed my business, attacked my family, stole my assets in a pay4play strike for the @MPAACounterstrike:Trump Presidency   Kim Dotcom (@KimDotcom) May 19, 2017Sean Hannity has offered Dotcom a national platform (which Kim retweeted)I knew Seth Rich.

Here is a compilation of Hannity and Limbaugh s remarks on the Rich case:https:\\u002f\\u002fwww.youtube.com\\u002fwatch?v=KXn6FzWBS4oWhy were no employees of Joe s City Bar where Rich was last seen questioned about his final hours leading up to his murder? Why was the surveillance tape in the bar not seen by investigators? WND A manager of the Washington, D.C., bar where Democratic National Committee worker Seth Rich was last spotted hours before he was shot and killed last summer told WND that D.C. police officers never interviewed the bar s staff or requested any evidence from the bar, including the bar s surveillance video from that night, as part of an investigation into Rich s murder.The revelation backs up a claim made by a private investigator who worked on the case who said D.C. police were told to  stand down  on the investigation.WND also can report that the investigator recently was ordered to  cease and desist  his work on the murder case. The police never asked for the surveillance video from that night,  a manager of Lou s City Bar told WND.His name is being withheld for this story.He said the bar s surveillance video runs in a cycle of 30 days and that, by now, any footage that may have existed of Rich the last night he was seen alive has been taped over.Furthermore, the manager said police never asked for any other kind of evidence from the bar such as Rich s bar receipt from that night. The manager did note he wasn t sure if Rich paid using a credit card or cash. Seth Rich s girlfriend, best friend and parents all speak out about the brutal murder that DC detectives are calling a  botched robbery  that left Rich dead while leaving all of his valuables, including his wallet on his person. Seth Rich s parents admitted that after Seth was shot, police reported that he was  quite talkative . If Seth was  quite talkative,  then why aren t there any leads on his killers? Seth s parents appear to be Hillary sycophants. They appear to be very proud of their son as they tell Crime Watch Daily that he was just getting ready to go to work for Hillary s campaign. They also adamantly stand behind the Democrat Party and claim they are angered by any claim that a hit was ordered on Rich by online citizen journalists.As more and more evidence is being revealed about Rich s possible role as the leaker of the DNC emails to Wikileaks, the attitude of Seth s parents towards citizen journalists has taken a surprising turn. In this video that was just released, Rich s parents appear to be praising the work of citizen journalists that are forcing the investigation into Seth Rich s death via social media.https:\\u002f\\u002ftwitter.com\\u002fRedPillDropper\\u002fstatus\\u002f866071104112209921According to research conducted by a 4Chan citizen journalists, Joseph Capone, the owner of Lou s City Bar where Rich was last seen alive, visited the East Wing of the White House 4 days before the murder of Seth Rich.A visit by a Joseph P. Capone to the East Wing of the White House on July is verified on the government White House visitor log website. We cannot verify that this is the same Joe Capone who owns Lou s City bar where Seth was last seen. According the White House Museum website, the East Wing is reserved for  the first lady and her staff, including the White House social secretary and correspondence staff.:Crime Watch Daily investigated the murder of Seth Rich and compiled an interesting video that includes interviews with Seth s girlfriend, best friend and parents.Although there are pockets of darkness, for the most part this neighborhood is pretty well-lit.

Will DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz take the utlitmate hit to keep Bernie fans under control? When will the media expose Hillary s involvement in the DNC and media s coordinated take down of Bernie Sanders?Bernie Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver said his team was  disappointed  by the emails from the Democratic National Committee leaked through WikiLeaks, which seemed to reveal staff in the party working to support Hillary Clinton. Someone does have to be held accountable,  Weaver said during an interview with ABC News.  We spent 48 hours of public attention worrying about who in the [Donald] Trump campaign was going to be held responsible for the fact that some lines of Mrs. Obama s speech were taken by Mrs. Trump. Someone in the DNC needs to be held at least as accountable as the Trump campaign. We have an electoral process. The DNC, by its charter, is required to be neutral among the candidates. Clearly it was not,  Weaver said, responding for the first time to the growing controversy.  We had obviously pointed that out in a number of instances prior to this, and these emails just bear that out. Another member of Sanders  staff, Rania Batrice put it this way:  Everything our fans have been saying   and they were beaten down for and called conspiracy theorists   and now it s in black and white. One of the newest leaks is an email thread about Sanders faith. Sanders, who is Jewish, did not bring up his religious faith much during the campaign trail and some DNC staffers were hoping he would. But the email itself does not mention Sanders by name, so readers are to infer that it may have been him. But it remains to be seen if these leaked emails are fakes.DNC CFO Brad Marshall sent an email, with the blunt subject line  No Sh*t,  to DNC communications director Luis Miranda, CEO Amy Dacey, and deputy communications director Mark Paustenbach, discussing if Sanders would be bringing up his faith during the Kentucky and West Virginia primaries: It might may no difference, but for KY and WVA can we get someone to ask his belief. Does he believe in a God. He had skated on saying he has a Jewish heritage. I think I read he is an atheist. This could make several points difference with my peeps. My Southern Baptist peeps would draw a big difference between a Jew and an atheist. Dacey replied with a simple  Amen  about the topic. Sanders had discussed his Jewish heritage in the past, but has remained mum on all other religious aspects of his life. Marshall told The Intercept he did not recall writing this email and it wasn t necessarily geared toward Sanders.  Uproxx Via: Slate And InterceptThe email dump comes at a crucial time, just days before the party s national convention in Philadelphia, with thousands of delegates representing both campaigns gathering from across the country. Weaver and several other members of the Sanders staff have said they are worried the news could disrupt the goals of the convention.Weaver said the emails showed misconduct at the highest level of the staff within the party and that he believed there would be more emails leaked, which would  reinforce  that the party had  its fingers on the scale. Everybody is disappointed that much of what we felt was happening at the DNC was in fact happening, that you had in this case a clear example of the DNC taking sides and looking to place negative information into the political process.

ForbesA new report on global warming data has now proven President Donald Trump to be right to pull out of the Paris Agreement. The report analyzed climate data such as Global Average Surface Temperature (GAST), the NOAA, and HADLEY.SHFTPLan reports: According to the report, which has been peer reviewed by administrators, scientists and researchers from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (M.I.T.), and several of America s leading universities, the data is completely bunk: In this research report, the most important surface data adjustment issues are identified and past changes in the previously reported historical data are quantified. It was found that each new version of GAST has nearly always exhibited a steeper warming linear trend over its entire history. And, it was nearly always accomplished by systematically removing the previously existing cyclical temperature pattern. This was true for all three entities providing GAST data measurement, NOAA, NASA and Hadley CRU.As a result, this research sought to validate the current estimates of GAST using the best available relevant data. This included the best documented and understood data sets from the U.S. and elsewhere as well as global data from satellites that provide far more extensive global coverage and are not contaminated by bad siting and urbanization impacts. Satellite data integrity also benefits from having cross checks with Balloon data.The conclusive findings of this research are that the three GAST data sets are not a valid representation of reality. In fact, the magnitude of their historical data adjustments, that removed their cyclical temperature patterns, are totally inconsistent with published and credible U.S. and other temperature data. Thus, it is impossible to conclude from the three published GAST data sets that recent years have been the warmest ever  despite current claims of record setting warming.Finally, since GAST data set validity is a necessary condition for EPA s GHG\\u002fCO2 Endangerment Finding, it too is invalidated by these research findings. (Full Abstract Report) Fox News reported on President Trump pulling out of the Paris Agreement per his campaign promise: he is leading. President Trump is withdrawing the United States from the Paris Climate Accord.It is the right decision for a number of reasons.First, the Paris Accord is being treated by many as a treaty with treaty obligations, but President Obama never submitted it to Congress for passage.Second, though President Trump could have left it in place and done nothing, his successor could have easily revived it if left in place.Third, the structure and implementation of the Paris Accord set a terrible precedent. President Obama worked for what amounts to a global agreement with voluntary measures, but those measures would impact the American economy. But, despite that impact, President Obama did not present the Paris Accord to Congress for ratification or debate. Members of the liberal establishment were outraged.Obama criticized President Trump s decision to pull out of the Paris Climate agreement with the following statement : A year and a half ago, the world came together in Paris around the first-ever global agreement to set the world on a low-carbon course and protect the world we leave to our children.It was steady, principled American leadership on the world stage that made that achievement possible.  It was bold American ambition that encouraged dozens of other nations to set their sights higher as well. And what made that leadership and ambition possible was America s private innovation and public investment in growing industries like wind and solar   industries that created some of the fastest new streams of good-paying jobs in recent years, and contributed to the longest streak of job creation in our history.Simply put, the private sector already chose a low-carbon future.  And for the nations that committed themselves to that future, the Paris Agreement opened the floodgates for businesses, scientists, and engineers to unleash high-tech, low-carbon investment and innovation on an unprecedented scale.The nations that remain in the Paris Agreement will be the nations that reap the benefits in jobs and industries created.  I believe the United States of America should be at the front of the pack.  But even in the absence of American leadership; even as this Administration joins a small handful of nations that reject the future; I m confident that our states, cities, and businesses will step up and do even more to lead the way, and help protect for future generations the one planet we ve got. But of course, like all Champagne Socialists, their credo is  do as I say, not as I do,  with Obama jacking up his carbon footprint when abroad. Who could forget Obama s massive convoy during a recent speaking gig in Milan?The Independent Journal Review reported: Former President Barack Obama traveled to Italy this week to make a speech on climate change at the  Seed & Chips: The Global Food Innovation Summit  in the city of Milan.It seems like Obama has taken a page out of Leonardo DiCaprio s book of  do as I say, not as I do  and took a private jet to Milan. Not only that, he had a 14 car convoy to get into the city, which also included protection from above with a helicopter.It doesn t end there. According to The Daily Mail, 300 police officers were used to protect the former president.The fleet of 14 included multiple SUVs, police cars, and sedans   not to mention a few motorcycles. Here s another look at the convoy:While in Milan, Obama also met with former Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, who was a close partner during their respective times in office.

If you live in Sweden and have been watching your Swedish traditions and culture discarded and replaced with a radical Muslim culture, you probably won t be shocked by this video. If you live in a nation like Germany or the UK that s been importing unvetted refugees from Muslim majority nations for several years, you will probably not be surprised by this video. But for many Americans, who are foolish enough to think that inviting millions of Muslim refugees (who have no interest in assimilating) into your neighborhoods and communities, this video should serve as a warning to you of what a bleeding-heart nation looks like post-idiocy:The weather forecast in Sweden vs the weather forecast in Iraq. pic.twitter.com\\u002ft870JhVRSU  Paul Joseph Watson (@PrisonPlanet) July 11, 2017So, why is Sweden starting to look like a majority Muslim nation? In 1975, the Swedish parliament unanimously decided to change the former homogeneous Sweden into a multicultural country. Forty years later the dramatic consequences of this experiment emerge: violent crime has increased by 300%.If one looks at the number of rapes, however, the increase is even worse. In 1975, 421 rapes were reported to the police; in 2014, it was 6,620. That is an increase of 1,472%.Sweden is now number two on the global list of rape countries. According to a survey from 2010, Sweden, with 53.2 rapes per 100,000 inhabitants, is surpassed only by tiny Lesotho in Southern Africa, with 91.6 rapes per 100,000 inhabitants.Data Also Suggests the Uptick Is Due to Immigrants More controversial is what explains these increases. Some contend the increase in rape is simply a statistical phenomenon due to the application of an expanded definition of rape in 2005 and again in 2013. Others suggest Swedish women have simply grown bolder about reporting things that happened previously but went unreported. Maybe, but in the same period, as Carlqvist and Hedegaard point out,  the number of gang rapes [in Sweden] increased spectacularly.  In rapes of this kind  culprits and victims are most often young and in almost every case, the perpetrators are of immigrant background, mostly from Muslim countries. Finally, it s also worth pointing out that the rise of rape isn t peculiar to Sweden either. The same problem is plaguing Germany, Austria (more information here), Britain, and other EU nations.

Sheaffer said Caesar s death scene was particularly graphic, with blood  spewing everywhere,  and an American flag hanging overhead. To be honest I thought it was shocking and distasteful,  Shaeffer told Mediaite.  If this had happened to any other president   even as recently as Barack Obama or George W. Bush   it would not have flown. People would have been horrified. The Trump connection in the Oskar Eustis-directed production was not intended to be subtle, though the president is reportedly never referred to by name during the show.The actor playing Caesar, Gregg Henry (who also happened to play a caricature of Trump in Shonda Rhimes  ABC show Scandal), told Backstage in an interview last month that while the similarities between the Roman general and the current president don t always align exactly, there was still much to be gleaned from Trump s presidency and then injected into his portrayal of Caesar. The idea for me was to try and do some things that will represent and show you and I have great costumes and wigs that show you that this could be Trump,  Henry told Backstage. But I m also trying to bring in the larger knowledge of tyrants. It s sort of a  tyrant s  greatest hits  in [the way I play] the speeches and in the nature of the ego and belief that one man is more important, is above the law, is the law. Those tyrannical beliefs in terms of how to deal with power. For her part, Shaeffer told Mediaite that while she found the parallels between Trump and Caesar  fascinating,  the onstage murder of a character that so closely resembled Trump was a step  too far. I don t love President Trump, but he s the president. You can t assassinate him on a stage, she told the outlet.

Americans pride ourselves on being people who have a government. But these days, it more often seems as if we ve got a government that has people.And that government is even selecting who its people will be, having within a generation essentially imported a state s worth of new people through immigration.Since 1970, the number of  Hispanics of Mexican origin  in the U.S. has jumped from fewer than 1 million to more than 33 million. If all these Mexicans were a state, it would be the second largest in population in the country, trailing only California.Did you vote to approve that immigration policy? Did anyone? In fact, the federal government allowed it to happen without any voter input. That s by design.In recent years, Congress has attempted to draft legislation to deal with illegal immigration. And while the controversial  Gang of Eight  bill passed the Senate in 2013, it died in the House after one of its authors withdrew his support. Immigration is a difficult topic, one that will require difficult discussions.Instead, the Obama White House would prefer to short-circuit the political discussions. America cannot wait forever for them to act. That s why today I am beginning a new effort to fix as much of our immigration system as I can on my own, without Congress,  President Obama warned last summer. After the November elections, he acted to grant amnesty to millions of illegals.In February, a federal judge put a hold on that policy while he determined its legality. The administration admits it went right on ahead, issuing 2,000 more waivers. Now, an appeals court has upheld the stay. But the White House says it will press ahead. [T]he administration s enforcement priorities, including our focus on deporting felons and not families, and many other executive actions on immigration continue to move forward,  White House spokesman Eric Schultz told reporters this week.  It would be a shame if an issue so critical like this became mired in a political dispute. But Schultz has it exactly backward. If our representative system of government means anything, it should mean that the people have a say in the big issues facing our country.It s precisely because the issue is so important that it deserves to be a subject of political disputes. It s through the political process in the presidential and congressional elections of 2016 that voters can finally have a say in the nation s immigration policy. We ve already waited far too long.Via: Breitbart News \"],[\"It can be said that Senator Bernie Sanders is one of the most sincere politicians in all of politics. He s ambitious with a gusto for progress that is really unmatched. However, this gusto for pushing forward an economic agenda that is unparalleled by everyone running against him has left several leading economists scratching their heads, including Paul Krugman.In Krugman s recent post in the New York Times he brings up a challenge to the economic thought of both Sanders and Professor Gerald Friedman, who makes the claim that the Vermont Senator s economic plan would make jobs and income soar. Friedman states that real economic growth under Sanders would grow to 5.3% per year. That s as opposed to where we are now, which is at around 2%.Krugman writes: OK, progressives have, rightly, mocked Jeb Bush for claiming that he could double growth to 4 percent. Now people close to Sanders say 5.3??? Even those of us who believe that there s still significant slack in the US labor market are aware that much, probably most, of the decline in labor force participation since 1999 reflects an aging population   prime-working-age LFPR has reclaimed most of the lost ground since the Great Recession, and there s probably a long-term downward trend even there. It s possible that we can get unemployment down under 4 percent, but that s way below any estimates I ve seen of the level of unemployment consistent with moderate inflation. Krugman goes so far as to even say that if this sort of line was being perpetuated by a Republican, it would be described as  deep voodoo.  He continued, saying: Sanders needs to disassociate himself from this kind of fantasy economics right now. And  he concluded by stating that if his campaign disagrees with this assessment, which is backed up by fellow leading economic advisers, we ll be looking at a Trump presidency for sure.In a letter to Sanders and Friedman from  former Chairs of the Council of Economic Advisers for Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton  Alan Krueger, Austan Goolsbee, Christina Romer, and Laura D Andrea Tyson, they state that they  have worked to make the Democratic Party the party of evidence-based economic policy.  Continuing, they wrote: We are concerned to see the Sanders campaign citing extreme claims by Gerald Friedman about the effect of Senator Sanders s economic plan claims that cannot be supported by the economic evidence. Friedman asserts that your plan will have huge beneficial impacts on growth rates, income and employment that exceed even the most grandiose predictions by Republicans about the impact of their tax cut proposals.As much as we wish it were so, no credible economic research supports economic impacts of these magnitudes. Making such promises runs against our party s best traditions of evidence-based policy making and undermines our reputation as the party of responsible arithmetic. These claims undermine the credibility of the progressive economic agenda and make it that much more difficult to challenge the unrealistic claims made by Republican candidates. With Goolsbee even going so far as to separately also say,  they ve evolved into magic flying puppies with winning Lotto tickets tied to their collars  when he was commenting on another summation of Sanders  proposals by another progressive analyst.It seems pretty harsh, but it also seems they clearly to want to get their point across.Featured image from Flickr\"],[\"We can probably expect more Donald Trump lackies to be hit with ethics violations over the next four years.South Carolina GOP state Rep.

But Merrill is about to win a trip to prison after prosecutor David Pascoe officially charged him with 30 counts of ethics violations and misconductAccording to The State, Merrill is being accused of using his political office to receive over $1 million through his company, Greechie Communications, or directly.Merrill is accused of failing to disclose contributions and expenditures made to and from the House GOP Caucus operating account and improperly using that account for campaign purposes. That failure allowed Merrill to collect $164,564 from the House Republican Caucus without without accountability between Jan. 1, 2005 and Dec. 31, 2008, according to prosecutors.Merrill is charged with using his office for financial gain as a House member for receiving $108,169 to Geechie Communications from the GOP caucus just from Jan. 1, 2010 through Dec. 31, 2011.He is accused of using his position from 2005-2008 while serving as House GOP leader to direct $82,515 from the caucus to his PR firm.In addition, the indictment alleges Merrill directed $186,332 from the caucus to Geechie Communications, in excess of the fair market value for services it rendered between 2008 and 2010.In addition, Merrill  illegally received payments totaling at least $276,561 from the S.C. House Republican Caucus  through multiple accountsAnd those are just the tip of the iceberg.As it turns out Pascoe had to fight in court to keep the investigation because Attorney General Alan Wilson attempted to help Merrill, who happens to be his friend, by trying to assign another prosecutor to the case.This isn t the first time Trump has hired people who have since been charged with committing crimes.A Trump campaign staffer in Michigan was convicted of election fraud late last month.It makes one wonder just how many criminals Trump hired to help him win and how many will be in his administration.Featured Image: Spencer Platt\\u002fGetty Images\"],[\"While Donald Trump may have spent a lot of time dissing President Barack Obama during his presidential campaign, he has definitely changed his tone   likely because he knows how incredibly screwed he is if Obama doesn t hold his little orange hands during this transition process.On Wednesday, Trump horrified the entire Republican Party by showering praise on our current president and even said that he thinks so highly of our current Commander in Chief that he has taken some of Obama s advice on his future cabinet. During an interview on The Today Show, Trump touched on several subjects, but his most shocking statements were his kind words about Obama.

I love getting his ideas. And I may differ in many cases, I differ very greatly. It s safe to say that the  one  person Trump says Obama  thought very highly of  might be another one of Trump s lies, or there might be a small chance that at least one of the people in Trump s cabinet isn t a white supremacist (hopefully).

I ve always felt fine about Putin. He s a strong leader. He s a powerful leader,  Trump added.At the end of January, Putin and Trump held their first official phone call, which, according to the Kremlin, was  good and constructive. Over the past years, the lack of mutual respect became the main reason for the deterioration of relations,  Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov added.Another important thing is that Washington is prepared for dialogue, the spokesman concluded. This is what President Putin called for rather consistently but where unfortunately he did not see reciprocity over the past years,  Peskov said.Earlier in January, however, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov emphasized that the first meeting between Putin and Trump may  happen in months to come,  not  in a matter of weeks. Peskov also said,  it is maybe the biggest mistake on the part of Western analysts to think that Trump is  our man.  He is an American man.

Something that could very likely render a third world war because of leadership that doesn t know how to careful maneuver foreign diplomacy and policy? A Republican presidency.

We should be so lucky.But while Trump continues to set fire to the GOP, Jane Sanders threw cold water on Trump s attempt to spread the wildfire to the left.

Reuters and other outlets reported late Thursday that Pai told major telecommunications trade groups of his plans Tuesday to replace 2015 net neutrality rules with voluntary agreements to adopt open internet principles. The 2015 rules prevented broadband providers from giving or selling speedy or so-called fastlane access to some internet services over others.  Pai, a Republican appointed by President Donald Trump, opposes the rules approved by the FCC which gave the agency strong legal control over broadband providers, treating them much like utilities. FCC Commissioner Mignon Clyburn, a Democrat, said if the reports are accurate “we are gearing up for a battle that could eviscerate the widely supported open Internet protections.” The rules “were built on a record of more than four million comments, and demonstrated that a free and open internet is at the very heart of our American democracy,” she added. Chris Lewis, vice president at Public Knowledge said Pai could “give dominant cable and telecommunications companies what their DC lobbyists have dreamed of for years: voluntary net neutrality ‘rules’ where consumer protection is no more than ‘trust your cable or internet provider.’” The FCC declined to comment.  Pai wants to introduce new regulations under which internet providers like AT&T Inc, Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications Inc would voluntarily agree in their terms of service to not obstruct or slow consumer access to web content. The move would allow the Federal Trade Commission to enforce compliance with the new rules. Internet providers do not oppose net neutrality principles, but opposed the decision to reclassify internet service under a law that subjects them to potential utility style regulation. Pai is expected to unveil his proposal as early as April 27, with an initial vote planned for either May or June, sources told Reuters. The proposal would be open for public comment before the FCC could finalize it. The Internet Association, the trade group that represents major internet companies like Alphabet Inc, Facebook Inc, Netflix Inc and Microsoft Crop, and strongly supports net neutrality, will meet with Pai on Tuesday, a person briefed on the matter said. The group declined to comment. \"],[\"AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - Abortion providers in Texas reacted with surprise and elation on Monday to the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to throw out the state’s restrictive abortion law and said they aimed to reopen some clinics shut down since the measure was passed in 2013. Since the law was passed by a Republican-led legislature and signed by a Republican governor, the number of abortion clinics in Texas, the second-most-populous U.S. state with about 27 million people, has fallen from 41 to 19. “I am honestly surprised by the Supreme Court decision,” Rachel Bergstrom-Carlson, health center manager at Planned Parenthood of Austin, said at the clinic that performs about 250 abortions per month in the Texas state capital. But Bergstrom-Carlson said she does not think the ruling “all of the sudden creates open access” to abortion for Texas women or that it means other legislation intended to restrict women’s access to safe and legal abortions will be scrapped. Abortion providers said the law imposed medically unnecessary regulations that were intended to shut clinics. Texas state officials said the law was aimed at protecting women’s health. Dr. Bhavik Kumar, who performs abortions at Whole Woman’s Health clinics in Texas, said abortion providers will seek to reopen some of the shuttered clinics but do not expect to be able to return to the number in operation prior to the law. Negotiating new leases and hiring staff will mean a slow return to operations for those that do re-open, Kumar said. The Supreme Court ruled that both key provisions of the law - requiring abortion doctors to have difficult-to-obtain “admitting privileges” at a local hospital and requiring clinics to have costly hospital-grade facilities - violated a woman’s right to an abortion established in a 1973 landmark ruling. “I am beyond elated,” Amy Hagstrom Miller, founder and CEO of Whole Woman’s Health, which operates four abortion clinics in Texas and spearheaded the challenge to the law. “After years of fighting heartless, anti-abortion Texas politicians who would seemingly stop at nothing to push abortion out of reach, I want everyone to understand: you don’t mess with Texas, you don’t mess with Whole Woman’s Health,” she added. If the Supreme Court had left the law in place, only eight clinics would have remained open, including the Planned Parenthood facility in Austin, a U.S. lower court judge said. The state’s Republican leaders, including the governor and attorney general, criticized the ruling that they said would endanger public health. “Now abortion clinics are free to ignore these basic safety standards and continue practicing under substandard conditions,” Republican Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick said. “By its ruling, the court held that the ability of abortion clinics to remain open – even under substandard conditions – outweighs the state’s ability to put women’s health and safety first.” The legislature meets again next year, and top lawmakers indicated they may look at new abortion restrictions. The “admitting privileges” provision, requiring doctors who perform abortions to have formal affiliation with a hospital within 30 miles (48 kms) of their clinic, had gone into effect. The facilities standards had been put on hold by courts. \"],[\"FORT WORTH, Texas (Reuters) - Republican candidate Donald Trump on Friday won the surprise endorsement of New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, the most prominent mainstream Republican to get behind the former reality TV star’s White House campaign. Christie said the billionaire front-runner has the best chance of beating Democrat Hillary Clinton in the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election - although Clinton has yet to secure her party’s nomination.  The endorsement gives Trump a further lift before next week’s Super Tuesday nominating contests. It comes just a day after he took a battering from his two main rivals at a televised Republican debate.  Trump’s unorthodox candidacy has stirred controversy and shaken the Republican Party at its roots, but an increasing number of senior Republicans are becoming resigned to the idea he will be their candidate in November.      Trump is “rewriting the playbook,” said Christie, 53, who until two weeks ago was himself a rival for the Republican nomination. Christie dropped out after failing to muster much support for his candidacy.     Trump, 69, who has never held public office, has campaigned as a political outsider. He is riding a wave of voter anger at the slow economic recovery, illegal immigration and what he says is America’s diminishing role in the world.     “The best person to beat Hillary Clinton in November on that stage last night is undoubtedly Donald Trump,” Christie told a news conference on Friday, a day after the last Republican candidates’ debate before Super Tuesday. The debate marked a new, more aggressive approach for U.S. Senator Marco Rubio, 44, who has emerged as the Republican establishment’s challenger to Trump. The other main challenger at the debate was U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. Trump has unsettled mainstream Republicans by winning three straight nominating contests - in New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada. Polls show he is likely to win big in key primaries on Tuesday. “Since I started this whole thing I’ve been practically Number 1,” Trump said on Friday at a rally in Texas.  The 11 Republican nominating contests on Tuesday have a total of almost 600 delegates at stake, and could set Trump up to clinch the presidential nomination. Reuters\\u002fIpsos polling data on Friday showed Trump ahead nationally in the Republican race with support at 44.2 percent, followed by Cruz at 20.7 percent and Rubio in third place at 14 percent.     On the Democratic side, former Secretary of State Clinton is battling U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. Clinton and Sanders have been in a dead head over the past week, the Reuters\\u002fIpsos data shows. Trump has vowed to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexican border to halt illegal immigration, called for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States and promised to take a tough stance on trade against China.   He was combative at a rally on Friday. He mocked Rubio, referred to violent Islamist militants as “these animals” and promised to defend Americans’ constitutional right to bear arms. “We’re going to build up our military, we’re going to knock out ISIS. We’re going to knock out ISIS fast,” he said, referring to the Islamic State militant group.  Wielding a water bottle as a prop, Trump made fun of Rubio for an awkward incident in which the senator grabbed for a drink of water off camera during an important televised speech in 2013.  Rubio and Cruz ganged up on Trump at Thursday’s debate in Houston in a last-ditch bid to keep him from winning in states on Super Tuesday.      Rubio on Friday again took aim at Trump. “He’s a con man who’s taking advantage of people’s fears and anxieties about the future, portraying himself as some sort of strong guy,” Rubio told reporters in Oklahoma. “He’s not a strong guy. He’s never faced real adversity before.” PredictWise, a research project that analyzes opinion polls and betting markets, said Trump would comfortably win among Republicans in all but one of the 11 Super Tuesday states that it measured. Cruz, 45, is likely to win in his home state of Texas, PredictWise said. Rubio’s home state of Florida is not part of the Super Tuesday contests. PredictIt, based out of Victoria University in Wellington, New Zealand, on Friday gave Trump a 73 percent chance of winning the nomination compared with a peak 75 percent chance two days earlier.      Trump’s swipes at rival candidates and heated exchanges with journalists and others have for months bolstered his standing in nominating contests and opinion polls.  In a post on Twitter, Trump took aim at Rubio, a first-term senator, for his debate performance. “Lightweight Marco Rubio was working hard last night. The problem is, he is a choker, and once a choker, always a chocker (sic)! Mr. Meltdown.”   Republican strategist Doug Heye said Christie may have opened the door for more mainstream Republican endorsements of a man whose chances of winning the White House were seen as next to nil a year ago.     “If you’re the Trump campaign this is obviously very good news and it gives permission for others to endorse. But it also makes it hard (for Trump) to make the outsider argument,” he said.   Glenn Hubbard, who had been an adviser to the campaign of former Florida Governor Jeb Bush and was chair of the Council of Economic Advisers during the George H.W. Bush administration, said he planned to keep up steady criticism of Trump on economic issues.  “I think it is time for serious people to stand up and be counted. The next few weeks come very quickly,” said Hubbard, who published a column in the Boston Globe on Friday criticizing Trump.  Hubbard, now dean of the business school at Columbia University, told Reuters he worried Trump’s comments already hurt the country’s image abroad and would hobble his ability to govern if elected.

That includes payments by three Russian companies and a Netherlands-based company, Inovo, controlled by Turkish businessman Ekim Alptekin, they said. The FBI’s interest in Kian has not been previously reported. Kian played a central role in securing and overseeing the Inovo contract, two people with knowledge of that project said.  It is not clear whether Kian is a target of the criminal investigation or whether investigators are trying to build a fuller understanding of how Flynn’s company operated. A person recently interviewed by the FBI in connection with the Flynn investigation said agents from the bureau’s criminal division had asked as much about Kian and his work on the project with Alptekin as they had about Flynn.  Kian did not respond to repeated requests for comment, nor did the lawyer he recently hired, Robert Trout. The FBI declined to comment. Flynn’s lawyer, Robert Kelner, did not respond to requests for comment. Alptekin declined to comment for this story but last month told Reuters that he was satisfied with the work done by Flynn Intel Group and denied any wrongdoing.  The FBI has been investigating whether Flynn’s consulting firm lobbied on behalf of Turkey - after being paid $530,000 by Inovo - without making the proper disclosure, Reuters reported earlier this month. The federal investigation is being run by special counsel Robert Mueller. Mueller has a mandate to investigate contacts between Russia and Trump’s 2016 election campaign team and any related matters. Flynn was fired by the Trump administration in February after officials said he mischaracterized a series of phone calls with Russia’s ambassador last December.   The top Democrat on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, which has separately been looking into whether Flynn made false statements in applying for security clearance, said he was also scrutinizing Kian.  “I have an interest in Bijan Kian and his interactions with General Flynn based on specific documents already obtained by the Committee,” Elijah Cummings told Reuters in an email.  Kelner has sought immunity for Flynn in exchange for his testimony, saying his client “certainly has a story to tell.”    In private conversations with potential clients, Kian portrayed himself as a rainmaker for Flynn, tapping into  connections cultivated during a five-year tenure as a director at the U.S. Export-Import Bank, according to one person who worked with the firm. Alptekin told Reuters in May that his firm hired Flynn Intel Group to research Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen’s activities in the United States, which he suspected were “poisoning” relations between the United States and Turkey. Like Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, Alptekin blamed a failed coup in Turkey last July on followers of Gulen. Gulen, who has lived in self-imposed exile in Pennsylvania since 1999, has denied involvement in the attempted coup and dismisses Turkey’s allegations that he heads a terrorist organization. Kian oversaw key elements of the project that emerged, including a still-unfinished documentary on Gulen, according to two people involved in the project. Inovo paid Flynn Intel Group a total of $530,000, starting in September, according to a Justice Department filing by the company in March. Flynn Intel Group paid $80,000 to Inovo in “consultancy fees,” according to the filing, which does not provide more detail on why payments were made in both directions. On Sept. 19, Kian and Flynn met in New York with Turkey’s foreign minister and energy minister, who is Erdogan’s son-in-law, according to a person with knowledge of the meeting.   In late October, Kian invited staff of the House Homeland Security Committee to Flynn Intel Group’s headquarters in Virginia. The meeting was called to show off new mobile phone security technology, but Kian also used the opportunity to try to get a congressional hearing on Gulen, according to a person at the meeting.  At that point, the Flynn Intel Group had only disclosed its work for Alptekin’s Inovo in a filing with Congress. It had not mentioned Inovo’s ties to Turkey. When Justice Department officials became aware months later that Kian and other Flynn Intel Group officials had met with Turkish officials they insisted on a fuller disclosure, people involved in those discussions said. The Flynn Intel Group made the more detailed disclosure in its March filing with the Justice Department under the Foreign Agents Registration Act that said the work that Flynn and Kian did for Inovo “could be construed to have principally benefited the Republic of Turkey.” \"],[\"BERLIN (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron, accused by critics of being out of touch with ordinary people, denied in an interview with a German magazine he was aloof, saying that he was merely trying to stamp out cronyism between politicians and the media. The 39-year-old former banker was caught on video earlier this month saying during a visit to a struggling company that workers protesting his economic policies would do better to get a job in a nearby aluminum factory battling to find employees. That prompted the far-left and far-right, who have sought to cast Macron as out of touch with the common man and a president for the rich, to say he had shown  contempt . But Macron told Germany s Der Spiegel:  I am not aloof. When I travel through the country, when I visit a factory, my staff tell me after three hours that I am ruining the schedule.  He added:  When I am with French people, I am not aloof because I belong to them.  Macron said being surrounded by journalists was not akin with being close to the people, adding:  A president should keep the media at arm s length.  He has said he planned a  Jupiterian  presidency - dignified and weighing his pronouncements carefully - a departure from his often-mocked predecessor Francois Hollande s man-of-the-people style. Macron said on Friday in a surprise move that he would give his first long live TV interview on Sunday evening. \"],[\"GENEVA (Reuters) - Russia is committing  grave  human rights violations in Crimea, including its imposition of citizenship and by deporting prisoners, a U.N. human rights report said on Monday.   Grave human rights violations, such as arbitrary arrests and detentions, enforced disappearances, ill-treatment and torture, and at least one extra-judicial execution were documented,  the report said.  Russian authorities did not allow the U.N. investigation to enter Crimean territory.  Russia occupied Crimea in 2014 and replaced Ukrainian laws with Russian laws, but its annexation has never been internationally recognized. The U.N. General Assembly ordered the human rights investigation in December 2016.   Imposing citizenship on the inhabitants of an occupied territory can be equated to compelling them to swear allegiance to a power they may consider as hostile, which is forbidden under the Fourth Geneva Convention,  U.N. human rights chief Zeid Ra ad al Hussein said in a statement.  Russia had also broken international law by transporting detainees and prisoners from Crimea to Russia, the report said. When it occupied Crimea, Russia automatically recognized all Ukrainians on the peninsula as Russian citizens, unless they sent a written rejection. As of May 2015, about 100,000 people, about 4 percent of Crimea s population, did not have Russian citizenship, the report said, citing a Russian official.  About 19,000 people - mainly civil servants wanting to keep their jobs under Russia s de facto rule - were effectively forced to renounce their Ukrainian citizenship, the report said.   Russia says a March 2014 referendum legitimized its  incorporation  of Crimea. Opponents of the referendum have been targeted by laws against terrorism, extremism and separatism, and some have been forcibly interned in psychiatric institutions, the report said.  Many media outlets have been shut down and all Crimea s 22 congregations of Jehovah s Witnesses have been effectively outlawed, the report said.  Education in Ukrainian has almost disappeared and Russia has banned the Mejlis, a body representing Crimean Tatars, whose members have been subjected to intimidation, house searches and detention, the report said. Russia is a veto-wielding member of the U.N. Security Council, which means it can block any attempt to hold it to account.  But Fiona Frazer, head of the U.N. office in Ukraine that produced the report, said it was important to document what was happening in Crimea so that victims could record the human rights violations they were facing and try to ensure justice and accountability. \"],[\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump is likely to rescind an Obama-era policy that protects nearly 600,000 immigrants who entered the country illegally as children and are known as “Dreamers,” according to media reports on Friday. Trump’s decision on whether to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, policy could be announced as early as next week, reported ABC News, citing multiple sources. Attorney General Jeff Sessions discussed the program with senior White House officials on Thursday, according to an administration official. Department of Homeland Security spokesman David Lapan denied reports that the department had made any recommendations on DACA to the White House. “There have been continuing discussions about DACA but nothing has been determined,” Lapan told Reuters. White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters on Friday that the program continues to be under review. A White House spokesperson told Reuters that only Congress can legislate a permanent solution for the plight of children who are currently protected from deportation by DACA. Trump had pledged on the election campaign trail to scrap all of former President Barack Obama’s executive orders on immigration, including DACA. Immigrant advocates reacted to the news with a flurry of statements, promising to defend the program with protest and legal action. “Immigrant youth fought to create the DACA program and we will fight like hell to defend it,” said Greisa Martinez Rosas, Advocacy Director and DACA-beneficiary of United We Dream said in a statement. Civil rights groups said ending the program could increase racial divisions in the country in the wake of the recent violence in Charlottesville. Ten Republican state attorneys general in June urged the Trump administration to rescind the DACA program, while noting that the government did not have to revoke permits that had already been issued. If the federal government did not withdraw DACA by Sept. 5, the attorneys general said they would file a legal challenge to the program in a Texas federal court. The 10 who signed the letter represent Alabama, Arkansas,  Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Nebraska, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and West Virginia. A larger coalition of 26 Republican attorneys general had challenged the Obama-era policy covering illegal immigrant parents, known as DAPA, that had been blocked by the courts before it took effect. The Department of Homeland Security rescinded that policy earlier this year. \"],[\"BELLEVILLE, Ill. (Reuters) - The suspect who opened fire on Republican lawmakers as they played baseball on Wednesday raged against Republican U.S. President Donald Trump on social media and idolized Bernie Sanders, whom he saw as the only politician who understood the working class. Authorities identified the gunman as James Hodgkinson, a 66-year-old home inspector from the St. Louis suburb of Belleville, Illinois. He died from injuries sustained in a shoot-out with Capitol Hill police who were at the scene in Alexandria, Virginia, outside Washington.  Hodgkinson is believed by investigators to have been a person “of strong views,” a senior U.S. official said, without elaborating. The Belleville News-Democrat newspaper posted a photograph of Hodgkinson protesting outside a post office there in 2012, wearing sunglasses and a goatee and holding a homemade placard that read “TAX the Rich.” Hodgkinson was a member of many anti-Republican groups on Facebook including “The Road to Hell Is Paved With Republicans,” “Terminate The Republican Party,” and “Donald Trump is not my President,” his profile showed before it was taken down. Trump won the U.S. presidential election in November. Republicans also control both chambers of Congress. “Trump is a Traitor. Trump Has Destroyed Our Democracy. It’s Time to Destroy Trump & Co.” Hodgkinson wrote in a March 22 post. His profile picture was a U.S. flag with the slogan: “Democratic Socialism explained in 3 words: ‘We the People.’” Hodgkinson went to Washington several weeks ago to protest against Trump’s election, his brother told the New York Times. The former mayor of Alexandria, Bill Euille, said he talked with the suspect at the local YMCA most mornings for more than a month, and even tried to help find Hodgkinson a job after seeing he was living out of a gym bag, the Washington Post said. Stephen Brennwald, an Alexandria attorney, also saw Hodgkinson at the YMCA wearing long pants rather than gym attire, and said he often seemed to be staring into space. “It’s just very freaky to think that this guy who was just sitting in there for weeks, not really doing anything, actually turned out to shoot at people,” Brennwald told Reuters.  Hodgkinson’s Facebook profile featured a cover photo of Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont who ran unsuccessfully to be the Democratic Party’s presidential candidate last year.  Sanders, an independent who ran as a progressive populist but was defeated by Hillary Clinton, said the suspect had “apparently volunteered” on his campaign. In a statement, Sanders condemned the shooting as a despicable act.” One woman who asked not to be named told Reuters that Hodgkinson had contacted her via Facebook as part of a political discussion, but that he subsequently commented on her page that Clinton was a “liar” and a “baby killer.” “I actually blocked him at one point,” the woman said. A bartender at the Pork Barrel BBQ in Alexandria said Hodgkinson started coming in for beers about a month ago.   “He was a regular-looking guy that kind of gave you a sense of the creeps, but you can’t really put your finger on it,” said Christina Shrimshaw, 27, who served him a handful of times but never remembered him discussing politics. “He would talk about very mundane things, like golf. He was big into watching the Golf Channel.”   A neighbor in Belleville, William Schaumleffel, recalled how in March he heard gunshots and saw Hodgkinson shooting with a long gun toward woods across a corn field from his yard.  “I yelled at him: ‘Hey, stop shooting over there. There are houses over there,’” Schaumleffel said. Hodgkinson did not stop, he added, so he filed a report with the sheriff’s office. Hodgkinson’s criminal history included a 2006 arrest on battery charges that were later dismissed, as well as multiple traffic violations, according to state records that identified him as a 5-foot, 6-inch (1.67-metre) man weighing 190 pounds (86 kg), with brown eyes. Most of the infractions were ultimately dropped. Hodgkinson had been licensed as a home inspector and real estate appraiser, but did not renew his home inspector license after it expired last year, state records showed. His license to appraise real estate expired in 1997. According to Facebook, Hodgkinson went to Belleville Township High School West and studied flight training at Southwestern Illinois College. Beginning in mid-2015, Hodgkinson began expressing support for Sanders’ 2016 campaign, and federal records showed he donated $18 to the effort. “Bernie is the Only Candidate in Decades that Really Cares about the Working Class,” Hodgkinson posted on June 13, 2016. The Belleville News-Democrat published letters he wrote the paper criticizing Republicans, tax policies and income inequality. One from August 2012 read: “I have never said ‘life sucks,’ only the policies of the Republicans.” \"],[\"PARIS (Reuters) - A large majority of people in France believe President Emmanuel Macron s tax policies favor the rich, a poll showed on Thursday, days after he angered unions with disparaging remarks about protesters. Eighty-two percent of respondents in the Odoxa poll thought Macron s tax policies - including a scaling-back of a long-standing wealth tax - catered mainly to the richest. Three in four said the policy helped heads of large businesses and fewer than one in three believed Macron s tax stance was favorable for low-income workers and pensioners. This month, Macron made good on a pledge to scale back the wealth tax, long a tool for social justice for left-wingers but blamed by others for driving millionaires abroad. He is scrapping the tax on all but property holdings, a move that critics said was a get-out for owners of yachts and private jets, while reducing housing subsidies for the poor. The 39-year-old leader, who argues that the left- and right-wing politics are an anachronism, is struggling to shake off the elitist image of his years as a Rothschild banker. He has argued that the economy, which has suffered from chronic unemployment and sluggish growth for years, needs entrepreneurship, foreign investment and rewards for risk-taking. But he was criticized after complaining about  lazy  elements of society and saying that people who clashed with police during a protest at a car parts plant should seek work elsewhere. Macron s approval ratings have tumbled since his election in May, dragged down by labor reforms, budget cuts, and the decrease in housing subsidies.  An Ifop poll in late September showed some respite with a  dissatisfaction  rating of 53 percent down from 57 percent in August. An August Harris Interactive poll showed 46 percent trusted Macron s political leadership, 13 points off his mid-June high - making him the most unpopular French president in the first 100 days in office in decades. Macron hopes to weather further protests as his government unfurls more reforms aimed at making hiring and firing easier.  Some unions say that will undermine labor protections. On Thursday, protesters put on a show of force near a meeting of human resources executives on the western edge of Paris. Police arrested 41 people at the protest in which several executives  cars were torched.

Trump s address to South Korea s National Assembly will come a day after he seemed to take a more balanced approach: threatening to use America s full military might against North Korea if needed, but also offering it a diplomatic opening to  make a deal  to end the nuclear standoff. While Trump presented no specific solution to his toughest global security challenge, his more conciliatory rhetoric toward North Korea could help lower tensions between Washington and Pyongyang that have put much of the east Asian region on edge over the prospects for military conflict. It contrasted markedly with Trump s earlier threats to  totally destroy  North Korea if it threatened the United States, and the personal insults he exchanged with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. It remains to be seen, however, whether the unpredictable Trump, in his final day on North Korea s doorstep, will build  on this approach or return to the bellicose language that has characterized his handling of the North Korean issue. Trump s official  talking points  for his Asia tour show that he intends to use the speech in part to contrast South Korea s  amazing rise  with North Korea s  sad, backward  state  and to urge resolve against Pyongyang, according to a confidential document reviewed by Reuters. He is also expected to condemn Pyongyang for its poor human rights record. Trump will then fly to Beijing where, according to senior administration officials, he will try to convince Xi to squeeze North Korea further with steps such as limits on oil exports, coal imports and financial transactions. Previewing his Beijing visit, Trump told a news conference in Seoul on Tuesday that China and North Korea s other giant neighbor, Russia, were among countries whose cooperation will be  crucial in getting North Korea to rein in its nuclear and missile programs.  President Xi   has been very helpful. We ll find out how helpful soon,  Trump said. But it is far from clear if Xi, who has just consolidated his power at a Communist Party congress, will agree to do more. China says its leverage over Pyongyang is exaggerated by the West, and points to its support in the U.N. Security Council for recent sanctions on North Korea as evidence that it is doing all it can to curtail the isolated nation s nuclear and missile tests.  On this issue, China s position and stance is already very clear and staunch,  Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said on Monday.  Everyone can see clearly that we don t need anybody to tell us what we should be doing.  But with Trump appearing to crack open the  door to diplomacy with North Korea   something that China has long urged   he may have a better chance of securing further promises to intensify economic pressure on North Korea, which relies on Beijing for more than 90 percent of its trade. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, however, has seemed willing to risk snubbing China when he deems it useful as he pursues development of a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland. At the same time, Xi may be mindful that Trump has held off on trade actions against China that he loudly threatened during the 2016 presidential campaign to give Beijing more time to make progress on North Korea. For his part, Xi will also be looking to maintain the good personal chemistry the two leaders developed when Trump hosted him at the Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida in April. The  bromance  is set to continue when Xi returns the favor by laying on a lavish welcome for Trump s visit starting on Wednesday. Trump is expected to go to the Forbidden City, possibly guided by Xi, and participate in an inspection of Chinese troops, though China has released few other details. \"],[\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican U.S. Senator Mike Enzi introduced on Tuesday a resolution allowing for the repeal of President Barack Obama’s signature health insurance program, which provides coverage to millions of Americans, Enzi’s office said in a statement. The move by the Senate’s budget committee chairman on the first day of the new Congress set in motion the Republican majority’s promise to repeal the 2010 Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, as its first major legislative item. Republicans have said the repeal process could take months and that developing replacement health insurance plans could take years. More than 20 million previously uninsured Americans gained health coverage through Obamacare. Coverage was extended by expanding the Medicaid program for the poor and through online exchanges where consumers can receive income-based subsidies. Republicans have launched repeated courtroom and legislative efforts to dismantle the law, criticizing it as government overreach. Democrats have scoffed at Republicans’ plans, accusing them of never having united around a replacement strategy.  The Republicans are using a budget resolution to provide for Obamacare’s repeal, allowing them to act without any Democratic votes. Budget resolutions require a simple majority to pass in the Senate, instead of the 60 votes normally required to clear procedural hurdles. There are 52 Republicans in the 100-seat chamber.  The budget resolution contains so-called reconciliation instructions, directing committees to dismantle Obamacare as part of reconciling taxes and spending with the budget blueprint - and to report back to the budget committee by Jan. 27. A Senate vote on the resolution could come next week, with action in the House of Representatives expected to follow. But the repeal process won’t be complete until the committees finish the reconciliation procedure and votes are taken on their work. “These instructions to committees are provided to facilitate immediate action on repeal, with the intent of sending legislation to the new president’s desk as soon as possible,” the statement from Enzi’s office said. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump repeatedly vowed during last year’s presidential campaign to repeal Obamacare. \"],[\"WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand s new government plans to review and reform the Central Bank Act to possibly include employment, alongside inflation, as a dual target, Labour Prime Minister-elect Jacinda Ardern said on Tuesday. The populist New Zealand First, the junior partner in the new Labour-led coalition government, also wants to broaden the central bank s focus to include greater management of the local dollar s value against other currencies.  We have been looking at changing the objectives set out in the Reserve Bank Act,  Ardern told reporters in Wellington.  The objectives of the Act to possibly include employment is certainly part of our plans.  Labour flagged the monetary policy changes during its election campaign. New Zealand First has previously mentioned it would like the central bank to better manage the currency, without elaborating.  The New Zealand dollar suffered fresh falls on Tuesday as Ardern and New Zealand First leader Winston Peters confirmed their policy priorities. The kiwi dollar shed all its early gains to push below $0.6940, having briefly been as high as $0.7003 at one point. Rather than just focussing on inflation, Labour wants the Reserve Bank to have a full employment goal when devising policy settings, bringing it into line with the United States and Australia.  While unemployment in New Zealand is at near decade lows of below 5 percent, job growth was a hot political issue during the recent election. The unlikely alliance between the centre-left Labour and populist New Zealand First was brokered after a Sept. 23 election failed to deliver a majority to the governing National or opposition Labour.  Peters has been offered the role of deputy prime minister, which he is likely to accept, and Ardern indicated on Tuesday that Peters would also become foreign minister, putting a protectionist at the forefront of New Zealand s international relations. Peters was foreign minister in a Labour-led government in 2005, during which time he became among a handful of Western politicians to visit North Korea.   The general consensus is that he did a good job,  said Richard Shaw, politics professor at Massey University.  He wasn t particularly interested in restructuring departments. He s very good at working the room and is an affable character.  Labour and New Zealand First share similar policies designed to cut immigration, ban foreigners from buying existing property and raise the minimum wage. Many of the policies draw on voter concerns that immigration and foreign buyers of local homes are putting too much pressure on infrastructure and house prices, representing a shift in New Zealand s formerly open door policy.  Ardern said Labour s immigration policy remained in place, whereby net migration would reduce from by between 20,000 to 30,000. This represents a less dramatic cut than New Zealand First had proposed prior to the election. Net migration is running at just over 70,000 a year. While a  confidence and supply  agreement with the Greens is delivering policies across the political spectrum, such as a push to legalise cannabis for personal use. \"],[\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers, the fourth-ranking Republican in the House of Representatives, on Friday told Fox News Channel that fellow Republican Representative Blake Farenthold should resign if an ethics investigation finds that sexual misconduct accusations against him have merit.  “If these allegations are proven to be true ... I would hope that he would step aside,” said McMorris Rodgers, chair of the House Republican Conference. Farenthold’s office was not immediately available to comment on her remarks. The House Ethics Committee said on Thursday it was investigating Farenthold, 55, over allegations of sexual harassment, discrimination and retaliation involving a former female staff member. It said it was also looking into whether the Corpus Christi, Texas, congressman made inappropriate statements to other members of his staff. Farenthold said on Thursday he was relieved that the ethics panel was going to look into the accusations. “Once all the facts are released, I‘m confident this matter will once and for all be settled and resolved,” he said. Politico reported last week that the congressional Office of Compliance had paid $84,000 from a public fund on behalf of Farenthold for a sexual harassment claim. In 2014, Farenthold’s former communications director Lauren Greene sued him, alleging a hostile work environment, gender discrimination and retaliation, court documents showed. Farenthold and Greene reached a mediated agreement in 2015 to avoid costly litigation, but the settlement’s details were confidential, according to a statement released at the time in which Farenthold denied engaging in any wrongdoing. A number of lawmakers have been accused of sexual misconduct. This week, Democratic Representative John Conyers and Republican Representative Trent Franks resigned, while Democratic Senator Al Franken said he would be stepping down in the coming weeks. \"],[\"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge in New York voiced skepticism on Wednesday over whether groups and individuals should be able to proceed with a lawsuit against President Donald Trump alleging that he violated the U.S. Constitution by accepting foreign payments through his hotels and other businesses. U.S. District Judge George Daniels also questioned government lawyers seeking to have him throw out the suit accusing Trump of running afoul of the Constitution’s “emoluments” clause by maintaining ownership of his business empire while in office. Daniels said he would rule within a month or two on whether he will continue to hear the suit. The emoluments clause, designed to prevent corruption and foreign influence, bars U.S. officials from accepting gifts from foreign governments without congressional approval.  Trump has ceded day-to-day control of his businesses to his sons. Critics have said that is not a sufficient safeguard. During a hearing on the bid to dismiss the case, Daniels suggested the U.S. Congress might be better suited than the courts to resolve the dispute.  “They can make this an issue, but they have not done so,” Daniels said. “Why is it appropriate for the judiciary to have the president fight this out in a street brawl?” The plaintiffs in the lawsuit, filed in January after Trump took office, are the nonprofit watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a hotel owner, a hotel events booker and a restaurant trade group. Daniels, appointed to the bench by Democratic former president Bill Clinton, acknowledged that the case was navigating “uncharted waters.”  If he allows the case to go ahead, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, Joseph Sellers, said they intend to seek further evidence of Trump’s alleged violations of the emoluments clause. In court papers, they said the “full extent of his violations” are not yet known because he has not released his tax returns.   But Daniels raised doubts about whether the plaintiffs are legally entitled to sue. Federal courts usually require plaintiffs to demonstrate they have actually been harmed.  The plaintiffs allege they are injured when foreign governments try to “curry favor” with Trump by favoring his businesses, such as the Trump International Hotel in Washington, or a high-end restaurant at a Trump hotel in New York City, leading to lost patronage, wages and commissions. The emoluments clause was not meant to provide a right to protect individuals from competition, Daniels told another plaintiffs’ lawyer, Deepak Gupta. Gupta urged the judge to reject “the government’s view that the president is above the law.”  In June, the Trump administration asked the court to throw out the case, saying the constitution prohibits gifts and emoluments given to U.S. officials acting in their official capacities only and does not constrain the president’s businesses.  Daniels did not buy that argument. If a foreign government expects favorable action, it might also “buy a million dollars worth of your hot dogs,” he told Brett Shumate, a lawyer for the U.S. Department of Justice. “Just because it’s a business transaction doesn’t necessarily mean it’s not an emolument,” Daniels said. Shumate replied, “The president is engaging in ordinary business transactions, not in exchange for anything.” \"],[\"MAIDUGURI, Nigeria (Reuters) - Nigeria is replacing the military commander of the fight against Boko Haram after half a year, an army spokesman said on Wednesday, following a string of insurgency attacks despite years of official claims the group has almost been defeated.  The shake-up underscores the fragility of the security situation in Nigeria s northeast, where the conflict with the  Islamist insurgent group is now in its ninth year, despite assertions by President Muhammadu Buhari s administration that it is on its last legs. A military spokesman confirmed the replacement of Ibrahim Attahiru, theater commander of the operation against Boko Haram, in a text message to Reuters. Major General Rogers Nicholas will take his position. The spokesman did not provide further details.  Attahiru s removal comes in the wake of a series of  embarrassing  attacks, two military sources told Reuters. They said the conduct of the war against the insurgents is now being reviewed. The attacks, which occurred during Attahiru s command, include the kidnapping of members of an oil prospecting team which led to at least 37 people being killed in July, and  deadly assaults on the towns of Magumeri, Biu and Madagali, the sources said. A spokesman for the president, who serves as Nigeria s commander-in-chief, declined to comment. The governor of Borno state, which is at the epicenter of the insurgency, has said the government s long-term plan now is to corral civilians inside fortified garrison towns -  effectively ceding the countryside to Boko Haram. That plan and the spate of deadly attacks have raised questions about assertions by the government and military that Boko Haram has been all but wiped out, as well as doubts about Nigeria s ability to retain sovereign integrity in the northeast. \"],[\"DHAKA (Reuters) - The U.S. government will constantly monitor its sanctions regime to respond to violence in Myanmar s Rakhine state that has sent hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslim refugees across the border to Bangladesh, a senior U.S. official said on Saturday.  We are constantly evaluating the situation,  Simon Henshaw, Acting Assistant Secretary of State for the Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration, told reporters at a news briefing in Dhaka after visiting camps in Cox s Bazar where hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees are sheltering.  Congress has given us a number of tools we can use,  he said, noting disturbing reports of atrocities in Rakhine state.   We call for a full investigation of these reports, we call for those who committed (the atrocities) to be held accountable,  he said.  It is incredible that only within two months more than 600,000 refugees have taken shelter in a country.  A seven-member delegation led by Henshaw visited Myanmar from Oct. 29 before traveling to Bangladesh on Wednesday. It went to Cox s Bazar on Thursday.  During our meetings with Myanmar government officials we told them that it is their responsibility to return a secure and stable situation in Rakhine state. It is also their responsibility to investigate the reports of atrocities.   The delegation also asked Myanmar to allow Rohingya people back to their land and to rehabilitate the villages that were burned. He said they had been shocked by Rohingya accounts of atrocities, murder and sexual assaults.    The delegation called on the Myanmar government to allow access to press and international organizations so they could see the situation on the ground,  he said. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said the issue has been taken to the highest level of authority in the U.S. government.  The statements related to the situation in Myanmar have been issued from the White House and also from the State Department.  She said the delegation would update U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson before his visit to Myanmar on Nov. 15. Some 2,500 Rohingya refugees crossed into Bangladesh on Friday through two border crossings, a senior security official said on Saturday.  Those refugees are already being sent to different camps under the supervision of Bangladesh Army,  Major Mohammad Iqbal, Deputy Commanding Officer of Bangladesh Border Guard of Cox s Bazar district told Reuters. \"],[\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s watchdog is expanding a review of administrator Scott Pruitt’s frequent travels to his home state Oklahoma to include more recent trips taken on military and charter flights, according to a memo seen on Friday. The Office of Inspector General had been investigating the “frequency, cost and extent” of Pruitt’s travels to Oklahoma through July 31, and will now expand the “active audit” to include all travel, including the use of private and military flights he has taken up to Sept. 30. The expanded review coincides with heightened scrutiny surrounding the travels of President Donald Trump’s cabinet officials with reports that some have spent tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars for non-commercial flights. Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price resigned last week over his use of costly private charter planes for government business. The Interior Department’s own inspector general last week confirmed it also opened an investigation into travels by Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke after receiving numerous complaints about his use of three chartered flights, including one on an aircraft owned by an oil and gas executive. Energy Secretary Rick Perry also used a private charter flight last week, Reuters reported. The flight cost $11,000, according to travel records provided to Reuters by the Department of Energy. The records show that Perry took four non-commercial flights between May and last week totaling nearly $56,000 of taxpayer money. Department spokeswoman Shaylyn Hayes said in a statement on Friday that in the “rare instances where government-owned or chartered aircraft have been used, trips were pre-approved by an Ethics officer within the Office of General Counsel.” Separately, a spokeswoman for the Energy Department’s inspector general office could not confirm nor deny whether it is investigating his travels. In addition to investigating the frequency of Pruitt’s travels, the watchdog is also evaluating whether Pruitt followed EPA travel protocols and whether “EPA’s policies and procedures are sufficiently designed to prevent fraud, waste and abuse with the Administrator’s travel.” Pruitt has taken at least four flights that were either not commercial or military-chartered since mid-February, according to government records. EPA spokeswoman Liz Bowman said the four non-commercial flights had been cleared by EPA lawyers. Pruitt had also traveled to Oklahoma on at least 43 of the 92 days of March, April and May, according to copies of his travel records obtained by the Environmental Integrity Project watchdog and reviewed by Reuters last month, which prompted the initial investigation. \"],[\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly on Monday confirmed a Reuters report that he was considering a proposal to separate women and children who cross the U.S. border with Mexico illegally, a policy shift he said was aimed at deterring people from making a dangerous journey. Kelly was asked in a CNN interview about the proposal, first reported by Reuters on Friday, in which the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) would change U.S. policy and keep parents in custody while putting children in the care of the Health and Human Services Department. “Yes, I am considering - in order to deter more movement along this terribly dangerous network - I am considering exactly that,” Kelly said. “We have tremendous experience in dealing with unaccompanied minors,” he said. “They will be well cared for as we deal with their parents.” The policy change would allow the government to keep parents in custody while they contest deportation or wait for asylum hearings. Children would be put into the “least restrictive setting” until they can be taken into the care of a U.S. relative or state-sponsored guardian, said government officials who were briefed on the proposal. Currently, families contesting deportation or applying for asylum are generally released from detention quickly and allowed to remain in the United States until their cases are resolved. A federal appeals court ruling bars prolonged child detention. “Let me start by saying I would do almost anything to deter the people from Central America from getting on this very, very dangerous network that brings them up through Mexico into the United States,” Kelly said. He said social service organizations have told him that more than 90 percent of the women making the journey from Central America are sexually abused. U.S. Representative Henry Cuellar, a Texas Democrat whose district includes about 200 miles (320 km) of the border with Mexico, slammed the DHS proposal. “Bottom line: separating mothers and children is wrong,” he said in a statement on Friday. “That type of thing is where we depart from border security and get into violating human rights,” he said. About 54,000 children and their guardians were apprehended between Oct. 1, 2016, and Jan. 31, 2017, more than double the number caught over the same period a year earlier. \"],[\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Representative Jim Jordan, a leading House conservative, said on Sunday that fellow conservatives are not discussing replacing Speaker Paul Ryan despite unhappiness with the way Republican leaders handled last week’s debt ceiling increase that included no fiscal reforms. Many Republicans are unhappy with the deal President Donald Trump reached last week with Democratic leaders to raise the government’s debt ceiling and allow it to continue financing federal spending programs until Dec. 8. In an interview with Fox News Sunday, Jordan, a Republican, appeared to cast blame for the debt ceiling hike on party leaders including Ryan, saying they had not provided any “good options” to Trump before he struck a deal with Democrats. “In this situation, he (Trump) wasn’t presented with good options,” said Jordan, co-founder and former chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, the most conservative group in the House. “No one is talking about changing the leadership,” Jordan told Fox. He said a Washington Post story last week that reported that conservatives had met with Ryan to express their dismay about the debt ceiling increase was “hardly news,” because the lawmakers meet with Ryan every week. Rebellious conservatives pushed out Republican John Boehner, Ryan’s predecessor, as speaker in 2015. The new plan also authorized spending $15.25 billion in emergency disaster relief for the victims of hurricanes Harvey and Irma. Ninety House Republicans, including many members of the Freedom Caucus, voted against the measure, which Trump has now signed into law. Conservatives have long called for coupling spending reforms with any measures that raise the U.S. debt ceiling. But the deal did the opposite, raising the ceiling and paying for hurricane relief without spending cuts elsewhere. Republican leaders had urged an 18-month extension of the debt ceiling, but Trump accepted the three-month extension  proposed by Democrats. Jordan said he believed Trump has the same vision and focus as the Freedom Caucus, which was to represent people who felt they had been forgotten by officials in Washington. If conservative options are presented to the president, “I’m confident when that happens, he will pick those options that are conservative,” Jordan said. \"],[\"PALATKA, Fla. (Reuters) - At a town hall in his conservative Florida district this week, U.S. Representative Ted Yoho drew applause for defying his own Republican Party leaders to help derail a healthcare plan that was President Donald Trump’s first major legislative initiative. Far from paying a price back home, as Trump has threatened they would, Yoho and some of the other far-right members of the House Freedom Caucus appear to have support for standing their ground, based on their reception at several town halls during a two-week congressional recess. A handful of House Freedom Caucus lawmakers were facing constituents for the first time since last month’s defeat of Trump’s effort to repeal and replace Obamacare, which was also rejected by some Republican moderates. Many supporters made clear they expect them to work with Trump to make good on campaign promises to reform the nation’s health care system. “I want it done,” said Bob White, 74, after questioning Yoho on the issue during a town hall on Tuesday night in rural Putnam County, Florida. “Wield that big stick.”  The rebellious faction of conservatives in the House of Representatives was instrumental in toppling a plan supported by Trump to rewrite Obamacare, President Barack Obama’s signature healthcare law. Trump has singled out the group for blame. Many caucus members refused to back the Republican leadership’s bill because they considered parts too similar to Obamacare and said it would not have done enough to reduce insurance premiums. At town hall meetings, constituents pressed them to keep working to address problems such as high healthcare costs. The reception for Yoho and other caucus members at home could shape their approach to the Republican president and leadership controlling both chambers of Congress, said Matthew Green, an associate professor of politics at Catholic University of America, who studies congressional parties and leaders. “The Freedom Caucus members are either going to become more recalcitrant because they will be hearing from their constituents ‘good job,’” he said. “Or if they don’t hear that, they might be more willing to compromise.” Michigan Representative Justin Amash landed in the crosshairs of the feud when a White House adviser called on Twitter for Trump supporters to defeat him in a primary. But in the farming and manufacturing area he represents in the southwestern state, home to cereal maker Kellogg Co, the four-term congressman heard cheers in a high school auditorium in Battle Creek, Michigan on Tuesday night, where he held a town hall with about 100 people attending. “If I had to choose between Justin and Trump, I’d go with Justin for sure,” said construction worker Eric Smith, 34, who voted for both, but so far has found Trump lacking conservative principles. “At this point, I’d give Donald Trump a D.”  Retiree Cliff Ward, 72, told Amash that he was pleased with his role in the blocking the legislation, which polls showed to be unpopular and expected to end health coverage for millions. “Now we need you to work with Trump and the other Republicans to get this done,” he added.     Living in Georgetown, Florida, a community so remote that cell phone service is a chief concern, Trump voter Melvin Shebester knew little about the House Freedom Caucus. The faction of small-government conservatives came together in 2015 and since then have been a thorn in the side of more mainstream Republican leadership in the House, including an attempt to push out former Republican House Speaker John Boehner. The 84-year-old Shebester was impressed that his congressman, Yoho, stood up to the president on a bill that he saw as rushed. “It takes a lot of guts to stand up against your party,” said Shebester, attending Yoho’s town hall on Tuesday night at a government center in Palatka, Florida with his son and grandson. “We can’t go up there and tell Trump he’s wrong,” added his son, Steven Shebester, 56, who lives nearby.      Many Republicans have avoided public town halls, often open to anyone interested, since the meetings became a staging ground for liberal protests earlier this year.  But Yoho, a veterinarian first elected in 2012, has held several. His event in Gainesville, a college town, on Monday was crowded by left-leaning activists who at times shouted him down. On Tuesday night in Palatka, a small town in Yoho’s sprawling district in north central Florida lined with oaks and Spanish moss, he took questions from about 100 constituents in a politically mixed crowd. He told reporters his office received some 3,500 calls in the days leading up to the healthcare plan showdown, with only about 215 in support. And a phone survey of constituents found the Republican plan was as unpopular as Obamacare itself. He said constituents gave him a clear message: “Stay the course.” (This version of the story has been refiled to fix dropped letter in seventh paragraph) \"],[\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Republican chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives intelligence committee set off a political firestorm on Wednesday when he said the communications of members of Donald Trump’s transition team were caught up in incidental surveillance targeting foreigners. Representative Devin Nunes said at a news conference that it was possible President Trump’s own communications were also intercepted and disseminated among U.S. intelligence agencies. The White House seized on Nunes’ remarks, which had cited anonymous sources, to bolster Trump’s unproven assertion that former President Barack Obama’s administration spied on the incoming president. Nunes himself said there is no proof of that, as have other lawmakers of both parties and the FBI director. A short while later, Trump spokesman Sean Spicer cited Nunes’ comments at his White House news briefing. “I do think it is a startling revelation, and there’s a lot of questions that need to get asked,” Spicer said. Democrats denounced Nunes’ statements as highly unusual from the chairman of an intelligence committee, with the top Democrat on the committee saying its members had not been informed and implying that Nunes was giving political cover to the president. Intelligence reports about the communications appeared to “unmask” the identity of the Trump associates and the names were widely shared among the agencies, Nunes said. He said it was possible Trump’s own communications were also collected. The National Security Agency routinely collects electronic communications on foreigners through a variety of surveillance tools. But information about Americans is also sometimes incidentally gathered, such as when someone is communicating to a foreign target.  Typically the names of Americans are made anonymous, or masked, in foreign intelligence reports unless an intelligence agency determines the identity of that person is relevant to national security or a criminal investigation. It was unclear why the reports Nunes cited contained unmasked names. A U.S. government source said it was logical, if not normal, that communications from Trump aides would have been incidentally intercepted by U.S. agencies after his election, given that they would have an interest in talking to foreign governments. Trump took office on Jan. 20. Two days ago, the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, James Comey, told a hearing of Nunes’ committee that his agency was conducting a criminal investigation of potential links between Trump associates and Russia’s attempts to influence the 2016 U.S. election to benefit Trump. “I recently confirmed that on numerous occasions the intelligence community ... collected information about U.S. citizens involved in the Trump transition,” said Nunes, who was himself on Trump’s transition team. Nunes said he was referring to intelligence reports of communications collected under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. “I want to be clear, none of this surveillance was related to Russia or the investigation of Russian activities or of the Trump team,” he said. Trump said he felt “somewhat” vindicated by Nunes’ announcement after being briefed by Nunes. FBI head Comey on Monday said that Trump’s claims were groundless. According to Nunes, the conversations in question were collected legally in November, December and January. In an interview with CNN, the committee’s leading Democrat, Adam Schiff said, “The chairman will need to decide whether he is the chairman of an independent investigation into conduct which includes allegations of potential coordination between the Trump campaign and the Russians, or he’s going to act as a surrogate of the White House, because he cannot do both.” Nunes’ remarks appeared tied to a line of questioning from Republicans during Monday’s hearing about the importance of identifying and prosecuting those responsible for intelligence leaks. Republicans have focused much of their discussion of the issue on the release of the names, or “unmasking” of Trump associates in the investigation. Trump fired his former national security adviser, General Mike Flynn, after the revelation that he had spoken to Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak, during the transition - which was leaked to the press after those calls were caught by surveillance intercepts. Nunes appeared to suggest intelligence reports about intercepts other than Flynn’s conversations existed.     Former intelligence officials and Democrats said Nunes’ announcement was highly unusual from the chairman of an intelligence committee. Schiff said he was not consulted by Nunes before his news conference. Nunes’ decision to share the information with the White House before informing the committee was a “profound irregularity,” Schiff said, adding that “a credible investigation cannot be conducted this way.” Schiff said the unmasking of a U.S. person may be appropriate in the context of an investigation. U.S. intelligence agencies have accused Russia of seeking to influence the presidential election in Trump’s favor against Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton by hacking computer systems and spreading disinformation. Russia denies the allegations. Nunes said he was “very concerned” about whether U.S. intelligence agencies were spying on Trump. He briefed Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan before the news conference and went to the White House to share the information. Admiral Mike Rogers, the director of the National Security Agency, was asked by Republicans at Monday’s hearing about the agency’s policies for “unmasking” the names of Americans whose communications were incidentally collected under foreign surveillance programs. Rogers said that 20 NSA employees, including himself, have the authority to unmask the identity of an American’s communications, and that senior officials at the CIA, FBI and Justice Department can make such a request. Asked how many Americans had been unmasked since June 2016, Rogers said he did not know. \"],[\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Representative John Conyers is stepping down as senior Democrat on the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee, while lawmakers investigate allegations of sexual harassment against him, Conyers said in an emailed statement on Sunday.  Conyers said that while he denied the allegations, his presence during a congressional ethics review of the matter was a distraction. “I cannot in good conscience allow these charges to undermine my colleagues in the Democratic Caucus, and my friends on both sides of the aisle in the Judiciary Committee,” Conyers said.  Conyers, 88, from Michigan, is the longest-serving House lawmaker and a founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus. The House Ethics Committee said last week it was investigating allegations of sexual harassment against Conyers, who said his office had resolved a harassment case with a payment but no admission of guilt. The allegations against Conyers came to light as Congress reviews policies on how to handle sexual harassment complaints. They followed a string of such complaints against prominent figures in the U.S. media, Hollywood and politics.  “In this case, I expressly and vehemently denied the allegations made against me and continue to do so,” said Conyers. Twelve women who said they previously worked for Conyers told reporters in a statement on Sunday that he “was a gentleman and never behaved in a sexually inappropriate manner in our presence.” The group said it supported letting the ethics probe run its course. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi called for “zero tolerance” on sexual harassment in a statement released after Conyers’ email. “We are at a watershed moment on this issue, and no matter how great an individual’s legacy, it is not a license for harassment.”   \"],[\"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Illinois must increase payments to Medicaid providers despite an ongoing budget impasse, after a U.S. District Court judge on Wednesday ruled the minimal payments made by the state do not comply with federal consent decrees.  Judge Joan Lefkow ordered renewed negotiations between Illinois and health care advocates for the poor, setting a June 20 deadline to be in “substantial compliance” with the decrees.     Lawyers representing the state’s 3 million Medicaid recipients had asked the judge to give precedence to payments to managed care organizations participating in the state and federal health care program for the poor and disabled over the state fully funding other priorities, including debt service on bonds and pensions.  Lefkow said Illinois Comptroller Susana Mendoza, who pays the state’s bills, has not offered a “lawful basis” for not paying the Medicaid providers the $2 billion they are owed. “Although the court means no disrespect to the comptroller, who faces an unenviable situation, it finds that minimally funding the obligations of the decrees while fully funding other obligations fails to comply not only with the consent decrees, but also with this court’s previous orders,” the judge’s latest order stated. Illinois is limping toward the June 30 end of a second-straight fiscal year without a complete spending plan due to a political stalemate between its Republican governor and Democrats who control the legislature. Lawmakers ended their spring session on May 31 without a fiscal 2018 budget deal, triggering downgrades that pushed Illinois’ credit ratings from S&P and Moody’s Investors Service to a step above junk. As a result of the stalemate, Illinois’ backlog of unpaid bills reached $14.9 billion this week.  Mendoza said the real solution is enacting a budget.  “The lack of a budget for the last two years has created a situation in which we now have more court-ordered and state-mandated payments than we have revenues to cover them,” she said in a statement. Tom Yates, executive director of the Legal Council for Health Justice, who is representing Medicaid recipients in court, said more money is being sought at this time to ensure access to medical care, not an immediate payment in full. “I think the talks will have little different tenor now because the judge makes it pretty clear she expects more money to flow to Medicaid providers,” he said.  The consent decrees, which require the state to continue to make Medicaid payments despite its budget problems, stem from two 1992 cases.  \"],[\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives could vote as soon as next week on legislation to toughen sanctions on North Korea by targeting its shipping industry and companies that do business with the reclusive state, congressional aides said on Thursday. The legislation, approved by the House Foreign Affairs Committee last month, is intended to cut off supplies of cash that help fund North Korea’s nuclear program, and increase pressure to stop human rights abuses such as the use of slave labor, the bill’s sponsor, Foreign Affairs Chairman Ed Royce, said. It also calls on President Donald Trump’s administration to decide whether North Korea is a state sponsor of terrorism. Amid international concern over the escalation of North Korea’s nuclear program, top Trump administration officials held briefings on the issue on Wednesday for the entire U.S. Congress, busing the 100 senators to the White House and meeting with members of the 435-person House at the Capitol complex. As he left the House briefing, Royce said he expected the legislation to move quickly, as part of what he hoped would be a strong international effort to use every method possible to pressure Pyongyang to curb its nuclear ambitions. “In particular, it will focus on financial institutions as well as what you might call ‘slave labor.’ These are cases where the North Koreans send out work crews to do work, and instead of being paid, the money comes back to the North Korean regime, and is spent on their nuclear program,” Royce told reporters. The Trump administration said it wanted to push North Korea into dismantling its nuclear and missile programs through tougher international sanctions and diplomatic pressure, and remained open to negotiations to bring that about. Officials also said on Wednesday they wanted to return the country to the U.S. list of terrorism sponsors. A spokesman for Royce declined to comment on when there might be a vote, referring questions to House leadership, whose aides did not immediately respond to a request to confirm the timing. Trump’s secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, is due to meet with the U.N. Security Council on Friday to press for tougher international sanctions on North Korea. \"],[\" OSLO (Reuters) - A 2015 global pact for fighting climate change will benefit in some ways at least if U.S. President Donald Trump carries out a threat to pull out, backers say, in a shift from gloom about the fate of a deal that took two decades to negotiate.  The Paris Agreement requires consensus for all decisions, meaning the withdrawal of a recalcitrant United States would make it easier for emitters such as China and the European Union to design details of a trillion-dollar shift from fossil fuels.  Trump has called man-made climate change a hoax and made a so-far unfulfilled campaign pledge to “cancel” the agreement, saying he wants to promote the domestic fossil fuel industry.  In a step to undo environmental regulations introduced under former President Barack Obama, Trump will sign an order on Tuesday aimed at making it easier for companies to produce energy in the United States.  “There will be some advantages for other countries and there will also be extraordinary disadvantages,” if the U.S. ends up quitting Paris, said Christiana Figueres, an architect of the agreement who was the U.N.’s climate chief in Paris.  “It’s not a black and white scenario,” she said.  She said the ideal outcome, both for the United States and other nations, was for Washington to stay and make deep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions. There were better investment prospects for renewable energies such as solar power than coal, she added.  The fear has long been that a pullout of the world’s top economy would drain other nations’ willingness to cut greenhouse gas emissions under an agreement ratified by nations as diverse as China, Saudi Arabia and African countries.  But there is an emerging rival view that Paris might be better off.  “The Achilles heel of the Paris Agreement is that it’s built on consensus,” said Johan Rockstrom, director of the Stockholm Resilience Center at Stockholm University.  “It’s very difficult to have a negative giant in the room” able to obstruct all decisions, he said, adding that he had swung in recent weeks to reckon that a U.S. pullout would be better overall from an earlier view that it would be a “big failure”.  The Paris Agreement has few binding obligations. It lets all nations set their own goals for fighting climate change and has no penalties for non-compliance.  Governments have set a 2018 deadline to work out a rule book for the Paris Agreement, filling in details, for instance, of how nations will report and monitor their curbs on emissions.  Maldives Environment Minister Thoriq Ibrahim - chair of the Alliance of Small Island States whose members fear they are at risk from rising sea levels - urged continued U.S. participation in Paris.  “The closer you look at it, the clearer it becomes that it (the Paris Agreement) also promotes important strategic, economic, and security benefits as well,” he said.  Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg also said it would be better for the United States to stay. “But I don’t think that it’s the end of the Paris Agreement if the United States decides to leave,” she said.  Oliver Geden, of the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, disagreed. A U.S. withdrawal would badly undermine the Paris Agreement and any decisions would be largely irrelevant without the world’s biggest economy, he said. “The momentum could fade away pretty soon,” he predicted.  Still, almost 200 nations agreed after Trump’s election in November that the world had an “urgent duty” to combat an “alarming and unprecedented” rate of global warming.  “The pace and scale of change already underway in the global economy is remarkable and irreversible,” said Stephanie Pfeifer, head of the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change, a forum with 18 trillion euros ($20 trillion) in assets under management.  “Renewables have already overtaken coal as a global power source, electric vehicles are the growth segment of the auto industry and jobs are being created very rapidly in clean energy,” she said.  The U.S. target under Paris, set by Obama, is to cut emissions by between 26 and 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025 as part of global efforts to avert more downpours, droughts, heatwaves and floods.  Trump’s pro-coal policies are likely to make U.S. emissions cuts less ambitious.  By staying in the Paris Agreement, Trump would also undermine a demand in its Article 4 that successive national climate plans have to be ever deeper cuts. A U.S. pullout would make it easier for backers to argue that the principle has not been violated.  The Paris Agreement sets an over-riding goal of limiting global warming to “well below” two degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times. The United Nations says that current pledges are insufficient to meet that goal.

Sharif resigned as prime minister in July after the Supreme Court disqualified him for not declaring a source of income. He was also forced to step down as president of PML-N, though he kept control of the party and installed Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, a loyalist, as prime minister. The party s state minister for interior, Talal Chaudhry, said a parliamentary meeting of the ruling party chaired by Abbasi had nominated Sharif as its leader. He said Sharif would be formally re-elected president in a session scheduled for Tuesday.  He will become party president tomorrow, God willing,  Chaudhry said. Hours later, Pakistan s parliament amended a law to enable Sharif to re-take PML-N leadership. The amendment bill was presented by law minister Zahid Hamid and passed by lower house with a majority.   We feel very strongly Nawaz Sharif has to lead our party. He s the symbol of unity in our party,  said Rana Afzal Khan, a PML-N lawmaker. Khan said Sharif was battling to assert  civilian supremacy  and boost democracy in a nation that has been beset by military interference in politics. In protest some opposition lawmakers tore up paper copies of the Election Bill 2017, passed by the Senate last week, that allows Sharif to become the party president again despite his disqualification by the court. But the vote was more of a formality as PML-N has a vast majority.     A previous election bill barred from office someone disqualified under Article 62 and 63 of the Constitution, which was used by the courts to remove Sharif.   You are making a law for one person. You are putting the assembly on stake for one person,  said Sheikh Rashid Ahmed, the leader of Awami Muslim League, a small opposition party. Sharif on Monday appeared before an anti-corruption court and is expected to be indicted next week, along with three of his children.   The veteran leader denies any wrongdoing and has alleged there was a conspiracy against him, with senior PML-N figures pointing fingers at elements of Pakistan s powerful military. The army denies playing a role. Relations between the military and civilian establishment were strained again on Monday when the paramilitary Rangers force, nominally under the control of the interior ministry, barred Interior Minister Ahsan Iqbal from entering the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) courts where Sharif appeared. Iqbal, visibly angry, threatened to resign in protest.  I cannot be a puppet interior minister,  Iqbal said.  I am the interior minister and my subordinate force takes orders from somewhere else.        Two states cannot function in one state,  he said. \"],[\"(Reuters) - The Department of Labor on Wednesday released a long-awaited rule requiring companies to disclose when they seek advice about countering union campaigns, which several business groups vowed to challenge in court. The so-called persuader rule, first proposed in 2011, amends the federal Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act to require detailed reports from employers and their advisers, including the types of consulting or legal services rendered and any fees paid.  For more than 50 years, the reporting law required such disclosure from employers only when their lawyers or consultants interacted directly with workers.  The Department of Labor said in a memo accompanying the rule that workers would be better prepared to make decisions about unionizing if they knew who was behind their employers’ arguments. The rule is backed by major unions, including the Service Employees International Union and the AFL-CIO. Activities covered by the rule include hiring consultants or lawyers to create materials and policies for organizing anti-union campaigns or script managers’ communications with employees. The proposal has come under attack from groups including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers, which say it would stifle employers’ free speech rights to counter union organizing, and the American Bar Association, which says it could interfere with attorney-client privilege. The rule is the latest salvo in the business community’s battle with the Obama administration over labor policy. Business groups compared the proposal with rules adopted last year by the National Labor Relations Board to speed up the union election process, saying both provide little benefit to workers while burdening employers.  Several business groups on Wednesday said they would probably sue over the persuader rule. They said it could discourage some companies from consulting lawyers at all, potentially leading them to commit inadvertent labor violations during union campaigns.  “The DOL must have created this rule with the real intent of assisting organized labor because they are the only ones who stand to gain anything from this,” said Robert Cresanti, president and chief executive officer of the International Franchise Association, one of the groups that says it is considering a court challenge. Pushback was also expected from Republicans in Congress. Representative John Kline of Minnesota, who chairs the House Education and the Workforce Committee, said in a statement on Wednesday that the rule was unfair because it did not impose the same disclosure requirements on unions. \"],[\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan urged President Donald Trump on Friday not to rescind an Obama-era program that protects immigrants who entered the United States illegally as children, as more Republicans lined up against the move. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said Trump will announce on Tuesday whether he will end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program, which protects nearly 800,000 young men and women from deportation. It also makes those covered, so-called Dreamers, eligible for work permits. “We love the ‘Dreamers,’” the Republican president, already facing calls from leading business figures and Democrats to preserve the program, told reporters in the Oval Office, without tipping his hand on the decision. Ryan and Senator Orrin Hatch on Friday joined a small but growing number of lawmakers from the party that controls Congress and the White House to speak out against killing DACA, created in 2012 by Democratic former President Barack Obama and long the target of conservative immigration hard-liners. “I actually don’t think he should do that, and I believe that this is something Congress has to fix,” Ryan said in an interview with WCLO radio in his hometown of Janesville, Wisconsin. Ryan said he believes Obama exceeded his authority in creating DACA by executive order, bypassing Congress, but there now are “people who are in limbo.”  “These are kids who know no other country, who were brought here by their parents and don’t know another home. And so I really do believe that there needs to be a legislative solution. That’s one that we’re working on. And I think we want to give people peace of mind,” Ryan added. Nancy Pelosi, the top House Democrat, said she was “heartened” by Ryan’s comments and asked him to meet with Democratic lawmakers next week to discuss a “comprehensive legislative solution.” Hatch said in a statement rescinding the program would further complicate a U.S. immigration system sorely in need of legislative reform. “Like the president, I’ve long advocated for tougher enforcement of our existing immigration laws. But we also need a workable, permanent solution for individuals who entered our country unlawfully as children through no fault of their own and who have built their lives here. And that solution must come from Congress,” the longest-serving Republican senator added. Tennessee’s Republican attorney general, Herbert Slatery, said his office will not participate in a lawsuit challenging DACA that is expected to be filed by a group of Republican state attorneys general next week, and urged Congress to pursue a legislative fix. “Many of the DACA recipients, some of whose records I reviewed, have outstanding accomplishments and laudable ambitions, which if achieved, will be of great benefit and service to our country,” Slatery wrote in a letter to Tennessee’s two Republican U.S. senators. About 200 Dreamers and their supporters turned out on Friday for a rally in downtown Los Angeles to urge national leaders not to end the program.   Among them was Docnary Reyes, 21, who came to the United States from Guatemala with her parents in 1997 when she was a toddler. Before obtaining DACA in 2014, Reyes had to work under-the-table cleaning apartments, she said. Her work authorization allowed her to obtain a paid internship last year working on a project involving cyanobacteria. The Los Angeles resident will continue her education at the University of California, Davis, to study environmental restoration.  “I feel like I really care about our environment and not enough people do,” Reyes said. Trump made a crackdown on illegal immigrants a centerpiece of his 2016 election campaign and has stepped up deportations since taking office in January. But business leaders say immigrants make important economic contributions and that ending the program would hit economic growth and tax revenue. Leading business figures including Facebook Inc (FB.O) CEO Mark Zuckerberg have rallied in defense of the program and the Dreamers. Congress under presidents of both parties has been unable to pass comprehensive immigration reform. Spokeswoman Sanders said Trump, who previously has called DACA illegal, is not taking the decision lightly.  “The president’s priorities on immigration are to create a system that encourages legal immigration and benefits our economy and American workers,” Sanders told a news briefing. Most of the Dreamer immigrants came from Mexico and other Latin American countries. More than 200,000 live in California, while 100,000 are in Texas. New York, Illinois and Florida also have large numbers. What to do about Dreamers has been actively debated within the White House and Trump administration. One senior administration official described the debate as a “tug of war” between factions in favor and against the move. DACA supporters argue that the people it protects grew up and were educated in the United States and were integrated into American society, with little connection to the countries in which they are citizens. Opponents of the program argue that illegal immigrants take jobs from U.S. citizens.  There are deep divisions in the United States over the fate of roughly 11 million illegal immigrants, most of them Hispanics. Trump as a candidate promised to deport all of them. Undoing DACA could have political consequences for Trump and his fellow Republicans, further alienating Hispanics, a growing voting bloc in the United States. Trump’s pardon for an Arizona sheriff who critics accused of targeting Hispanics, his planned wall along the U.S.-Mexican border and his comments about Mexico sending “rapists” and drug dealers into the United States already had antagonized many Hispanic Americans. \"],[\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - With Stephen Bannon, the worry always was that he could be even more disruptive to President Donald Trump’s White House from outside than he was within. In the hours following his firing on Friday, those fears seemed warranted, as the conservative voices who viewed Bannon as one of their own howled in rage over Trump’s decision to fire his chief strategist. The reaction was most notable from Breitbart News, the hard-right news site that Bannon ran before he joined Trump’s presidential campaign last year. “WAR,” tweeted one of the site’s editors, Joel Pollak, who published a piece questioning whether Trump would now move in a more moderate direction with Bannon out of the White House.  “Steve Bannon personified the Trump agenda,” Pollak wrote. Bannon rejoined Breitbart as executive chairman only hours after his firing was announced. He is now expected to use it as a platform to blast those within the White House - and perhaps Trump himself - when they don’t hew to the fiercely nationalist policies Bannon advocated as an inside adviser. As Trump’s chief strategist, Bannon fought numerous battles with senior Trump aides and top Republicans in Congress over the administration’s policy agenda. Breitbart frequently backed him up, ripping establishment Republicans such as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Speaker of the House of Representatives Paul Ryan, blaming them for obstructing Trump’s agenda. More recently, the site trained its fire on Trump’s national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, after he removed officials who espoused Bannon’s foreign-policy world view. In recent days, Bannon had told friends he is worth tens of millions of dollars, is a worldwide leader in the populist-nationalist movement that propelled Trump to power, and could go back to Breitbart, which he refers to as a “killing machine”, or perhaps other endeavors financed by the family of hedge-fund tycoon Robert Mercer, his longtime ally. “Steve has a powerful voice, and he’s going to keep that voice up,” said Sam Nunberg, a former Trump campaign adviser and Bannon friend. “He’s going to continue to promote policies that got Donald Trump in the White House.” Bannon had clashed with the likes of Gary Cohn, the director of the National Economic Council, and Jared Kushner, a Trump adviser and the president’s son-in-law, both of whom favored more business-friendly, mainstream economic policies on trade, taxes, and other matters. While Bannon’s ouster may mean a short-term win for the relative moderates in the West Wing, those he dubbed the “globalists,” it does not mean that policy battles on national security, immigration and the economy will dissipate. Trump has a shown a proclivity for seeking counsel from former advisers such as Corey Lewandowski and Newt Gingrich and from conservative pundits such as Sean Hannity. The outspoken and provocative Bannon could join their number. And there remain other White House officials sympathetic to Bannon’s world view, such as domestic policy adviser Stephen Miller. Even so, Bannon’s absence will be felt. “Trump is always going to be Trump on immigration, trade, and foreign policy. But Steve was the highest-ranking adviser who shared Trump’s world view. With him gone, there’s not a replacement for that voice in internal debates,” one administration official said. “I think people have always overestimated how influential anyone can be on Trump. But without Steve constantly pushing back on every policy idea coming from the so-called ‘globalists,’ it’s easy to see how they could have a chance to start winning more policy battles.” Mike Cernovich, an alt-right activist and personality, suggested to his more than 300,000 followers on Twitter that Bannon was sacked to ensure that the White House raises troop levels in Afghanistan, which Bannon opposed. “This is a full-on coup now, guys,” Cernovich said in a posted video. Beyond Breitbart and the alt-right, some more traditional conservative groups were also concerned about the implications of Bannon’s departure. Twenty Republican grassroots leaders, including longtime activists Richard Viguerie, Jenny Beth Martin, and Ginni Thomas, wrote to Trump earlier in the week urging him to keep Bannon on. “We will miss Steve Bannon in the White House because he helped President Trump keep many of the promises he made on the campaign trail,” Martin, co-founder of Tea Party Patriots, said in a statement after Bannon’s ouster. But she also reiterated her support for the president, saying “he is his own man.” If Bannon has anything to do with it, he will push to make sure that Trump stays that way.  But some supporters still worried that the radical agenda  Bannon fought for could be at risk. “It’s a sad day for the movement,” Nunberg said. “I think it will end up being a mistake.” (Corrects spelling of name in paragraph 22 to Viguerie.) \"],[\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said on Tuesday he likely will sign an order this week that is expected to allow Americans to buy stripped-down health insurance policies, a step some experts say would further undermine the Obamacare law that Trump opposes. Unable to win passage of legislation to dismantle the 2010 law in a Congress led by his own party, Trump indicated he would take unilateral action. He offered few specifics beyond saying his action would let people cross state lines to obtain “great, competitive healthcare” costing the United States “nothing.” The expected order would allow small businesses and individuals to band together as associations to buy health insurance plans that would be exempt from some Obamacare requirements. These include mandatory coverage for 10 essential health benefits such as maternity and newborn care, prescription drugs and mental health treatment.  It would also expand the amount of time people can use short-term medical insurance plans, which are cheaper than traditional plans but cover a limited set of benefits. People could use those plans for up to a year, compared to three months under current law.  “I’ll also be signing something, probably this week, which is going to go a long way to take care of many of the people that have been so badly hurt on healthcare,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. “With Congress the way it is, I decided to take it upon myself,” Trump added, saying the plan is “largely worked out.” White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said Trump will make his announcement “by the end of Friday.” Trump said his action would let insurers sell across state lines. The association health plans, for instance, could be sold from a state with fewer benefit requirements. Such insurance policies could be cheaper than those that provide the full range of medical coverage required under Obamacare, potentially making them attractive to people in other states. It is unclear when these plans would become available. It is unlikely consumers could sign up for these plans during the 2018 open enrollment period, which begins Nov. 1.  Experts questioned Trump’s authority to issue such an order that would exempt some plans but not others from Obamacare rules rather than pursuing the changes through legislation. The action could open Trump to legal challenges from Democratic state attorneys general, who have said they will sue Trump if he tries to destroy Obamacare. The plans allowed under the order could lure young and healthy people away from the individual insurance markets created by the 2010 Affordable Care Act, dubbed Obamacare. That could further destabilize those markets, where insurers have already exited the markets altogether, pared back offerings or hiked premiums because of uncertainty caused by the Trump administration.  Experts said Trump’s plan could leave behind only the sickest people in the Obamacare markets, raising premiums and effectively eroding the law’s protection that people with pre-existing medical conditions cannot be charged more. “There’s a general belief that at every turn the federal government is going to create regulations to hurt rather than help the markets,” said Craig Garthwaite, director of the healthcare program at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management, referring to the Trump administration.  “It unwinds the ability of people with pre-existing conditions to get insurance under the ACA,” Garthwaite said. Republicans have failed to make good on their seven-year promise to repeal and replace Obamacare, the signature domestic policy achievement of Trump’s Democratic predecessor Barack Obama. Gutting Obamacare was a top Trump campaign promise. Trump, who has called the law a failure and vowed to let it “implode,” has undermined Obamacare through regulatory and administrative actions. Last week, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services issued a rule that will let businesses and non-profit organizations lodge religious or moral objections to obtain an exemption from the law’s mandate that employers provide birth control for women in health insurance with no co-payment. Trump has declined to commit to making payments guaranteed to insurers under Obamacare. The payments are estimated to be about $7 billion this year and help lower out-of-pocket medical costs for low-income consumers. Insurers have cited that uncertainty in exiting insurance markets or hiking premiums.  His administration has slashed the Obamacare advertising budget, halved the open enrollment period and cut funding to groups that help sign people up for insurance under the law. \"],[\"CHICAGO (Reuters) - A young Singaporean blogger who says he was persecuted for his political opinions in the Southeast Asian country was released on Tuesday from U.S. detention in Chicago after a federal immigration panel ruled in his favor.     The federal Board of Immigration Appeals upheld a March decision by a Chicago immigration judge granting asylum to Amos Yee, 18, who had been jailed twice in Singapore for social media postings critical of government officials, his attorneys said on Tuesday.  Now I can criticize the Singapore government without being sent to prison,  Yee told Reuters after his release.  Yee s trials in Singapore were closely watched by rights groups and the United Nations, and fueled debate in Singapore over censorship, the limits of free speech and political correctness. Yee had been in U.S. immigration detention since December 2016 when he arrived seeking asylum, according to Yee s attorney  Sandra Grossman. The court made its ruling on Sept. 21, but Grossman said she only learned of the outcome this week. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which opposed Yee s asylum application and argued the Singapore government had legitimately prosecuted him, could not be immediately reached.  The department could appeal the ruling to a circuit court but Grossman said she believed it was unlikely. Chicago immigration Judge Samuel Cole found Yee s prosecution, detention and treatment by Singapore authorities  constitute(s) persecution on account of Yee s political opinions.  Officials at Singapore s embassy in Washington could not be immediately reached for comment Tuesday. In March, the country s Ministry of Home Affairs issued a statement in which it quoted Yee s remarks against Muslims and Christians and noted Yee had pleaded guilty to charges against him. In September last year, Yee pleaded guilty to six charges of deliberately posting comments on the internet - in videos, blog posts and a picture - that were critical of Christianity and Islam. He was sentenced to six weeks in jail. In 2015, Yee was convicted on charges of harassment and insulting a religious group over comments he made about former premier Lee Kuan Yew and Christians soon after Lee s death. His sentence at the time amounted to four weeks in jail. The case now goes back to a Chicago immigration court to complete any security investigations or exams as part of the asylum process. \"],[\"BENGHAZI, Libya (Reuters) - Two months after the dominant military force in eastern Libya declared victory in a campaign to retake Benghazi, Hassan al-Zawy is living rough in his home in the district that witnessed the city s last major battle. Like many other residents, he ventured back as Khalifa Haftar s Libyan National Army gradually wrested back control from Islamist militants and other rebel groups. Parts of Libya s second city were reduced to rubble during more than three years of fighting and, with economic crisis and political turmoil gripping the country, rebuilding is a daunting challenge.  There are flies, mosquitoes and garbage. At night, we have absolutely nothing,  Zawy told Reuters in mid-August in the seafront neighborhood of Sabri.  We ve been here for one month and 10 days and all we want from the state is (this): electricity and water, and for people to return to their homes, and stay there.  A conflict that developed after strongman Muammar Gaddafi was toppled in an uprising six years ago has yet to be resolved. Benghazi, where the 2011 revolution started, has seen some of the worst violence. Tens of thousands of residents, many opposed to Haftar, were displaced to other Libyan cities. Sabri is where Haftar s rivals had their final strongholds, and was bombarded by LNA heavy artillery and air strikes up until a few weeks ago. Sporadic fighting continued after Haftar announced victory on July 5.. People recover what they can from the rubble of ruined buildings. Children help with the cleanup.  Afterwards, men sit outside drinking tea or coffee and guarding their streets. One says he will stay in his home even if he has to hang towels over the doors and windows.  Another Sabri resident, Farag Mahmoud, said some people were so keen to get back to their homes that they were ignoring the risk from land mines still planted in parts of the district.   We found our homes had been flooded from broken pipes in the plumbing systems, and were submerged in water around 70 to 80 centimeters deep,  he said. Some returning residents have formed citizens  committees to lobby the municipal authorities on water, electricity and hygiene, said Milad Fadlallah, a local engineer. Most residents in the less severely damaged eastern part of Sabri would be able to spend the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha, which starts on Sept. 1, back in their neighborhood, Fadlallah said. But a lack of funds and political leadership in a country still divided between two rival governments will hinder reconstruction, said Osama al-Kaza, director of projects at Benghazi s municipality. In Benghazi, the conflict has also had left deep physical and psychological scars.  Achieving an outstanding and modern image for the city will have to be done in stages, will take years and cost billions,  he said.

A bill agreed by U.S. Senate and House leaders foresees fines for companies aiding Russia to build energy export pipelines. EU firms involved in Nord Stream 2, a 9.5 billion euro ($11.1 billion) project to carry Russian gas across the Baltic, are likely to be affected. Both the European Union and the United States imposed broad economic sanctions on Russia’s financial, defense and energy sectors in response to Moscow’s annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and its direct support for separatists in eastern Ukraine. But northern EU states in particular have sought to shield the supplies of Russian gas that they rely on.  Markus Beyrer, director of the EU’s main business lobby, Business Europe, urged Washington to “avoid unilateral actions that would mainly hit the EU, its citizens and its companies”. The Commission, the EU executive, will discuss next steps on Wednesday, a day after the U.S. House of Representatives votes on the legislation, knowing that the U.S. move threatens to reopen divisions over the bloc’s own Russia sanctions. Among the European companies involved in Nord Stream 2 are German oil and gas group Wintershall, German energy trading firm Uniper, Anglo-Dutch Royal Dutch Shell, Austria’s OMV and France’s Engie. The Commission could demand a formal U.S. promise to exclude EU energy companies; use EU laws to block U.S. measures against European entities; or impose outright bans on doing business with certain U.S. companies, an EU official said. But if no such promise is offered, punitive sanctions such as limiting the access of U.S. companies to EU banks require unanimity from the 28 EU member states. Ex-Soviet states such as Poland and the Baltic states are unlikely to vote for retaliation to protect a project they have resisted because it would increase EU dependence on Russian gas. An EU official said most member states saw Nord Stream 2 as “contrary or at least not fully in line with European objectives” of reducing reliance on Russian energy. Britain, one of the United States’ closest allies, is also wary of challenging the U.S. Congress as it prepares to leave the EU and seeks a trade deal with Washington. In fact, the EU’s chief executive, Jean-Claude Juncker, has few tools that do not require unanimous support from the bloc’s 28 governments. The Commission could act alone to file a complaint at the World Trade Organisation. But imposing punitive tariffs on U.S. goods would require detailed proof to be gathered that European companies were being unfairly disadvantaged - a process that would take many months. Diplomatic protests such as cutting EU official visits to Washington are unlikely to have much effect, since requests by EU commissioners for meetings with members of Trump’s administration have gone unanswered, EU aides say. As if to highlight the confusion in the EU’s position, two sources in Brussels told Reuters that Germany was urging the EU to add up to four more Russian nationals and companies to the bloc’s own sanctions blacklist, after evidence emerged that gas turbines built by Germany’s Siemens had been delivered to Crimea in contravention of sanctions. As the EU’s trade with Russia has tumbled, keeping unity to maintain the sanctions has been strained by rival business interests that have been worsened by a perceived lack of U.S. leadership since President Donald Trump entered the White House in January. However, the White House said on Sunday that Trump was open to signing the bill once it is agreed. Meanwhile there is little or no sign that the Western sanctions have had any tangible effect in Ukraine, as the Russian-backed rebellion in the country’s industrial east continues unabated.

The story took the Republican presidential race to a new level of personal rancor and Trump issued a statement saying he was not responsible for it. “I have nothing to do with the National Enquirer and unlike Lyin’ Ted Cruz I do not surround myself with political hacks and henchman and then pretend total innocence,” Trump said. Cruz, a U.S. senator from Texas, addressed the Enquirer story at a news conference in Wisconsin, saying, “Let me be clear. This National Enquirer story is garbage. It is complete and utter lies. It’s tabloid smear and it is a smear that has come from Donald Trump and his henchmen.” Trump’s statement pointed to other articles the Enquirer, a tabloid known for its gossip and unflattering celebrity photos, had been correct about in the past. “Ted Cruz’s problem with the National Enquirer is his and his alone, and while they were right about O.J. Simpson, John Edwards, and many others, I certainly hope they are not right about Lyin’ Ted Cruz,” the billionaire New York developer said. Trump and Cruz have sparred in recent days about their wives as they battle to be the Republican nominee in the Nov. 8 election. Earlier this week Trump accused Cruz of posting a nude photo of Trump’s wife, Melania, on Twitter. Cruz denied having any role in the photo being circulated on the Internet and Trump responded by threatening to “spill the beans” on Cruz’s wife. Cruz said the Enquirer story was evidence that Trump is unfit to be president. “This man would be an embarrassment,” he said. The Enquirer published blurred images of five women with whom it said Cruz has had affairs but did not name them. Two women who appeared to be pictured in the Enquirer stepped forward on Friday and called the article false. The National Enquirer could not immediately be reached for comment on the story. Cruz’ wife, Heidi Cruz, was campaigning with him on Friday and he gave her a hug and kiss before he began a town hall event. She sat off stage smiling while he spoke. This is not the first time a presidential candidate has been accused of extramarital sex. During the 1992 campaign, Gennifer Flowers came forward to detail an affair she had with Bill Clinton. Subsequently, more women admitted to having affairs with him, including then-White House intern Monica Lewinsky. Former Colorado Senator Gary Hart, a Democrat, had his 1988 presidential campaign derailed when reports surfaced that he was having an affair. Former North Carolina Senator John Edwards admitted to having an affair with a campaign photographer during his 2004 campaign, although the public did not learn about the romance until after he was defeated. The Enquirer’s Cruz story exploded on the social media site Twitter overnight on Thursday. By Thursday afternoon, #CruzSexScandal was a worldwide trending topic on Twitter. \"],[\"BOZEMAN, Mont. (Reuters) - A Montana Republican congressman-elect pleaded guilty on Monday to assaulting a reporter and was ordered to perform community service and receive anger management training. Greg Gianforte, a wealthy former technology executive who campaigned on his support for President Donald Trump, attacked a reporter on May 24, the day before he won a special election to fill Montana’s lone seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. Gallatin County Judge Rick West sentenced Gianforte to 40 hours of community service and 20 hours of anger management classes. The judge in Bozeman, Montana, also handed down a six-month deferred jail sentence, allowing Gianforte to avoid time behind bars if he complies with the court’s orders.    Ben Jacobs, a political correspondent for Britain’s Guardian newspaper, said Gianforte “body-slammed” him, breaking his eyeglasses, when the reporter posed a question about healthcare during a campaign event in Bozeman.  The altercation has been portrayed as a sign of the toxicity that has infused American politics. Critics of Trump say his strident criticism of the media has encouraged violence against journalists, while some of the president’s supporters say reporters in general are unfair in their coverage. “This was not a proud moment, but I’m ready to move on and we have a lot of work to do in Washington,” Gianforte, who is expected to be sworn in later this month, said outside court. Last week Gianforte apologized to Jacobs in a letter, and he sent a $50,000 check to the Committee to Protect Journalists. In return, Jacobs pledged not to sue him. “I am confident that he will be a strong advocate for a free press and the First Amendment,” Jacobs said in court on Monday. “And I even hope to be able to finally interview him once he has arrived on Capitol Hill.” Gianforte apologized to Jacobs again in court and said he looked forward to meeting with him later. The judge left open the possibility that Gianforte, after completing his sentence, could have the misdemeanor assault charge formally dismissed, Gallatin County Prosecutor Marty Lambert said by phone. Gianforte initially sought to plead no contest, instead of guilty, but the prosecutor said he insisted on a guilty plea. “This is the type of case where a defendant just needs to admit to the court what he did, to plead guilty, and he did that,” Lambert said. Gianforte on May 25 defeated Democrat Rob Quist to fill the House seat vacated when Trump appointed Ryan Zinke as interior secretary.  \"],[\"LONDON (Reuters) - Donald Trump told Britons on Sunday he supported Brexit, repeating just days before the vote on June 23 that he thinks the UK would be better off outside the European Union. As the campaign to decide Britain’s EU membership restarted after a three-day hiatus following the killing of lawmaker Jo Cox, Trump, the presumptive Republican U.S. presidential candidate, said in a newspaper interview he was backing an “out” vote.  “I would personally be more inclined to leave, for a lot of reasons like having a lot less bureaucracy,” he told the Sunday Times. “But I am not a British citizen. This is just my opinion.” The billionaire businessman also told the newspaper that he would seek to have good relationships internationally if he were elected president in November, including with David Cameron. The British Prime Minister has in the past called Trump’s proposed temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States “divisive, stupid and wrong”.  Trump said in May that Britain would be better off outside the EU because of high levels of migration. The latest opinion polls showed the ‘Remain’ camp recovering some momentum, although the overall picture remains one of an evenly split electorate. Trump, whose mother was Scottish, is due to be in Britain the day after the referendum, when he visits two golf courses he owns in Scotland. Trump also said that if he became president he would try to improve the trade deals the U.S. has with China, and work more closely with Russia and that could include co-operating with Russia in the fight against Islamic State.  \"],[\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A former senior official in the Reagan administration and prominent Republican foreign policy insider told Reuters he provided input for the late-April foreign policy speech by Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. “I was asked to contribute material” for Trump’s April 27 speech at the Center for the National Interest, a Washington, D.C., think tank, said Richard Burt. Burt said he is not part of Trump’s campaign. “But I am happy to talk to people looking for advice on foreign policy issues,” said Burt, a managing director of McLarty Associates, a Washington-based consulting firm co-founded by former President Bill Clinton’s White House chief of staff and counselor Thomas “Mack” McLarty. Burt said he also would be willing to offer foreign policy advice to Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, if she asked for such advice, though he added, “She’s not going to.”Burt is also chairman of Global Zero, an independent group devoted to ridding the world of nuclear weapons. Trump told The New York Times in April that he was not sure it would be “a bad thing” for the United States if Japan had nuclear weapons, and has said the same about South Korea and Saudi Arabia. Burt said the main theme he talked about to Trump was the need for the United States to pursue a “more realist foreign policy,” in which the United States would avoid seeking “regime change” abroad, and instead make protecting the United States and its interests the main policy goal. Trump, who became the Republican’s presumptive nominee last month after the last of his challengers dropped from the party’s race, articulated this theme again in a campaign speech late on Tuesday, as he claimed victory in the last Republican nominating contests. Under Reagan, Burt headed the State Department’s Bureau of Political-Military Affairs and then its European and Canadian Affairs bureau and served as U.S. ambassador to Germany from 1985 to 1989. Some of Burt’s contemporaries from the administrations of Presidents Reagan, George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush, have publicly denounced Trump’s foreign policy views or remained mute. Earlier this year, Trump met with a group of 11 foreign policy advisers, headed by Republican Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, one of Trump’s most outspoken supporters.  Reuters sought comment on the recent activities of Trump’s foreign policy team from several of its members and from a campaign spokeswoman. Most declined to comment, and the campaign did not immediately reply to a request for comment.  One campaign team member, who asked for anonymity because he is not authorized to comment publicly, said that while the team had held several discussions since Trump’s speech, the candidate remains his own most important foreign policy adviser. \"],[\"LAHORE, Pakistan (Reuters) - A Christian man has been sentenced to death on blasphemy charges by a court in eastern Pakistan after a close friend accused him of sharing anti-Islamic material, the defendant s lawyer said on Friday. Blasphemy is a criminal offence in Muslim-majority Pakistan, and insults against the Prophet Mohammad are punishable by death. Most cases are filed against members of minority communities. Nadeem James, 35, was arrested in July 2016, accused by a friend of sharing material ridiculing the Prophet Mohammad on the Whatsapp messaging service. Lawyer Riaz Anjum said his client intended to appeal against the verdict, passed on Thursday by a sessions court in the town of Gujrat. There was widespread outrage across Pakistan last April when student Mashal Khan was beaten to death at his university in Mardan following a dorm debate about religion. Police arrested over 20 students and some faculty members in connection with the killing. Since then, parliament has considered adding safeguards to the blasphemy laws, a groundbreaking move given the emotive nature of the issue. There have been at least 67 murders over unproven allegations of blasphemy since 1990, according to figures from a research center and independent records kept by Reuters. And in 2011, a bodyguard assassinated Punjab provincial governor Salman Taseer after he called for the blasphemy laws to be reformed.  Taseer s killer, executed last year, has been hailed as a martyr by religious hardliners. \"],[\"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The most consequential legal challenge to U.S. President Donald Trump’s travel ban will proceed on two tracks in the next few days: in a U.S. appeals court vote in San Francisco and the Seattle courtroom of a federal judge. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals will vote on whether to reconsider an appeal in the case that was decided in the Seattle court last week. That vote could reveal which judges disagree with their colleagues on the bench and support the arguments behind the new president’s most controversial executive order. In Seattle, the state of Washington will attempt to probe Trump’s motive in drafting the Jan. 27 order. In another case, in Virginia, a federal judge on late Monday halted enforcement of portions of the order against Virginia visa holders or permanent residents, concluding that the travel ban likely violates the U.S. Constitution’s protections for freedom of religion.  The rulings put the order on hold until the courts can rule on the underlying merits. Ultimately, they will have to address questions about the extent of the president’s power on matters of immigration and national security. Traditionally, judges have been extremely cautious about stepping on the executive branch’s authority in such matters, legal experts say. Trump’s directive, which he said was necessary to protect the United States from attacks by Islamist militants, barred people from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen from entering the country for 90 days. Refugees were banned for 120 days, except those from Syria, who were banned indefinitely. The ban was backed by around half of Americans, according to a Reuters\\u002fIpsos poll, but triggered protests across the country and caused chaos at some U.S. and overseas airports.  U.S. District Judge James Robart in Seattle suspended the order nationwide after Washington state challenged its legality, eliciting a barrage of angry Twitter messages from Trump against the judge and the court system. A three-judge panel at the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco upheld the ruling last week, raising questions about Trump’s next step. In the Virginia case, U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema said there was a lack of evidence showing a national security purpose for the executive order and issued a preliminary injunction against parts of it.  While the ruling is not on the underlying merits of the case, Brinkema noted, “The ‘Muslim ban’ was a centerpiece of the president’s campaign for months.”  Legal experts said no other judge has so fully considered the question of whether the order amounted to a discriminatory ban on Muslims. According to Brinkema, “the evidence indicates the government’s purpose was based on religion,” said Nelson Tebbe, a professor at Brooklyn Law School, adding that the ruling could influence other judges’ views on the matter. At a Seattle court hearing on Monday, Robart said he would move forward with discovery in the case, meaning the request and exchange of information pertinent to the case between the opposing parties.  Meanwhile, an unidentified judge on the 9th Circuit last week requested that the court’s 25 full-time judges vote on whether the temporary restraining order Robart imposed on Trump’s travel ban should be reconsidered by an 11-judge panel, known as en banc review. The 9th Circuit asked both sides to file briefs by Thursday. Since judges appointed by Democrats hold an 18-7 edge on the 9th Circuit, legal experts say it is unlikely a majority will disagree with the court’s earlier ruling and want it reconsidered.  Arthur Hellman, a professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law who has studied the 9th Circuit, noted that one of the three judges who issued the original ruling was appointed by President George W. Bush.  Even if the en banc vote fails, however, judges on the 9th Circuit who disagree with last week’s ruling will be able to publicly express their disagreement in court filings, which could help create a record bolstering Trump’s position. Meanwhile, the government has signaled that it is considering issuing a new executive order to replace the original one. In that case, it could tell the 9th Circuit later this week that it does not want en banc review, because the case would be moot. “You would think Jeff Sessions would do whatever he had to do to get this case ended as soon as possible,” Hellman said, referring to the recently appointed U.S. attorney general. \"],[\"MADRID (Reuters) - Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy on Friday ruled out calling a national election after Catalan separatists won a regional vote, thwarting his bid to resolve the country s biggest political crisis in decades.  Rajoy had gambled on unionist parties taking control of Catalonia s regional government, which he sacked in October for illegally pursuing independence from Spain. Rajoy, speaking at a news conference, said he would make an effort to hold talks with the new Catalan government. However, he did not clarify whether he would be willing to meet deposed Catalan President Carles Puigdemont, who is in self-imposed exile in Brussels and whose party retained its position as the largest separatist force. \"],[\"VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis welcomed the poor, homeless and unemployed as guests of honor for a Mass and gourmet meal in the Vatican on Sunday, saying that helping the needy was one way of obtaining a  passport to paradise . Francis celebrated a Mass marking the Roman Catholic Church s first yearly World Day of the Poor, which the pope established to draw the attention of the world s 1.2 billion Catholics to the neediest. Volunteers from charity organizations brought about 7,000 needy people to St Peter s Basilica for a special Mass celebrated by the pope, who has made defense of the poor, immigrants and downtrodden a major plank of his papacy. About 1,500 of them were having lunch with the pope in the Vatican s large audience hall and others were being taken to eat as guests in nearby pontifical colleges. Most of the needy people were from Rome and other parts of Italy but charity groups also brought groups from France, Spain, Germany and Poland.  If in the eyes of the world they (the poor) have little value, they are the ones who open to us the way to heaven; they are our  passport to paradise . For us it is an evangelical duty to care for them ...,  he said in his homily.  God will not ask us if we felt righteous indignation, but whether we did some good,  he said, labeling indifference as a sin of omission. The pope said this  is when we say,  that doesn t concern me; it s not my business, it s society s problem.   It is when we turn away from a brother or sister in need, when we change channels as soon as a disturbing question comes up, when we grow indignant at evil but do nothing about it.  The menu for the poor was selected by Sergio Dussin, the same chef who prepares meals for visiting dignitaries at Vatican conferences. It consisted of dishes the poor can only dream of: mini gnocchi, fish with tomatoes, olives, Venetian cheese, veal with vegetables and Venetian-style tiramisu for dessert. Three days after his election in 2013, Francis said:  Oh, how I would like a poor Church, and for the poor.  He since given up some of the trappings of the papacy, shunning the spacious papal apartments in the Vatican s Apostolic Palace for a modest residence in a guest house.  He also has put aside the papal limousine and is driven around Rome in a simple blue Ford Focus. \"],[\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday declined to hear an appeal by Texas seeking to revive the state’s strict Republican-backed voter-identification requirements that a lower court found had a discriminatory effect on black and Hispanic people. The justices let stand a July 2016 decision by a lower court that found that the 2011 Texas statute ran afoul of a federal law that bars racial discrimination in elections and directed a lower court to find a way to fix the law’s discriminatory effects against minorities. There were no noted dissents from the high court’s decision not to hear the case from any of the eight justices, but Chief Justice John Roberts took the unusual step of issuing a statement explaining why the case was not taken up, noting that litigation on the matter is continuing in lower courts. Roberts said that although there was “no barrier to our review,” all the legal issues can be raised on appeal at a later time.  The law, passed by a Republican-led legislature and signed by a Republican governor, had been considered one of the strictest of its type in the United States. It was challenged in court by the U.S. Justice Department under former President Barack Obama, civil rights groups and individual voters. Critics including the Obama administration had said the Texas law and similar statutes enacted in other Republican-governed states were tailored to make it harder for minorities including black and Hispanic voters, who tend to support Democrats, to cast ballots. Backers of these laws have said they are necessary to prevent voter fraud, despite little evidence of such fraud. The seven types of government-issued identification permitted under the law as proof of identity included a driver’s license, a concealed handgun license, a military ID card and a U.S. passport but not state university ID cards or identification issued to obtain welfare benefits. A special 15-judge panel of the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 9-6 that the Texas law had a discriminatory effect and violated the U.S. Voting Rights Act. The judges were divided differently on other parts of the ruling. The appeals court directed a federal district court to examine claims by the plaintiffs that the law was actually intended to be discriminatory, rather than merely having a discriminatory effect. A hearing on that part of the case was scheduled for Tuesday but has now been delayed following a request from President Donald Trump’s administration. While Obama’s administration had backed the challenge to the Texas requirements, the Trump administration could change course. Republican Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, whose office launched the appeal, said he was disappointed by the court’s action. “Texas enacted a common sense voter ID law to safeguard the integrity of our elections, and we will continue to fight for the law in the district court, the Fifth Circuit, and if necessary, the Supreme Court again,” Paxton said in a statement. Challengers of the Texas law have said that up to 600,000 people would be unable to vote if the law were fully in effect because of the large number of voters who lack the limited types of permissible identification. After the appeals court ruling, Texas and the plaintiffs struck a deal for a short-term remedy to be used for the November 2016 election. The Texas law is one of several passed by Republican legislatures since 2010. A similar law in North Carolina was struck down by a federal appeals court in July 2016. \"],[\"(Reuters) - Republican John Hammond III had made no secret of his distaste for Donald Trump and his desire to halt his march to the party’s presidential nomination, telling the Indianapolis Star newspaper in March that the mogul was “unfit” to lead the country. But the Republican National Committee member, a partner at law firm Ice Miller, said no anti-Trump group ever reached out to him, nor did he see any evidence that such groups were in the state until just a few days before voting in Indiana’s primary election. By the time some direct mail and TV ads popped up, it was “too late” to make a difference, he said. “There was never really any early ‘Stop Trump’ effort in Indiana,” he told Reuters. Trump became the Republican party’s presumptive nominee on Tuesday with his resounding win in Indiana’s primary, which led his main rival U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas to drop out and heaped pressure on distant third-place contender John Kasich, the Ohio governor, to do the same. In the process, Trump dealt a seemingly fatal blow to the high-profile effort known as “Stop Trump” or “Never Trump” launched by conservative Republicans. The movement - led by the conservative anti-tax nonprofit Club for Growth and the Our Principles PAC - for months failed to significantly slow Trump’s momentum and now appears to be on death watch, political operatives and at least three officials involved in the movement say. It emerged over the U.S. winter as initial skepticism over Trump’s chances turned to anxiety among conservatives, who view many of the Manhattan real estate mogul’s policy pledges as a liberal threat to their low-tax, low-spending principles. But from the start it was hobbled by poor coordination, the lack of a single, influential public leader, and the absence of an agreed-upon alternative to Trump, according to leaders in the movement as well as Republican operatives familiar with it. “You have to have a plan of action to deal with him,” said Republican strategist Doug Heye, a Trump opponent who has ties to people in the movement. “And it appears no one really did.” Publicly, leaders in the Stop Trump movement dispute the notion that they were ineffective, saying their efforts in Wisconsin helped head off a Trump win in April. They also say the groups communicate effectively with one another and that they will continue fighting despite the Indiana results. “We will continue to educate voters about Trump until he, or another candidate, wins the support of a majority of delegates to the Convention,” Katie Packer, chair of the Our Principles PAC said in a statement on Tuesday.  But, in private, three top officials associated with the movement conceded that Indiana was a “do or die” moment. The movement suffered a major setback when Republican mega donors declined to play the role of “Trump Slayers.” Both casino magnate Sheldon Adelson and the billionaire industrialist Koch brothers, decided not to repeat their experience in 2012, when they lavished hundreds of millions of dollars on Republican candidates only to see no returns. Deprived of such major financial backers, Club for Growth and Our Principles PAC together spent only $27 million on anti-Trump messaging, according to Federal Election Commission reports. Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton’s campaign and Super PAC have spent at least $78 million so far, according to FEC reports.  The groups and their associates focused their messaging over the winter and spring on television and social media ads and Twitter blasts highlighting Trump’s comments about women being “bimbos,” “dogs” and “fat pigs,” as well as his statements supporting universal health care and higher taxes.  Throughout their campaign, the two groups did not coordinate directly with one another or even converse on a regular basis, according to one Club for Growth official.  It wasn’t until last week that Our Principles PAC and the Stop Trump effort in California, led by political consultant Rob Stutzman, even joined forces. Officials at Club for Growth said they weren’t aware of that California effort.  Some veteran Republican operatives said Our Principles PAC had been a waste of time and money.  “They’ve had no leadership. They’ve spent tens of millions of dollars by now and gotten zero message, zero movement,” said one Republican familiar with the workings of the movement. “The whole thing has been a disaster from the beginning.” Many donors, like Trump’s rival candidates, underestimated the tycoon, believing he would burn out after his early successes, Republican consultants say. Those who did come forward publicly to support the Stop Trump movement, such as Chicago Cubs owners and Our Principles PAC funders Joe and Marlene Ricketts, were swiftly treated to Trump’s social media wrath.  “They better be careful,” Trump said of the Ricketts in a Tweet in February. ”They have a lot to hide!”  By March, other wealthy families who had donated to the cause were asking reporters not to identify them in stories anymore because they didn’t want their spouses and children to face “abuse” from the Trump campaign.  “I don’t think you can underestimate how effective Donald’s bullying has been, even among wealthy donors,” said one top official at Club for Growth. Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski dismissed the notion that donors had been fearful, saying the identity of campaign contributors has long been public information. \"],[\"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian Senator Nick Xenophon, a key independent lawmaker,  said on Friday he was resigning from national politics, potentially complicating Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull s efforts to pass legislation. Turnbull does not have a majority in the Senate and has relied on Xenophon s party, the fourth largest bloc in the upper house, to pass legislation.  Xenophon s replacement will come from his party, which bears his name, but is likely to be a far less experienced compared with Xenophon s nine years as a Senator.  Xenophon was a known quantity, he was experienced and as he saw, Turnbull could work with him,  said Peter Chen, senior lecturer in politics at the University of Sydney.   His potential replacement will be inexperienced, and that can be unpredictable. This will not be Turnbull s preferred choice.   Xenophon s future as a Senator was under a cloud due to him holding possible dual citizenship with Britain. Under the constitution a lawmaker must only hold Australian citizenship to be eligible to be elected to the national parliament. Xenophon had renounced his Greek citizenship, which he received from his mother, but had not been aware he held possible British citizenship. While he was born in Australia, his father was born in Cyprus, which was a British colony until independence in 1960. Xenophon s citizenship issue was due to be determined by Australia s High Court. Australia s High Court will next week rule on the eligibility of seven politicians, including Xenophon and Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce. Should Joyce be ruled ineligible, Turnbull will lose his majority in the lower house. In announcing his surprise resignation, Xenophon said he would stand for election in his home state of South Australia next year. State parliaments do not have the same citizenship rule as the national parliament.  I have increasingly concluded that you can t fix South Australia s problems in Canberra without first fixing our political system at home. South Australia politics is broken and politically bankrupt,  Xenophon told reporters in Adelaide. \"],[\" WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Evangelical Christian leader Jerry Falwell Jr. will head an education reform task force under U.S. President Donald Trump and is keen to cut university regulations, including rules on dealing with campus sexual assault, the school he heads said.  Falwell, the son of the late televangelist Jerry Falwell Sr., was described by Trump as “one of the most respected religious leaders in our nation” last year after Falwell endorsed him during the Republican party primary race.  READ MORE Trump vows end to prohibition on church political activity Vatican worried about Trump immigration order Falwell is president of Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia, which bills itself as the world’s biggest Christian university. A school spokesman, Len Stevens, said on Wednesday it was not clear yet when the task force would start its work.  Stevens said Falwell was interested in eliminating numerous regulations the U.S. Department of Education has placed on colleges and universities, adding that many college presidents felt the same, regardless of their political orientation.  “It’s an autonomy issue for universities to be able to not be micromanaged by the Department of Education,” Stevens said in an email.  Falwell also wants to cut federal rules on investigating and reporting sexual assault under Title IX, the federal law that bars sexual discrimination in education, according to Stevens.  The Liberty University head believes on-campus sexual assault investigations are best left to police and prosecutors, Stevens said.  Falwell told the Associated Press he turned down an offer from Trump to become education secretary, in part because Falwell did not want to move his family to Washington.  When Falwell introduced Trump before a speech he gave at Liberty University early last year, Falwell said he saw similarities between Trump and his father, the founder of the Moral Majority organization, including a penchant to “speak his mind.”  The Senate Education Committee sent Trump’s nomination of Betsy DeVos, a charter school advocate, to be education secretary to the full Senate on Tuesday for a confirmation vote.  \"],[\"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Ride-hailing app Uber [UBER.UL] said on Monday it was joining a global public transport association to improve mobility in the cities it operates in, although North America s largest public transit union said there was no place for the U.S. company. Uber s move to join the International Association of Public Transportation (UITP) is part of a drive by Uber to improve its relationships with local authorities after a series of regulatory and legal setbacks. UITP represents public transport providers around the world, including Transport for London (TfL) - which in September stripped Uber of its operating license. Scandal-hit Uber has just had to reassure authorities it is changing the way it does business after the disclosure of a massive data breach cover-up that has prompted investigations from regulators around the world. Andrew Salzberg, Uber s head of transportation policy and research, said aligning the company with public transport authorities was a good way to make Uber a better partner for cities. Uber, currently valued at $69 billion, has been testing a more collaborative approach to regulators under its new CEO Dara Khosrowshahi in a shift away from a more aggressive culture under former CEO Travis Kalanick.  One of the big emphases that Dara has made ... is that we want to be better partners for the cities we operate in,  Salzberg said. Uber said it would work on a series of training sessions with UITP aimed at connecting people better with public transport. Salzberg said the company also wanted to help reduce congestion on roads by encouraging people to move to shared modes of transport. Alain Flausch, secretary general of UITP, said Uber s decision to join the association was a sign that the company wanted a better relationship with regulators. Flausch said he had told members of UITP that he would check the company stuck to its promises.  It s a work in progress and having Uber join is a good sign. Of course they keep their business model but ... they need to be a bit more flexible and open to talking,  he told Reuters. However, Larry Hanley, president of the Amalgamated Transit Union (ATU), which represents public transit employees in the United States and Canada, said Uber should start being a better partner to the cities it operates in by  paying a living wage to their drivers who call those cities home.   Public transportation should serve the public good, and until Uber demonstrates that they meet that standard they have no business being a part of the International Association of Public Transport,  Hanley said. \"],[\"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The White House said on Tuesday it is trying to persuade Congress not to press ahead with a bill that would allow survivors and families of victims of the Sept. 11 attacks to sue the government of Saudi Arabia for damages, in an apparent effort to avoid having a presidential veto overridden. White House spokesman Josh Earnest, speaking during a press briefing in New York, repeated a promise that President Barack Obama would veto the bill, which has been passed by both houses of Congress, but said there was a push to change legislators’ minds about the law.  “White House officials and other senior officials on the president’s national security team have engaged members of Congress and their staffs in both parties in both houses,” Earnest said. Congressional aides have said the measure appeared to have enough support, two-thirds majorities in both the Senate and the House of Representatives, for lawmakers to override an Obama veto for the first time since he took office in January 2009. The Senate sent the bill to Obama last week, giving him a 10-day window, which ends on Sept. 23, to veto the measure. “We’re going to continue that engagement up to and through the president vetoing this legislation in the hopes that we can find an alternative that preserves the effective response that we’ve already designed to counter state sponsors of terrorism rather than leaving that designation subject to individual decisions by individual judges,” Earnest said.      The bill could lead to U.S. diplomats, service members and companies being taken to court all over the world because it would erode the principle of sovereign immunity, he said. \"],[\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The leaders of the U.S. House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee called on Tuesday for Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to address a joint meeting of Congress during a visit to Washington in June. “Given the depth of our relationship with India across a range of areas - defense, humanitarian and disaster relief, space cooperation, conservation and innovation - we believe this is an ideal opportunity for the Congress to hear directly from the prime minister,” Representatives Ed Royce, the Republican committee chairman, and Eliot Engel, the panel’s ranking Democrat, wrote to House Speaker Paul Ryan. The invitation would be a sharp turnaround for a leader who was once barred from the United States over massacres of Muslims. A spokeswoman for Ryan said she had no announcement at this time about whether Ryan would extend the invitation. Invitations to address the Senate and House are considered a great honor. There have been only two in the past year: Pope Francis, on Sept. 24, and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, on April 29, 2015. When Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party and its allies swept India’s elections in 2014, there initially were questions about whether he would qualify for a visa. President Barack Obama quickly dismissed the issue by inviting him to the White House when he called to congratulate him on his victory. In 2002, when Modi had just become Gujarat’s chief minister, more than 1,000 people, mostly Muslims, were killed in sectarian riots in the state. The administration of President George W. Bush denied Modi a visa in 2005 under a 1998 U.S. law barring entry to foreigners who have committed “particularly severe violations of religious freedom.” Modi denied any wrongdoing. India’s Supreme Court ruled in 2010 he had no case to answer. Washington sees its relationship with India as critical, partly to counterbalance China’s rising power. Obama has called it “one of the defining partnerships of the 21st century.” The letter to Ryan was also signed by Republican Representative George Holding and Democrat Ami Bera, the co-chairmen of the Congress Caucus on India and Indian Americans. \"],[\"BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Dozens of relatives of the 44 crew members of an Argentine submarine that went missing on November 15 marched from a naval base on Sunday, demanding to know what happened and criticizing the government s response to the tragedy. Holding posters with photos of the crew and chanting  Search and Rescue!  the family members walked away from a naval base in Mar del Plata, following a press conference during which the navy said the submarine had still not been located. The disaster has spurred soul searching over the state of the military in Argentina, which now has one of Latin America s smallest defense budgets in relation to economic size after a series of financial crises.   Our disagreement is with the government, not with the navy,  said Marcela Moyano, wife of crew member Hern n Rodr guez, during the protest.  Whoever is responsible needs to be held responsible.  Spokesman Enrique Balbi said on Thursday the navy had abandoned hope of rescuing the crew alive, noting the ARA San Juan had air supplies for a week while 15 days had passed since it last reported its position. Some family members complained they were not advised before the general public of the end of the rescue mission and have also demanded more contact with President Mauricio Macri in Mar del Plata, where the San Juan was scheduled to end its journey.  While local media have speculated Macri will soon declare a period of national mourning for the submarine crew, he has been silent in recent days.  He (Macri) needs to be here because this is the priority, there are 44 families behind this situation and someone has to be in charge,  said Marcela Fern ndez, wife of Alberto S nchez. Macri s defense minister met with families in Mar del Plata on Friday. Balbi said on Saturday an object that was being reviewed by a Russian unmanned remotely operated vehicle in the South Atlantic had turned out not to be the submarine. The government has pledged to continue the search with foreign assistance. The navy said on Nov. 27 that water that entered the submarine s snorkel caused its battery to short-circuit before it went missing. The navy had previously said international organizations detected a noise that could have been the submarine s implosion the same day contact was lost. \"],[\"TALLINN (Reuters) - Ireland dismissed British proposals for the Irish border after Brexit as unconvincing on Friday, a day after the EU chief negotiator said they amounted to a demand the bloc suspend its laws for Britain. But British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, speaking at a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Tallinn, said a solution was  not beyond the wit of man . The border between the Irish Republic and the British province of Northern Ireland is currently open to free flow of goods, being an internal EU frontier. But when Britain leaves the bloc, it will become subject to EU customs regulation.  Establishment of a physical border could revive security concerns, 20 years after a peace deal involving Dublin that ended a long civil conflict in Northern Ireland and led to the end of army and police checkpoints.     Britain has proposed an  invisible border  without border posts or immigration checks between the two after Brexit, but given no firm proposals how the customs frontier between Northern Ireland and the Republic would be monitored. EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said on Thursday British proposals would undermine the bloc s single market. He said Britain in effect wanted the EU to  suspend the application of its laws  as a test case for broader EU-British customs regulations.  This will not happen.  Ireland s Foreign Minister Simon Coveney told Reuters on Friday:  The maintenance of an invisible border on the island of Ireland would be a lot easier if Britain were to remain in the customs union.  That is something Prime Minister Theresa May has said would not happen, though her cabinet is split on the issue and some have floated the idea of a transition period after Brexit that would still leave Britain in the EU customs union.  Britain is the one leaving, they have an obligation to try and design unique solutions.... We cannot have a physical border on the island of Ireland again that creates barriers between communities,  Coveney said.  We cannot and will not support that and nor will the European Union,  he said, adding that Britons wanted to avoid a hard border too.  The problem is that the solutions to actually get us there so far haven t been convincing.  Negotiations to extricate Britain from the EU have seen a slow start and Brussels has repeatedly warned that time is running out to answer complex questions before Britain is due to leave in March, 2019. The bloc, which will have 27 member states after Brexit, wants to solve key exit issues before opening talks about any future trade cooperation with Britain. London says divorce talks should run in parallel with discussions about future ties.  But, with slow progress on agreeing Britain s divorce bill, ensuring expatriates  rights and deciding on the Irish border, the EU now doubts it will give a green light in October for starting talks about the post-Brexit order, as had been planned.  The EU worries London may try to use the Irish border as a template for a broader trade pact with the EU after Brexit. It believes Britain s proposals risk affecting the bloc s single market and customs union. The European Parliament s chief Brexit speaker, Guy Verhofstadt, dismissed Britain s plans for an  invisible border  as surreal.  We are nowhere on border issues,  one senior EU official said. But, asked if he was confident that Britain would get a deal with the EU, Johnson said in Tallinn:  Absolutely, with rock solid confidence.  He reiterated London s stance that the divorce talks should run together with discussion about the post-Brexit relationship.   Article 50 makes it very clear that the discussion about the exit of a country must be taken in context with discussion of the future arrangements. And that s what we re going to do,  he said. \"],[\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - For months Republican presidential candidates traded insults such as “dummy,” “jerk” and “loser.” Then, party front-runner Donald Trump repeated a supporter’s description of Ted Cruz as a “pussy.” With the contest for the party’s nomination moving into South Carolina and the stakes rising, it is possible the most disparaging discourse of the Nov. 8 election campaign is yet to come.  The epithets may be characteristic of schoolyard bullies, but there is some evidence that candidates are reveling in the attention they draw. The harshest attacks elicit the biggest responses at rallies, on the Internet and on cable TV. Trump, the billionaire former reality TV star, sent a New Hampshire rally into a frenzy on Monday when he repeated the term “pussy” shouted by a person in the crowd, effectively questioning Cruz’s manliness. Trump went on to win the state’s primary the next day, ahead of the third-place Cruz by a 3-to-1 margin. “It’s one of the reasons I won. You have to be yourself,” Trump said in a television interview on NBC’s Today show. Trump later promised to clean up his foul language and to be more presidential.   History suggests the language could turn even more coarse in the run-up to next Saturday’s Republican nominating contest in South Carolina. It was there that U.S. Senator John McCain of Arizona was accused in 2000 of fathering an illegitimate African-American child, and former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney in 2008 of supporting polygamy.  “These adults are acting like elementary children,”  Leslie McRobbie, a former fifth-grade schoolteacher from New Hampshire, said of this year’s Republican contenders.   President Barack Obama, a Democrat, this week spoke of the snark that characterized a Republican race of the past when he recalled that Ronald Reagan was described by rivals as an “unshapely man” and a “yahoo” before his election as president in 1980. Coming off the first nominating contests in Iowa and New Hampshire, the seven remaining candidates for the Republican nomination are under pressure either to break away from the crowd or prevent others from doing so.  Insults can foster that. Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, mocked more than once by Trump as a “low-energy” candidate, has since retaliated by tweeting that Trump was “not just a loser,” but also a “liar and a whiner.” The put-down was re-tweeted nearly 3,000 times and “liked” by more than 4,000 users.   Cruz, responding to Trump’s decision to skip a Fox News-hosted Republican debate, branded his rival “Ducking Donald” and sponsored a special edition filter on picture-sharing app Snapchat that featured a blond-haired duck with an exaggerated pout meant to represent the real-estate mogul. “When we create so much of the modern campaign around the characters that are running, and not on the subjects, the natural byproduct of that is calling people names,” said political scientist Michael Artime. Artime said that while bickering and name-calling have always existed in elections, this cycle has seen a notable uptick in the negative. “In the past, if somebody would’ve said what Trump said the other night, that would have been a very damaging thing to their campaign,” Artime said. “The kind of politics we get is kind of the politics we deserve,” he said.  While many have gleefully or indifferently watched as candidates hurled barb after barb, others have condemned it. “Bullying can be highly instrumental and used for social climbing,” said Bob Faris, associate professor of sociology at University of California-Davis, who studies aggressive behavior in adolescents. “And it works,” he said, “provided that kids target the right kids.” For Trump, perhaps the most blustery of the candidates, the target is constantly changing, his numbers remaining constant in the opinion polls while he assails rivals for being “stupid,” “weak” and “pathetic.” “He does look like a bully,” Faris said. “Donald is a whole new development. I can’t think of a candidate like him.” Presidential historian Mike Purdy, however, cites a precedent in the late Republican President Theodore Roosevelt. “Roosevelt loved more than anything else to be the center of attention, and he had a huge, huge ego,” Purdy said. “They both have a certain amount of ego. They both have trouble controlling their mouths,” Purdy said, likening Roosevelt to Trump. Purdy said Roosevelt called his onetime ally William Howard Taft a “fathead” during the 1912 presidential campaign, and went on to say then-rival Taft, seeking re-election at the time, had the “brains of a guinea pig.” Neither won the race. Purdy noted the attacks also came at the expense of substantive political discourse.  “They’re incredibly personal attacks, and they’re not just attacks just on somebody’s position, they’re attacks about personal characteristics,” he said. “That is part of the civility I think we need to recapture.” On Friday, Trump suggested he agreed. “I do this for effect,” Trump said of his foul language in an interview with WOR Radio in New York. “As we get closer, you will be shocked at how presidential I will be. You will be very proud of me.”  (Editing by Richard Valdmanis and Howard Goller) SAP is the sponsor of this content.

Sessions has retained Washington-based lawyer Charles Cooper, whom spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores described as a long-time friend of the former senator.  She did not say when Cooper was hired or whether he would be Sessions’ defense lawyer in the federal probe into alleged Russian interference in last year’s presidential election and possible collusion by Trump’s campaign team. Cooper was present at Sessions’ confirmation hearing and again when he testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee earlier this month. Sessions recused himself from the Russia investigation in early March, shortly after news reports surfaced of his previously undisclosed contacts with Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak. He has since come under further scrutiny for his role in the  firing of former Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey in May. Comey accused the president of dismissing him to undermine the investigation into ties between the Trump campaign team and Russian officials. During his testimony before the Senate committee, Sessions angrily denied any wrongdoing. Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior adviser Jared Kushner have also hired attorneys as special counsel Robert Mueller, appointed after Comey’s dismissal, leads the Russia investigation. \"],[\"NEW YORK (Reuters) - From plush penthouse apartments on the Upper East Side to bars in midtown Manhattan, New York’s financial community watched in stunned dismay on Wednesday as Republican Donald Trump clinched the White House. An early party mood quickly soured as donors and supporters of Hillary Clinton realized that the Democratic candidate, Wall Street’s preferred choice because she represented the status quo, had lost. Many were stuck for words. “Not really much to say,” said Marc Lasry, a billionaire credit investor. Trump’s unpredictable pronouncements and opposition to free-trade agreements have made the real estate mogul unpopular with many financiers, who fear that he could disrupt global trade and damage geopolitical relationships. The U.S. dollar sank and stocks plummeted as investors fled risky assets. S&P 500 index futures crashed. Joseph Peiffer, a lawyer who has represented investors and others in class-action lawsuits, cracked open a third bottle of wine, his “only in the case of an emergency” bottle, while watching the returns during an election night party he hosted for about 20 friends and family members in his hometown of New Orleans. “This seems like enough of an emergency to break it open,” he said. Trump’s pronouncements on the financial sector have perplexed Wall Street. On the one hand, he has pledged to dismantle much of the regulation put in place after the financial crisis, known as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law. On the other hand, he has called for a “21st century” version of the 1933 Glass-Steagall law that required the separation of commercial and investment banking. Trump has not said what that version would entail other than saying that he would prioritize “helping African-American businesses get the credit they need.”  “Sometimes you hear him on the stump criticizing the banks,” Peiffer said. “Then his policy paper says he wants to deregulate the bank. The two things don’t jive. But who knows what he really thinks. And we won’t know that until he does it.” For Trump supporters who work on Wall Street, his victory is a vindication. “I’m very happy,” said Matthew Tyrmand, a private investor and contributor to the Breitbart News website, who was attending a Young Republicans party at a bar off Madison Avenue. Tyrmand, who had shorted stocks ahead of the election - a bet that stock prices will fall - said he had been called “delusional” for predicting a Trump win. Tyrmand said Trump would be good news for markets because he understands the benefit of letting businesses fail. He predicted equity markets would go through a prolonged correction before recovering. “We will be healthier long term,” he said. Around Tyrmand, other Trump supporters hugged one another, sang “God Bless America”, clinked glasses and called out “M-A-G-A!” - the acronym for Trump’s campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again.”  But in one corner of the bar, a man and a woman downed shots before starting on fresh pints of beer. Asked if the drinks were out of celebration or depression, the response was quick: “Depression,” the man said, declining to give his name. “But either way we drink” Matthew Farley, a lawyer with Drinker Biddle & Reath LLP in New York, said he had been warning friends and colleagues about an electoral upset for months.  “I told them that ... a significant portion of the country wanted someone to do a cannonball into the pool and mess up the status quo,” said Farley, who advises Wall Street brokerages on regulation and arbitration issues. “The cannonball party is not united. They’re progressives and conservatives, but they’re fed up with the status quo and all they know is that anything is better than what we got.” Trump supporter Steven Chiavarone, associate portfolio manager for Federated Global Investment Management Corp, a fund that invests in stocks, bonds and currencies globally, said the market gyrations should not be seen as a harbinger of doom. “The world doesn’t end. Assuming capitalism survives, you manage through the volatility and then find the opportunity.” \"],[\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - More than 50 automakers, state transportation agencies and other groups urged the White House and other federal policymakers on Thursday not to open a portion of the wireless spectrum reserved for connected vehicles in the near future. The letter was signed by major auto trade groups representing nearly the entire auto industry, including Toyota Motor Corp, Ford Motor Co, General Motors Co, Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) and Honda Motor Co. It came a week after a cable industry trade group and some tech companies, including Qualcomm Inc, and public interest groups urged the White House to take quick action to open the spectrum to more wireless devices. Automakers and companies seeking to use the 5.9 GHz unlicensed spectrum band for wireless devices have been sparring for several years. In January, U.S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx sent a proposed regulation to the White House that would require all new cars to be equipped with “vehicle-to-vehicle” technology that could eventually prevent up to 80 percent of crashes in which alcohol is not a factor. The proposal will not be final until approved by the White House and opened for public comment. The technology, which involves cars repeatedly sending wireless signals to each other, could help alert drivers if an oncoming vehicle may disregard a traffic light. It can detect threats from hundreds of yards away and indicate whether  vehicles can, for example, pass safely or make a left turn. “One of the most – if not the most – significant advances in vehicle safety is now coming into existence. We urge you to stay the course and complete the action your administration has undertaken to improve the safety of drivers and passengers on America’s roadways,” said the letter, signed by the auto and auto parts trade groups as well as the Michigan, California and Arizona state transportation departments and the National Safety Council and National Sheriffs Association. Automakers say vehicle-to-vehicle technology could also help speed self-driving cars to the roads. Last week in a separate letter to the Obama administration, the National Cable and Telecommunications Association and other groups said the president needs to act quickly because as connected device use “continues to skyrocket, the spectrum resources that power our devices are perilously insufficient.” The groups urged speedy action. “We must act now to find more unlicensed spectrum,” they wrote. Michael Calabrese, director for wireless policy at New America’s Open Technology Institute, said the “auto industry ignores the fact that their unused band has enough spectrum to deploy – and protect – both crash avoidance safety applications and next generation Wi-Fi.” Dave Sullivan, an analyst at AutoPacific, said automakers have a lot at stake and have made significant investments in the technology. “It’s imperative that this spectrum not be encroached on,” he said. In 1999, the Federal Communications Commission allocated 75 megahertz of spectrum in the 5.9 GHz band for highway safety. But critics say the technology has not progressed much beyond the testing phase. FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler, U.S. Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker and Foxx agreed in January to conduct testing on whether the spectrum can be shared with wireless devices. The government officials said it is “imperative to ensure the future automotive safety and efficiency of the traveling public” that testing be completed before they make any decisions on sharing the spectrum. \"],[\"JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesian President Joko Widodo has nominated the chief of staff of the air force to be the new head of the armed forces (TNI), to replace a controversial general who is due to retire in April. Air Chief Marshal Hadi Tjahjanto has close ties to the president and was previously in charge of an air base in the city of Solo, on the island of Java, when Widodo was its mayor. Since then, Tjahjanto has been promoted a number of times including to inspector general of the defense ministry and the president s military secretary.  Marshal Hadi Tjahjanto is considered capable and qualified to become TNI commander,  presidential spokesman Johan Budi told reporters on Monday after confirming the nomination. The proposal had been sent to the parliament, which needs to approve it, he said. Abdul Kharis Almasyhari, chairman of a parliamentary commission with oversight of defense and security, said the commission would do a  fit and proper  assessment of the nomination, which hopefully could be completed by a Dec. 14  recess. The outgoing armed forces chef, General Gatot Nurmantyo, who will step down at the end of his term in April, has often courted controversy over what analysts see as his political ambitions.  He has been accused of whipping up nationalist sentiment by promoting the notion that Indonesia is besieged by  proxy wars  waged by foreign states looking to undermine it. In October, Widodo said the armed forces should stay out of politics and ensure their loyalty was only to the state and the government - a statement many believed referred to Nurmantyo s actions. There has been speculation that Nurmantyo would seek to run for vice president or even president in 2019. Nurmantyo has not confirmed any political ambitions. He told a briefing in October the military was  neutral in practical politics . \"],[\"BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Britain is very close to reaching an agreement with the European Union on how to protect the rights of citizens after it leaves the bloc, British Finance Minister Philip Hammond said on Thursday. The rights of EU citizens in Britain is one of three issues the bloc wants to settle before it begins discussing the future relationship between Britain and the EU.  We have made very good progress. We have a very high degree of alignment. Not yet completely concluded, but we are very close to having agreement on how we are going to protect each other s citizens who are in our countries,  Hammond told a news conference in Budapest after meeting ministers of the Visegrad Group of eastern states.  Our desire and intention is that people who have come to the UK to work and make their lives in the UK should be able to continue to live there, carry on their lives exactly as before. That is our clear and stated intention,  he said. Hammond added however that British nationals who have moved to EU countries should be allowed to do the same.  From a reciprocal basis the objective is to make everything look exactly as it did the day before we left the EU,  he said. Hammond also said talks about Britain s departure from the EU should result in an exit roadmap.  We want to give businesses on both sides of English Channel and both sides of the Irish border the confidence that they will not face a cliff edge when we leave the EU,  he said.  That is why we are proposing a time-limited transition period so that we can provide that certainty that our borders will continue to operate smoothly and that our businesses can continue to supply their customers and our citizens carry on with their day to day lives across continental Europe.  \"],[\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department was “disappointed” India had refused visas to members of a U.S. commission that examines violations of religious freedom around the world, a spokesman said on Monday. The commission, made up mainly of professors and leaders of non-profit groups appointed by the president and members of Congress, had planned to travel to India last week but New Delhi failed to issue them visas. The Indian Embassy said in a statement on its web site that “a foreign entity” like the U.S. commission had no standing to pass judgment on the state of India’s constitutionally protected rights. Robert George, a professor of jurisprudence at Princeton who chairs the commission, said last week it was unfortunate that a secular democracy like India had refused a visit from the panel, which has been permitted in countries such as Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and China, which restrict religious freedoms. State Department spokesman John Kirby said the United States was “disappointed by this news.” “We’re supportive of the commission and the important role they play in reviewing facts and circumstances of violations of religious freedom around the world,” Kirby said. He declined to say whether the State Department had discussed the issue with counterparts in New Delhi. But he did say the United States remained engaged “in a number of discussions” with the government on the issue. The commission said in its 2015 report on religious freedom that incidents of religiously motivated and communal violence had reportedly increased for three consecutive years. It said that despite India’s status as a pluralistic, secular democracy, New Delhi had long struggled to protect minority religious communities or provide justice when crimes occurred, creating a climate of impunity. Non-governmental organizations and religious leaders, including from the Muslim, Christian, and Sikh communities, attributed the initial increase in violence to religiously divisive campaigning in the 2014 general election by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, or BJP, which won the vote. Since the election, religious minorities have been subject to derogatory comments by politicians linked the BJP and numerous violent attacks and forced conversions by Hindu nationalist groups. Despite a much-heralded fresh start in U.S.-India relations under Prime Minister Narendra Modi of the BJP, the United States has run into problems arranging visits by other American officials, including the head of its office to combat human trafficking and its special envoy for gay rights. \"],[\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrat candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders each picked up primary wins on Tuesday in yet another demonstration of how divided the party is in the drawn-out national race to win the nomination for November’s general election. Clinton narrowly defeated Sanders in Kentucky, a state where she was not expected to win. Sanders bested her in Oregon, a state that played to his strengths. In Kentucky, the two candidates will likely split the 55 delegates up for grabs. In Oregon, Sanders will take only a handful more of the 61 delegates that were awarded.     Clinton’s sizeable lead in delegates means it is likely she will eventually be her party’s nominee, but she remains more than 100 delegates short of sealing the deal. The Democratic primary now hits a two-week lull, with the final set major contests, including California, scheduled for June 7. Clinton, who spent the past two days campaigning in Kentucky, would like to lock up the nomination and turn her attention to the Nov. 8 general election and presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump. Trump has begun to organize his general election campaign. On Tuesday, he signed a joint fundraising agreement with the Republican National Committee. The agreement allows him to raise $449,400 from a single donor by splitting the funds between his campaign, the RNC and state Republican parties.  Trump, who eschewed donations in the political system through the primary, has thus far insisted on mostly self-funding his campaign. The shift to a more traditional fundraising approach could draw the ire of some supporters. Trump, in an interview with Megyn Kelly that aired on Fox News Tuesday night, said he did have regrets about his actions during the Republican primary process. “I could have used different language in a couple of instances, but overall I’m happy with the outcome,” Trump said.  Sanders supporters became angry when Nevada state party officials chose to end their convention and block efforts to award the U.S. senator from Vermont more delegates than he initially won in the February caucus. Clinton won the caucus. The Nevada incident was a warning about the potential for fireworks at July’s Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. Clinton’s campaign continued to express confidence that she would be able to unify the party. “Hillary Clinton is grateful to the thousands of Nevadans who came out to participate in the caucuses and convention process,” Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook said. “She believes every voice should be heard and no one should be intimidated, harassed or threatened in this process. When the primary process is complete, our party must come together and ensure a Democrat is elected to serve as our next president,” Mook said. Sanders on Tuesday joined his supporters in criticizing the Nevada Democratic Party after Saturday’s events. One Sanders supporter threw a chair, unhappy about being blocked in a rules vote that was part of the effort to help the senator win more delegates to the national convention. Others drew chalk graffiti on a party building, while the state’s party chairwoman has been receiving death threats. Sanders framed Nevada’s incident as a warning. “If the Democratic Party is to be successful in November, it is imperative that all state parties treat our campaign supporters with fairness and the respect that they have earned,” Sanders said in a statement on the Nevada incident.   Sanders - who said he condemns violence and personal harassment of individuals - leveled some of the same complaints his supporters did, arguing that state party Chairwoman Roberta Lange did not allow a headcount on a disputed rules change. He also argued that 64 delegates to the state convention were not given a hearing before being ruled ineligible. The state party disputed the Sanders campaign’s interpretation of the events. It said some delegates did not show up at the convention and others were disqualified because they were not registered as Democrats in time. “The Sanders campaign is continuing to be dishonest about what happened Saturday and is failing to adequately denounce the threats of violence of his supporters,” the Nevada Democratic Party said in a statement. Sanders supporters began circulating a picture of Lange on the internet that included her cellphone number and encouraged others to contact her to express their unhappiness.  Lange said on MSNBC she had been receiving death threats, including many containing vulgar language. Public messages sent to her Twitter account included a barrage of derogatory statements. MSNBC played some of the voicemails, including one saying “people like you should be hung in a public execution.” “What you heard is a few of the thousands of emails and texts and Facebook messages and Twitter messages that I’ve gotten,” Lange said on MSNBC. “Threats to my family, to my grandson, to my husband.  Sanders’ continued presence in the race is prompting concerns among Clinton allies that he will damage her ability to take on Trump and hurt her in the fall.  But Sanders supporters shrug off that worry, arguing that Trump is such a flawed candidate that Clinton will easily dispatch with him if she faces him in the Nov. 8 election. Clinton’s camp seems to agree.  “Ultimately, we are confident that the passion and energy from the primary will be united in a common purpose — to move forward the ideals of our party and keep the White House out of Donald Trump’s hands,” her campaign manager Mook said. \"],[\"BEIJING (Reuters) - China is focused on solving the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue through talks and peaceful means, Chinese President Xi Jinping told U.S. President Donald Trump in a telephone call on Wednesday. The United States and South Korea have asked the United Nations to consider tough new sanctions on North Korea after its nuclear test on Sunday that Pyongyang said was an advanced hydrogen bomb. Washington and its allies have said there is a growing urgency for China, North Korea s top ally and trading partner, to apply more pressure on its already isolated neighbor to get it to back down on its nuclear weapons and missiles programs. China s focus on negotiations contrasts with Trump s assertions over the last few days that now was not the time to focus on talks with North Korea. In a telephone call with U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May on Tuesday,  President Trump reiterated that now is not the time to talk to North Korea, and made clear that all options remain open to defend the United States and its allies against North Korean aggression,  the White House said on Wednesday. However, the issue was not mentioned in a separate White House statement on the Trump-Xi call, which said only that the two leaders recognized the danger posed by North Korea and committed to working together with the goal of denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula. Earlier, a statement from China s foreign ministry said China  unswervingly  works to realize denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula and to safeguard the international nuclear non-proliferation system, Xi told Trump.  At the same time, we always persist in safeguarding peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and resolving the issue through dialogue and consultation,  Xi said.  It is necessary to stay on the path of a peaceful solution.  Xi also said that China attaches importance to Trump s visit to China later this year. The statement cited Trump as saying that the United States was deeply concerned about the Korean nuclear issue and that it valued China s  important role  in resolving the problem. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley accused North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on Monday of  begging for war  and urged the Security Council to impose the  strongest possible  sanctions. Beijing has said reining in North Korea is not chiefly its responsibility, and has expressed doubts that U.N. economic sanctions, which it has backed, will resolve the situation. Sanctions so far appear to have done little to stop North Korea from boosting its nuclear and missile capacity as it faces off with Trump, who has vowed to stop Pyongyang from being able to hit the U.S. mainland with a nuclear weapon. It is unclear if China will back further sanctions. Beijing fears that completely cutting off North Korea could lead to its collapse, unleashing a wave of refugees into China s northeast. China accounted for 92 percent of North Korea s trade in 2016, according to South Korea. China s foreign ministry said on Tuesday it would take part in Security Council discussions in  a responsible and constructive manner . China and Russia have advocated a plan in which the United States and Seoul stop major military drills in exchange for North Korea halting its weapons programs, but neither side is willing to budge. Trump and Xi last spoke by telephone on Aug. 12. The White House said at the time that their relationship was  extremely close  and  will hopefully lead to a peaceful resolution of the North Korea problem.  But tensions in China-U.S. ties have increased since Trump took office, with the U.S. president having authorized an investigation into China s alleged theft of intellectual property, and suggesting trade relations would be linked to Beijing s help on North Korea. \"],[\"BERLIN (Reuters) - German police on Tuesday detained six Syrians suspected of planning an attack using weapons or explosives on behalf of the Islamic State militant group, prosecutors said. Police detained the suspects aged between 20 and 28 during  raids in the cities of Kassel, Hanover, Essen and Leipzig, the general prosecutor s office in Frankfurt said in a statement. Some 500 police officers took part in the raids during which  eight apartments were searched. Four of the suspects arrived in Germany in December 2014 and two arrived the following year. All six had applied for asylum. The prosecutor s office did not say if their asylum applications had been approved. Prosecutors said the six Syrians  are suspected of being members of the foreign terrorist organization that calls itself Islamic State (IS) . They added:  The accused are also suspected of having planned an attack against a public target in Germany using either weapons or explosives.  It is the second time this month that Syrians have been arrested on suspicion of planning militant violence. Earlier this month a 19-year-old Syrian man was detained on suspicion of planning a bomb attack. The arrest comes one month before the first anniversary of an attack in Berlin by a failed Tunisian asylum seeker who killed 12 people by plowing a truck into a Christmas market. Concrete blocks have been installed around Christmas markets at several central squares in the capital this year before the festive season opens in a couple of weeks. \"],[\"(Reuters) - Hackers targeted the computer systems of presidential candidate Donald Trump and Republican Party organizations as well as Democratic Party networks, sources familiar with investigations into the attacks said. At least one Trump staff member’s email account was infected with malware in 2015 and sent malicious emails to colleagues, according to one insider for the Republican candidate’s campaign and an outside security expert. It was unclear whether or not the hackers actually gained access to campaign computers. In the past month, U.S. security officials have said that starting last year, hackers infiltrated computers of the Democratic National Committee (DNC), the presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton and her party’s congressional fundraising committee. U.S. officials said they have concluded that Russia or its proxies were responsible, leading to calls by some Democrats and cyber security officials for the Obama administration to blame Russia publicly. Kremlin officials have dismissed the allegations as absurd, but there is anxiety in Washington over the possibility that a foreign power might be using hacked information to meddle in the Nov. 8 U.S. election. The Trump campaign has hired security firm CrowdStrike, which also is assisting the Democratic National Committee, according to one person briefed on the matter. The company declined to comment.A different outside security firm was hired to examine software the Trump and Clinton campaigns use to manage mailings, electronic outreach and other campaign efforts, another person who was briefed on the issue said.A spokeswoman for Trump’s campaign declined to comment. A spokesman for the Republican National Committee could not immediately be reached for comment. The tools and techniques used to hack Republican targets resemble those employed in attacks on Democratic Party organizations, including the DNC and Clinton’s campaign organization, two sources said. That has led U.S. officials to reach a preliminary assessment that Russia’s military and civilian intelligence agencies or their proxies have targeted both political parties. Attempts to hack into Republican political organizations over an extended period were reported in intelligence bulletins circulated by U.S. agencies, four sources said. They did not disclose the identities of the organizations. Two U.S. security officials said the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security have offered assistance to both political parties in identifying possible intrusions and upgrading their defenses against what one of the officials called “constantly evolving threats.” \"],[\"BEIJING (Reuters) - Cultural exchanges between countries need to consider the  temperature  of popular opinion and how people feel about each other, a senior Chinese official said on Friday, amid a freeze in cultural ties with South Korea over an anti-missile system. China has been angered by Seoul s decision to deploy the U.S.-made Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system, saying that its powerful radar harms China s own national security and will do nothing to lessen tensions with North Korea, which THAAD is supposed to defend against. Popular South Korean soap operas have been pulled from streaming sites, K-Pop singers have had concerts canceled and there has been a dramatic drop in Chinese tourists to South Korea. China has not officially linked the moves to the THAAD tensions, but has said relations need to have a  basis in popular opinion . Asked about the prospects for cultural exchanges with South Korea amid the THAAD dispute, deputy media regulator Zhang Hongsen said cultural exchanges were not an  ordinary exchange of goods .  Cultural exchanges relate to where the popular will inclines and to emotional choices,  he said, speaking on the sidelines of a Communist Party Congress.  So what we say is that culture exchanges are an exchange of temperatures, and this temperature comes from popular feeling and emotion,  added Zhang, who is a Vice Minister of the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television.  When popular sentiments and emotions align, cultural exchanges and cooperation can certainly develop in a positive direction,  he said, without elaborating. \"],[\"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidates Donald Trump and Ted Cruz turned to Twitter to defend their wives’ honor after a Super PAC put out an ad featuring Trump’s wife nude and Trump threatened to “spill the beans” on Cruz’s wife. Trump’s threat came on Tuesday night when he was upset about an ad that showed his wife, former model Melania Trump, lounging nude with a caption saying, “Meet Melania Trump. Your next first lady. Or, you could support Ted Cruz on Tuesday.” Trump said Cruz was behind the ad, which appeared on Tuesday, the day of nominating contests in Utah, where the heavily Mormon electorate favored Cruz in its caucuses, and Arizona, which gave Trump a victory in its primary vote. The ad said it was from Make America Awesome, a Super PAC that is allowed to promote a candidate but not coordinate with the campaign. “Wow @SenTedCruz, that is some low level ad you did using a picture [of] Melania in a G.Q. shoot,” Trump tweeted on Tuesday. “Be careful or I will spill the beans on your wife.”      Trump later deleted the tweet but published another that read: “Lyin’ Ted Cruz just used a picture of Melania from a G.Q. shoot in his ad. Be careful, Lyin’ Ted, or I will spill the beans on your wife!” Trump did not indicate what kind of beans he intended to spill about Heidi Cruz, who is on leave from an executive job at Goldman Sachs while campaigning, but her husband quickly came to her defense on Twitter. “Pic of your wife not from us,” the U.S. senator from Texas said. “Donald, if you try to attack Heidi, you’re more of a coward than I thought. #classless.” The battle continued on Wednesday with Cruz telling CNN: “He went directly after my wife. If Donald wants to get in a character fight, he’s better off sticking with me because Heidi is way out of his league.”   A Twitter response from Trump questioned Cruz’ honesty. “Lyin’ Ted Cruz denied that he had anything to do with the G.Q. model photo post of Melania. That’s why we call him Lyin’ Ted!” he said.  The director of Make America Awesome, Liz Mair, posted on Twitter that her group was responsible for the ad. She did not respond to an email from Reuters seeking comment. In a campaign appearance for her husband in Waukesha, Wisconsin, Heidi Cruz addressed the uproar briefly. “You probably know by now that most of the things that Donald Trump says have no basis in reality,” she told reporters. “So we are not worried in the least.” \"],[\"BATON ROUGE, La. (Reuters) - Republican John Neely Kennedy, a candidate for the U.S. Senate,  won a runoff election in Louisiana on Saturday against Democrat Foster Campbell in a race that gives the Republicans a 52-seat majority in the chamber. Campbell told his supporters in the state capital of Baton Rouge that he had called Kennedy to congratulate him on his victory. Kennedy, the state treasurer and the favorite going into the runoff, had slightly less than 61 percent of the vote with all 3,904 precincts reporting, according to the state Secretary of State’s office. Turnout was relatively low. Kennedy, who said he will not move to Washington D.C. after a campaign spent railing against “insiders,” told supporters “I’d rather drink weed-killer than be anywhere else tonight,” a reference to a widely reported campaign quote in which he said he “would rather drink weed-killer than support Obamacare.” Kennedy will fill the seat held by outgoing Republican Senator David Vitter, who is retiring. In conceding, Campbell vowed “I’ll never stop fighting for working families, I’ll never stop working for what’s right.” Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards, a Democrat, congratulated Kennedy on his victory.  “I look forward to working with him to secure additional funding for flood relief, to make long term investments in our infrastructure and to bring Louisiana’s federal tax dollars home to help our people,” Edwards said in a statement.  With Kennedy’s victory, the Republicans will have a 52-seat majority in the 100-seat U.S. Senate. Going into the general election on Nov. 8, Republicans had a 54-seat majority. Kennedy had campaigned on the popularity in his state of President-elect Donald Trump, who easily won Louisiana. Trump flew to Baton Rouge for an election-eve rally on Kennedy’s behalf, and Vice President-elect Mike Pence earlier  stumped for Kennedy as well. Kennedy, 65, was a Democrat until he switched party affiliation in the conservative-leaning state in 2007.  He had consistently polled well ahead of Campbell since placing first in the state’s 24-candidate free-for-all primary, which included former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke. Celebrities including Patton Oswalt and John Leguizamo both actively supported Campbell’s losing bid. Under Louisiana law, all candidates are pitted against each other in the November general election. If no candidate claims a majority, the top two candidates move to a runoff. Also on Saturday, Republicans Mike Johnson, a state representative, and Clay Higgins prevailed in Congressional runoffs, replacing representatives who made unsuccessful bids for the Senate seat won by Kennedy.  \"],[\"NAIROBI\\u002fMOGADISHU (Reuters) - The size and methods of the latest truck bombing in Mogadishu show how international and Somali government efforts to stop the killings are failing, partly because intelligence gathering to counter such attacks is so disjointed, security sources say.   More than 300 people were killed in the bombing in the heart of the capital on Saturday, the deadliest attack in the history of the Horn of Africa nation. The Islamist insurgency al Shabaab was blamed for the blasts, which happened when a car bomb and a truck bomb headed for the airport detonated prematurely.   Somali security services and the donor nations working with them are both to blame for disorganization in the divisions that are supposed to be working to detect and stop such attacks, said Hussein Moalim Mohamud Sheikh Ali, a former national security adviser to the president.   The national security architecture is in tatters,  he told Reuters.  The Shabaab attacks are a symptom of the greater political dysfunction of the state.   The increasing frequency and growing size of the attacks threaten the fragile security gains made in Somalia ahead of the withdrawal of African Union peacekeepers at the end of the year. They also are a concern for other countries in the region where al Shabaab is active, such as Kenya and Uganda. In 2016, 723 people died in 395 attacks in Somalia, up from 46 dead in 36 attacks in 2010, according to a confidential report produced earlier this year by Nairobi-based thinktank Sahan Research.  Initial swab tests at the site of the attack showed traces of potassium nitrate, a fertilizer component, indicating al Shabaab is now manufacturing explosives as well as buying them or harvesting them from munitions, experts say. Competing programs funded by different donor nations and the lack of a centralized database are hurting efforts to analyze intelligence related to improvised explosive devices (IEDs), four Western and one Somali security source told Reuters.  A letter from Somalia s minister of internal security addressed to the United States, Britain and the United Nations in May complained of competition and secrecy among agencies gathering intelligence.    Multiple actors involved means this process is highly disorganized ... causing a severe problem for the governmental counter-terrorism efforts,  said the letter, seen by Reuters.  The pressure is building on President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed, who must ensure Somalia s fledgling security forces are ready to step in when the 22,000-strong AU force leaves. His government is already stalling on releasing a report into a joint U.S.-Somali raid on Bariire in August that residents say killed 10 civilians. Political disagreements threaten co-operation between Somalia s federal and regional forces.  Last week the minister of defense and army chief resigned, without giving reasons. The interior ministry spokesman resigned this week.  Somali police did not respond to requests for comment. HIGH-GRADE EXPLOSIVES Obtaining high-grade military explosives - the material that makes a bomb explode - involves harvesting them from captured munitions, or buying them from someone else.  Making their own explosive allows the insurgents to build more and bigger bombs, according to the Sahan report and an upcoming report from a U.N. panel of experts that monitors an arms embargo on Somalia. According to the U.N. report which is due to be published next month, the U.S. Terrorist Explosive Device Analytical Center, which is funded by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, has confirmed the presence of potassium nitrate in six major vehicle-borne bomb incidents since 2016.   The potential use of HME (home-made explosive) by al Shabaab would allow the group to rely less on the process of harvesting explosives from munitions, which is slow and laborious   allow(ing) the militant group to increase the frequency and explosive weight of its IEDs,  said the report.  Al Shabaab, which wants to overthrow Somalia s U.N.-backed government and impose strict Islamic law, has not yet claimed responsibility for Saturday s attack, in keeping with previous incidents in which large numbers of civilians have been killed. Mass civilian deaths have caused deep divisions among fighters, a security source with knowledge of discussions within the group said.  A former top al Shabaab commander, Mukhtar Robow Abu Mansur,  condemned the attack and was photographed by local media donating blood. Robow defected to the government in August after the U.S. government removed a $5 million bounty for his capture. Two Mogadishu-based security sources outlined the events leading up to the latest attack to Reuters. They said a car bomb and a truck bomb were deployed to hit Mogadishu International Airport, a warren of buildings ringed by barbed wire and blast walls that house contractors, diplomats and a European Union military training mission.   One bomb would have breached a checkpoint, opening the way for a larger bomb,  one of the Western security contractors told Reuters.  They also had fighters nearby ready to come inside the base.   The driver of the car bomb had been driving through checkpoints for a week ahead of the attack, paying small bribes and getting security forces used to his presence, he said.  A larger truck entered the city and passed through one checkpoint, but was stopped at one known as Kilometer Five. Panicking, he tried to force his way through, but got snarled in traffic next to a fuel truck.  I could see the truck speeding. I also heard few gunshots behind it. Police must have been chasing it,  said Mohamed Ali, 21, who was injured in the blast.   As it advanced it came to many cars in the street, then the truck driver swerved abruptly to the left lane, but its tyres got stuck in the highway divider. What followed was the blast and smoke.   The fireball tore through the intersection, incinerating hundreds of civilians. Many were too badly burned to be identified and were buried in mass graves.  The driver of the car bomb was detained at another checkpoint by soldiers who had taken him out for questioning before its bomb also detonated.  Three security sources told Reuters he identified himself as al Shabaab. \"],[\"(Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders on Tuesday requested a recount in the close Kentucky presidential primary against front-runner Hillary Clinton, state election officials said on Tuesday. The recanvass will take place at all 120 county boards of election on Thursday, according to the Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Grimes. Clinton won Kentucky by just 1,924 votes, according to the unofficial totals posted on the secretary of state’s elections page. She won Jefferson County, which includes Louisville and is the largest by far of the state’s 120 counties, by nearly 10 times that amount In his filing on Tuesday, Sanders requested a full check and recount of every voting machine and absentee ballot from all precincts in the counties, according to Grimes’ website. “My office is notifying all county boards of elections that Sen. Sanders has requested a recanvass, and we are reminding them of the laws and procedures to be followed,” Grimes said in a statement. Clinton, a former U.S. senator and secretary of state, narrowly defeated Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont, in the May 17 presidential nominating contest in Kentucky, a state she had not been expected to win.  A Sanders campaign representative said the recount request was important for the integrity of the Democratic presidential contest, in which Sanders is continuing to challenge Clinton despite her formidable lead in the number of delegates needed to secure the nomination. “I think the point is just transparency, it’s not just about Kentucky,” Sanders aide Larry Cohen said on CNN. “It’s about trying to create a context, now and at the (Democratic) convention, that these primaries and caucuses need transparency, they need to be authentic, they need to build confidence among voters, particularly younger voters, that this is not rigged.”  Sanders has generally drawn more support from young voters than Clinton. \"],[\"ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Donald Trump’s surprise election as U.S. president has Pakistanis wary that he may accelerate what they see as a shift in American policy to favor arch-foe India in the long rivalry between nuclear-armed neighbors, analysts said on Wednesday. Historical allies in the region, Islamabad and Washington have seen relations sour over U.S. accusations that Pakistan shelters Islamist militants, a charge Pakistan denies. They hit new lows in May when a U.S. drone killed the leader of the Afghan Taliban movement on Pakistani territory. At the same time, Pakistan’s ties with traditional rival India have also deteriorated this year, with India saying Pakistan-based militants killed 19 of its soldiers in a September attack on an army base in the disputed Kashmir region. To many Pakistanis, Trump’s anti-Muslim rhetoric - he once proposed banning Muslims entering the United States - and business ties to India are signs that his administration could shift further toward New Delhi. “America will not abandon Pakistan, but definitely, Trump will be a tougher president than Hillary Clinton for Pakistan,” said Hasan Askari Rizvi, Lahore-based foreign policy analyst. “I think India will have a better and smoother interaction compared to Pakistan.” Trump has yet to lay out a detailed policy for South Asia, although he recently offered to mediate between India and Pakistan in their dispute over the divided territory of Kashmir. He also told Fox News in May he would favor keeping nearly 10,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan “because it’s adjacent and right next to Pakistan which has nuclear weapons.” On Wednesday, a U.S. diplomat in Pakistan sought to assure the country that Trump’s election did not signal a drastic policy change. “Our foreign policy is based on national interest and they don’t change when the government changes,” Grace Shelton, U.S. Consul General in Karachi, told Geo News television. Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif congratulated Trump. “Your election is indeed the triumph of the American people and their enduring faith in the ideals of democracy, freedom, human rights and free enterprise,” Sharif said in a statement. Still, the uncertainty of a Trump presidency has many Pakistanis on edge, even if the country has leaned towards China in recent years for investment and diplomatic support. “Trump is a bit of a wild card,” said Sherry Rehman, a Pakistani senator and former ambassador to the United States.     “Pakistan obviously cannot rule out engaging with whomever America elects, but his anti-Muslim rhetoric may cast a shadow on relations in times of uncertainty.” Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi also congratulated Trump on Wednesday.  “We look forward to working with you closely to take India-US bilateral ties to a new height,” Modi said in a tweet. Trump has partnered with Indian businessmen on a handful of real estate ventures, but apart from courting the Indian-American vote he has not articulated how he would develop the bilateral relationship. India-U.S. ties have flourished under President Barack Obama and Modi, who came to power in 2014, with the two countries striking key defense agreements this year. Modi’s government has also waged a campaign to isolate Pakistan diplomatically. Shaurya Doval, director of the India Foundation, a think-tank close to Modi’s government, called Trump’s election “a very positive development”, but added that India and the United States would have continued to grow closer under a Hillary Clinton presidency as well. “My sense is that India-U.S. relations are not dependent on individuals – there are strong institutions and processes there,” he said. One fringe Hindu nationalist group in India held a victory gathering at New Delhi’s speakers’ corner on Wednesday. “He’s an American nationalist. We are Indian nationalists. Only he can understand us,” Rashmi Gupta of the Hindu Sena, or Hindu Army, told Reuters. “We expect him to support us when it comes to terrorist attacks on India from Pakistan.” Trump will also have to decide whether to maintain the number of U.S. troops in Afghanistan or change the scope of the mission, 15 years after a U.S.-led campaign toppled the hardline Islamist Taliban government.     The United States has spent some $115 billion in aid for Afghanistan since 2002, but the country is still caught in conflict, with a third of the country out of government control and thousands of Afghan civilians, soldiers and police dying every year. Afghan officials have voiced concern that the conflict is being forgotten in Washington, and warned privately that the West will pay a huge price if that continues.     “The people of Afghanistan are tired of war. We want (Trump) to invest heavily in bringing peace to war-torn Afghanistan and stabilize our region,” said Umer Daudzai, former Afghan minister of interior. Obama’s original aim of pulling out of Afghanistan entirely has been put on hold in the face of mounting gains by Taliban militants, with U.S. air power and special forces still regularly involved in combat.     As recently as last week, two U.S. Green Berets were killed near the northern city of Kunduz. Although Afghan security forces have been fighting largely alone since the end of the main NATO-led combat mission in 2014, their performance has been patchy and they continue to rely heavily on U.S. air power. The Taliban on Wednesday urged Trump to withdraw all U.S. troops. “They should not cause damage to their economy and their military in this failed war,” Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said of the American government in a statement. \"],[\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump, who has attacked China on issues from trade to the South China Sea, held his first face-to-face talks with a member of the Chinese leadership on Monday, and the White House said it was a chance to discuss shared security interests and a possible meeting with President Xi Jinping. State Councilor Yang Jiechi, China’s top diplomat, met Trump briefly after talks with the new U.S. National Security adviser, H.R. McMaster, Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, and White House chief strategist Steve Bannon. A senior U.S. administration official said discussions included bilateral cooperation and the possibility of arranging a meeting between Trump and Xi, but no date was set. The official said the meeting with Trump lasted five to seven minutes. White House spokesman Sean Spicer called it “an opportunity to say ‘hi’ to the president” before Yang left. “This was an opportunity to begin that conversation and talk to them on shared interests of national security,” he said at a regular news briefing. China’s Foreign Ministry cited Yang as telling Trump that China was willing to enhance exchanges with the United States at all levels, expand coordination and cooperation, and respect each others’ core interests and major concerns. “Ensuring the steady and healthy development of China-U.S. ties will surely benefit both peoples and the world as a whole,” the ministry paraphrased Yang as saying. Yang, who outranks China’s foreign minister, was the first top Chinese official to visit the White House since Trump took office on Jan. 20. His visit followed a phone call between Yang and U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson last week, during which the two affirmed the importance of a constructive U.S.-China relationship. It was the latest step by the world’s two largest economies to try to put relations back on an even keel after a rocky start following Trump’s election victory. Trump has been a strong critic of Beijing, accusing China of unfair trade policies, criticizing its island building in the strategic South China Sea, and accusing it of not doing enough to constrain its neighbor, North Korea. Trump incensed Beijing in December by talking to the president of Taiwan and saying the United States did not have to stick to the “one China” policy, under which Washington acknowledges the Chinese position that there is only one China, of which Taiwan is a part. Trump later agreed in a phone call with Xi to honor the “one China” policy in a diplomatic boost for Beijing, which vehemently opposes criticism of its claim to self-ruled Taiwan. In an interview with Reuters on Thursday, Trump pressed China to do more to rein in North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs, saying Beijing could resolve the issue “very easily if it wanted to.” China dismissed Trump’s remarks, saying on Friday the crux of the matter was a dispute between Washington and Pyongyang. Beijing has repeatedly called for a return to negotiations between Pyongyang and world powers. As Yang held talks at the White House, senior officials from the United States, Japan and South Korea met at the State Department to discuss additional measures to choke off funding to North Korea’s weapons program. “The officials considered other possible measures under national authorities, including means to restrict further the revenue sources for North Korea’s weapons programs, particularly illicit activities,” they said in a joint statement. They also agreed that North Korea’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs directly threatened their security and “strong international pressure” was needed to push back at Pyongyang, the statement said.  Plans for renewed contacts with North Korea in the United States were canceled last week after the U.S. State Department denied a visa for the top envoy from Pyongyang, the Wall Street Journal reported on Saturday. \"],[\"NEW YORK\\u002fWASHINGTON (Reuters) - About 60,000 visas were revoked under U.S. President Donald Trump’s executive order temporarily halting immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries, the State Department said on Friday, in one of several government communications clarifying how the order is being rolled out. The revocation means the government voided travel visas for people trying to enter the United States but the visas could be restored later without a new application, said William Cocks, a spokesman for consular affairs at the State Department. “We will communicate updates to affected travelers following the 90-day review,” he said.  Earlier news reports, citing a government attorney at a federal court hearing, put the figure at more than 100,000 visas. The government issued over 11 million immigrant and non-immigrant visas in fiscal year 2015, the State Department said.     The immigration executive order signed by Trump a week ago temporarily halted the U.S. refugee program and imposed a 90-day suspension on people traveling from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. Trump said the measures would help protect Americans from terrorist attacks. Under President Barack Obama, Trump’s predecessor, the United States added those seven countries as “countries of concern” under its visa waiver program, effectively toughening U.S. visa procedures for individuals who visited those places during the past five years. Trump’s executive order was at least in part informed by those restrictions. The new president, who took office on Jan. 20, went further by temporarily barring passport holders from those seven countries.  The State Department first issued the guidance about revoking the visas on Jan. 27, the day Trump signed his executive order, according to a memo filed in a court case in Massachusetts.  But confusion about the roll out of the order sparked protests at airports across the country where people had been detained and led to a wave of lawsuits filed by individuals, states and civil rights groups.  To further clarify how the order should be applied, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) sent out a letter to all of its employees on Feb. 2, according to a copy of the memo seen by Reuters. The memo said the agency was continuing to process all applications and petitions for people inside the United States regardless of their country of origin. It also said all applications for permanent residency and adjustment of status can move forward. USCIS said they could not discuss internal employee communications.  The Department of Homeland Security had earlier clarified, after some initial back-and-forth, that the order would not apply to green card holders. Also people from the seven countries who hold dual citizenship are allowed to enter the United States on the passport of a non-restricted nation when eligible, according to Feb. 2 guidance posted by U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s website. \"],[\"DUBLIN (Reuters) - It is not yet clear if Britain and the European Union can agree on written assurances to avoid a hard Northern Ireland border by a Monday deadline, Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said on Sunday.  But he said he was hopeful a meeting between British Prime Minister Theresa May and European Council President Donald Tusk on Monday would lead to a deal in time for a Dec. 14-15 EU summit. That would allow Britain to move on to talks on its future trading relations with the bloc.  Avoiding a so-called hard border on the island of Ireland is the last major hurdle before talks begin on the future trade relationship and a two-year Brexit transition. Tusk said he had asked May to  put a final offer on the table  by Monday, but Coveney suggested agreement on the wording of written reassurances may come later.   The hope is that those [Monday] meetings will result in a momentum that can be carried into the leaders  summit the week after ... and can allow this Brexit negotiation process to open up to phase two of discussions,  Coveney told RTE radio. Asked if he expected an agreed text of written British assurances on the issue Monday morning, Coveney said:  Let s not run before we can walk here. Obviously, we would like that to be the case.      The Irish cabinet is to meet at 0900 GMT on Monday and give Prime Minister Leo Varadkar a mandate to make a decision on the border issue.   That may or may not be on the back of an agreed wording. That remains to be seen over the next number of hours,  Coveney said. Ireland is not asking the British government to  do the impossible  and provide a detailed plan border will work, but rather for  clear principles  for the second phase of talks to eliminate the possibility of a hard border.   What we have to make sure here is that we don t have an unintended consequence of the re-emergence of a [hard] border,  he said.  We can t allow that and we won t allow that.  \"],[\"MANILA (Reuters) - Leaders from across Asia joined U.S. President Donald Trump at an extravagant gala dinner in the Philippines’ capital on Sunday, a show of amity in a region fraught with tensions that have lurked behind his marathon tour of the continent. Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte set the tone of cordiality ahead of the two days of summit meetings he will host, suggesting that despite their differences over claims to the South China Sea, the leaders should not discuss the issue. “We have to be friends, the other hotheads would like us to confront China and the rest of the world on so many issues,” Duterte said at a business conference, as planes carrying heads of state and government attending the summit landed in quick succession in Manila.  “The South China Sea is better left untouched, nobody can afford to go to war. It can ill-afford a violent confrontation.” Hours earlier, during a bilateral visit to Vietnam, Trump offered to mediate in the dispute over the South China Sea, where four Southeast Asian countries and Taiwan contest China’s sweeping claims to the busy waterway. All the claimants will be at the summit, except for Taiwan. Trump will join leaders of Southeast and East Asian nations in Manila over the next two days, the last leg of a tour that has taken him to Japan, South Korea and China as well as Vietnam. The sheer length of the trip - the longest to Asia by a U.S. president in more than a quarter century - may reassure some that, despite Trump’s “America First” policy, Washington remains committed to a region China sees as its strategic domain. Leaders of the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), China, Russia, Japan, Canada, South Korea, India, Australia and New Zealand arrived one by one for a glitzy gala dinner where they were entertained by singers and dancers. Each of the men sported a cream-colored barong, a traditional Philippines shirt made of fiber from the pineapple plant, embroidered and worn untucked. They were served a four-course Filipino-Asian fusion meal curate and prepared by Chef Jessie Sincioco, who also designed the menu for Pope Francis when he visited the Philippines in 2015. Police used water canon to prevent hundreds of protesters reaching the U.S. embassy in Manila ahead of Trump’s arrival. Carrying placards declaring “Dump Trump” and “Down with U.S. Imperialism”, the left-wing protesters were blocked by police in riot gear with shields and batons, and then showered with jets of water from a fire engine. The United States and its former colony, the Philippines,  have been strategic allies since World War Two.  Trump is expected to try during the summit to shore up relations, which have been strained by the mercurial Duterte’s notorious anti-U.S. sentiment and his enthusiasm for better ties with Russia and China. Duterte - sometimes described as the ‘Trump of the East’ because of his brash style - said last week he would tell the U.S. president to “lay off” if he raised the issue of human rights when they met. More than 3,900 Filipinos have been killed in what the police call self-defense in a war on drugs declared by Duterte. Critics say executions are taking place with no accountability, allegations the police reject. But Trump, who has been criticized at home for neglecting rights issues in dealings abroad, praised Duterte in May for doing an “unbelievable job on the drug problem”. “INDO-PACIFIC” Trump’s tour comes against a background of tensions on the Korean peninsula following exchanges of war-like threats and insults between North Korea’s leader Kim Jong Un and Trump over Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile development program. China has been urged by both South Korea and the United States to take a more active role in curbing North Korea’s nuclear and missile ambitions. During his tour, Trump and his team have repeatedly used the term “Indo-Pacific” instead of “Asia-Pacific” for the region, which some see as an effort to depict it as more than China-dominated. Pacific Rim nation leaders agreed in Vietnam on Saturday to address “unfair trade practices” and “market distorting subsidies”, a statement that bore the imprint of Trump’s efforts to reshape the global trade landscape. The summit of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) countries in Vietnam put on show the contrasting vision of the “America First” policy with the traditional consensus favoring multinational deals that China now seeks to champion. Manila hosted the APEC summit two years ago, and at that meeting Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau won a Twitter poll with the hashtag #APEChottie that asked people to vote for the most attractive leader there. Journalists swarmed the youthful leader and screamed in excitement. On his latest visit, Trudeau visited an outlet of Jollibee, a chain that has become a byword for Filipino fast food, chatting and posing for selfies, charming the people of Manila again.

The ruling came with German authorities on high alert ahead of Tuesday s anniversary of an attack last year in which a failed Tunisian asylum-seeker plowed a truck into crowds at an outdoor Christmas market and killed 12 people. Prosecutors said the suspect, identified only as Sascha L., had carried out two successful tests of a home-made explosive device in his hometown in January.  An inquiry found two videos of the accused pledging allegiance to Islamic State s leader. However, the court ruled on Monday that there was no evidence that the man had a personal connection with the Islamist militia or that he was financially supported by the militia, German broadcaster NDR reported. NDR said the court granted him leniency since he cooperated with authorities after his arrest and confessed his plans.  German magazine Der Spiegel had reported that the man was part of the far-right scene in the past before converting to Salafism, an ultra-conservative Islamist creed. The man, who was arrested in February, admitted planning an attack. Chemicals that could be used to make explosive devices were found during a search of his home in the town of Northeim in central Germany. Three men charged as accomplices of the convicted man also appeared before the court. Two were convicted, with one sentenced to three years probation and the other to 100 hours of community service. The third person was acquitted.  Last week, German police raided nine locations in Berlin and the eastern state of Saxony Anhalt in an investigation of four people suspected of planning an Islamist-motivated attack.  \"],[\"MADRID (Reuters) - Catalonia will stop sending weekly financial accounts to Madrid, defying a demand by Spain s central government that the region prove it is not using public money to promote an independence drive. The decision follows a series of moves to block a Catalan referendum on self-rule, planned for Oct. 1, which Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy s government has declared illegal. In a letter dated Sept. 13, Catalan Deputy Governor Oriol Junqueras told Spanish Budget Minister Cristobal Montoro the region would no longer comply with the obligation to submit its accounts every week. He said the arrangement implied  political control that is not related to the objectives of budget stability or to the purposes of state legislation in this matter . Madrid ordered Catalonia to start providing the weekly data in July. The government warned the region would lose access to some public funds if it was found to be using state money to organize the vote. All of Spain s regions pay taxes to the central government, and are then given a quota to spend on health, education and infrastructure. Catalonia, which has one of the strongest regional economies, says the system is unfair. After the referendum was announced, Madrid warned Catalonia it risked losing access to a separate funding program, set up in 2012 when economic crisis hammered regional budgets, if it failed to provide weekly accounts.  Junqueras said in his letter that his administration was committed to financial stability and would still collaborate with Montoro s ministry, and continue to account for their spending every month.  The will of the (Catalan) government is to continue to focus on dialogue and the exercise of democracy as a way to resolve the debate on political relations between Catalonia and Spain,  the letter said.         Catalonia accounts for around 20 percent of Spain s gross domestic product and has received some 70 billion euros ($83 billion) in funding from Madrid since 2012. \"],[\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson asked Saudi Arabia to ease its blockade of Yemen, two sources said, just days before the Saudi-led military coalition announced on Wednesday it would let aid flow through the Yemeni port of Hodeidah and allow U.N. flights to the capital.  It was not clear if pressure from Washington was the direct cause of the Saudi change of heart but the request from Tillerson to Saudi Arabia s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, was one of several U.S. attempts this month to have Riyadh soften its hawkish foreign policy.  Tillerson asked for a loosening of the blockade on Yemen during a roughly 45-minute phone call at the beginning of this week, according to a source familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity. R.C. Hammond, a top adviser to Tillerson, confirmed the exchange with Prince Mohammed. The secretary of state  has brought the request to (the) Saudis  attention several times over the past months,  he added.      The Trump administration, according to U.S. officials and a European diplomat, also pressed the Saudis to allow Lebanese Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri to return to Beirut after he flew to Riyadh on Nov.4 and abruptly announced his resignation. The efforts to take the edge off Saudi Arabia s foreign policy reflect growing U.S. concern about Riyadh s direction despite high-profile attempts by President Donald Trump to improve relations with the longtime U.S. ally.              Publicly, Trump, his top aides and senior Saudi officials have hailed what they say is a major improvement in U.S.-Saudi ties compared with relations under former President Barack Obama, who upset the Saudis by sealing a nuclear deal with their arch-foe Iran. Privately, however, U.S. diplomats and intelligence analysts   express growing dismay over Riyadh s foreign policy, especially toward Yemen and Lebanon, as Saudi Arabia aims to contain Iranian influence.      It is my understanding that the administration is frustrated. There has been of course varying degrees of frustration from different members of the administration,  U.S. Senator Todd Young said of the situation in Yemen.  Young, a Republican member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, spoke before the Saudi-led military coalition s decision was announced on Wednesday.         The coalition, which is fighting Houthi rebels, said it would allow humanitarian aid access through Hodeidah and U. N. flights to the capital Sanaa, more than two weeks after blockading the country to stop the flow of arms from Iran. Yemen, in civil war and under bombardment by a Saudi-led coalition, faces a deep humanitarian crisis and aid workers warn of famine if the blockade were not lifted.                   A senior Saudi official told Reuters that even before Tillerson and Prince Mohammed spoke recently, senior White House officials had communicated to the Saudi ambassador in Washington the importance of taking those two steps.  They stressed the importance of addressing the humanitarian situation in Yemen and we said that we understood and that the closures were temporary while we work on a comprehensive aid and access plan,  the official said. An administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed that White House and National Security Council officials worked on easing the blockade with senior Saudi officials, including Prince Mohammed and his younger brother Khalid, the Saudi ambassador to the United States.    Much of the U.S.-Saudi relationship, multiple U.S. officials say, is conducted in a tight circle and led by Trump s son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, who has established a direct channel with Prince Mohammed. Kushner  did not oppose  the pressure on the Saudis and United Arab Emirates to ease humanitarian suffering in Yemen, said one U.S. official. But the official added:  In no way does this change the position that Jared and the Crown Prince evidently share that the main objective is reversing Iranian influence in Yemen and elsewhere.         On Lebanon, the U.S. message to Saudi Arabia about Hariri was conveyed in statements by Tillerson and in private conversations between U.S. and Saudi officials. Those officials included the Saudi state minister for Gulf affairs, Thamer al-Sabhan, who was in Washington recently, a senior administration official said.  We ve encouraged...the Saudis that it will be good for Lebanon s political stability for Hariri to return back to Beirut as soon as is practical,  the official said last week.     Hariri has since returned to Lebanon and shelved his decision to resign as prime minister, easing a crisis that had deepened tensions in the Middle East. Top Lebanese officials have said Saudi Arabia forced Hariri to quit and held him in the kingdom. Riyadh and Hariri deny this. \"],[\"(Reuters) - A member of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir has resigned over its plan to sing at the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump, and more than 22,000 people have signed a petition opposing the choir’s participation. Jan Chamberlin resigned after five years with the choir, which originates from Utah, over the Jan. 20 ceremony, saying it “will appear that (the) Choir is endorsing tyranny and fascism by singing for this man.” With three weeks to go before Trump is sworn in, teen classical singer Jackie Evancho is the only celebrity to have unequivocally embraced her role in an inauguration ceremony marked by soul-searching by larger invited groups, and fan backlash. The 1960s pop group, The Beach Boys, is considering an invitation to perform but has yet to make a final decision, a spokesman for the band said on Friday. “I simply cannot continue with the recent turn of events. I could never look myself in the face again,” Chamberlin wrote in a resignation letter that she posted on Facebook on Thursday. A separate petition on change.org started by Randall Thacker, a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, had gathered more than 22,000 signatures on Friday. The petition says the participation of the Tabernacle Choir in Trump’s inauguration does not reflect the Church’s values and would harm its worldwide image. The Church says taking part in the inauguration is voluntary, and notes that the Tabernacle Choir, which hails from Salt Lake City, Utah, has sung at such celebrations for five previous Republican presidents. Church spokesman Eric Hawkins said on Friday public response to the inauguration plans “has been mixed, with people expressing both opposition and support. The Choir’s participation... is not an implied support of party affiliations or politics. It is a demonstration of our support for freedom, civility and the peaceful transition of power.”  Some dancers in the Radio City Rockettes were also unhappy at performing. “We do a lot of events, but there have been no events that could cause trauma. And doing this would cause trauma for some people,” one Rockettes dancer said this week, speaking anonymously with Marie Claire magazine. Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli suffered a fan backlash on social media after reports that he was planning to sing for Trump. Bocelli and country singer Garth Brooks both backed out of performing at the inauguration. Organizers have denied they are struggling to recruit big names for the ceremony. “This is not Woodstock,” Trump aide Boris Epshteyn told CNN this week. “It’s not about celebrities. As Donald Trump tweeted himself, it’s about the people.” \"],[\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two minor tremors were detected on Saturday from near North Korea s nuclear test site and were probably aftershocks from the country s massive nuclear test in early September, a U.S. Geological Survey official said. The aftershocks, of magnitude 2.9 and 2.4, were detected at  0613 and 0640 GMT (1:13 a.m. and 1:40 a.m. EST) respectively, said the USGS and Lassina Zerbo, executive secretary of the Vienna-based Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization. A tweet from Zerbo said analysts had confirmed that the activity was  tectonic  in origin. The USGS official said the tremors had been in the vicinity of the Punggye-ri nuclear test site, where North Korea conducted its sixth and largest underground nuclear test on Sept. 3.  They re probably relaxation events from the sixth nuclear test,  the official said.  When you have a large nuclear test, it moves the earth s crust around the area, and it takes a while for it to fully subside. We ve had a few of them since the sixth nuclear test.  Pyongyang said the September test was of an H-bomb, and experts have estimated it was 10 times more powerful than the U.S. atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in 1945. A series of quakes since then has prompted experts and observers to suspect the test might have damaged the mountainous location of its site in the northwest tip of North Korea, where all of the country s nuclear tests have been conducted. South Korea s spy agency told South Korean lawmakers in October that North Korea might be readying two more tunnels at the site.  North Korea hinted its next nuclear test could be above ground after U.S. President Donald Trump warned in September that the United States would  totally destroy  North Korea if it threatened America. Another possible obstacle to North Korea s use of Punggye-ri for tests is the nearby active volcano of Mount Paektu, which North Koreans consider a sacred site. Its last eruption was in 1903, and experts have debated whether nuclear testing could trigger another. North Korea s official media reported on Saturday that national leader Kim Jong Un had scaled Mount Paektu with senior military officials to  emphasize his military vision  after completion of the country s nuclear force. Kim declared the nuclear force complete after the test of North Korea s largest ever intercontinental ballistic missile last month, which experts said puts all of America within range. \"],[\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A member of President Donald Trump’s transition team, Makan Delrahim, will be nominated to head the U.S. Justice Department’s Antitrust Division, the White House said on Monday. Delrahim is expected to move to the Justice Department after finishing up in the White House counsel’s office, where he has worked to steer Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch through the Senate confirmation process. The Senate must vote to confirm Delrahim once the nomination is formalized.   As the proposed chief of the Antitrust Division, Delrahim would review corporate mergers at a time when many investors and corporate executives are anticipating a more relaxed view of deal-making after years of tough oversight by the administration of former President Barack Obama.       Antitrust experts who have followed Delrahim’s career have said that when it comes to merger approvals he would follow in the footsteps of a former boss, Hewitt Pate, who was assistant attorney general of antitrust from 2003 to 2005. Delrahim was Pate’s deputy, specializing in international antitrust. Under Pate, the division was criticized for allowing too many deals, but it sued to stop US Airways from merging with United Airlines and blocked a deal to combine DirecTV and EchoStar. It tried but failed to stop Oracle Corp from buying PeopleSoft. “I know Makan Delrahim to be smart, energetic and expert in antitrust. He is certainly no pushover,” said Seth Bloom, a former general counsel of the Senate antitrust subcommittee who knew Delrahim when both worked on Capitol Hill.     Reuters first exclusively reported on March 17 that Delrahim was expected to be nominated to head the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division. If confirmed, Delrahim would oversee the Justice Department’s assessment of AT&T’s Inc plan to buy Time Warner Inc, the owner of HBO, Warner Brothers and news network CNN.     The department is reviewing a number of major transactions in seeds and agricultural chemicals, like the mergers of Dow Chemical Co and Dupont, and of Bayer  and Monsanto. Those proposed deals, along with ChemChina’s purchase of Syngenta, would consolidate six agricultural chemical companies into three.Before going to work at the White House after Trump’s inauguration in January, Delrahim was a lobbyist with the law firm Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck, LLP. One client in 2016 was health insurer Anthem Inc, which this year lost a court fight with the Justice Department over whether it would be allowed to merge with Cigna. Anthem has appealed the loss. \"],[\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Justice Anthony Kennedy’s legal reasoning in a 2015 immigration case suggests the U.S. Supreme Court’s frequent swing vote would be skeptical of President Donald Trump’s travel ban on people from seven Muslim-majority countries. The little-noticed case involved an Afghan-born naturalized U.S. citizen named Fauzia Din who argued she had the right for a full explanation from the U.S. government as to why her Afghan husband was denied entry. The justices ruled 5-4 against her.  Kennedy wrote in a concurring opinion that in some circumstances the U.S. government’s motives in denying someone entry could be subject to legal review.  In their lawsuit challenging Trump’s Jan. 27 ban, the states of Washington and Minnesota cited Kennedy’s opinion. Lower courts have temporarily blocked the ban, but the administration may ask the Supreme Court to revive it. Trump’s executive order barred entry for citizens from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days and imposed a 120-day halt on all refugees, except refugees from Syria who are barred indefinitely. Curbing entry to the United States as a national security measure was a central premise of Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, originally proposed as a temporary ban on all Muslims. He has voiced frustration at the legal challenge to his order. Washington and Minnesota argued that Trump’s order violated the U.S. Constitution by discriminating against Muslims. Trump during the presidential campaign called for a “total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.” In the 2015 case, Din, who lives in Fremont, California, sued the U.S. government after her husband, Afghan citizen Kanishka Berashk, was denied a visa in 2009. She objected to the government’s visa denial under a law giving consular officials wide discretion to bar people linked to “terrorist activities.” The high court’s ruling overturned a 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals decision that said Din was right to insist the government give her more information about the visa denial. Kennedy’s opinion suggested he could be willing to dig into the Trump administration’s rationale for the order, said Mark Haddad, the Los Angeles-based lawyer who represented Din in the 2015 case.  “The ostensible reason for the travel ban is security but that’s not a good faith concern if the underlying reason is religious animus,” Haddad said.  Kennedy’s opinion showed he is “not prepared to give complete and total deference to the executive branch in the enforcement of immigration laws,” Haddad added. Samuel Alito, one of the court’s most conservative justices, signed onto Kennedy’s opinion. In total, six of the current eight justices suggested in that 2015 case that the government was not immune from scrutiny over immigration-related decisions if there was evidence of a questionable motive. The case brought by Washington and Minnesota, or one of several similar disputes around the country, could reach the high court quickly in the wake of Thursday’s decision by a three-judge panel of the San Francisco-based 9th Circuit upholding a Seattle district judge’s decision to block Trump’s order. The Trump administration would need to win the support of five of the current eight justices to reinstate the order while litigation over the legality of the directive continues. It could also seek to end the litigation by issuing a new order.  Neil Gorsuch, Trump’s nominee to fill a lingering vacancy, is awaiting Senate confirmation hearings and is unlikely to be seated on the court for at least two months. The 2015 case, called Kerry v. Din, was cited both by the challenging states and the Trump administration in their court fight. Washington state’s lawyers argued Kennedy’s opinion showed that courts must look at what motivated the government’s decision beyond the words that appear in the order itself. They cited the previous comments by Trump and others expressing a desire to keep Muslims from entering the United States. The administration noted in court papers Kennedy also made it clear that the government is entitled to deference, especially on national security. Anil Kalhan, an immigration law professor at Drexel University’s Kline School of Law in Philadelphia, said there are multiple ways of interpreting Kennedy’s opinion, which could muddy the waters.  Kennedy’s opinion “doesn’t necessarily mean he would reach the same conclusion” on Trump’s ban, Kalhan said. In Tuesday’s 9th Circuit oral argument, administration lawyer August Flentje called the executive order “facially legitimate,” meaning there is no need for courts to inquire further into motive. Judge Michelle Friedland immediately pounced: “Haven’t there been allegations here of bad faith?” She said Kennedy’s opinion in the Din case as well as a 1972 Supreme Court ruling in a case with similar themes “envision that’s something we should look at.” The 1972 case involved professors objecting to the U.S. government’s decision not to allow a Marxist academic to speak at a Stanford University conference. The appeals court cited both cases in its Thursday ruling.\"],[\"(Reuters) - Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton said on Wednesday the attack in Brussels that killed more than 30 people is the “latest brutal reminder” that more must be done to defeat Islamic State militants, including by European Union member countries. In an address at Stanford University in California, Clinton said the United States and Europe should take a “harder look” at protocols at airports and other “soft sites” that are outside security perimeters.  Clinton also said “there is much we can do to support our European partners” but “there is also more they can do to share the burden with us.” Clinton said she would like to see more European countries investing in defense and security in the way Germany has during the Obama administration. “The most urgent task is stopping the flow of foreign fighters to and from the Middle East” who are citizens of France, Germany, Belgium and the United Kingdom with European passports that make it easier for them to cross into Syria and return radicalized, Clinton said. Clinton said that many European nations do not currently alert their neighbors when they turn away a “suspected jihadist” at their border or when a citizen’s passport is stolen. European Union countries also need to share traveler information more readily, Clinton said. “It’s actually easier for the United States to get flight manifests from EU nations than it is for EU nations to get them from their own neighbors, thanks to an agreement that the United States negotiated when I was secretary of state,” Clinton said. Additional steps that could be taken in Europe are the creation of a “new, unified, European border and coast guard” to strengthen the external borders of a continent that is under “unprecedented pressure from refugees and migrants,” Clinton said. Clinton also praised past partnerships between the United States and Europe, calling the NATO alliance between North American and European countries one of the best investments that America has made. Republican front-runner Donald Trump has in recent days said that the United States should rethink its involvement in the decades-old alliance. Clinton also took aim at Trump, along with presidential rival U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, when she slammed “offensive, inflammatory rhetoric that demonizes all Muslims,” including those who could be partners in the fight against terrorism. \"],[\"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Illinois’ two top Republican legislators said on Wednesday they will introduce legislation soon to let the state take over the cash-strapped Chicago public school system, permit the district to file for municipal bankruptcy and eventually allow for city-wide school board elections. The plan has the backing of Republican Governor Bruce Rauner, who has embraced allowing local governments facing financial turmoil to file for bankruptcy. But it is strongly opposed by Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who controls the city’s schools, the Chicago Teachers Union, and by Democratic leaders, who control the legislature. Senate Minority Leader Christine Radogno and House Minority Leader Jim Durkin, both Republican allies of Rauner, said a new approach is needed to rescue the Chicago Public Schools (CPS)from financial mismanagement and near collapse. Rauner told reporters Emanuel has failed to address the school district’s fiscal woes over the nearly five years he has been mayor.  “His message to us in state government has been for months, ‘We have a crisis. We need $500 million. We want the state to give it to us.’ That’s not a reasonable message. That’s not a reasonable request,” Rauner said. The nation’s third-largest school system has a structural budget deficit topping $1 billion and credit ratings that have fallen deep into the “junk” level.  The district’s current budget has a $480 million gap that officials hope to fill with bigger pension funding support from the state. But the plan has become entangled in a state budget stalemate between Rauner and Democrats.  The Republicans’ plan would amend an existing law permitting state oversight of fiscally troubled schools to include CPS and allow for an independent authority to run the district, while making it clear the state is not liable for school debt. Once solvency is regained, an elected school board would take control.  The plan would also open the door to Chapter 9 municipal bankruptcy while protecting general obligation bondholders with a statutory lien. “The mayor is 100 percent opposed to Governor Rauner’s ‘plan’ to drive CPS bankrupt,” Emanuel spokeswoman Kelley Quinn said in a statement, adding that the state has been shortchanging Chicago students. House Speaker Michael Madigan rejected the plan, pointing to Michigan’s takeover of the city of Flint, which has led to a health crisis from lead-tainted water. “The disaster in Flint, Michigan, is a very timely example of how reckless decisions just to save a buck can have devastating consequences on children and families,” Madigan said in a statement. Senate President John Cullerton, a Chicago Democrat, said the Republicans’ “mean-spirited” plan is not going to happen.  CPS has scheduled an $875 million bond sale for next week, partly to free up revenue for its sagging budget. \"],[\"BEIJING (Reuters) - China wants dialogue with the new U.S. administration to manage disputes and promote bilateral relations, but only on the basis of respecting each other’s core interests, like the “one China” principle, China’s foreign minister said. U.S. President Donald Trump, who was inaugurated on Friday, upset Beijing before taking office by casting doubt on the “one China” principle, under which Washington acknowledges Beijing’s position of sovereignty over self-ruled Taiwan. China views Taiwan as a wayward province, to be brought under its control by force if necessary. However, proudly democratic Taiwan has shown no interest in being ruled by Beijing. Speaking at a reception for the upcoming Chinese Lunar New Year, Foreign Minister Wang Yi said the future direction of Sino-U.S. ties had “attracted attention”. “We are willing, on the basis of strictly abiding by the ‘one China’ principle and respect of each other’s core interests, to have dialogue with the new U.S. government,” Wang said, in comments posted on the ministry’s website late Tuesday. China is willing to “increase mutual trust, focus cooperation, manage and control disputes and promote the healthy development of China-U.S. relations, to bring even greater benefits to both peoples”, he added. Separately, state news agency Xinhua quoted Chinese ambassador to Washington, Cui Tiankai as saying that while the Trump administration has yet to formulate a China policy, the general trend of China-U.S. cooperation cannot be reversed as it is “the only right choice” for both. In any trade war, both countries would suffer, he added. “Currently, the world economy needs a strong engine to lead to stronger development and faster growth, it’s inescapable responsibility for China and the United States to do this, rather than heading toward a trade war,” Cui said. With Trump’s decision to quit the Transpacific Trade Partnership (TPP), Cui said China cannot take over the U.S. role as the global leader who makes trade rules. “I think this is a misleading notion, because international trade rules cannot be made by the United States or China alone, and rather, they should be made and implemented by all nations in the world,” Cui said. \"],[\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson canceled public  events on Tuesday after a van carrying three volunteers and a campaign staffer slid on ice in Iowa, flipped on its side and was hit by another vehicle, his campaign said.  One of the volunteers, Braden Joplin, 25, died after being taken to a trauma center at the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha, the hospital said in a statement released by the Carson campaign. The other three people were treated and released from a hospital in Atlantic, Iowa, the statement said. Carson, a retired neurosurgeon, was traveling from South Carolina to Omaha where he planned to meet with Joplin’s family members and offer his condolences, the hospital statement said. Carson is among a dozen Republican presidential candidates crisscrossing Iowa before the state’s Feb. 1 caucuses, the nation’s first contest to determine the party’s nominee in November’s presidential election.

In a statement on his Facebook page, the head of the anti-immigration Freedom Party (FPO) did not say whether he would attend the inauguration ceremony on Jan. 20, but did state he would not be meeting Trump himself. Spokesmen for his party were not immediately available for comment.   Strache’s visit is likely to raise fresh questions about ties between European far-right parties and people close to Trump. FPO officials met people close to Trump, including his pick for national security adviser Michael Flynn, on a recent visit to the United States, the party said last month. “There is a series of invitations to talks with interesting political representatives of the United States on the sidelines of the U.S. president’s inauguration on our packed schedule,” Strache said, adding that he would be accompanied by an FPO delegation. French presidential candidate Marine Le Pen was seen at Trump Tower last week, but a spokesman for Trump said she did not meet with him or his team.  The Kleine Zeitung newspaper said Strache’s delegation would include Norbert Hofer, who narrowly failed to become president last year, which would have made him the first freely elected far-right head of state in Europe since World War Two.  Strache said “good diplomatic and economic relations” between Austria and the United States were a priority for him given his party’s “possible future government responsibilities”. Austria’s centrist government’s mandate runs until next year. “In order to avoid unnecessary speculation, a meeting with the future U.S. president, Donald Trump, is not planned,” Strache said.   \"],[\"TOKYO (Reuters) - U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross is expected to join Vice President Mike Pence for a bilateral economic dialogue in Tokyo next month, a Japanese government official with direct knowledge of preparations said on Thursday, dashing Tokyo’s hope of leaving thorny issues on trade off the negotiating table. Participants of the dialogue, led by Pence and Japanese Deputy Prime Minister Taro Aso, will hold their first round of talks in Tokyo on April 18 to discuss issues ranging from macroeconomic policy, infrastructure investment and trade. The dialogue will be a major test of U.S. President Donald Trump’s confrontational approach to trade. Senior administration officials, including Ross, have signaled they would press Japan to remove non-tarrif trade barriers and buy more U.S. products. Japan, which proposed the dialogue, had hoped to keep contentious issues like auto and agriculture trade out of the talks by proposing an agenda focused on infrastructure investment and energy. One of Tokyo’s strategy was to keep the bilateral dialogue as informal as possible so Aso can deal directly with Pence, who is regarded as having a less confrontational view on trade compared with others in the Trump administration, Japanese government officials said. “The agenda is vague now, but if friction comes up in the future, our plan is to say let’s discuss that in the Aso-Pence dialogue and then use the dialogue to diffuse any problems,” one of the officials said on condition of anonymity as he was not authorized to speak publicly. The participation of Ross heightens the chance the dialogue would serve as a venue to discuss a bilateral trade deal, which could put Japan under U.S. pressure to open up heavily-protected areas like agriculture and pharmaceuticals, the officials said. Hiroshige Seko, Japan’s ministry of economy, trade and industry, and Foreign Minister Fumiko Kishida will also join the dialogue, the government officials said. Ross has been known to have close ties with Japan, having led a firm investing in the country since 1997 and serving as chairman of the Japan Society - a non-profit organization promoting bilateral relations, since 2010. \"],[\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Key members of the U.S. Congress said Friday they had reached a compromise to shift more than $1 billion to try to keep struggling families together, including those with babies born dependant on opioids. The proposal is driven in part by an opioid crisis that threatens thousands of families. The bill would allow mental health, substance abuse and parenting assistance whenever a child is deemed at “imminent risk” of entering foster care. The measure also offers support for relatives who unexpectedly assume responsibility for a child when a parent cannot. Under current law, such funds may only be spent after a child enters foster care. A spokesman for the Child Welfare League of America, John Sciamanna, called the proposed change “a landmark…, potentially historic.” The legislation involves more than $1 billion over 10 years. Related opioid bills have not included funding. “This bill would make a historic shift in child welfare funding by offering a way for moms and dads to get help and treatment rather than pitching in only after children are removed from home,” said Sen. Ron Wyden, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee. The bill is a compromise between four powerful members of Congress: Wyden; the Senate Finance committee’s Republican chair, Orrin Hatch of Utah; the Republican chair of the House Ways & Means Committee, Kevin Brady of Texas; and the ranking Democrat on Ways & Means, Sander Levin of Michigan. The plan offers “bipartisan solutions for families and children affected by the opioid addiction crisis,” Hatch said in a statement. In December, a Reuters investigation revealed that at least 110 babies had died since 2010 after being born opioid-dependent and sent home with parents ill-prepared to care for them. No more than nine of the 50 U.S. states followed a federal law requiring them to help those newborns, the news agency found. In response to the Reuters series, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services asked all states to report by June 30 whether and how they are following the existing law, known as the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act. In May, the House passed legislation to improve safety planning for children born dependent on opioid drugs. Reanne Pederson of Devils Lake, N.D., one of the women portrayed in the Reuters series who accidentally smothered her newborn in bed while on drugs, said she was happy to hear about new funding possibilities. “It’s important to me that moms who are struggling with addiction get help,” she said. \"],[\"YANGON (Reuters) - Myanmar authorities have found 10 bodies buried in a mass grave on the edge of a village in Rakhine State, the military-run newspaper Myawady reported on Tuesday, a day after the army said it had launched an investigation at the site. About 650,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled from Rakhine state and sought refuge in neighboring Bangladesh in recent months after a violent crackdown there by Myanmar security forces in response to attacks by militants.    Rights monitors have accused troops of atrocities, including killings, mass rape and arson during the crackdown. The United States has said it amounted to  ethnic cleansing . The Myanmar military has said its own internal investigation had exonerated security forces of all accusations of atrocities. A team including police, a local administrator, judge and doctor had examined the grave site, at the village of Inn Din, about 50 km (30 miles) north of the state capital Sittwe, on Tuesday and discovered 10 unidentified bodies, Myawady said.  This group is continuing the process of investigation to uncover the truth,  the report said. Military officials were not immediately available for further comment. The discovery of a mass grave near a cemetery in the village was announced in a statement on the army commander-in-chief s official Facebook page on Monday. The village is in Maungdaw township, one of the areas worst affected by the violence that has prompted the United Nations  top human rights official to allege that Myanmar s security forces may have committed genocide against the Rohingya.   Myanmar s armed forces launched what they termed clearance operations in northern Rakhine, where many of the stateless Muslim minority lived, after Rohingya militants attacked 30 police posts and an army base on Aug. 25.   Myanmar s civilian leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, has faced fierce international criticism for failing to do more to protect the Rohingya.   The civilian government, which has no control over the military, has said the army was engaged in legitimate counter-insurgency operations. It has promised to investigate allegations of abuses in Rakhine if it is given evidence. \"],[\"(Reuters) - Maine Governor Paul LePage apologized on Friday for an obscenity-laced voicemail he left for a lawmaker who he believed had called him a racist for remarks he made about drug dealers.  The incident followed a town hall meeting on Wednesday during which LePage said he kept a binder with photographs of drug dealers arrested in Maine and more than 90 percent of them were black or Hispanic, the Portland Press Herald reported.  The governor’s remarks triggered a barrage of criticism from political figures and the American Civil Liberties Union of Maine.  LePage left the voicemail message for State Representative Drew Gattine after a television reporter said the lawmaker was among several people who had called the governor a racist. According to a recording of the message obtained by the Portland Press Herald, LePage said in the message, “Mr. Gattine, this is Gov. Paul Richard LePage. I would like to talk to you about your comments about my being a racist, you cocksucker. I want to talk to you. I want you to prove that I’m a racist.   “I’ve spent my life helping black people and you little son-of-a-bitch, socialist cocksucker. You … I need you to, just friggin. I want you to record this and make it public because I am after you. Thank you.”  The governor later told local reporters that he wished he could settle the dispute with Gattine by means of an armed duel. Gattine did not respond immediately to calls for comment.     He told the Press Herald that LePage’s voicemail was “uncalled for” and that he never said the governor was a racist. An editorial in the Press Herald, speaking for the state’s voters, said Maine apologized to America for electing, then re-electing a “governor who is unfit for high office.” After the voicemail became public, LePage issued a statement apologizing to Maine citizens for calling Gattine “the worst word [he] could think of” in the voicemail. The governor defended his choice of language by saying the remarks were “simply a metaphor” that harkens back to the 1820s when political opponents “used to call each other out.” “I meant no physical harm to Gattine,” LePage said in the statement.  It is not the first time LePage has found himself the subject of controversy. Earlier this year, he said that drug dealers “come up here, they sell their heroin and they go home. Incidentally, half the time, they impregnate a young white girl before they leave.” He later said the comment was a “slip-up” and that he meant to say that drug traffickers get “young Maine girls” pregnant and that most residents of Maine are white. Also in January, LePage told Maine gun owners they should “load up and get rid of the drug dealers.”  \"],[\"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - The African National Congress (ANC), South Africa s ruler since the end of apartheid, faces perhaps the most pivotal few days in its recent history when it meets over the weekend to choose a successor to Jacob Zuma as party leader. The ANC s electoral dominance means whoever wins the job is likely to become South Africa s next president. But Zuma s presidency, tainted by corruption and scandal, has badly tarnished the ANC s image both at home and abroad. The party once led by Nelson Mandela is now deeply divided. Investors will also be watching events closely. Economic growth in Africa s traditional powerhouse has been  lethargic over the last six years and the jobless rate stands near record levels. Political instability, including the questions over who will replace Zuma, has been cited by credit rating agencies as a big  factor behind their decision to cut South Africa to  junk . The two frontrunners in the race are Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa and Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, a former cabinet minister and ex-wife of the president, who is backing her.  Ramaphosa s promises to fight corruption and revitalize the economy have gone down well with foreign investors and ANC members who think Zuma s handling of the economy could cost the party dearly in the next national election set for 2019. Dlamini-Zuma is associated with a radical brand of wealth redistribution which is popular with poorer ANC voters angry at racial inequality. Analysts say the outcome of the leadership contest is too close to call and that the bitterness of the power struggle between Ramaphosa and Dlamini-Zuma has increased the chances of the party splitting before the national election. The Ramaphosa camp sees the faction aligned with Zuma and Dlamini-Zuma as having seized control of the ANC and betrayed the values of the anti-apartheid struggle which it led. Dlamini-Zuma s team thinks Ramaphosa would not be decisive enough in addressing the gaping racial inequalities that persist in South Africa - the core of her campaign. Some analysts say Zuma s influence over who succeeds him has been diminished by his travails. The 75-year-old president has faced   and denied   numerous corruption allegations since taking office in 2009 and has survived several votes of no-confidence in parliament. The ANC expects to announce the winner early on Sunday, the second day of a five-day party conference which only takes place once every five years, ANC spokesman Zizi Kodwa said. Party officials insist members will accept the outcome of the leadership vote and avoid a fallout.  We need to take out this item from the conference agenda as quickly as possible,  ANC spokesman Kodwa told radio station 702 on Friday. Disillusioned ANC members have left to form new political groupings on several occasions   the most recent example being the African Democratic Change party founded by former ANC lawmaker Makhosi Khoza this year. In August, Zuma narrowly survived another attempt in parliament to force him from office after some members of his party voted with the opposition. Enoch Godongwana, who chairs a party committee on economic policy, said there had been interactions between the main opposing party factions to prevent the party splintering.  If the ANC collapses, do you have anything in its place which can hold this country together on a national basis? I would argue that at this stage in time you simply do not have a replacement for the ANC,  he told reporters on Thursday. Ramaphosa, a former trade union leader who became one of South Africa s richest people, is seen as more business-friendly than Dlamini-Zuma and the five other leadership contenders. Ramaphosa edged Dlamini-Zuma by getting the majority of nominations to become leader of the party, but it is far from certain he will become the next leader and therefore the likely next president. He is expected to be backed by ANC veterans, labor unions and civil society organizations.   If Dlamini-Zuma wins, a split is very likely, because the Ramaphosa camp views itself as the  old ANC . This is a last attempt by them to regain control of the party from the Zuma faction,  said Darias Jonker, director for Africa at Eurasia Group. Political analyst Ralph Mathekga said he thought Dlamini-Zuma would win the leadership, partly because of her strong support in KwaZulu-Natal province, which is sending the most delegates to the conference. As well as Zuma s support, she also has the backing of the ANC s influential women s and youth leagues.  The rand rallied on Friday on signs that her bid for the ANC leadership was weakened by court cases which will obstruct some delegates who back her from attending the party conference in Johannesburg. As well as electing a new leader, the ANC will choose senior officials such as the secretary general and members of the National Executive Committee. It will also set policy priorities for the leadup to the 2019 election. \"],[\"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian police charged a 38-year-old man on Friday for allegedly assaulting former prime minister and same-sex marriage opponent Tony Abbott in the Tasmanian city of Hobart.   The man was charged with  Common Assault  following an investigation into a complaint made by Abbott, Tasmania police said on its Facebook page. Abbott told local media he was  headbutted  by a man wearing a  yes  badge in support of same-sex marriage on Thursday evening. Australia began a non-compulsory postal vote this month to determine whether it becomes the 25th country to legalize same-sex marriage. The emotionally charged campaign has seen an alarming volume of hate speech, spurring parliament to pass emergency legislation to outlaw opponents spewing their vitriol while the vote was in progress. Abbott, who is actively campaigning for the  no  side,  sustained minor injuries from the attack including a slightly swollen lip. Police did not comment on the motivation of the attack. Earlier this month, the godson of former prime minister Kevin Rudd was allegedly assaulted in Brisbane by a man who was tearing down rainbow flags put up in support of same-sex marriage. In May, Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce, who is openly gay, had a lemon meringue pie launched at his face in a protest about his advocacy for same-sex marriage.     \"],[\"UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United Nations Security Council will meet on Friday at the request of eight states on the 15-member body over U.S. President Donald Trump s decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, diplomats said on Wednesday.  The request for U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to publicly brief the Security Council meeting was made by France, Bolivia, Egypt, Italy, Senegal, Sweden, Britain and Uruguay, said diplomats.  Trump abruptly reversed decades of U.S. policy on Wednesday, generating outrage from Palestinians and defying warnings of Middle East unrest. Trump also plans to move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv. Israel considers the city its eternal and indivisible capital and wants all embassies based there. Palestinians want the capital of an independent Palestinian state to be in the city s eastern sector, which Israel captured in a 1967 war and annexed in a move never recognized internationally.  The U.N. has given Jerusalem a special legal and political status, which the Security Council has called upon the international community to respect. That is why we believe the Council needs to address this issue with urgency,  Deputy Swedish U.N. Ambassador Carl Skau said on Wednesday. A U.N. Security Council resolution adopted in December last year  underlines that it will not recognize any changes to the 4 June 1967 lines, including with regard to Jerusalem, other than those agreed by the parties through negotiations.   That resolution was approved with 14 votes in favor and an abstention by former U.S. President Barack Obama s administration, which defied heavy pressure from long-time ally Israel and Trump for Washington to wield its veto. After Trump spoke on Wednesday, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told reporters:  I have consistently spoken out against any unilateral measures that would jeopardize the prospect of peace for Israelis and Palestinians.   In this moment of great anxiety, I want to make it clear: There is no alternative to the two-state solution. There is no Plan B,  he said.  I will do everything in my power to support the Israeli and Palestinian leaders to return to meaningful negotiations.  U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley praised Trump s decision as  the just and right thing to do.  \"],[\"THE HAGUE (Reuters) - Dutch far-right politician Geert Wilders said Donald Trump’s victory in the U.S. presidential election was a sign that the West was living through a “patriotic spring” that would boost support for populist parties in Europe like his own. Wilders, whose anti-immigration, anti-Muslim Freedom Party tops polls ahead of next year’s parliamentary elections, said mainstream politicians had lost the trust of voters in the West by ignoring the issues they cared most about. “Trump winning proved to me that people are fed up with politically correct politicians who are concerned and involved with issues that regard themselves but not those that are important to the public,” he said. \"],[\"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The television audience for Thursday’s restrained Republican Party presidential debate on CNN was down from last week’s figures, according to preliminary Nielsen data on Friday.

That’s well below the 11.5 rating garnered by the rowdy March 3 Republican debate, broadcast by the Fox News Channel, which translated to 16.9 million viewers. The size of the audience in millions is expected to be available from Nielsen later on Friday.

The Iraqi Joint Operations Command said the offensive to capture Hawija in northern Iraq  will be swift,  state TV reported.  The action, announced by Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, took place four days before a referendum on Kurdish independence due to be held in northern Iraq, including Kirkuk. Abadi says Monday s referendum is against the constitution and has called on the autonomous Kurdistan Regional Government to cancel it. Kirkuk is shaping up as a flashpoint ahead of the independence vote as it is also home to Arab and Turkmen communities who oppose breaking away from Iraq. Kurdish Peshmerga forces took control of Kirkuk after the Iraqi army collapsed in the face of Islamic State offensive in 2014, preventing the militants from capturing the oil fields. A U.S.-led international coalition is providing air support to the Iraqi forces  offensive on Hawija, state TV said.  The Iraqi forces, deployed north and west of Hawija district, are pushing southward along the Tigris River and had cleared the first lines of defense by midday, state TV said.  A total of 23 villages were captured from Islamic State, said the operation s commander, Lieutenant General Abdul Ameer Yarallah, cited by the TV channel.  We finished the first chapter of the liberation operation,  in Hawija, he said, without indicating the timing of the second chapter.    The United Nations last week said up to 85,000 people could be displaced from the Hawija region. Up to 30,000 children are in extreme danger, Save the Children said on Thursday.   They have already suffered horribly under ISIS rule...food, water and medicine are running out, with many children reportedly weak and malnourished,  the organization said.   It is imperative that all Iraqi and coalition forces open up safe escape routes for people and allow civilians to flee to wherever is safest,  it added. Iraqi forces and Sunni tribal fighters also captured on Thursday the region of Ana, in the Euphrates River valley, as they pushed toward the Syria border, a military statement said.  The offensive on Hawija should not affect the Kurdish plan to hold the referendum in Kirkuk on Monday, a Kurdish official told Reuters.   The Peshmerga hold the frontlines with the Hawija district from the eastern side, near Kirkuk, but are not taking part in the offensive, he said.    Hawija, north of Baghdad, and a stretch of land along the Syrian border, west of the Iraqi capital, are the last pieces of the country still in the hands of Islamic State. The group overran about a third of Iraq in 2014. Islamic State s self-declared caliphate effectively collapsed in July, when U.S.-backed Iraqi forces captured Mosul, the group s de facto capital in Iraq, after a grueling nine-month battle. Kurdish Peshmerga fighters took part in operations against the militants.  Islamic State also controls territory in Syria, along the Iraqi border but it is shrinking fast in the face of a U.S.-backed Kurdish-led coalition and Russian and Iranian-backed forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.            \"],[\"BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina s President Mauricio Macri vowed to press ahead with reforms to the country s tax, labor and retirement systems in a speech on Monday, a week after his  Let s Change  coalition swept to victory at the polls in midterm elections. The government will present a tax reform proposal this Tuesday or Wednesday, and an amnesty plan for companies that hired workers informally in the coming days, Macri said. He added that the government would convene a commission to propose changes to the retirement system in coming weeks. The speech marked a roadmap for the second half of Macri s four-year term, as he seeks to implement business-friendly reforms to attract investors who avoided the country during more than a decade of populist rule.   We need lower taxes, more public works, and all this we need to achieve with fiscal balance,  Macri told a gathering of lawmakers, governors, union leaders, judges and others. Investors have been encouraged by the reforms Macri has implemented since taking office in December 2015, including lifting foreign exchange controls, settling with holdout creditors, and lowering export taxes. But significant investment has not arrived. Companies have demanded lower costs, while credit agencies are concerned about a deep fiscal deficit.  Macri s coalition swept the five most populous areas in  midterm elections, giving him a broader mandate to pass reforms, though it still lacks majorities in both chambers of Congress. Macri said his government had reduced the country s tax burden, and wanted to make the system  simpler, clearer, and fairer.   He reiterated the government s aim of slashing Argentina s fiscal deficit by one percentage point of gross domestic product per year. And he also vowed to reform the country s retirement system, a large driver of government spending.   We need to start a mature and honest conversation about our retirement and pension system,  Macri said.  Our retirement system hides serious inequities, and it is not sustainable.   While Macri has said he does not plan major changes to the country s labor code, he has said the government plans to provide incentives to companies to formalize undeclared workers and work with unions in specific sectors to lower costs. Macri also pledged reforms to the country s justice system to combat corruption. Cabinet Chief Marcos Pena told journalists that the resignation on Monday of chief prosecutor Alejandra Gils Carbo, appointed during the former administration of President Cristina Fernandez, was a step towards making the judiciary more independent. \"],[\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida said on Wednesday he is  considering running for re-election and may decide to jump into the race as early as this weekend, a move that could help Republicans retain their majority in the U.S. Senate.  “I’ll go home later this week. And I’ll have some time with my family. And then, if there’s a change in our status, I’ll be sure to let everyone know,” the former Republican presidential candidate told reporters in the U.S. Capitol.  Rubio, 45, first elected to the Senate in 2010, announced his retirement from the Senate in March after losing Florida’s presidential primary. But Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell and others have been pressuring him to reconsider, citing polling data showing him to be the only Republican who can win the election in Florida.  Rubio confirmed a Politico report that he was urged to run for re-election on Sunday in Orlando, Florida, by one of the Republicans contending for the seat, his friend Lieutenant Governor Carlos Lopez-Cantera. The two men were in Orlando after the shooting that killed 49 people at a gay nightclub. Another Florida Republican hopeful, U.S. Representative David Jolly, has indicated he would step aside if Rubio entered the race. Rubio must decide whether to seek re-election by June 24, the filing deadline for Florida’s August primary. \"],[\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Congress approved a stop-gap funding bill on Wednesday that averts a looming federal government shutdown and provides urgently needed money to help battle an outbreak of the Zika virus. Passage of the bipartisan legislation came shortly after Republicans and Democrats ended a months-long fight over whether Washington should provide aid to the city of Flint, Michigan, as it struggles with a crisis over contaminated drinking water. Separate legislation was approved by the House of Representatives earlier in the day setting aid for Flint. It must now be reconciled with a somewhat different bill passed by the Senate.   The House voted 342-85 in a late-night session on Wednesday to approve stop-gap funding to keep the U.S. government operating from Oct. 1, the start of the new fiscal year, until Dec. 9, when lawmakers will attempt to approve longer-term money. With existing funds due to expire on Saturday, House Appropriations Committee Chairman Hal Rogers said the legislation “is a last resort, but at this point it is what we must do ... to keep the lights on in our government.” The Senate voted 72-26 earlier on Wednesday to adopt the short-term spending bill. Besides providing money to keep the government operating, the legislation also contains $1.1 billion to battle the Zika virus that has hit Puerto Rico hard and spread to U.S. states, most notably Florida. The disease can cause severe birth defects. Funds would be used to develop a vaccine and reduce Zika exposure. The bill also includes $500 million for flood relief in Louisiana and other states. In a series of carefully orchestrated maneuvers after the Senate approved the temporary funding, the House passed a wide-ranging water resources bill containing $170 million to assist Flint by a vote of 399-25. Democrats have demanded action on the crisis, which stems from dangerous levels of lead in Flint’s drinking water. A Senate version of the bill contains $220 million for Flint and other cities with problem water systems. The two chambers will have to hammer out compromise legislation after the Nov. 8 presidential and congressional elections. Wednesday’s flurry of activity in Congress came as lawmakers rushed to recess this week until after the elections.        Conservative groups urged Congress to defeat the funding bill. However, with House and Senate members facing an imminent deadline for approving new money and lawmakers eager to go home to campaign for re-election, the measure moved quickly through Congress on Wednesday. The White House said it was disappointed that the temporary funding bill continued a provision barring the Securities and Exchange Commission from taking action to increase transparency in public companies’ political spending. It also expressed disappointment that Congress failed to take steps to ensure that the Export-Import Bank was able to fully operate its loan guarantee programs. Nevertheless, President Barack Obama is expected to sign the bill into law. \"],[\"MANILA (Reuters) - Leaders from across Asia joined U.S. President Donald Trump at an extravagant gala dinner in the Philippines  capital on Sunday, a show of amity in a region fraught with tensions that have lurked behind his marathon tour of the continent. Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte set the tone of cordiality ahead of the two days of summit meetings he will host, suggesting that despite their differences over claims to the South China Sea, the leaders should not discuss the issue.  We have to be friends, the other hotheads would like us to confront China and the rest of the world on so many issues,  Duterte said at a business conference, as planes carrying heads of state and government attending the summit landed in quick succession in Manila.   The South China Sea is better left untouched, nobody can afford to go to war. It can ill-afford a violent confrontation.  Hours earlier, during a bilateral visit to Vietnam, Trump offered to mediate in the dispute over the South China Sea, where four Southeast Asian countries and Taiwan contest China s sweeping claims to the busy waterway. All the claimants will be at the summit, except for Taiwan. Trump will join leaders of Southeast and East Asian nations in Manila over the next two days, the last leg of a tour that has taken him to Japan, South Korea and China as well as Vietnam. The sheer length of the trip - the longest to Asia by a U.S. president in more than a quarter century - may reassure some that, despite Trump s  America First  policy, Washington remains committed to a region China sees as its strategic domain. Leaders of the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), China, Russia, Japan, Canada, South Korea, India, Australia and New Zealand arrived one by one for a glitzy gala dinner where they were entertained by singers and dancers. Each of the men sported a cream-colored barong, a traditional Philippines shirt made of fiber from the pineapple plant, embroidered and worn untucked. They were served a four-course Filipino-Asian fusion meal curate and prepared by Chef Jessie Sincioco, who also designed the menu for Pope Francis when he visited the Philippines in 2015. Police used water canon to prevent hundreds of protesters reaching the U.S. embassy in Manila ahead of Trump s arrival. Carrying placards declaring  Dump Trump  and  Down with U.S. Imperialism , the left-wing protesters were blocked by police in riot gear with shields and batons, and then showered with jets of water from a fire engine. The United States and its former colony, the Philippines,  have been strategic allies since World War Two.  Trump is expected to try during the summit to shore up relations, which have been strained by the mercurial Duterte s notorious anti-U.S. sentiment and his enthusiasm for better ties with Russia and China. Duterte - sometimes described as the  Trump of the East  because of his brash style - said last week he would tell the U.S. president to  lay off  if he raised the issue of human rights when they met. More than 3,900 Filipinos have been killed in what the police call self-defense in a war on drugs declared by Duterte. Critics say executions are taking place with no accountability, allegations the police reject. But Trump, who has been criticized at home for neglecting rights issues in dealings abroad, praised Duterte in May for doing an  unbelievable job on the drug problem .  INDO-PACIFIC  Trump s tour comes against a background of tensions on the Korean peninsula following exchanges of war-like threats and insults between North Korea s leader Kim Jong Un and Trump over Pyongyang s nuclear and missile development program. China has been urged by both South Korea and the United States to take a more active role in curbing North Korea s nuclear and missile ambitions. During his tour, Trump and his team have repeatedly used the term  Indo-Pacific  instead of  Asia-Pacific  for the region, which some see as an effort to depict it as more than China-dominated. Pacific Rim nation leaders agreed in Vietnam on Saturday to address  unfair trade practices  and  market distorting subsidies , a statement that bore the imprint of Trump s efforts to reshape the global trade landscape. The summit of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) countries in Vietnam put on show the contrasting vision of the  America First  policy with the traditional consensus favoring multinational deals that China now seeks to champion. Manila hosted the APEC summit two years ago, and at that meeting Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau won a Twitter poll with the hashtag #APEChottie that asked people to vote for the most attractive leader there. Journalists swarmed the youthful leader and screamed in excitement. On his latest visit, Trudeau visited an outlet of Jollibee, a chain that has become a byword for Filipino fast food, chatting and posing for selfies, charming the people of Manila again.

In a statement, Secret Service Director Randolph “Tex” Alles attributed the funding shortfall to the cost of protecting President Donald Trump and his family, and “an overall increase in operational tempo.” The Secret Service did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In an interview with USA Today, which first reported the story, Alles noted that the Secret Service’s mission was set by law and that he did not have authority to curtail it. “The president has a large family, and our responsibility is required in law,” Alles told the newspaper. “I can’t change that. I have no flexibility.” The agency must protect a record 42 people, including 18 Trump family members, up from a total of 31 during the administration of former President Barack Obama, he told USA Today. The problem did not start with the current president’s tenure, “but rather has been an ongoing issue for nearly a decade,” Alles said in the statement. Alles has asked lawmakers to raise the combined salary and overtime cap for agents from $160,000 a year to $187,000 for at least the period of Trump’s first term, USA Today reported. But even if such a proposal was approved, about 130 veteran agents would not be fully compensated for hundreds of hours already amassed, the newspaper said, citing the agency. The White House said in a statement that the Trump administration would work with Congress on the issue. “The president is committed to ensuring the Secret Service and all of those protecting our country have all the resources they need,” it said. \"],[\"PARIS\\u002fBAGHDAD (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron on Saturday called on Iraq to dismantle all militias, including the government-sanctioned, Iran-backed Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF), a rare public call to do so by a major Western leader. Macron s call, which followed a meeting with Iraqi Kurdish leaders in Paris, underscores the tough balancing act Baghdad has to perform between its allies in the war on Islamic State, Iran and Western powers, which do not see eye to eye.  It is essential that there is a gradual demilitarisation, in particular of the Popular Mobilisation that established itself in the last few years in Iraq, and that all militias be gradually dismantled,  he told a Paris news conference held with Iraqi Kurdish leaders. Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) authorities accuse the majority Arab Shi ite PMF of widespread abuses against Kurds in Iraq s ethnically mixed regions. Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi s government denies that the PMF are engaged in a systematic pattern of abuses and has pledged to punish anyone proven guilty of violations. Disarming the PMF is seen as Abadi s most difficult test as his forces edge closer to declaring victory over Islamic State. In Baghdad, Abadi s office released a statement later saying he had spoken to Macron by phone and that the French president had affirmed his country s commitment to a unified Iraq. It made no mention of Macron s call to dismantle the militias. Iraqi Vice President Nuri al-Maliki, a former prime minister who was pressured to leave office by both the U.S. and Iran for failing to stop Islamic State, was more forceful. Macron, he said, was carrying out  unacceptable interference  in Iraq s internal affairs.  These positions from France are absolutely rejected and harm Iraq s sovereignty and its institutions,  Maliki said in a statement. Macron s meeting with KRG Prime Minister Nechirvan Barzani and his deputy Qubad Talabani was the first high-profile international meeting for the Kurdish leadership after a Sept. 25 independence referendum. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and British Prime Minister Theresa May have both made trips to Iraq after the referendum but only met officials in Baghdad and made no visits to the KRG capital Erbil. Western powers had encouraged the Kurds not to hold the referendum and instead engage in dialogue with Baghdad. Macron again called for dialogue between the central government in Baghdad and the semi-autonomous KRG within the framework of the Iraqi constitution, saying he was convinced a  constructive dialogue  could lead to lifting Baghdad s restrictions on the Kurdish region. Kurds voted to break away from Iraq in the referendum, defying the government in Baghdad and alarming neighboring Turkey and Iran who have their own Kurdish minorities. The Iraqi government responded by seizing the Kurdish-held city of Kirkuk and other territory disputed between the Kurds and the central government. Long-serving Kurdish president Masoud Barzani stepped down over the affair and the regional government led by his nephew Nechirvan has tried to negotiate an end to the confrontation. The Kurdish prime minister said on Saturday he saw France playing a role to end the dispute with Baghdad and that his government respected a verdict by the Iraqi Supreme Federal Court ruling the referendum unconstitutional and its results void.  With regards to the referendum, we are in a new era, and this issue is over and we have made our position in the Kurdistan Regional Government clear,  Erbil-based broadcaster Rudaw quoted Barzani as saying. Macron called for the long-delayed implementation of Article 140 of the Iraqi constitution to settle the status of territories disputed between Baghdad and the Kurds. Article 140 provided for a referendum to be held by the end of 2007 in the oil region of Kirkuk and other territories claimed by both the KRG and the Iraqi government to determine whether their populations wanted to be part of the Kurdish region or not. No such referendum took place, among the reasons cited by the KRG to unilaterally hold its referendum on independence.  \"],[\"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Kurdish Peshmerga fighters rejected a warning from an Iraqi paramilitary force to withdraw from a strategic junction south of Kirkuk, which controls access to some of the region s main oilfields, a Kurdish security official said on Sunday. Iran meanwhile shut its border crossings with Iraq s Kurdistan in support of measures taken by the Iraqi government to isolate the Kurdish region, the Iraqi foreign ministry said. The border closing came as an Iranian military official arrived in Iraq s Kurdistan for talks on the growing crisis between the Kurdish authorities and the Iraqi government following last month s Kurdish independence referendum. The Baghdad central government has taken a series of steps to isolate the autonomous Kurdish region since its vote for independence, including banning international flights. Baghdad s tough line, ruling out talks sought by the Kurds unless they renounce the breakaway move, is backed by neighbors Turkey and Iran - both with their own sizeable Kurdish minorities, and in Turkey s case, a long-running Kurdish insurgency. The top Kurdish leadership met on Sunday to discuss the crisis and rejected the Iraqi government s demand that it cancels the outcome of the independence referendum as a precondition for talks to resolve the dispute. The vote delivered an overwhelming  Yes  for independence. The Iraqi government in a statement accused the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) of bringing fighters from Turkey s separatist Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) to Kirkuk, describing the move as a  declaration of war . In the statement, published after a meeting in Baghdad, chaired by Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi and attended by top military and security commanders, the government said it would seek to impose its authority over Kirkuk and other disputed areas. A spokesman for KRG President Masoud Barzani, Vahal Ali, denied the Iraqi government claims about the PKK.  This is false, there are no PKK in Kirkuk, only Peshmerga,  he told Reuters, referring to KRG military forces. The Kurdish leadership meeting, attended by Barzani, rejected the Iraqi  military threats  and pledged to defend Kurdish-held territory in case of an attack.  Iraqi paramilitary groups backing the Shi ite-led government in Baghdad had warned the Peshmerga to leave a position north of the Maktab Khalid junction by midnight Saturday, a KRG security official said.  The Kurdish position north of the junction controls the access to an important airbase and Bai Hassan, one of the region s main oil fields, the KRG official said.  Ali al-Hussaini, a spokesman for the paramilitary groups known as Popular Mobilisation, did not give indications about their next move following the Kurds rejection of the warning .  We are waiting for new orders,  he told Reuters.  There were no clashes reported 21 hours after the deadline but tension remained high with both sides mobilized. Iranian Major General Qassem Soleimani arrived on Saturday in the Kurdistan region to hold talks about the crisis. He is the commander of foreign operations for Iran s elite Revolutionary Guards who provide training and guns to Popular Mobilisation The city of Kirkuk, the airbase and their immediate surroundings, including the oilfields, are under Kurdish control. Kurdish authorities said on Friday they had sent thousands more troops to Kirkuk to confront Iraqi  threats.   Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi has repeatedly denied any plans to attack the Kurds.  Popular Mobilisation is a separate force from the regular army and officially reports to Abadi. It is deployed alongside the army south and west of Kirkuk. Kirkuk, a city of more than one million people, lies just outside KRG territory but Peshmerga forces were stationed there in 2014 when Iraqi security forces collapsed in the face of an Islamic State onslaught. The Peshmerga deployment prevented Kirkuk s oilfields from falling into jihadist hands. In Washington, U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Friday the situation had the full attention of the United States, which was working to ensure it does not escalate. The United States has taken the side of the Iraqi government in refusing to recognize the validity of the referendum. \"],[\"BEIRUT (Reuters) - U.S.-backed militias in Syria have detained senior foreign Islamic State leaders in months of fighting for Raqqa, but it is not yet clear if they will be repatriated after facing trial, a spokesman said on Thursday.  We have foreign emirs ... from all around the world,  Talal Silo of the SDF told Reuters.  They were captured in special operations, and some of them turned themselves in to our forces.  The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), an alliance of Kurdish and Arab militias, declared victory this week in Raqqa, raising flags over the last Islamic State positions in the city.  The fall of Raqqa marked a potent symbol of the jihadist movement s collapsing fortunes. Islamic State militants used the city as a planning and operations center for its warfare in the Middle East and its string of attacks overseas. The United States has said Raqqa served as a hub for attacks abroad. In November 2015, after militants killed more than 130 people in Paris, France said it launched air strikes on Islamic State targets inside Raqqa. Silo declined to say how many high-ranking, foreign Islamic State prisoners were in detention, but said SDF intelligence was interrogating them.   There are prisons dedicated just for Daesh,  he added, using the Arabic acronym for Islamic State.  We don t put them with the regular prisoners.    They are being investigated, and will be presented to the courts. We have an independent judicial system that will try them, all of them,  he said.  After the trials, it remained unclear if the SDF would hand over the fighters to their countries or whether the foreign states would accept to take them back, he said.   It depends on the situation between us and the (foreign) states,  Silo said.  There may be an agreement ... there may be consent to handing them over, and there may not be.  With air strikes and special forces from the U.S.-led coalition, the Kurdish-led SDF had been fighting since June inside Raqqa, after months of battles to encircle the city. Raqqa was the first major city Islamic State seized in early 2014, before its series of rapid victories in Iraq and Syria brought millions of people under the rule of its self-declared caliphate, which passed laws and issued passports and money. \"],[\"ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan described the United Arab Emirates foreign minister as impertinent and spoiled by money on Thursday after he retweeted accusations that Ottoman forces looted the holy city of Medina during World War One. Without naming him, Erdogan said UAE Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahayan - who shared a tweet accusing Ottoman troops led by Fakhreddin Pasha of stealing money and manuscripts from Medina in 1916 - was ignorant.  Some impertinent man sinks low and goes as far as accusing our ancestors of thievery ... What spoiled this man? He was spoiled by oil, by the money he has,  Erdogan told an awards ceremony at his Ankara palace.  When my ancestors were defending Medina, you impudent (man), where were yours? First, you have to give account for this,  he added.  The United Arab Emirates, a close U.S. ally, sees Erdogan s Islamist-rooted ruling party as a friend of Islamist forces the UAE opposes across the Arab world. Relations were further strained by Ankara s support for Qatar after Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt imposed sanctions on the Gulf emirate in June. Two months later, Sheikh Abdullah criticized what he called Turkey and Iran s  colonial  actions in Syria, though Turkey and the UAE have both opposed Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Medina, now part of Saudi Arabia, was under Ottoman rule until the empire s collapse at the end of World War One. On Wednesday, Erdogan said Fakhreddin Pasha, who led the Ottoman forces, had not stolen from Medina or its people but strived to protect the city - where the Prophet Muhammad was buried - and its occupants during a time of war.  Believe me, this man who insulted us, who disrespected us, wouldn t even know what the holy relics are. They are ignorant like this,  Erdogan said.  \"],[\"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The U.S. Homeland Security Department’s inspector general said on Friday he was investigating possible abuse of authority in a case that triggered a lawsuit against the department by Twitter Inc (TWTR.N). Inspector General John Roth described the probe in a letter to Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat who had asked for an investigation due to concerns about free speech protections.  In a lawsuit on April 6, Twitter disclosed that it received a summons in March from the U.S. Bureau of Customs and Border Protection, an agency within Homeland Security, demanding records about an account on the social media platform identified by the handle @ALT_uscis. The account has featured posts critical of President Donald Trump’s immigration policies, leading Twitter to complain in  its lawsuit that the summons was an unlawful attempt to suppress dissent. The agency dropped its demand of Twitter the day after the suit was filed. Customs bureau spokesman Mike Friel said on Friday that the bureau requested the inspector general’s review and will fully support it. The people behind the Twitter account have not disclosed their identities, but the use of “ALT” with a government agency acronym has led many to assume government employees were behind the tweets critical of Trump.  The lawsuit said the account “claims to be” the work of at least one federal immigration employee. USCIS is the acronym of United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, a component of Homeland Security. Roth’s office is charged with investigating waste, fraud and abuse within Homeland Security. He wrote in his letter that he was looking at whether the summons to Twitter “was improper in any way, including whether CBP abused its authority.” “DHS OIG is also reviewing potential broader misuse of summons authority at the department,” he added. Wyden’s office posted the letter online. A representative for Roth could not immediately be reached for comment. A Twitter spokeswoman declined to comment. \"],[\"CHARLESTON, S.C. (Reuters) - Long viewed by the Republican establishment and many donors as one of their rising stars, U.S. Senator Marco Rubio has been struggling to make his mark in the race for the party’s 2016 presidential nomination in a field led by mavericks Donald Trump and Ted Cruz. Regarded as well-spoken and telegenic, Rubio began facing criticism a few months ago when he was perceived as campaigning too little in Iowa and New Hampshire, the two states where next month party members will cast their first ballots. Rubio, 44, may still have a breakthrough, but with 20 days to go until Iowa’s Feb. 1 nominating caucuses, the first-term Florida lawmaker faces questions about his campaign strategy in a race for the Nov. 8 election made up of 11 candidates dominated by the billionaire Trump and U.S. Senator Cruz of Texas. His prospects reach a critical moment at a Thursday night debate in South Carolina when he tries to position himself as the consensus alternative to Trump and Cruz and distance himself from such establishment candidates as former Florida governor Jeb Bush and governors Chris Christie of New Jersey and John Kasich of Ohio. Republican experts say he seems to be straddling two political lanes, trying to win over establishment Republicans as well as anti-establishment conservatives who favor Cruz. The debate, on the Fox Business Network, is due to begin at 9 p.m. ET on Thursday (0200 GMT on Friday). The son of Cuban immigrants, Rubio has drawn support by stressing his working-class upbringing in Las Vegas and Miami as the child of a bartender father and a mother who was both a maid and a cashier. But voters and party operatives suggest he has until recently failed to commit to the intimate face-to-face politicking considered mandatory by voters in either Iowa or New Hampshire, which has a Feb. 9 primary. Rubio aides acknowledge the high stakes of the coming weeks. “I feel good but we’ve got to close strong,” said Rubio’s New Hampshire state director, Jim Merrill. A Reuters\\u002fIpsos opinion poll showed Rubio on Wednesday at 6.7 percent, compared to 15.2 percent little more than a month ago, falling from second place to fifth among Republicans after Trump, Cruz, Bush and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson. Some voters have cited a tendency by Rubio in past months to stick to well-honed talking points on the stump instead of mixing it up at town-hall meetings where people can ask questions. This has raised concerns he might lack necessary experience. “There’s a lot of people who were very interested in him and continue to be, but in Iowa it just seems like he hasn’t fully committed himself to aggressively campaign in the state and that’s causing some pause,” Iowa Republican strategist Doug Gross said. Dennis Thorell of New Durham, New Hampshire, said Rubio needed a longer resume of accomplishments than U.S. senator and former speaker of the Florida House of Representatives. Thorell said Rubio might be better suited for the vice presidency or another top job in a Republican administration. “He hasn’t had any experience running anything,” Thorell said while listening to Rubio in Concord, New Hampshire, last week. “He did very well in the legislature down in Florida and was mentored by Jeb (Bush) but he hasn’t run anything.” Rival candidates for the Republican nomination have assailed Rubio also for his absences from the U.S. Senate during hearings and floor votes, raising further questions about how he spends his time. Defending his record of missed votes, Rubio has said the majority of his time is spent in service to his constituents and his Senate committee work, both of which he says continue unabated. Rubio aides told Reuters they plan a multimillion-dollar advertising campaign for New Hampshire and expect to outspend all rivals on the TV airwaves in the state. The aides said Rubio has plans to be a major presence in both Iowa and New Hampshire in the final stretch, with a schedule that will include plenty of give-and-take with voters in informal settings such as town halls. They said Rubio’s schedule is as heavy as any of his rivals, but that much of it has been at behind-the-scenes fund-raising events that have been essential to get him the resources needed for the final push. Republican strategists say Rubio’s path to the nomination would have to start with at least a third-place finish in Iowa presumably behind poll leaders Cruz and Trump, which would deliver him some momentum going into New Hampshire. If Rubio goes on to place high in Iowa and do well in New Hampshire, he and his aides will see it as the realization of a strategy of going for broke at the right moment in the states that render the first judgments in the presidential race. “From the get-go we said we didn’t want to peak in September, we wanted to peak in February. It’s starting to grow. It feels like it’s starting to happen for us,” Rubio spokesman Alex Conant said. Republican analysts say Rubio appears to be as well-placed as any of his rivals in the drive to become the establishment Republican favorite. He is drawing increasingly larger crowds in New Hampshire and has a solid organization in the state. “I think he suffered from the perception that he hasn’t been here as much and worked it as hard as some of his competitors,” Republican strategist Steve Duprey said. “If he puts the pedal to the metal, he could do very well.” For more on the 2016 presidential race, see the Reuters blog, “Tales from the Trail” (here). \"],[\"BOSTON (Reuters) - Billionaire environmental activist Tom Steyer, who has spent more than $140 million on fighting climate change, said on Tuesday he will spend whatever it takes to fight President-elect Donald Trump’s pro-drilling and anti-regulation agenda. The former hedge fund manager from California is putting together a strategy that will “engage voters and citizens to fight back” once Trump takes the White House in January, he told Reuters in an interview. However, he stressed he was not planning to fight Trump through the courts. Instead, he would focus on “trying to present an opposite point of view and trying to get that point of view expressed, and communicated to citizens.” Steyer’s pledge to fight Trump suggests an intensifying battle for U.S. public opinion on global climate change, an issue that has already divided many Americans, lawmakers, and companies between those who consider it a major global threat and those who doubt its existence. Other U.S. environmental groups are also preparing to resist Trump’s agenda, with some vowing street protests and more established organizations that helped draft some of President Barack Obama’s environmental regulations preparing to defend them in court. “We have always been willing to do whatever is necessary,” Steyer said, when asked how much money he was willing to spend to oppose Trump’s agenda. Trump campaigned on a promise to drastically reduce environmental regulation and ease permitting for infrastructure, moves he said would breathe life into an oil and gas industry ailing from low prices, without harming U.S. air and water quality.  He has also called climate change a hoax and has promised to “cancel” the Paris Climate Accord between nearly 200 nations to slow global warming, a deal he said would cost the U.S. economy trillions of dollars and put it at a disadvantage. While the approach has cheered the industry, it has sent shockwaves through the environmental movement, which is confronting the prospect of losing all progress it made during the Obama administration. Steyer, who had endorsed Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, called Trump’s policies dangerous. “Every single one of these things, whether it was getting rid of Paris or cutting back the EPA, we think are extremely dangerous to the security of every American,” Steyer said. “We think it is based on willful ignorance of the facts and flies in the face of the realities facing the world.” Steyer’s main political vehicle, NextGen Climate, on Tuesday called on the Obama administration to defy Trump’s pro-drilling agenda by issuing an order permanently blocking all new drilling in the Atlantic and Arctic Oceans. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Trump has also promised to ask Canadian oil pipeline company, TransCanada Corp, to resubmit its application to build a pipeline into the United States that would link Alberta’s vast oil sands to American refineries and ports on the Gulf Coast. The project, Keystone XL, had been rejected by the Obama administration after years of mass protests and lobbying by environmental organizations. Steyer said the project may no longer make sense since a slump in oil prices has reduced the profitability of oil sands production. Steyer, who four years ago left the hedge fund firm he co-founded to devote himself full-time to environmental activism, said young voter turnout in areas where NextGen focused its mobilization efforts during the 2016 campaign was up more than 20 percent from the last presidential election in 2012. “Did we get the president we want, absolutely not. Did we get a majority of clean energy supporters in the senate, no,” Steyer said. “But in terms of what we did, and the strategy we took, we wouldn’t do anything differently.”  NextGen poured nearly $69 million into its elections related programs during the presidential campaign, according to federal records compiled by OpenSecrets.org, slightly lower than the $74 million it spent during the mid-term congressional elections in 2014, when only two of the six candidates it supported won.  \"],[\"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Trapped under tons of rubble and in complete darkness, Diana Pacheco s hopes were fading fast for making it out alive from a collapsed office building after a huge earthquake in Mexico City, despite rescuers  frantic attempts to reach her. Then the trapped woman had a great stroke of luck: a series of short messages she had written and sent to her husband some 16 hours earlier lit up his phone screen.  My love   The ceiling fell   We re trapped   I love you   I love you a lot   We re on the fourth floor   Near the emergency stairway   There s four of us,  read the WhatsApp messages, which finally reached her husband Juan Jesus Garcia on Wednesday at 5:34 a.m.  Garcia, 33, an Uber driver, had been waiting, often in tears, beside the collapsed building all night and immediately ran over to rescue workers.  It was like a miracle because I was the only one who got the message and since I was there with the rescue workers I talked to them and they could locate her,  said Garcia. The messages on Garcia s phone, seen by Reuters shortly after they were received on Wednesday, could have been delayed due to erratic cell phone coverage in parts of Mexico City after the quake, or the fact that Pacheco s phone signal was blocked by the tons of concrete that kept her trapped in the collapsed building. When asked whether WhatsApp messages can be delivered hours after they were sent in an area without good cellphone coverage, a spokeswoman for the company confirmed it is possible.         Pacheco, a recruiter for a human resources and accounting firm, said she sent the messages shortly after the 7.1 magnitude earthquake struck at 1:14 p.m. on Tuesday.  Those messages helped them know more or less where we were located,  Pacheco said on Friday from her hospital bed, her voice weak. Using the information to pinpoint their location, rescuers freed Pacheco, 30, and the three other survivors shortly after 6 a.m. on Wednesday.  Rescue operations were still underway on Friday at the building, where Pacheco says there were some 60 people on her floor alone at the time of the quake.  I think there are people (alive) there because we had oxygen, air was coming in,  she said. Despite having bruises all over her body and wearing a neck brace, Pacheco was generally in good health. She said she tried to send WhatsApp and text messages to other people from under the building, as well as make phone calls and post on Facebook, but only the messages to her husband got through.     She said when the building fell, the force of two floors above collapsing violently knocked her down, but a wall of concrete stopped just short of crushing her and three of her coworkers. They found themselves huddled together in a cramped space. They screamed out every time they heard voices from outside the building.  We heard them (rescue workers) when they asked us to yell or make noise, but regardless of how much we yelled they couldn t hear us,  Pacheco said.     The quake, Mexico s deadliest in a generation, has already claimed close to 300 lives.

The EU and Britain, which is will leave the EU in March 2019, agreed last Friday on the divorce terms in three key areas   a financial settlement, citizens  rights and how to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland. The European Commission said on Monday the deal was not legally binding yet, but it regarded it  as a deal between gentlemen  with  the clear understanding that it is fully backed and endorsed by the UK government . But Britain s Brexit minister David Davis said on Sunday that the deal, which allows both sides to start talks on a future trade agreement crucial for Britain, was more of a  statement of intent  than a legally binding measure. This caused concern among EU officials that London may want to go back on the agreement.   Remarks by David Davis that Phase One deal last week not binding were unhelpful and undermines trust. European Parliament text will now reflect this and insist agreement translated into legal text as soon as possible,  Guy Verhofstadt, who leads the European Parliament Brexit coordination team, tweeted. He said that after Davis s  unacceptable remarks , the European Parliament will ask EU leaders meeting on Brexit on Friday to formally make negotiations on a future trade agreement with London conditional on including the agreement so far in full in the treaty on Britain leaving the EU. A draft text which leaders are set to adopt on Friday already states that  negotiations in the second phase can only progress as long as all commitments undertaken during the first phase are respected in full and translated faithfully in legal terms as quickly as possible . \"],[\"(Reuters) - New Zealand s two main parties are neck and neck in opinion polls after the appointment of a charismatic leader boosted the opposition Labour Party, threatening the governing National Party s decade-long hold on power. The election is on Sept 23. Below are the main parties  positions on key issues: ECONOMYNew Zealand s once booming economy is facing some capacity constraints. Unemployment is at an eight-year low and a labor shortage, most noticeably in construction, threatens to curb growth. Both main parties plan to be fiscally prudent and maintain a budget surplus, but would differ on monetary policy. National plans to cut net debt to 10-15 percent of GDP by 2025, while Labour and the Green Party both plan to cut it to 20 percent of GDP within five years of taking office. Labour proposes adding full employment to the existing inflation mandate of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, which economists say could lead to easier monetary policy and fuel longer-term inflation. To form a government, National may be more dependent on New Zealand First, which favors greater currency intervention - something New Zealand has been reluctant to do in the past. National is planning to adjust tax thresholds, or effectively deliver tax cuts, from April 2018 to boost family income. Labour wants to do away with National s planned tax cuts and boost tax credits and subsidies. New Zealand s house prices have risen more than 50 percent in the past decade as the construction industry failed to keep up with demand from a growing population, fueled by record migration and an increasing number of New Zealanders staying home. Labour criticizes National for leaving the housing crisis unresolved after nine years in government. It wants to ban overseas buyers from purchasing existing homes and build 100,000 affordable homes over 10 years. It also plans to create a housing authority to speed up residential development. National questions Labour s ability to build so many houses while curbing immigration. It plans to make NZ$1 billion available to speed up the development of 60,000 houses. New Zealand First wants to ban foreign non-residents from owning a home in New Zealand, except in particular cases, and to  provide government assistance for first-home buyers. The Green Party wants to provide 10,000 new houses over 10 years for low-income groups through a rent-to-buy scheme. The National Party tightened eligibility criteria this year for immigration and believes current levels of immigration are about right to meet the economy s needs. Labour plans to reduce net immigration by up to 30,000 from record levels of over 70,000 annually and to charge every visitor a NZ$25 fee, which would be ring-fenced for a NZ$75 million infrastructure fund. The Greens want to review immigration policy to make sure migrants match the skills employers need, in line with Labour s policy. New Zealand First wants to curb immigration by ensuring New Zealand workers have the first chance at jobs and by capping the number of older migrants. National wants to expand New Zealand s international trade. Among other plans, it wants to complete the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, launch a free trade deal with the European Union and Britain post-Brexit and upgrade its free trade agreement with China. Labour wants to reconsider New Zealand s role in the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact if provisions on foreign investment are not changed to allow the New Zealand government to restrict investment into the country. New Zealand First wants to renegotiate the TPP. \"],[\"BEIRUT (Reuters) - U.S.-backed militias in Syria said they have formed a joint military center with the Iraqi army to protect their common border region after ousting Islamic State militants. Commanders of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), an alliance of Kurdish and Arab militias, met with Iraqi military leaders on Sunday. They  discussed protecting the Syrian-Iraqi border in the region adjacent to Deir al-Zor province, and how to finally eradicate Daesh mercenaries there,  the SDF said in a statement. Daesh is an Arabic acronym for Islamic State.  The two sides decided to form a joint coordination center to guarantee the security of the border,  it said. Last week, the SDF declared victory in its assault in Syria s Deir al-Zor, which borders Iraq. The offensive focused on seizing territory east of the Euphrates river that bisects the oil-rich province. The Kurdish-led SDF has been battling for months with the help of jets and special forces from the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State (IS). On the other side, Iraqi forces recaptured the last swathes of territory still under Islamic State control along the frontier with Syria on Saturday and secured the western desert. It marked the end of the war against IS, three years after they overran about a third of Iraq s territory. Iraqi forces who fought IS came from the army, air force, police, elite counter-terrorism forces as well as Shi ite and Sunni paramilitaries and Kurdish Peshmerga fighters. They received key air support from the U.S.-led global coalition. Syrian government forces and their allies, backed by Russian air power, have taken most of the remaining areas of Deir al-Zor province. They are mostly on the western side of the Euphrates, while the SDF is on the eastern bank. Russia and the United States set up a communications channel to reduce the chance of fighting between the two rival campaigns against Islamic State.  Forces arrayed against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria now anticipate a new phase of guerrilla warfare. Colonel Ryan Dillon, spokesman for the coalition, said Iraqi security forces and the SDF had linked up at their shared stretch of the frontier on Sunday.   Secure international border protects Iraqis (and) Syrians from remnant Daesh movement into (and) across the region as terrorist fighters\\u002fleaders attempt to flee the battlefield,  he wrote on Twitter.  \"],[\"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Donald Trump’s proposal to force Mexico to pay for his planned border wall by threatening to block remittances from illegal immigrants would be a major violation of Mexicans’ rights, Mexico’s central bank governor said on Tuesday. The Republican presidential hopeful’s campaign said last week that if elected in November, Trump would use a U.S. anti-terrorism law to cut off such money transfers unless Mexico made a one-time payment of $5 billion to $10 billion for the wall. However, speaking in Mexico’s Congress, Mexican Central Bank Governor Agustin Carstens dismissed the idea. “The remittances are the property of the people that make them, and they have every right to be able to carry out international transfers,” Carstens told reporters. “So it would be a serious violation of the property rights of our fellow citizens abroad, and this measure would be completely unjust.” \"],[\"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Donald Trump’s Indonesian business partner dismissed concerns by ethics officials that the U.S. president-elect’s companies’ overseas business deals might be vulnerable to conflicts of interest in an interview on Wednesday. Hary Tanoesoedibjo, 51, is the billionaire chairman and chief executive of MNC Group, which is constructing two luxury resorts in Indonesia that will be managed by the Trump Hotel Collection, a subsidiary of the Trump Organization.  Like Trump, Tanoesoedibjo believes his country’s politics could benefit from his business acumen and says he now devotes half his 16-hour days to tending to Perindo, the political party he founded last year, and other political efforts. “We didn’t add any new project since he decided to run for president so I don’t think there is a conflict of interest,” Tanoesoedibjo said in an interview at the Trump International Hotel in Manhattan where he was staying before traveling to Washington for Trump’s inauguration on Friday.  “A conflict of interest happens when if after he won the election and then we decided to add more projects. That’s where we get to a gray area,” he said. “But our project actually has been decided long before that.” He said he signed the deal with Trump in early 2015. Trump’s unusual path to the White House as a businessman who has never previously held political office and his decision to retain ownership of his companies has drawn him into conflict with ethics watchdogs.  Walter Shaub, director of the U.S. Office of Government Ethics, has unsuccessfully urged Trump to “divest his conflicting assets.” Trump has said the company would not make any new deals abroad while he is president and that his two elder sons, Donald Jr. and Eric, will take over his roles in running the business. Tanoesoedibjo said he met with the two brothers for two and a half hours on Wednesday morning at Trump Tower to discuss the resorts’ progress, and said Donald Jr. was expected to return to Indonesia this summer.  MNC is investing between $500 million and $1 billion in the developments, one near Jakarta and the other in Bali. It is paying the Trump Hotel company to manage luxury hotels, golf courses and country clubs at the two sites. The properties should be open by early 2019, Tanoesoedibjo said. He demurred on how U.S.-Indonesia relations might change under a Trump administration except to welcome Trump’s willingness to take on the United States’ larger trading partners in pursuit of what he calls better trade deals. “When the U.S. is pushing too hard against another big country like China or maybe a European country that may create a situation where that country may shift their investment somewhere else,” Tanoesoedibjo said, “and potentially to Indonesia.” He said he would decide before the end of next year whether to run in Indonesia’s 2019 presidential election, while describing Trump’s victory as inspiring to would-be candidates with thin political experience. “Maybe some day I’ll call him for political advice,” he said. \"],[\"LONDON (Reuters) - A 102-year-old man given a suspended sentence on Monday for sexually abusing a girl in the 1970s is thought to be the oldest person convicted of a crime in Britain, prosecutors said. Douglas Hammersley was given a two-year suspended sentence after pleading guilty to three counts of indecent assault. The Crown Prosecution Service said the incidents took place in the Buckinghamshire area, to the west of London, when the victim was between five and eight years old.      We were able to prosecute Hammersley thanks to the victim coming forward, even though the offences were committed more than four decades ago,  said Jennie Laskar-Hall, senior prosecutor for the CPS. In December, a 101-year-old man was jailed for 13 years for a string of historical sex crimes against two young sisters and their brother. Police said he was the oldest person to have been found guilty of a crime in British legal history. \"],[\"NEW YORK (Reuters) - AT&T Inc (T.N) Chief Executive Randall Stephenson on Thursday met in New York with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, an opponent of  the company’s acquisition of Time Warner Inc (TWX.N).  A spokeswoman for Trump confirmed the meeting after Stephenson was seen entering Trump Tower. Stephenson, who was accompanied by Robert Quinn, AT&T’s senior executive vice president for external and legislative affairs, would not answer questions from reporters.  AT&T said later on Thursday that the company’s $85.4 billion deal for Time Warner was not discussed. “The conversation focused on how AT&T can work with the Trump administration to increase investment in the U.S., stimulate job creation in America, and make American companies more competitive globally,” AT&T said in a statement.  During his campaign for the White House, Trump said AT&T’s proposal to buy Time Warner, owner of CNN and the Warner Bros movie studio, was an example of a “power structure” that was rigged against him and voters. “It’s too much concentration of power in the hands of too few,” said Trump, who has repeatedly accused the media of being biased against him and his campaign. Since the election, Trump has not commented publicly on the AT&T-Time Warner deal, but he has been critical of CNN. He sparred with a CNN reporter on Wednesday during a televised news conference.  A person briefed on the matter said AT&T requested the meeting with Trump late last week.  As Thursday’s meeting was about to get under way, Trump tweeted: “@CNN is in a total meltdown with their FAKE NEWS because their ratings are tanking since election and their credibility will soon be gone.” Representatives from AT&T and Time Warner declined to comment on Trump’s tweet.  A Trump transition official told Reuters earlier this month that the president-elect still opposed the deal, which would require antitrust approval by the U.S. Department of Justice. It could also face a review by the Federal Communications Commission, although the companies are considering ways to structure the deal to avoid that.  Time Warner shareholders will meet on Feb. 15 to decide whether to approve the merger. \"],[\"LONDON (Reuters) - Mayor of London Sadiq Khan called on the British government on Wednesday to make a formal apology for the 1919 Jallianwala Bagh massacre in which nearly 400 Sikhs were shot dead by British Indian army soldiers. During a visit to the Golden Temple at Amritsar in northern India, the most important pilgrimage site of Sikhism, Khan called the massacre one of the most horrific events in Indian history. On Sunday 13 April 1919, some 50 soldiers began shooting at unarmed civilians who were taking part in a peaceful protest against oppressive laws enforced in the Punjab by British colonial authorities. At least 379 Sikhs were killed, but the figure is still disputed.  It is wrong that successive British governments have fallen short of delivering a formal apology to the families of those who were killed,  he said.  I m clear that the government should now apologize, especially as we reach the centenary of the massacre. This is about properly acknowledging what happened here and giving the people of Amritsar and India the closure they need through a formal apology.  Khan, who is from the opposition Labour Party, does not speak for Britain s Conservative government. Former Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron visited Amritsar at the end of a trade mission to India four years ago in a show of contrition over the massacre but stopped short of making a formal apology. Khan is on a six-day mission to India and Pakistan to strengthen cultural and economic ties with the British capital. The British Foreign Office said in a statement:  As the former Prime Minister said when he visited the Jallianwala Bagh in 2013, the massacre was a deeply shameful act in British history and one that we should never forget.  It is right that we pay respect to those who lost their lives and remember what happened. The British Government rightly condemned the events at the time.   \"],[\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to nominate Columbia University law professor Robert Jackson to be a member of the Securities and Exchange Commission, a person with knowledge of the matter said on Thursday. Jackson is expected to be formally nominated on Friday, the source said. He would fill a vacant spot reserved for a Democrat on the five-member panel. His appointment follows the administration’s decision to nominate Hester Peirce as a Republican commissioner in July and would bring the SEC to full strength and paving the way for Chairman Jay Clayton to push ahead on an agenda of reducing public companies’ regulatory burdens. Jackson could not be reached for comment on Thursday. Jackson is known for his advocacy work in trying to advance new rules at the SEC that would force public companies to disclose their political spending to investors. \"],[\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic state officials blasted the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Thursday for telling governors in what they describe as a “legally incorrect” letter in March that they do not need to comply with a major climate change regulation. Fourteen Democratic attorneys general and officials from six cities and counties said the guidance that EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt sent to states on March 30 was misleading because the Clean Power Plan enacted under former President Barack Obama, a Democrat, remains on the books despite the Republican Trump administration’s plans to unravel it.  The Clean Power Plan was aimed at curbing carbon emissions from power plants. It never took effect because the Supreme Court put it on hold in February 2016. The state officials said the regulation “remains the law of the land” even if it is currently on hold and that Pruitt’s “unsolicited legal advice” to governors was “premature and legally incorrect.” They called for Pruitt to retract his letter.  The move is the latest tussle between Democrats who back the regulation and the new administration, conservative states and the coal industry, which oppose it. “Scott Pruitt cannot simply wish away the facts by giving governors bad legal advice,” New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a statement. “We’ll continue to fight to ensure that the federal government fulfills its legal responsibility to New Yorkers’ health and environment.”  An EPA spokesman was not immediately available for comment. Pruitt said in his guidance that because the case is on hold, “states and other interested parties have neither been required nor expected to work towards meeting the compliance dates,” which were deadlines set for states as part of their implementation of the rule. A legal challenge to the regulation brought by 27 conservative-leaning states remains pending at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.  The court has delayed issuing a ruling in the case due to the administration’s plan to reconsider the regulation. President Donald Trump, a Republican, signed an executive order in March ordering the agency to consider rescinding the rule. Schneiderman and other state officials also questioned why Pruitt sent the letter since he has said he would recuse himself in his current role. The former Oklahoma attorney general had participated in the challenge.  State attorneys general have had some success in battling back against agencies’ plans to roll back Obama-era climate regulations. \"],[\"UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United Nations blacklisted a Saudi Arabia-led military coalition on Thursday for killing and injuring 683 children in Yemen and attacking dozens of schools and hospitals in 2016, even as it said the coalition had taken action to improve child protection. The blacklist attached to the U.N. annual report on children in armed conflict also named the Iran-allied Houthi rebel group, Yemen government forces, pro-government militia and Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula for violations against children in 2016. The U.N. report said the Houthis and affiliated forces killed and injured 414 children in 2016.  The report from U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was submitted to the Security Council on Thursday and seen by Reuters. A draft of the blacklist was reported by Reuters on Tuesday. The actions of the Saudi-led coalition  objectively led  to it being blacklisted for killing and injuring 683 children and for 38 attacks on schools and hospitals last year, the report said, adding that all incidents were verified by the U.N. The coalition had been briefly added to the blacklist in 2016 and then removed by then-U.N. chief Ban Ki-moon pending review. At the time, Ban accused Saudi Arabia of exerting  unacceptable  undue pressure after sources told Reuters that Riyadh threatened to cut some U.N. funding. Saudi Arabia denied threatening Ban. In an effort to dampen controversy surrounding the report, the blacklist this year is split into two categories. One lists parties that have put in place measures to protect children,  which includes the Saudi-led military coalition, and the other includes parties that have not. The report, which was produced by U.N. Children and Armed Conflict envoy Virginia Gamba and issued in Guterres  name, does not subject those listed to U.N. action but rather shames parties to conflicts in the hope of pushing them to implement measures to protect children. Guterres spoke with Saudi King Salman by phone on Wednesday. U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said:  They had a very positive discussion on issues of mutual interest, including the situation in the Middle East and beyond.  Saudi U.N. Ambassador Abdallah Al-Mouallimi plans to hold a news conference on Friday.  Yemen has been devastated by more than two years of civil war in which President Abd-Rabu Mansour Hadi s government, backed by the Saudi-led coalition, is fighting to drive the Houthis out of cities they seized in 2014 and 2015. More than 10,000 people have been killed and the conflict has ruined the economy and pushed millions to the brink of famine. The Houthis control much of northern Yemen, including the capital, Sanaa. U.N. sanctions monitors reported to the Security Council in January that the Saudi-led coalition had carried out attacks in Yemen that  may amount to war crimes.  Riyadh denies the allegation. The U.N. sanctions monitors said at the time that the coalition was made up of Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Jordan, Morocco and Sudan.  The coalition has received limited U.S. support, including in logistics. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are major recipients of U.S. arms. Saudi Arabia is also a major customer of British defense companies.  The coalition needs to stop making empty promises to exercise caution, take concrete action to stop these deadly unlawful attacks in Yemen, and allow desperately needed fuel and aid to reach those in need,  said Jo Becker, children s rights advocacy director at Human Rights Watch.  Until this happens, governments should suspend all Saudi weapons sales,  she said.  The annual children and armed conflict report is produced at the request of the U.N. Security Council. In 2015 the United Nations left Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas off the blacklist, after they had been included in an earlier draft, but criticized Israel over its 2014 military operations. \"],[\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A bill to slash funding for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Internal Revenue Service and other financial regulators passed a key committee in the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday after a long partisan fight. The expansive legislation would also place a halt on the payday lending restrictions that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau recently proposed. The Appropriations Committee voted 30-17 to approve the bill allocating funds for financial services and general government, which now goes to the full House. One of the committee’s senior Democrats, Jose Serrano of New York, warned that the “bill in its current form will be vetoed.”  The Senate must still pass accompanying legislation. After that, both chambers will reconcile their bills into a single piece for President Barack Obama to sign or veto. Congress has tangled over budget laws for years, and federal agencies frequently rely on temporary continuing resolutions for funding. Republicans cast the bill as a way to streamline agencies and hold them accountable for spending decisions, while saving taxpayer money. Democrats attacked what they called “riders” to the bill, such as a measure to stop the Federal Communications Commission’s net neutrality rule and one to prevent corporations from being required to disclose political donations. They also said cuts to the SEC would hobble the agency in carrying out its duties and implementing the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law. Earlier this month the CFPB, charged with shielding consumers from financial fraud, proposed rules to limit short-term borrowings known as “payday” loans, which can charge interest as high as 390 percent. Critics say the proposal will cut off credit to poor people who may need small loans during emergencies. Representative Steven Palazzo, a Mississippi Republican, proposed an amendment on Thursday to delay implementing the rules until the bureau reports to Congress on their possible effects, saying he was concerned they could force people to turn to loan sharks.  Democratic National Committee Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz had been one of the few members of her party to oppose the rules, and had sponsored a bill to delay CFPB rules for two years.  Wasserman Schultz, who is also a U.S. representative from Florida, reversed her position in the last week. She told the hearing on Thursday the proposal is “inarguably a step in the right direction,” adding, “I stand with the CFPB in its efforts to protect Americans from predatory lending.”  \"],[\"(Reuters) - Investors seeking steady income flows may have ignored the technology sector and the unexpected impact technology is having on companies in other industries, Kera Van Valen, a portfolio manager at Epoch Investment Partners, said on Friday.   People have overlooked technology in terms of dividends and the changes some companies have made regarding the cash they generate, Van Valen told the Reuters Global Investment 2018 Outlook Summit in New York.  Within the tech sector you have seen a slight shift in appreciation towards the discipline of returning cash to shareholders. That s something people don t expect,  she said. Texas Instruments Inc (TXN.O) is now part of Epoch s high-dividend-based  shareholder  yield strategy as the chipmaker has committed to returning 100 percent of free cash flow through dividends and share buybacks, she said. The company targets free cash flow to be somewhere in the range of 20 percent to 30 percent of their revenue, said Van Valen, who helps oversee Epoch s U.S. and global dividend strategies, which account for half of its $48.6 billion in assets under management. Epoch s Shareholder Yield strategy is invested in a number of companies that use technology to improve their productivity, asset utilization and to reduce capital requirements. The result is an increase in return on equity and a company s ability to return more capital to shareholders in the form of dividends, share repurchases and debt reduction.  Increased efficiency through technology also has been unrecognized by investors in unforeseen places such as utilities, where Epoch owns utility holding company PPL Corp (PPL.N).   PPL is spending $500 million on a smart meter replacement program that will modernize the power grid to make it smarter and more resilient, Van Valen said. PPL can be more efficient when deploying people to deal with outages as a result of smart meters, she said. They will no longer need people to look for the outages.  Another technology play investors may have missed is McDonald s Corp (MCD.N), which has partnered with UberEATS and the use of a mobile app offer delivery in 3,700 restaurants, Van Valen said. McDonald s is touting its technology to increase efficiency, which flows to a company s bottom line, she said.   You don t necessary think of a large global fast food chain as a technology company,  she said.  It s helping with the growth in the revenues, profits and cash flows, which, from our perspective, that means growth in the dividends.  Epoch is  quite constructive  on the outlook for 2018 as the  market shifts from a period of central bank-driven low interest rates to one focused on profit growth and margins. Another overlooked stock is Red Electrica (REE.MC) in Spain, where the utility is unlikely to see changes in the regulatory environment and Epoch expects the dividend to grow 7 percent to 8 percent a year, Van Valen said.   It s a regulated utility so it falls within that boring mantra that we like so much,  she said. Another name Epoch likes is Altria Group Inc (MO.N) because of the strong pricing power and tremendous cash flows enjoyed by tobacco companies, she said. Altria is  very consistent about returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks and debt reduction,  she said. \"],[\"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Saad al-Hariri, who resigned from his post as Lebanon s prime minister on Nov. 4 from Saudi Arabia, reaffirmed on Wednesday he will return to Lebanon.

In an open letter to customers, Cook vowed to fight a court order from a Los Angeles judge to provide “reasonable technical assistance” to investigators wanting access to the phone of Rizwan Farook, a shooter in the San Bernardino attack that killed 14. Cook said complying with the government’s request would set a dangerous precedent that could ultimately undermine the security of its iPhones. Users supporting and opposing Apple’s position flooded Twitter with rival hashtags #thankyouapple and #boycottapple and Facebook users wrote lengthy posts on the move. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey tweeted his support for Cook on Thursday, joining groups like Amnesty International in applauding Cook’s stance. Conservative pundit Ann Coulter was among Cook’s many critics, suggesting in a social media post that Apple made the move “for PR” purposes.  Branding expert Allen Adamson, founder of Brand Simple Consulting, praised Cook’s forthright note to customers.  “Corporate leaders are better off having a very clear, principled view that customers can either agree or disagree with rather than having ambiguity and lack of clarity as to what the company stands for,” said Adamson, whose New York-based firm advises companies on volatile branding matters. Adamson and other branding experts said Cook’s open letter was important in getting ahead of the debate, even if its users do not necessarily support the company’s decision. Apple has come under fire from Republican lawmakers and presidential candidates like Donald Trump, but the company has also rallied support among privacy advocates.  “This is a lightning rod issue in the country right now and it is hugely emotional and polarizing. It is still unclear how it will connect with consumers,” said Adamson. Other analysts also pointed to Apple’s brand power as a likely shield against any immediate backlash from consumers. A recent survey of 44,000 consumers by branding consulting firm Brand Keys Inc found the company leading other major tech brands in virtually all categories from devices to services on customer engagement and loyalty.  “They have an extraordinary high level of emotional engagement with consumers,” said Brand Keys president Robert Passikoff. A steady stream of customers visited the Apple store in downtown San Francisco on Thursday, and shoppers seemed unfazed by the controversy. “I buy from Apple because of the product quality. This doesn’t affect our decision to buy from them,” said Esther Stearns, a retired tech worker. \"],[\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Pentagon said on Monday it was reviewing  adjustments  in arms for U.S.-backed Kurdish forces in Syria but stopped short of declaring a halt to weapons transfers, suggesting such decisions would be based on battlefield requirements. Turkey said on Friday that U.S. President Donald Trump told President Tayyip Erdogan he had issued instructions that weapons should not be provided to Syrian Kurdish fighters, which Ankara views as threat. It called on Monday for Washington to follow through on its pledge.  We are reviewing pending adjustments to the military support provided to our Kurdish partners in as much as the military requirements of our defeat-ISIS and stabilization efforts will allow to prevent ISIS from returning,  said Pentagon spokesman Eric Pahon, using an acronym for Islamic State, which U.S. and U.S.-backed forces are battling in Syria. \"],[\"WASHINGTON\\u002fBETHESDA, Md. (Reuters) - Wealthy, well-educated voters helped carry Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump to victory in this week’s East Coast primaries, a demographic the famously blunt-spoken billionaire had struggled to attract in the past. His sweep of Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, Connecticut and Rhode Island on Tuesday included wins in some of the richest and best-educated counties in the country - like Fairfield County, Connecticut, and Newport County, Rhode Island - and added to victories in his more traditional strongholds of white working-class neighborhoods. Exit polls from Connecticut, Pennsylvania and Maryland showed Trump winning about half of Republican voters with college degrees, and over half of Republican voters making more than $100,000 a year. “On its face, it is hard to believe he’d be improving with a demographic group that has been so averse to his style, his denigrating language,” said Randall Miller, a professor of American politics at Saint Joseph’s University in Pennsylvania.  “But I think people may have gotten used to Trump, he’s not as outrageous as he used to be,” he said, adding that familiarity with the businessman’s brand in the Northeast may also have helped him. Still, the five states could be an uphill battle for Republicans in the Nov. 8 presidential election. The last Republican presidential nominee to win any of them was George H.W. Bush in 1988. The challenge for the New York billionaire could be to replicate Tuesday’s performance in other parts of the country as he seeks to lock down his party’s nomination, with 10 state contests remaining.     Nationally, likely voters with a college degree have become increasingly critical of Trump in recent months, according to Reuters\\u002fIpsos polling. He is also increasingly unpopular with those who make more than $100,000 a year. But with Trump far ahead of his rivals, U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Ohio Governor John Kasich, in the race for the presidential nomination, Miller said Republican voters of all stripes may become more resigned to voting for Trump. “I think it is possible he replicates this.” ANTI-ESTABLISHMENT Trump has historically done well in areas where the collapse of important local industries has put stress on working families - propelling his popularity among poorer white voters drawn to his rhetoric about inept government and failed international trade deals. That narrative persisted in Tuesday’s contests. Trump took more than 63 percent of the vote in Forest County, Pennsylvania, where the median family income among whites, at $45,000, is the lowest in the state. But he also got more than 46 percent of the vote in Chester County, Pennsylvania, where median income for whites is the highest in the state, at $108,000.     A Franklin and Marshall College voter survey released last week showed Trump’s message of disaffection had sunk in across the state. Just under 40 percent of voters cited “government, politicians” as the most important problem facing Pennsylvania, with “unemployment, personal finances” ranked a distant second at 14 percent. In the affluent Maryland suburbs of Montgomery and Howard counties, where more than 60 percent of whites hold college degrees, Trump claimed a smaller 40 percent share of the Republican vote. It was still enough for a first-place finish over Cruz and Kasich. Fred Stubbs, 72, a retired accountant from Potomac, Maryland, said he voted for Trump on Tuesday because he believed the real estate mogul would improve the country’s standing in the world. He added that when he traveled to New York, he regularly dined in restaurants in buildings owned by Trump. “I’ve always admired him as a businessman,” Stubbs said.  \"],[\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Funding to battle the Zika virus failed to advance in the U.S. Senate on Tuesday, as Democrats blocked a Republican proposal that they said would short-change the challenge posed by the mosquito-borne virus as well as other health priorities.

Her priority was to transfer wealth from the white minority to the black majority, who are generally much poorer. Those who opposed the policy were mainly white people or members of the black elite who want to preserve the status quo, she said.  If we have to choose between our people having a better life and investment, that s not a choice,  she said, when asked about whether her policies could scare away businesses.  I m not afraid. I m not afraid of them. But I m not surprised white minority capital is not endorsing me,  she said on ANN7 television in a rare interview. ANC delegates will vote for a new party president next month, with Dlamini-Zuma expected to face Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa, a unionist-turned-millionaire businessman who is more popular with foreign investors.  From where I sit, it s looking good. The campaign is going well,  said Dlamini-Zuma, who was married to the president.  The winner of the party vote will be favorite to become the next president of South Africa, either at an election in 2019, or before if Zuma stands down or is forced out by the new ANC leadership next year. Apartheid in South Africa ended in 1994 but much of the country s wealth resides with the white minority. Successive ANC governments have said they want to empower the majority, though many black people have seen only modest economic gains. Dlamini-Zuma, who has held several cabinet posts and was most recently chair of the African Union, has pledged to tackle poverty and close the gaping racial inequality gap. Some investors are concerned about Dlamini-Zuma s proposed plan of  radical economic transformation , which critics have said is a populist term that isn t backed up by solid policies. \"],[\"HAVANA (Reuters) - Cuba has political prisoners and the U.S. government has shared lists of them with the Cuban government, a senior aide to U.S. President Barack Obama said on Monday during Obama’s historic visit to Havana.

Di Maio, deputy speaker of the lower house, is the party s most prominent and popular politician and had been groomed for the leadership in recent years by 5-Star s founder, the 69-year-old comedian Beppe Grillo. Boyish-looking and usually immaculately turned out in suit and tie, Di Maio presents a moderate image in striking contrast to Grillo, who is famous for his raucous tirades against Italy s ruling elite.  You have given me an enormous responsibility ... I assure you I ll carry it out with discipline and honor,  Di Maio told supporters on Saturday at the party s annual gathering in the Adriatic coastal town of Rimini.  I promise I will form a government team to be proud of for the first time in our history.     Grillo, who has so far acted as 5-Star s de facto chief, is now expected to gradually withdraw from the limelight.  I will always be like a dad for all of you, but I am old,  he told the gathering on Friday.     Di Maio, who has taken tough stances on law-and-order and immigration and is widely seen as on the right of the party which says traditional left-right labels have no meaning. He won by a huge margin over seven rivals in an online member ballot, held on Thursday and Friday, that reflected the movement s credo of internet-based direct democracy. His election was considered a formality because the other candidates were all little-known figures, mostly local councillors.  However, participation was much lower than the party had hoped, with just over 37,400 people casting a ballot, compared with more than 140,000 eligible.  Di Maio won 83 percent of the vote. The only people seen as having any chance against him decided not to run, opening the party up to accusations of failing to run a proper contest. Di Maio will now try to put that criticism behind him in the run-up to elections due by May next year. Most opinion polls, give 5-Star around 28 percent of the vote, just ahead of the ruling Democratic Party. However, that would not be enough to give it a majority in parliament unless it allies itself with another party, something it has so far always refused to do. The right-wing Northern League and Silvio Berlusconi s conservative Forza Italia (Go Italy) each have around 14 to 15 percent. 5-Star, founded by Grillo nine years ago as a protest movement, bases its appeal mainly on a campaign against corruption and vested interests. Its policies include the introduction of universal income support for the poor, boosting green energy and increasing the budget deficit to fund investments in infrastructure. Di Maio will need to broaden the movement s appeal and soothe barely disguised resentment among some 5-Star lawmakers over his dominant role in the party. His first challenge will be a vote in Sicily in November, which offers 5-Star the chance to win control of its first ever region. Victory could be a springboard to national success while defeat would be a major setback after the party spent months campaigning intensely on the island.

The remarks are perhaps the strongest indication yet from the Trump administration that prospects for any significant cooperation between the U.S. and Russian militaries against  Islamic State in Syria is unlikely anytime soon. They came despite repeated suggestions by Trump during his election campaign of the possibility of joint action against Islamic State militants.     “We are not in a position right now to collaborate on a military level. But our political leaders will engage and try to find common ground,” Jim Mattis told reporters after talks at NATO headquarters in Brussels, also mentioning U.S. concerns about Russian interference in democratic elections. Just hours before Mattis spoke, Russian President Vladimir Putin said it was in the interests of both nations to restore communications between their intelligence agencies. “It’s absolutely clear that in the area of counter-terrorism all relevant governments and international groups should work together,” he told Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB). U.S. intelligence agencies, however, are among the most powerful voice of caution in Washington on Russia, concluding that Moscow hacked and leaked Democratic Party emails during the presidential campaign as part of efforts to tilt the vote in the Nov. 8 election in Trump’s favor. Monday’s resignation of national security adviser Michael Flynn, who was seen in Moscow as a leading advocate of warmer ties with Russia, has underscored for the Kremlin the difficulties of reaching a settlement. Flynn resigned after disclosures he had discussed U.S. sanctions on Russia with the Russian ambassador to the United States before Trump took office, and that he later misled Vice President Mike Pence about the conversations.  Asked whether he believed that Russia interfered in U.S. presidential elections, Mattis said: “Right now, I would just say there’s very little doubt that they have either interfered or they have attempted to interfere in a number of elections in the democracies.” He did not explicitly cite the U.S. election. A Kremlin aide said there had been no progress on a potential meeting between Trump and Putin. “There is no agreement on a meeting nor a clear understanding yet,” Interfax news agency quoted Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov as saying. BACK-AND-FORTH Mattis, who has previously accused Russia of trying to break the NATO alliance, told a closed-door session of NATO on Wednesday that it needed to be realistic about the chances of restoring a cooperative relationship with Moscow.  He cited Moscow’s 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine, which plunged U.S.-Russia relations to a post-Cold War low. Mattis said NATO needed “negotiate from a position of strength” as he called for stepped up military spending. That prompted a terse reply from Russia’s Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu. “Attempts to build a dialogue with Russia from a position of strength would be futile,” he was quoted as saying by TASS news agency. Mattis shot back: “I have no need to respond to the Russian statement at all. NATO has always stood for military strength and protection of the democracies and the freedoms we intend to pass on to our children.” The back-and-forth came even as U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov met in Germany, and U.S. Marine General Joseph Dunford, the top U.S. military officer, met Chief of the Russian General Staff Valery Gerasimov in Azerbaijan. Lavrov dismissed the uproar over the U.S. election. “You should know we do not interfere in the domestic matters of other countries,” he said.  Congressional inquiries into alleged Russian interference in the U.S. elections are gaining momentum as Capitol Hill investigators press intelligence and law enforcement agencies for access to classified documents. The FBI and several U.S. intelligence agencies are investigating Russian espionage operations in the United States. They are also looking at contacts in Russia between Russian intelligence officers or others with ties to Putin’s government and people connected to Trump or his campaign. \"],[\"(Reuters) - A federal judge in Alabama has issued a permanent injunction barring state officials from denying same-sex couples the right to marry in that state, according to court documents made public on Wednesday.  The order, filed on Tuesday by U.S. District Judge Callie Granade, came in response to a 2014 lawsuit challenging Alabama’s ban on same-sex marriage, finalizing a decision Granade made in early 2015 that the state law was unconstitutional.  The legality of gay marriage was at the center of a national debate until the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in June 2015 that the U.S. Constitution provided same-sex couples the right to marry. Despite that order, Alabama officials continued to resist the change in the law.  Last month, Alabama Supreme Court Chief Justice Roy Moore was suspended for issuing an administrative order to state probate judges that they should not issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. In March, the Alabama Supreme Court dismissed petitions by opponents of same-sex marriage asking to reinstate the ban on those unions but refused to vacate or withdraw its own March 2015 ruling in favor of the same-sex marriage ban, made just months before the U.S. Supreme Court ruling. “This brings a finality by permanently prohibiting Alabama from enforcing its marriage laws which are discriminating against gay couples,” said Susan Watson, executive director of the ACLU of Alabama. “Given Alabama’s fierce resistance, this permanent relief was required to ensure marriage equality in the state.” Officials from the office of Alabama Attorney General Luther Strange, who is named in the lawsuit, could not be reached for comment on Wednesday.  Strange’s attorneys had asked for the lawsuit to be dismissed because the state was currently complying with the federal law.  But Granade said in her ruling that “promising to sin no more” did not render a permanent injunction unnecessary. The actions of the suspended chief justice and other officials suggested that other attempts may be made to undermine the constitutional right of same-sex couples to marry, she wrote. “It cannot be said with assurance that there is no reasonable expectation that Alabama’s unconstitutional marriage laws will not again be enforced,” the order said. \"],[\"BERLIN (Reuters) - Disputes about climate and immigration policy dominated German media ahead of resumed talks among Chancellor Angela Merkel s conservatives, the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) and the environmental Greens about forming a coalition government. Officials from all three political groups traded barbs and insults in a series of media interviews, dimming hopes that next week s talks could result in progress for a so-called Jamaica coalition - a name chosen because the parties  black, yellow and green colors mirror those of the Jamaican flag. Simone Peter, co-leader of the Greens, told Reuters the FDP must agree to honor existing carbon dioxide reduction promises before her party would continue coalition talks. She said her party viewed conservative s insistence on a migrant cap as a  no go . FDP Leader Christian Lindner shot back in an interview with the Bild am Sonntag newspaper:  If the Greens don t budge in future talks, Jamaica will remain a castle in the air.  Merkel, whose conservative alliance suffered its worst result in September elections since 1949, is trying to forge a tricky three-way coalition that is untested at a national level. The exploratory talks are to continue Monday after the three sides failed to reach agreement on immigration and climate issues during an 11-hour session on Thursday. A new poll for Bild am Sonntag newspaper showed support for conservatives down one percentage point to 31 percent - its lowest level this year - while support for the Greens and FDP was unchanged at 10 percent and 11 percent. Peter told Reuters it was nonsense to continue talks unless the FDP committed to a 2007 pledge to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 40 percent from 1990 levels by 2020.  Before exploratory talks continue, the FDP must accept unconditionally the climate protection goals,  Peter told Reuters in an interview.  Otherwise the talks make no sense.  Deputy FDP leader Wolfgang Kubicki told the RND newspaper chain on Friday that no agreement was possible if the Greens insisted on sticking to that target. Lindner blasted the Greens   maximum demands  for ending coal production and giving refugees unlimited rights to bring their families to Germany. He told the Bild am Sonntag such actions would only boost support for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which parlayed public frustration to win 12.6 percent of the vote in September. Alexander Dobrindt, a top negotiator for the Bavarian sister party of Merkel s conservatives, told the paper that building a coalition would be  more than difficult  unless the Greens modified their position rejecting limits on migration. Many conservatives want to take a harder line on immigration, blaming the election setback on Merkel s decision to allow in more than a million migrants in 2015 and 2016. They insist that an agreement by Merkel s CDU and the CSU on guidelines that would limit annual refugee numbers must form the basis of any coalition accord. The Greens reject such a cap. The right to asylum is guaranteed under Germany s constitution. \"],[\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The top U.S. military officer told the Senate on Thursday that it would harm the morale of U.S. forces to order them to carry out activities such as waterboarding or targeting civilians, options previously cited by leading Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. Marine General Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, did not comment on U.S. politics, and Trump’s name did not come up in a question put to him by Senator Lindsey Graham or in Dunford’s response. However, when asked by Graham, a former 2016 White House contender and frequent Trump critic, what the impact such tactics would have on the morale of the force, Dunford said: “Those kinds of activities that you described are inconsistent with the values of our nation. And quite frankly I think it would have an adverse effect,” citing fallout on the morale of the force. “And frankly what you are suggesting are things that actually aren’t legal for them to do anyway,” Dunford added.  During the campaign, Trump indicated that, if elected president, he might order the U.S. military to break the law on interrogation tactics, including waterboarding. Trump also suggested his willingness to target the families of terrorist suspects. Trump, the Republican front-runner, softened his stance on torture earlier in March, saying he would not order the U.S. military to break international laws on how to treat terrorism suspects. Waterboarding is the practice of pouring water over someone’s face to mimic drowning as an interrogation tactic. Critics say it is torture. Democratic President Barack Obama banned use of the method days after taking office in 2009. \"],[\"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Co-chairman Harvey Weinstein was taking an indefinite leave from the Weinstein Co, the film production company said on Friday, adding it will conduct an internal investigation into the New York Times’ report of sexual harassment allegations against one of the most powerful men in Hollywood. The Weinstein Company board of representatives said in a statement that it takes “extremely seriously” the accusations made in the Times story that said Weinstein had made eight settlements with women who had accused him of unwanted physical contact and sexual harassment over three decades.  Meanwhile, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and several Democratic politicians including Senators Kamala Harris, Cory Booker and Chuck Schumer said Friday they will re-route Weinstein’s political donations to women’s rights groups.  Weinstein Co board representatives called it “essential” to company culture “that all women who work for it or have any dealings with it or any of our executives are treated with respect and have no experience of harassment or discrimination.” The company said it has retained an outside legal firm to conduct an independent investigation into the allegations. Weinstein, 65, will take an indefinite leave of absence, the company said. His brother Bob, a co-chairman, and chief operating officer David Glasser will lead the company.  “As Harvey has said, it is important for him to get professional help for the problems he has acknowledged. Next steps will depend on Harvey’s therapeutic progress, the outcome of the Board’s independent investigation, and Harvey’s own personal decisions,” the board representatives added. Weinstein initially responded to the Times story on Thursday by apologizing for causing anyone pain, and saying he was taking a leave of absence. His lawyer later threatened to sue the New York Times. Weinstein, one of Hollywood’s best-known figures, has produced or distributed Oscar-winning movies including “Shakespeare in Love” and “Chicago.” He was a prominent donor to Democrats during the 2016 general election campaign. “The DNC will donate over $30,000 in contributions from Weinstein to EMILY’s List, Emerge America and Higher Heights because what we need is more women in power,” DNC communications director Xochitl Hinojosa said in a statement. \"],[\"(Reuters) - Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s support has sharply fallen in Utah where a poll on Wednesday showed him tied with Democrat Hillary Clinton in a state that has voted Republican in presidential races for decades.     The survey of 500 people from Salt Lake City-based Y2 Analytics also showed a surge for Evan McMullin, an ex-CIA officer running as an independent.     Trump and Clinton were both at 26 percent while McMullin, a member of the Mormon faith that dominates in Utah, trailed just behind at 22 percent. The telephone poll of likely voters was conducted on Monday and Tuesday, after a video featuring comments from Trump about groping women surfaced last week.  The survey underscored the level of disaffection some conservatives have shown for Trump, who has found himself at odds with much of the Republican Party establishment. The last time a Republican presidential nominee lost in Utah was in the landslide national election victory of President Lyndon Johnson, a Democrat, in 1964. “There’s limits to partisanship even in Utah of all places,” Scott Riding, managing partner of Y2 Analytics, said. The poll results indicate severe erosion in Trump’s popularity in Utah even as Clinton’s support has grown slightly. A Salt Lake Tribune poll in September put support for Trump at 34 percent, compared with 25 percent for Clinton. A number of prominent Utah Republicans, including Governor Gary Herbert and U.S. Senator Mike Lee, pulled their support for Trump or called on him to quit the race.  McMullin, a former CIA counter-terrorism specialist and investment banker whose campaign is based in Utah, is less well known nationally than the other minor candidates, Green Party nominee Jill Stein and Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson. Johnson ranked fourth in the Y2 Analytics poll with support from 14 percent of likely voters, roughly in line with his previous level of support in Utah. McMullin, who is running as a conservative independent, is on the ballot in a dozen states including Utah, with plans to expand his reach before the Nov. 8 election, according to his campaign spokesman Rick Wilson.  The vast majority of participants in the poll were familiar with the video tape of Trump’s vulgar comments about women during a 2005 recording and a third of them said it lowered their opinion of the New York businessman. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 4.38 percentage points. \"],[\"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Donald Trump chipped away at Hillary Clinton’s lead in the presidential race this week, according to a Reuters\\u002fIpsos poll released on Friday, as the candidates clashed over how to respond to the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history. The poll, conducted from Monday to Friday, showed Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, with a 10.7 point lead among likely voters over Trump, her likely Republican rival in the November presidential election. That’s down from a lead of 14.3 points for Clinton on Sunday, the day an American-born shooter who declared allegiance to militant group Islamic State killed 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida. Trump seized on the attack to sharpen his security proposals, saying he would block immigration to the United States from any country with a “proven history of terrorism” against America and its allies if elected. The pledge fine-tuned an earlier vow, made after the attacks last year in Paris and California, to ban the entry of all Muslims into the United States. He also called for measures to make it more difficult for suspected terrorists to obtain firearms, veering from the Republican Party’s general opposition to gun control. While Trump’s comments on both Muslims and guns dismayed some Republican elites, they may have cheered some voters. Some 45 percent of Americans said they supported Trump’s idea to suspend Muslim immigration, up from 41.9 percent at the start of the month, according to the poll. Meanwhile, about 70 percent of Americans, including a majority of Democrats and Republicans, said they wanted to see at least moderate regulations and restrictions on guns, up from 60 percent in similar polls in 2013 and 2014.   Clinton focused her response to the Orlando attack on the need to boost intelligence gathering and defeat Islamic State and what she called “radical jihadist terrorism,” while warning against demonizing Muslim-Americans. She also repeated her calls for tougher gun control measures, including a ban on assault weapons. As usual after a major attack, “terrorism” jumped to the top concern among all adults in the poll - rising above the economy, health care and other major issues. The poll’s five-day average showed that 45.5 percent of likely American voters supported Clinton, while 34.8 percent supported Trump, and another 19.7 percent did not support either candidate. On Sunday, Clinton’s support was at 46.6 percent, versus Trump’s 32.3 percent. The Reuters\\u002fIpsos poll was conducted online in English with adults living in the continental United States, Alaska and Hawaii. The political horserace poll included 1,133 likely voters and has a credibility interval, a measure of the poll’s accuracy, of 3.4 percentage points. \"],[\"AJACCIO, France (Reuters) - Corsican nationalists said on Monday it was time for talks with Paris on greater autonomy for the French Mediterranean island, after they won nearly two thirds of seats in local elections. Support for their cause in Sunday s vote was boosted by dissatisfaction with France s mainstream parties, a trend that has fueled secessionist ambitions in other parts of Europe. Nationalist leader Gilles Simeoni hailed the start of a new era after the two-party Pe a Corsica (For Corsica) alliance that he heads took over 56 percent of Sunday s vote and 41 of 63 seats.  Unlike in Catalonia, nationalists in Corsica have downplayed any ambitions for secession, saying the island - where Napoleon was born in 1769 - lacked the Spanish region s demographic and economic clout.  But Simeoni said he was seeking a greater say for local authorities on fiscal issues, official status for the Corsican language, and limiting the right to buy property in some areas to people who had lived on the island for at least five years.   This is a time many of us thought we would never witness,  he told applauding supporters after the win, referring to the fact that nationalists only started to make headway in Corsican elections two years ago.  Our dream is becoming reality.  Calling for discussions to find a  political solution,  Simeoni told Reuters:  It s the start of a new era, the ball is in the government s court.  The nationalist vote also benefited from the island s most active clandestine group, the National Front for the Liberation of Corsica (FLNC), having laid down its weapons in 2014 after a near four-decade long rebellion. Turnout for the run-off election, in which the top parties from an initial Dec. 3 ballot participated, was barely above 50 percent. But in a sign that the government may be heeding the call for dialogue, Prime Minister Edouard Philippe on Sunday called Simeoni to congratulate him on his win and told him he was willing to see him soon in Paris, Philippe s office said.     Corsica has a population of just 320,000 people and a tiny 8.6 billion euro ($10.13 billion) economy.

Forming a surprise alliance with the Houthis when they seized the capital Sanaa in 2014, Saleh s army loyalists and Houthi fighters have together weathered thousands of air strikes by a Saudi-led military coalition in 2 1\\u002f2 years of war. Fearing the Houthis are a proxy for their arch-foe Iran, the mostly Gulf Arab alliance seeks to help the internationally recognized government push up from a base in Yemen s south toward Sanaa. Saleh s guile has been key to resisting the push. For 34 years Saleh ruled over one of the world s most heavily armed and tribal societies with expertly balanced doses of largesse and force. He battled the Houthis for a decade in office before he befriended them when out of power. Cornered by pro-democracy  Arab Spring  protests, Saleh wore a cryptic smile when signing his resignation in a televised ceremony in 2012. Then as now, few could discern his intentions. But his desire to preserve by any means necessary his influence and that of his family - many of whom occupy top military positions - seems beyond doubt. His influence has outlived that of other Arab leaders left dead or deposed by uprisings and civil wars since 2011. As the conflict has wrought a humanitarian crisis, weeks of mutual sniping about responsibility for economic woes in northern Yemeni lands that they together rule peaked with a deadly gun battle between Houthi and Saleh supporters last week. Leaders from Saleh s former ruling party and the Houthis met and pronounced the split healed. Though they pledged to focus on the war effort against Yemen s internationally recognized government that is backed by the Saudi-led coalition, the tensions suggest Saleh is seeking to stake out his own political strategy as exhaustion sets in on all sides.   Saleh wants to capitalize on popular opposition to both the Houthis and the government, positioning himself as an alternative,  said Adam Baron, a Yemen expert at the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR). The war has killed at least 10,000 people, displaced 2 million from their homes, led to widespread hunger and a cholera epidemic which has left 2,000 people dead. Militias and Yemen s powerful Al Qaeda branch have gained ground in the chaos. Any total breakdown within the alliance between Saleh and the Houthis would be bloody and pit scores of local leaders, tribesmen and army units cultivated by Saleh for decades against others loyal to the fighters. Saleh appeared eager to avoid that showdown in an interview which aired on Monday on Yemen Today, a TV channel he owns.  There is no crisis or disagreement at all except in the imaginations of trouble-makers and sowers of discord at home and abroad,  he said. But the ex-leader, at times referring to himself in the third person, said that  imbalances  remained in the alliance, suggesting not all wounds had been salved. Analysts say he remains annoyed at the continued existence of a Houthi  revolutionary committee  which ruled alone before its alliance was formalized with Saleh s General People s Congress party in a  governing council  where they shared power.  Anxiety also flares over appointments of local officials and control over financial policy - both former GPC prerogatives. Beyond local squabbles, the good relations Saleh enjoyed with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates during his presidency raise Houthi fears of a grand double cross. Saleh s son, Ahmed Ali, lives under house arrest in the UAE where he once served as ambassador before it joined its ally Saudi Arabia to make war on the Houthi-Saleh alliance. A powerful former military chief whom his father appeared to be grooming to succeed him, Ahmed Ali and the passing of Saleh power to the next generation may figure into his calculus.  He certainly wants to secure a place for his family in any post-war order ... the Houthis are very paranoid that Saleh may cut a deal with Saudi Arabia and the UAE that will leave them out to dry,  Baron of ECFR added. Saleh has denied seeking to advance his son s political career or any backroom dealing with their enemies. To salvage their alliance, the Houthis will need to convince Saleh that despite their violent history, they make for stronger allies than some GPC members - like Saleh s successor, President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi - who turned on him in the past.  I say to President Saleh, out of sincerity and love, beware of these snakes,  Houthi official Hamid Rizq wrote on his Facebook page on Tuesday.  They are the ones who pushed you to fight wars against the honorable and loyal people in your society then abandoned you and called you are a thief and a criminal.  \"],[\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s eldest son and former campaign chairman can testify publicly before U.S. Senate committees, Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein told CNN on Tuesday. Feinstein said Robert Mueller, the special counsel investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and possible collusion between Moscow and the Trump campaign, has said Donald Trump Jr. and Paul Manafort were free to testify. Feinstein is the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which is among the congressional panels pursuing Russia investigations. \"],[\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senator Mark Kirk of Illinois on Tuesday accused many of his fellow Senate Republicans of being “closed-minded” by refusing to consider President Barack Obama’s nomination of Merrick Garland to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court. Kirk, facing a tough re-election battle in his Democratic-leaning state, became the first Republican senator to meet with Garland since Obama nominated the centrist appellate judge and former prosecutor on March 16 to replace conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, who died on Feb. 13. There is a need for “open-minded, rational, responsible people” to ensure the confirmation process works, Kirk told reporters before his private meeting with Garland, who already has met with some Senate Democrats. Most of the 100-member Senate’s 54 Republicans have backed Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s hard-line stance against confirming any Obama nominee or even meeting with Garland. “I think when you just say, ‘I’m not going to meet with him at all’ - that’s too closed-minded,” added Kirk, a first-term senator who may be one of the most endangered Senate Republicans in the Nov. 8 elections. Maine’s Susan Collins also took her fellow Senate Republicans to task for blocking Garland’s confirmation process.  Collins told WGAN radio, “Whether Republicans like him (Obama) or not, he is our president until inauguration day next January.” Collins said there seemed to be “no basis” for senators to refuse even to consider Garland. McConnell has said the Senate should leave it to Obama’s successor, who will take office next January after November’s elections, to fill the vacancy. More than a dozen Senate Republicans have indicated a willingness to at least meet with Garland. Last week, Kansas Republican Senator Jerry Moran, also running for re-election, was assailed by conservative groups after urging that the confirmation process proceed, even though he made clear he would not vote for Garland. Meetings with senators are a standard part of the confirmation process, allowing lawmakers to get acquainted with nominees for a lifetime position on the Supreme Court. Republicans fear Garland could move the court to the left for the first time in decades. The White House said the court’s split 4-4 ruling in an important labor case on Tuesday underscored the need to confirm Scalia’s replacement. “With a Supreme Court that is not fully staffed, it makes it more likely that situations can arise across the country where there are different rulings in different circuit courts that are not resolved by the Supreme Court,” spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters aboard Air Force One as Obama flew to Atlanta. \"],[\"MELITOPOL, Ukraine (Reuters) - Russia has left troops behind after staging war games in Belarus despite promising not to, Ukraine s Commander in Chief Viktor Muzhenko told Reuters. In an interview on a military plane on Thursday evening, Muzhenko said Russia has withdrawn only a few units from Belarus and had lied about how many of its soldiers were there in the first place.  His comments could increase tension between the two neighbors and contradict the Belarussian defense ministry spokesman, who said the last train of Russian troops and equipment had left Belarus on Thursday. Russia s defense ministry did not respond to an immediate request for comment. Relations between Kiev and Moscow nosedived after Russia s annexation of the Crimean peninsula in 2014 and the outbreak of a separatist insurgency in eastern Ukraine that has killed more than 10,000 people.  Ukraine sees itself as being at war with Russia and has accused Moscow of sending troops and hardware to fight in the Donbass region, which Moscow denies. There are frequent casualties despite a notional ceasefire agreed in 2015.  The Zapad wargames, held by Russian and Belarussian troops on territory in both countries in September, are a new source of concern for neighboring Ukraine and NATO member states on Europe s eastern flank.  Russia has said the exercise was to rehearse a purely defensive scenario, that the scale of the wargames was in line with international rules, and that allegations it was a springboard to invade Poland, Lithuania or Ukraine were false. But Muzhenko said the wargames were of an offensive nature. Ukraine staged its own drills in northern Ukraine in response to Zapad and built up troops there.   I wouldn t say that the tension has lessened. We can say tension is building up or rising,  he said.   We had information that they had withdrawn only a few units of the declared 12,500 troops, of which 3,000 were Russians, but there were significantly more of them there.  Muzhenko said the Russians had withdrawn air units from Belarus to make a show of leaving.  Russia demonstrated, and it was primarily a demonstration, the return of aviation units   they took off from the airfields and flew to airfields in Russia. But we understand that 300-400 km for aviation is a distance that can be overcome in a very short time,  he said.   The 55-year-old, who became Chief of the General Staff in 2014, said Ukraine was still outgunned in terms of its air defense capabilities in the Donbass war and needed air reconnaissance and anti-missile systems.  Kiev is hoping to receive lethal defensive weapons from U.S. President Donald Trump. Muzhenko said talks had been concluded.  We expect the corresponding decision because all negotiations are over and the relevant issues have been agreed   on the list and types of weapons   and we expect only the political decisions of our partner countries,  he said.  \"],[\"(Reuters) - Democrats in the Senate made a concerted push on Tuesday during a confirmation hearing for nominees to the Securities and Exchange Commission to require corporations to disclose political contributions. Senator Charles Schumer of New York threatened to vote against confirming the nominees, Lisa Fairfax and Hester Peirce, if they did not clearly state support for requiring corporations to make their political donations public. “The SEC is certainly not responsible for patching that hole in our campaign finance system, but you can help prevent that hole from being ripped any wider,” Schumer said. “Shareholders remain in the dark as executives of public corporations funnel money into our political system with no transparency or accountability.” Other Democrats, including Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey and Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon, made similar comments. The securities regulator has faced mounting pressure to require contributions disclosure from corporations since the Supreme Court struck down strict limits on campaign finance in its 2010 Citizens United decision.  Menendez said 1.2 million people have written to the SEC about the disclosure requirement.  Budget legislation passed by the Republican-majority Congress at the end of 2015 blocked the SEC from creating a rule on political spending. Peirce, a Republican who is a senior fellow at the Marcatus Center at George Mason University, noted the SEC is charged with carrying out laws and said she would not undermine the budget legislation if she is confirmed.  Fairfax, a Democrat who is a law professor at George Washington University, said she would uphold the budget law. She added, though, that she believes political spending could be material information to shareholders making investment decisions.  Peirce and Fairfax were nominated by President Barack Obama in October, and Tuesday’s hearing was the first step in confirming the nominations.  Republican Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama, the committee’s chairman, said he expected the nominations to come to the floor for a vote.  Still, the confirmations could stretch on for a while given the political divide in Congress and the debate about financial regulation in the presidential election.  The divide has made confirming nominees difficult. Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Ohio, noted Obama sent the committee 19 nominations to consider in the past 15 months and it approved only one.  Meanwhile, the hearing turned to issues that are taking center stage in the presidential campaigns. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat who advocates for financial regulation, pressed Peirce about her public criticism of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law put in place after the financial crisis. Many Republicans consider the law a regulatory overreach, while some Democrats view it as a way of preventing another crisis. “What you propose, from what I can tell in your writings, is less oversight of big banks, fewer efforts to reign them in, more chances for them to take on big risks to boost their profits and, if things go wrong, come crying to the government for another bailout,” Warren said. “The question is whether someone should be put in charge of enforcing laws that they think are unnecessary or counterproductive.” Peirce said she would implement the law as a commissioner. She added that she made her critiques as an academic and not a regulator. Senator Mike Rounds, a Republican from South Dakota, brought up the issue of gun ownership and pushed Fairfax about an amicus brief she signed that questioned WalMart’s gun sales. Fairfax said she was not sending “a signal about the underlying issue” but signed the brief to say companies must communicate corporate policies to investors. \"],[\"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Rescuers on Monday found the body of a Belgian army helicopter pilot who had disappeared in a mysterious midair incident at a weekend airshow, local media said. Investigators are trying to determine how and why the unnamed pilot left the controls of his Agusta A-109 on Sunday and ended up dead hundreds of meters below. The Belgian Armed Forces said in a statement that the pilot had fallen from the aircraft but that the co-pilot, alone on board, had landed it safely. Public broadcaster RTBF, quoting public prosecutors, said the co-pilot told them he was watching three skydivers who had just jumped from the helicopter. When he turned back round, the pilot s seat was empty and the door of the aircraft was open. \"],[\"LONDON (Reuters) - The trilateral meeting between Iran, Russia and Turkey in the Russian resort of Sochi this week was  a right step, at the right time  for stability in Syria, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani told Syrian counterpart Bashar al-Assad. Russia s Vladimir Putin won the backing of Turkey and Iran on Wednesday to host a Syrian peace congress, taking the central role in a major diplomatic push to finally end a civil war all but won by Assad.  Sochi summit   was a right step at the right time,  Rouhani was quoted as saying by state news agency IRNA on Saturday in a phone call with Tehran s main regional ally.  He said a national congress to hold face-to-face talks between government and opposition could be  a step towards stability and security of Syria.  Iran has signed large economic contracts with Syria, reaping what appear to be lucrative rewards for helping Assad in his fight against rebel groups and Islamic State militants.  Tehran is ready to have an active role in reconstruction of Syria,  Rouhani added. The chief commander of Iran s Revolutionary Guards, who has sent weapons and thousands of soldiers to Syria to prop up Assad s regime, also said on Thursday that their forces were ready to help rebuild Syria and bring about a lasting  ceasefire  there. Syria s six-year civil war has killed hundreds of thousands of people and forced millions to flee in the worst refugee crisis since World War Two. In a joint statement in Sochi, the three leaders called on the Syrian government and moderate opposition to  participate constructively  in the planned congress, to be held in the same city on a date they did not specify. Saudi Arabia, Iran s arch rival in the Middle East, also sponsored a meeting on Wednesday at a luxury hotel in Riyadh for the Syrian opposition groups. Regional tensions have risen in recent weeks between Sunni Muslim monarchy Saudi Arabia and Shi ite Iran. Saudi Crown Prince called the Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei  the new Hitler of the Middle East  in an interview with the New York Times published on Thursday. Israel also views Iran as the main threat in the region, and a cabinet minister said this month Israel has had covert contacts with Saudi Arabia.  It is very odd that a regional country considers Iranian nation as its enemy and the Zionist regime as its friend,  Rouhani told Assad in the call. The next round of U.N.-backed peace talks in Geneva aimed at ending the Syrian civil war will begin on Nov. 28. \"],[\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s administration on Sunday tempered a key element of his move to ban entry of refugees and people from seven Muslim-majority countries in the face of mounting criticism even from some prominent Republicans and protests that drew tens of thousands in major American cities. Trump signed the directive on Friday, but the policy appeared to be evolving on the fly. Democrats and a growing number of Republicans assailed the move and foreign leaders condemned it amid court challenges and tumult at U.S. airports. The president’s critics have said his action unfairly singled out Muslims, violated U.S. law and the Constitution and defiled America’s historic reputation as hospitable to immigrants. In a fresh defense of the action on Sunday, Trump said his directive was “not about religion” but keeping America safe. Trump has presented the policy as a way to protect the country from the threat of Islamist militants. U.S. Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said in a statement that people from the seven countries who hold so-called green cards as lawful permanent U.S. residents would not be blocked from returning to the United States from overseas,  as some had been after the directive. All green card holders who were detained at U.S. airports had been admitted into the country by late Sunday, a U.S. official familiar with the process told Reuters. The source could not provide a figure of how many people whose re-entry had been delayed, in some cases for hours. Outside the White House, where some viewing stands from Trump’s Jan. 20 inaugural parade still stood, several thousand protesters denounced him, carrying signs such as “Deport Trump” and “Fear is a terrible thing for a nation’s soul.” Protests also were staged in cities and airports in New York, Los Angeles, Boston, Houston, Dallas and elsewhere. The Republican president on Friday put a four-month hold on allowing refugees into the country, an indefinite ban on refugees from Syria and a three-month bar on citizens from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.  Border and customs officials struggled to put Trump’s directive into practice. Confusion persisted over details of implementation, in particular for the people who hold green cards. Senator Bob Corker, the Republican chairman of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee and a Trump supporter, said the president’s order had been poorly implemented, particularly for green card holders. “The administration should immediately make appropriate revisions, and it is my hope that following a thorough review and implementation of security enhancements that many of these programs will be improved and reinstated,” Corker said. Trump defended his action. “To be clear, this is not a Muslim ban, as the media is falsely reporting,” Trump said in a statement on Sunday. “This is not about religion - this is about terror and keeping our country safe. There are over 40 different countries worldwide that are majority Muslim that are not affected by this order.” He added: “We will again be issuing visas to all countries once we are sure we have reviewed and implemented the most secure policies over the next 90 days.” The department said on Saturday Trump’s action did apply to people with green cards who were returning to the United States from the seven nations, while a White House official said green card holders who had left the United States and wanted to return would have to visit a U.S. embassy or consulate to undergo additional screening. White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus then went on the Sunday morning news programs to say those people would not be blocked. “As far as green card holders moving forward, it doesn’t affect them,” Priebus said on the NBC program “Meet the Press.” Priebus added that these green card holders would be subjected to “more questioning” by U.S. Customs and Border Patrol agents when they try to re-enter the United States “until a better program is put in place over the next several months.” In an apparent indication that Kelly’s instructions were being implemented, some green card holders arriving in the United States said they had no trouble clearing customs.  Mahdi Tajsarvi, an engineer who lives in Virginia, said he and his wife, Arezoo Hosseini, both Iranian citizens with U.S. green cards, were asked a few routine questions by authorities at Dulles International Airport outside Washington on Sunday evening and let through within a few minutes. Priebus also said Customs and Border Patrol agents would  have “discretionary authority” when they encountered someone arriving who they suspect “is up to no good” from certain nations. Asked why Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Egypt were not included on Trump’s list, Priebus said that “perhaps other countries needed to be added to an executive order going forward.” U.S. judges in at least five states blocked federal authorities from enforcing Trump’s directive, but lawyers representing people covered by the order said some authorities were unwilling on Sunday to follow the judges’ rulings. U.S. Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham, prominent Republican foreign policy voices, said in a joint statement Trump’s order may do more to help recruit terrorists than improve U.S. security. “Ultimately, we fear this executive order will become a self-inflicted wound in the fight against terrorism,” they said, adding the United States should not stop green card holders “from returning to the country they call home.” “This executive order sends a signal, intended or not, that America does not want Muslims coming into our country,” the added. Trump blasted the two senators in a Twitter statement, calling them “sadly weak on immigration.” In a another Twitter message earlier on Sunday, Trump said the United States needed “strong borders and extreme vetting, NOW.” “Christians in the Middle-East have been executed in large numbers. We cannot allow this horror to continue!” added Trump, who successfully tapped into Americans’ fear of attacks during his election campaign. Trump’s tweet did not mention that many more Muslims have been killed in the bloody Syrian civil war and other violence in the targeted countries. Condemnation of Trump’s action poured in from abroad, including from traditional allies of the United States. In Germany, which has taken in large numbers of people fleeing the Syrian civil war, Chancellor Angela Merkel said the global fight against terrorism was no excuse for the measures and “does not justify putting people of a specific background or faith under general suspicion,” her spokesman said on Sunday. Canada will offer temporary residency to people stranded in the country as a result of Trump’s executive order on immigration, Canadian Immigration Minister Ahmed Hussen said. Briefing reporters at the White House on condition of anonymity, a U.S. administration official rejected criticism of the way Trump’s plan had been carried out, saying: “So it really is a massive success story in terms of implementation on every single level.” Chuck Schumer, the top Democrat in the Republican-led U.S. Senate, had a different view, calling Trump’s administration incompetent. “One hand doesn’t know what the other is doing,” Schumer said. “I think banning refugees, banning immigrants, banning religions like Islam or any other religion, is un-American,” said Will Turner, 42, draped in a U.S. flag among a crowd of several thousand people in front of the White House chanting: “No hate, no fear, refugees are welcome here.” An official of the conservative billionaire industrialist Koch brothers’ political network of donors criticized Trump’s immigration order at the donors’ winter gathering in Indian Wells, California. “Our country has benefited tremendously from a history of welcoming people from all cultures and backgrounds. This is a hallmark of free and open societies,” Brian Hooks said in a statement. Civil rights and some religious groups, activists and Democratic politicians have promised to fight Trump’s order and Schumer said his party would introduce legislation to overturn it. Republicans control both the House of Representatives and the Senate. Priebus said that of 325,000 people who arrived from foreign countries on Saturday, 109 people were detained for further questioning, and most of them were moved out, with just a “couple dozen more that remain” detained.  “It wasn’t chaos,” he said. Judges in California, Massachusetts, Virginia and Washington state, each home to international airports, issued their rulings after a similar order was issued on Saturday night by U.S. District Judge Ann Donnelly in New York’s Brooklyn borough in a case involving two Iraqis caught by the order as they flew into the country. Attorneys general from California, New York, 13 other states and Washington, D.C., condemned and pledged to fight what they called Trump’s “dangerous” and “unconstitutional” order. \"],[\"WASHINGTON\\u002fTEGUCIGALPA (Reuters) - The United States on Friday backed the re-election of Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez despite widespread misgivings about the vote count, prompting the opposition candidate to describe his bid for the presidency as a  lost cause.  The Honduran electoral tribunal declared Hernandez winner of the Nov. 26 election last weekend amid strident opposition protests over the vote count in the impoverished Central American country, which is a major hub for drug trafficking. The vote tally had initially clearly favored opposition candidate Salvador Nasralla, a center-leftist, but it swung in favor of the incumbent after a 36-hour delay.  After the United States weighed in, Nasralla was pessimistic about his chances of winning support in Honduras, claiming in an interview with Reuters that the nation s supreme court and electoral tribunal are in Hernandez s camp.  But he maintained that he had a path to victory at the international level, noting the Organization of American States (OAS) had called for new elections to resolve the dispute.  Nationally, we think it s a lost cause,  he told Reuters.  But internationally, we are confident that the OAS, which understands the great fraud in Honduras, will take action so that they repeat the elections.   Earlier in the day, Nasralla appeared all but ready to bow out of the race, saying in an interview with TV network France TV that his political career was over.   The situation is practically decided,  he told the network.  I no longer have anything to do in politics, but the people, which are 80 percent in my favor, will continue the fight.  The United States followed Mexico and other Latin American countries in supporting Hernandez, who has been a reliable U.S. ally.  The U.S. State Department congratulated Hernandez and said Honduras should pursue a  long-term effort to heal the political divide in the country and enact much-needed electoral reforms,  spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement. The Honduras election tribunal s declaration in Hernandez s favor last week sparked violent protests in Honduras, and the OAS s call for new elections has been rejected by the Honduran government. Nasralla had been backed by former President Manuel Zelaya, a leftist who was ousted in a 2009 coup after he proposed a referendum on his re-election, which was barred by the constitution at the time. But Zelaya said Friday that Nasralla was no longer a member of his alliance.  Nasralla said that he had no need for party membership anymore.    I am the president elect of all Hondurans,  he said.  It no longer makes sense to belong to the Alliance.  The streets of the Honduran capital Tegucigalpa and other major cities were largely calm on Friday with a few protests cleared by the armed forces. By mid-week some 27 people had died in clashes, according to local human rights group COFADEH. The State Department called for all sides to refrain from violence, for those who wish to challenge the result to use legal means, and for the government to ensure that security services respect the rights of peaceful protesters. It also called for the electoral tribunal  to transparently and fully review any challenges filed by political parties.  Hernandez has led a military crackdown against gangs in the Central American country, and Honduras  notoriously high murder rate has slid since he took power in 2014. Nasralla, a television host, traveled to Washington this week to urge the United States not to recognize the vote, but a senior State Department official said on Wednesday the government had not seen any evidence that would alter the vote s outcome. Nasralla said the U.S. decision reflected Washington s strategic concerns over a leftist government in Honduras.  They re afraid of losing Honduras,  he told local television. \"],[\"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Adolfo Lagos, the head of struggling Mexican broadcaster Grupo Televisa s telecoms unit izzi, was shot dead on Sunday on the outskirts of Mexico City, the state attorney general s office said in a statement. The attorney general s office for the State of Mexico, which surrounds the capital, said it was investigating the homicide near the ancient Teotihuacan pyramids. It said Lagos was on a bicycle when he was shot. He died in hospital from his wounds.  Press reports said Lagos died after group of men tried to steal his bike. In his Twitter profile photo, Lagos is shown riding a bike. The attorney general s office could not immediately be reached for comment.   Grupo Televisa profoundly laments the death of izzi Director Adolfo Lagos Espinosa that took place in the State of Mexico. Our condolences to his wife, daughters and family members,  the company wrote on Twitter. izzi offers phone, internet and cable television services. Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto took to Twitter to offer his condolences, saying that the federal attorney general s office would help state prosecutors investigate. The death of Lagos, a well-known former banker, is a fresh pain for Televisa, which is struggling with declining ad sales and tough competition from the widespread move to online video. The company s longtime chief executive will step down next year, the company said last month, and Televisa has also faced U.S. allegations that it was among media companies that paid bribes to secure television rights for soccer matches. The testimony came during the first trial to emerge from the U.S. investigation of bribery surrounding FIFA, soccer s world governing body. \"],[\"CAIRO (Reuters) - At least 54 people were killed when suspected militants set off a bomb and opened fire at a mosque in Egypt s restive northern Sinai on Friday, state media and eyewitnesses said. Eyewitnesses reported ambulances ferrying casualties from the scene to nearby hospitals after the attack on Al Rawdah mosque in Bir al-Abed, west of Arish city. Another 75 people were wounded, MENA reported. President Abdel Fattah al Sisi convened an emergency security meeting soon after the attack, state television reported. Egypt s security forces are battling an Islamic State insurgency in north Sinai, where militants have killed hundreds of police and soldiers since fighting there intensified over the last three years. Militants have mostly targeted security forces in their attacks, but have also tried to expand beyond the peninsula by hitting Egyptian Christian churches and pilgrims. \"],[\"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China must win its battle against corruption or face being erased by history, its new top graft buster said in an editorial on Saturday, underscoring the ruling Communist Party s focus on eliminating corrupt behaviour. Zhao Leji, appointed to the new seven-member Politburo Standing Committee last month and tasked to lead President Xi Jinping s signature war on corruption, wrote in the state-run People s Daily that failure would lead to the party s downfall.  If our control of the party is not strong and party governance is not strict, then the party won t be able to avoid being erased by history and the historic task the party carries will not be able to be fulfilled,  Zhao wrote. Xi, like others before him, has warned that corruption is so serious it could lead to the end of the party s grip on power. Xi s corruption fight has ensnared more than 1.3 million officials. At last month s five-yearly party congress he said it would continue to target both  tigers  and  flies , a reference to elite officials and ordinary bureaucrats. Zhao, formerly a low-profile official, replaced Wang Qishan, whose sweeping anti-graft campaign had made him China s second most-powerful politician.  The facts tell us and warn us that the party s position as the top political leader and power is the foundation of our political stability, economic development, national unity and social stability,  Zhao wrote. Zhao leads the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI), having previously been in charge of the party s powerful organisation department, which is in charge of personnel decisions. He added that there would be no tolerance of people who  just do what they want to do  and ignore orders or carry on with banned behaviours like trying to get around policy decisions. Promotions also needed to be rigorously scrutinised, he said, a reference to numerous previous scandals where corrupt officials had abused their power or taken bribes to promote friends and family members.  Officials  personal files must be examined, and individuals  reports on their personal matters must be verified,  Zhao wrote. Above all, the leadership of the Communist Party had to be maintained, as the last 100 years of history had shown that without the party s leadership  there is no way out , he added. China has plans for a national supervision law and a new commission next year to oversee the expansion of Xi s graft fight. \"],[\"BELGRADE (Reuters) - Serbia  foreign minister accused world powers on Tuesday of using double standards by refusing to accept the Catalan independence referendum while largely welcoming a separate Kosovo. Kosovo declared independence from Serbia in 2008 - an announcement accepted by Washington and most EU states but rejected by Belgrade and its allies. Almost a decade later on Sunday, voters in Catalonia backed independence from Spain in a referendum declared unconstitutional by the Madrid government. A day later Germany called the vote worrying, as other states fretted about their own separatist-minded communities.  I am bothered by the double standards of the international community,  foreign minister Ivica Dacic told the RTS public broadcaster.       The EU will never say it made an error with the recognition of Kosovo, but that decision will backfire. The Pandora s box was opened,  Dacic said.      Serbia s position on Kosovo has been one of the main stumbling blocks in its own bid to join the European Union. Brussels has said it needs to improve relations with the authorities in Pristina and stop trying to block their efforts to join international bodies. On Monday, Serbia s President Aleksandar Vucic called senior ministers and security chiefs for talks after European Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas said comparisons between Spain and Serbia could not be made as Kosovo had happened in  a very specific context .   How it can be that the referendum is invalid in Catalonia and in Kosovo it (independence) could be done without one,  Vucic said on Monday after meeting Greek President Prokopis Pavlopoulos in Belgrade.      Kosovo seceded almost a decade after NATO intervened with air strikes to drive out Serbian forces and halt the killing and expulsion of ethnic Albanian civilians during a two-year counter-insurgency war. \"],[\"DES MOINES, Iowa (Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump offered fresh details of how he would tackle illegal immigration on Saturday, saying he would crack down on those who overstay their visas as he sought to quiet criticism from conservatives. In a campaign speech in Des Moines, Iowa, Trump also cited the shooting death of a cousin of NBA star Dwyane Wade to urge African-American voters to rally behind him, calling it an example of violence that has to be addressed. Trump, speaking on the Iowa State Fairgrounds with hay bales stacked behind him, sought to clarify his views on how to overhaul the U.S. immigration system after saying earlier in the week that he was softening on his plan to deport all 11 million illegal immigrants. That stance drew fire from conservatives who wanted him to stand fast after he won the Republican presidential nomination in large part by a hardline stance that would include building a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico. In his speech, Trump said he would seek to institute a tracking system to ensure illegal immigrants who overstay their visas are quickly removed, and would propose an e-verify system to prevent the illegal community from gaining access to welfare and other benefits. “If we don’t enforce visa expiration dates, then we have an open border – it’s as simple as that,” he said. In outlining his views, Trump said addressing illegal immigration is important to helping Americans find jobs. “Every time an African-American citizen, or any citizen, loses their job to an illegal immigrant, the rights of that American citizen have been violated,” he said. “Equal protection under the law must include the consistent application of our immigration laws.” Trump said his first priority upon taking office next January would be the immediate deportation of thousands of illegal immigrants who remain in the United States despite having committed crimes. “These international gangs and cartels will be a thing of the past. Their reign of terror will be over. In this task, we will always err on the side of protecting the American people – we will use immigration law to prevent crimes, and will not wait until some innocent American has been harmed or killed before taking action,” he said. He did not explain how his plan would affect many of the illegal community who have been in the United States for decades and obeyed U.S. laws. Trump said the death in Chicago of Wade cousin Nykea Aldridge, 32, a mother of four, was an example of turmoil in U.S. inner cities. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, a former chief of staff to Democratic President Barack Obama, has struggled in particular to contain violence in his city. The incident permitted Trump to bring up again his desire to be a “law and order” president and underscore his drive to appeal to African-American voters who traditionally vote Democratic and overwhelmingly support Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. “It breaks all of our hearts to see it, it’s horrible,” Trump said. “And it’s only getting worse. This shouldn’t happen in our country. This shouldn’t happen in America. We send our thoughts and our prayers to the family, and we also promise to fight for a much, much better tomorrow.” Trump raised the subject after sending out tweets earlier in the day that prompted charges of insensitivity to the death and accusations he sought to exploit it for political purposes. The New York businessman was the headline speaker at “Joni Ernst’s Roast and Ride,” a charity event for military veterans run by U.S. Senator Joni Ernst, a Republican. Ernst and most other speakers offered praise for Trump, a rarity at a time when many Republican political leaders have distanced themselves from his candidacy due to his incendiary rhetoric. Trump is running neck and neck with Clinton in polls in the state with 72 days until the Nov. 8 election. \"],[\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Most of the U.S. coal industry doubts Donald Trump can fulfill his promise to make the ailing industry great again in a country awash in dirt-cheap natural gas, a competing fuel.  But a small sub-section of the coal sector that mines metallurgical coal - a variety used by steel makers instead of power plants - is gearing up for a Trump-inspired boom. That’s because the Republican president-elect has promised a spending surge for roads, bridges and tunnels after he takes office on Jan. 20, a push to upgrade America’s infrastructure with the support of leading Democrats that could jolt demand for metallurgical coal from American steel mills. Prices for met coal, as it is called, have already risen in recent months on lower supply from China. “This is the best news that Appalachia as a whole has had in about 10 years,” said Jason Bostic, a vice president at the West Virginia Coal Association, referring to Trump’s infrastructure agenda. “Suddenly there’s a little bit of hope here.” Corsa Coal Corp, a producer of met coal based in Pennsylvania, was already encouraged by the China-driven price spike before Trump’s victory. Now it believes U.S. politics are going its way too. “The thing that has got me the most excited is the potential for infrastructure spending,” said George Dethlefsen, Corsa’s chief executive. “All those things are very energy- and steel-intensive, and that’s good for our business.” The company  plans to boost its production of met coal by 70 percent in 2017 to around 1.2 million short tons. In the meantime, it is putting mines on a six-day-a-week schedule, up from four days, and it is looking at loading coal on its midnight shift, which it normally reserves for maintenance. Arch Coal Inc, which produces both met and steam coal used in power plants, said it was also optimistic about Trump, particularly his promise to roll back regulations. But other representatives of the steam coal industry have said regulation reversals may not overcome their main problem: plentiful and cheap natural gas following a decade-long hydraulic fracturing drilling boom. National production figures for met coal are unavailable, since the government does not break the data out. But total U.S. coal production has fallen to its lowest level since 1986, costing the industry thousands of jobs, as low natural gas prices and President Barack Obama’s emissions and water regulations took their toll. Met coal prices, however, reflect the coal sector’s only major sign of life this year. They have risen to above $270 a metric ton this month from lows of $70 a ton in February, driven in part by China reducing its output. Corsa and Arch are among a very small number of U.S. met coal producers that are publicly traded, with most of the others small and privately owned. Alpha Natural Resources, which emerged from bankruptcy in July, declined to comment.  Trump’s transition team is weighing an “infrastructure bank” to make investments in projects as part of an economic focus that also includes revamping taxes and regulation, a Trump adviser said this week. Democrats, including Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority leader Nancy Pelosi, have indicated they hope to work quickly with Trump on infrastructure. But whether they will succeed is far from certain, as many Republicans oppose spending bills. Ramaco, a private company, announced in September it will open two met coal mines in West Virginia and Virginia next year, thanks to $90 million in private equity investments that came in as global met coal prices swung upward. Randy Atkins, the chairman and chief executive of Ramaco, said adding new mines was possible if Trump’s U.S. infrastructure push succeeds but would depend on whether additional investors flock in to fund them. Banks and financial institutions are sensitive to recent bankruptcies of major coal companies - including Arch and Peabody Energy Corp - and the weak financial conditions of others, Atkins said. Jim Truman, the director of global metallurgical coal markets at research group Wood Mackenzie, said the specialized workers that would be required, such as underground electricians, could also be hard to find given coal’s downturn since 2008. Phil Smith, a spokesman for the United Mine Workers of America, said the other key to the U.S. met coal industry’s outlook is whether new infrastructure relies on American-made steel and coal as Trump has promised. “If we are importing the coal or importing steel made with foreign coal, then it won’t make any difference for American miners,” Smith said. \"],[\"BERLIN (Reuters) - Three of Germany s main parties have raised objections to the far-right Alternative for Germany s (AfD) candidate for the post of parliamentary vice president, highlighting its political isolation despite a strong showing in the Sept. 24 election. The anti-immigrant AfD swept into the Bundestag lower house of parliament with 12.6 percent of the vote, making it the third largest parliamentary group. It is the first far-right party to enter the Bundestag since the 1950s. All parties represented in the Bundestag are entitled to have their own vice president of the parliament, who chairs sessions, sets the agenda and calls lawmakers to order where necessary. But the candidates need to be approved by an absolute majority of all sitting lawmakers.  The Greens, the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) and the radical Left Party spoke out against the AfD s nomination of 75-year-old Albrecht Glaser, who has called Islam a political ideology rather than a religion, and said Muslims should not have the right to freedom of religion as Islam did not respect that freedom. Their objections demonstrated the difficulties the AfD may face in pushing its agenda - ranging from immigration and an insistence that Islam does not belong in Germany to problems it sees in the euro zone. The parliamentary vice presidents are generally elected in the first session of the lower house, which is expected to take place by Oct. 24 at the latest. Chancellor Angela Merkel s conservative bloc has so far not taken a public position on the AfD s choice. Michael Grosse-Broemer, the head of the conservatives  parliamentary group, declined to comment on Monday. Carsten Schneider, parliamentary manager of the center-left Social Democrats (SPD), told Reuters TV he did not know Glaser personally, did not want to pre-judge him and would seek to clarify with other parliamentary groups whether they could get to know Glaser in some format first. However, Dietmar Bartsch, head of the Left s parliamentary group, and Cem Ozdemir of the Greens told newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung they would not vote Glaser into the position.  Whoever questions the freedom of religion has disqualified themselves,  Ozdemir said. A representative of the FDP also expressed doubts about the AfD s choice of Glaser. Glaser was a member of Chancellor Angela Merkel s Christian Democrats (CDU) for 40 years until quitting in 2012 and helping to found the AfD in 2013. Alexander Gauland, head of the AfD s parliamentary group, told Reuters his party was sticking to its choice of candidate.  We all share Mr Glaser s opinion so it s completely clear,  he said. Gauland provoked outrage by saying during the election campaign that Germans should be proud of their World War Two soldiers. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker told mass-selling Bild newspaper that Gauland was not conscious enough of the feelings of other European countries who suffered under Nazi rule.  I won t accuse the whole AfD or its voters of being total Nazis - that would be simplistic - but if you re head of a group in Germany s Bundestag you need to consider how Germany s neighbors feel. And Gauland doesn t do that,  he said. \"],[\"MOSCOW (Reuters) - A Russian court was told on Tuesday that a close ally of President Vladimir Putin personally handed the country s then economy minister $2 million in cash inside a lockable brown bag as part of an elaborate bribery sting. Former Economy Minister Alexei Ulyukayev is on trial on charges of extorting the $2 million bribe from Igor Sechin, the head of state-owned oil company Rosneft, in exchange for Ulyukayev approving a business deal. In the courtroom, a state prosecutor read out the transcript of a secret recording of a late-night meeting between Sechin and Ulyukayev on Nov. 14 last year at the Rosneft offices in Moscow, when prosecutors say the money was handed over.  Sechin, who was cooperating with law enforcement officials, was wearing a wire to gather evidence. Ulyukayev says he was framed after having been lured to what he said was an innocent meeting to discuss Rosneft. The case has thrust into the open simmering tensions between rival Kremlin clans   a spectacle rarely seen in public in the 17 years since Putin first became president. Sechin, one of Putin s closest lieutenants, is part of a powerful faction in the Kremlin that favors greater state control over the economy. They have clashed with economic liberals in the government, a group that included Ulyukayev, whose arrest is seen as weakening the latter group s hand.  In the transcript read out in court on Tuesday, Sechin is quoted asking someone to bring some tea and  a little basket with sausage , a reference to a gift he gave Ulyukayev. In another fragment read out by the prosecutor, Sechin is cited as telling Ulyukayev:  Sorry it took a while. I was on a business trip and going here and there while putting together the amount. Consider the mission accomplished. There you go   take it. And this key just in case. And take the basket too.  The funds were handed over inside a lockable brown bag along with a key and the basket, the state prosecutor said. When agents from Russia s Federal Security Service swooped on Ulyukayev as he emerged from the meeting, the minister told agents that the bag he was carrying in the boot of his car contained some  good wine  given to him by Sechin, a state prosecutor told the court.  When agents opened the bag with a key which Ulyukayev said Sechin had given him, they found 200 bundles of $100 bills, the prosecutor said. The basket was also found in the boot.  Ulyukayev s hands were also found to be contaminated with a tracing agent that the bag had been marked with, the prosecutor said. \"],[\"PHOENIX (Reuters) - Two National Football League teams largely steered clear of a controversy over national anthem protests that have ensnared U.S. President Donald Trump and threatened to damage the game’s popularity, staging a “moment of unity” on Monday instead. The entire Dallas Cowboys team, including owner Jerry Jones, linked arms and knelt on the playing field for a moment before the game, but then stood respectfully as the “Star-Spangled Banner” was performed by singer Jordin Sparks. “We all agreed that our players wanted to make a statement about unity and we wanted to make a statement about equality,” Jones said after his team beat the Arizona Cardinals 28-17.  Jones has previously expressed pride that no players on his team had taken to one knee as the anthem was played and said he was disappointed to see such protests. Cardinals players joined arms as a giant flag was unfurled on the field but did not kneel. “Prior to the National Anthem, the @DallasCowboys and @AZCardinals shared a moment of unity on the field,” the NFL said in a Twitter post that was retweeted by the Cowboys.  Former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick stirred a polarizing national debate in 2016 after refusing to stand during pre-game renditions of the “Star Spangled Banner” to protest against police violence against African-Americans. Kaepernick was not signed by an NFL team this season but several players have made similar gestures. Trump kicked off his battle with the largest-grossing U.S. professional sports league at a rally on Friday, when he said any protesting player was a “son of a bitch” who should be “fired.”Those remarks touched off protests by dozens of NFL players, coaches and even some owners at games on Sunday, along with criticism from many corners of the sports world. “The childishness, the gratuitous fear-mongering and race baiting has become so consistent that we almost expect it, the bar has been lowered so far,” Gregg Popovich, head coach of the San Antonio Spurs basketball team, told reporters.  The head of the U.S. Olympic Committee (USOC) spoke out in support of the protesters at NFL games. “The athletes you see protesting are protesting because they love their country,” USOC Chief Executive Scott Blackmun told reporters in Park City, Utah. The International Olympic Committee’s charter prohibits “demonstrations of political, religious or racial propaganda” at Olympic venues. Not all players joined in Sunday’s protests. Notably, Pittsburgh Steelers lineman Alejandro Villanueva, a U.S. Army veteran, stood alone at the entrance to the stadium for the anthem on Sunday while his teammates waited in the locker room. Villanueva jerseys and other apparel have outsold those of all other players in the past 24 hours, said a spokesman for online retailer Fanatics, which operates NFLShop.com. Villanueva’s teammate, Ben Roethlisberger, said on Monday he regretted having missed the anthem. “I was unable to sleep last night,” Roethlisberger said in a statement. “I personally don’t believe the Anthem is ever the time to make any type of protest.”      Trump kept up his verbal battle with the players on Monday, saying on Twitter that his objection to the protests had nothing to do with race but was “about respect for our Country, Flag and National Anthem. NFL must respect this!” The president, who has called for a boycott of NFL games, also tweeted: “Tremendous backlash against the NFL and its players for disrespect of our Country.” The demonstrations have become a thorny issue for the league, which has sought to support players’ rights to protest while trying to keep politics from overshadowing games. CBS Corp said overall viewership of games it broadcast on Sunday was up 4 percent from last year and 1 percent from last week. NBC, owned by Comcast Corp, said viewership for its Sunday night game was down compared with the week before. “The protest has nothing to do with respecting the flag. I agree with their message but not doing it during the anthem,” U.S. Air Force veteran Jimmy Phillips, 43, said before Monday’s game in Phoenix. Nike Inc said it supported athletes who had joined the protests. “Nike supports athletes and their right to freedom of expression on issues that are of great importance to our society,” Nike said in a statement. The debate attracted intense attention online, with the hashtag “#TakeAKnee” racking up 2.4 million mentions and “#TakeTheKnee” used 1.2 million times by Monday, while “#BoycottNFL” had 101,500 mentions. Prominent players continued to speak out against Trump on Monday.     New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, who has said he considers Trump a friend, said on Monday he disagreed with the president’s remarks. “I thought it was just divisive,” Brady told Boston’s WEEI radio. At the same time as he berated the NFL, Trump praised car-racing league NASCAR, which saw no protests at its Sunday race in New Hampshire.

Shafik s daughter May Shafik told Reuters on Friday he was preparing to depart, first for Europe and the United States.  Then he will head back to Egypt to start his presidential campaign,  she said. Shafik had been prevented from leaving the UAE in previous days but had now received assurances that he could travel freely, she said, without specifying who gave the assurances. The UAE denied placing any movement restrictions on Shafik, after a video of him aired by Qatari-owned TV channel Al Jazeera said he had been barred from travel. May Shafik said there had been no intention to release that video, and that it had been leaked to Al Jazeera. The video was filmed as a precaution, she said. The UAE is an ally of Sisi s government, which has been officially silent on Shafik s candidacy announcement. Several Egyptian TV pundits, however, came out against Shafik in a sign of opposition he is likely to face from state-linked media. Shafik is the most serious potential challenger yet to Sisi, who is widely expected to seek a second term, although he has not yet announced he will run. Sisi as a military commander led the ousting of former president Mohamed Mursi of the Muslim Brotherhood in 2013, before his own landslide election a year later. Sisi s supporters see him as key to stability following prolonged, violent upheaval that followed the 2011 Egyptian revolt that toppled president Hosni Mubarak. Sisi s government is fighting an Islamist militant insurgency in the Sinai region and has also enacted painful austerity reforms over the last year that critics say have dented his popularity. Shafik, a minister under Mubarak, narrowly lost to Mursi in Egypt s 2012 election before fleeing overseas. \"],[\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Presidential candidate Donald Trump on Wednesday lashed out at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce’s scathing criticism of his stance on trade, highlighting divisions within the Republican Party that threaten unity ahead of the Nov. 8 election. At a campaign rally in Maine on Wednesday, Trump called the nation’s largest business association “controlled totally by various groups of people who don’t care about you whatsoever.” He said new trade deals should be negotiated because foreign countries are taking advantage of America. “Every country that we do business with us look at us as the stupid people with the penny bank,” Trump said Wednesday at the rally in Bangor, Maine. The Washington-based lobbying group, which represents the United States’ largest companies and business interests, is typically a reliable backer of Republican policies.  But on Tuesday it took issue with Trump’s vocal opposition to trade deals, calling his proposals “dangerous” ideas that would push the United States into another recession. Trump said the Chamber’s argument that his policies would cause a trade war were incorrect because the United States was already at a deficit.  “We’re already losing the trade war, we lost the trade war,” Trump said. “Nothing can happen worse than is happening now.” In speeches on Tuesday, Trump called for renegotiating or scrapping the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with Canada and Mexico, calling it a job killer, and reiterated opposition to the pending Trans-Pacific Partnership among the United States and 11 other Pacific Rim countries. He also lambasted China’s trade and currency policies. The Chamber has consistently backed trade deals.      The public squabbling between the presumptive Republican nominee and the business group was unusual, one of a series of reminders that Trump still struggles to unite his party behind his campaign. The Republicans and many business leaders tend to share policy goals and work in lockstep, and many business leaders have traditionally been big donors to Republican candidates. So far, the Chamber’s political action committee has donated $134,000 to federal candidates or their committees, with $127,500 of that total going to Republicans, according to U.S. government campaign finance records. Billionaire Republican donor Paul Singer, who bankrolled an effort to try to defeat Trump during the campaign’s nominating phase, said on Wednesday that a Trump presidency and his trade positions would almost certainly lead to a global depression. “The most impactful of the economic policies that I recall him coming out for are these anti-trade policies,” Singer said during a panel discussion at the Aspen Ideas Festival in Colorado, according to CNBC. But opposing trade deals has proven a winning strategy for Trump among voters concerned about the loss of manufacturing jobs.  Art Laffer, an economic adviser to President Ronald Reagan who supports Trump, said he did not like the tone of Trump’s speech on Tuesday but thought it was an improvement over his past comments on trade. “It’s not terribly alarming to me,” Laffer said. “I didn’t see any 45 percent tariffs across the board. ... “I saw negotiating better trade deals rather than throwing away all the trade deals we have now. He points out the flaws in these trades, and that’s all true,” Laffer said. “I don’t like the tone of it, but I dislike the tone less today than I did three weeks ago.” Peter Navarro, a Trump trade policy adviser, defended the candidate’s position. “Here’s the central point to understand: The White House has been utterly and completely soft on China’s illegal trade practices,” said Navarro, a professor at the University of California, Irvine. “The status quo is the worst of all possible worlds for the United States.”  Trump also took fire from for his positions on trade from Democrats. In a call organized by rival Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign, U.S. Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, a former businessman and tech entrepreneur, said that while the country needed to do a better job protecting workers, more resources should be put into training them for a new economy. He also noted that it was unusual to see a Republican standard-bearer and the Chamber divide.  “You’ve really got a special circumstance when the U.S. Chamber of Commerce” responded to Trump’s economic plan with a “full-fledged onslaught,” Warner said. “No one could have predicted this kind of election season.” Clinton held no public campaign events on Wednesday but did announce she would appear next week with President Barack Obama, the first time this year that he and his former Secretary of State have campaigned together. \"],[\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Raw feelings and mistrust could pose an obstacle to President Donald Trump and hard-line conservative lawmakers in his Republican Party as they seek to rebound from defeat on healthcare legislation by launching into an overhaul of the U.S. tax code. Trump has accused the Freedom Caucus lawmakers of snatching a “defeat from the jaws of victory” with their rejection of the White House-backed healthcare bill to replace President Barack Obama’s 2010 healthcare reform bill. In interviews with 10 of the roughly three dozen House Freedom Caucus members, the lawmakers said they were eager to put aside tensions over the healthcare debacle and seek common ground on tax reform. But there is no consensus, even within the conservative faction, on details of a tax-reform bill, with some members open to discussing ideas such as the border tax plan supported by House leaders and others opposed to it. Representative Warren Davidson, a Freedom Caucus member from Ohio, said Republicans should leave aside the blame game and work through their policy differences before launching tax reform legislation. “Some people are still in that hurt-feelings and frustration” stage, Davidson said. “I do think it’s smart to take the time to get it right.” Republican Representative David Schweikert of Arizona, a Freedom Caucus lawmaker who sits on the tax-writing House of Representative Ways and Means Committee, could emerge as a bridge between the conservative faction and House leaders. The panel will work closely with House leadership on the tax bill. Schweikert said he planned to consult with rank-and-file members to discuss plans and listen to their priorities. He said giving companies incentives to invest in plants and equipment was one of the items on his own wish list. “My personal fixation is very simple: What maximizes economic growth?” Schweikert said. Representative Mark Meadows, chairman of the Freedom Caucus, said the group has “no formal position” on the structure of tax reform legislation. But Meadows listed the top priorities on his own wish list: “Lower taxes, lower taxes and lower taxes.” A 35-page blueprint developed by House Republican leaders, known as a “Better Way,” will serve as a starting point for the tax-reform discussions. The plan calls for streamlining the income tax system and cutting the corporate income tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent. It would exclude export revenue from taxable income and impose a 20 percent tax on imports.  The border tax proposal has divided the business community and is a top flashpoint for lawmakers. Big exporters such as General Electric Co say the tax would boost manufacturing and jobs. But retailers like Target Corp have said the border tax would hike consumer prices and hurt the economy. Trump, a businessman who had never been in public office until he took over at the White House on Jan. 20, has at times praised the border tax idea but at other times has been noncommittal. Virginia Congressman Dave Brat said he would insist that the tax bill not add to the deficit, while Meadows said he would not necessarily insist on that. Other conservatives said they needed more information about the tax bill to form an opinion - and some space from the contentious health care debate. “We just had a major battle on a Republican welfare plan and that has consumed to a large degree my time and mental effort,” said Alabama Representative Mo Brooks. “When we have a tax reform bill I can evaluate, that’s when I’ll start voting on it,” Brooks said. As a sign of tensions that have lingered after the collapse of the healthcare bill, Freedom Caucus lawmakers faced tough questioning from their colleagues during a closed-door meeting of House Republicans on Tuesday, said Representative Randy Weber of Texas. But Weber said some of the friction eased by the end of the meeting, prompting House Speaker Paul Ryan to say that more give and take might have been useful in the healthcare effort. “Ryan said: ‘This is what we should have been doing,’” Weber told Reuters. Republican Representative Ken Buck of Colorado, a member of the Freedom Caucus, said he thinks lawmakers learned lessons from the healthcare defeat that could apply to tax reform. “I think people are going to work harder to get to ‘yes’ this next piece of legislation,” Buck said. A Reuters\\u002fIpsos opinion poll released on Wednesday showed Republicans mostly blame Congress, and not Trump or party leaders, for failing to pass the healthcare overhaul.                        \"],[\"FORT WORTH, Texas (Reuters) - The widow of a slain Navy SEAL whose story was turned into the hit movie “American Sniper” has become a prominent figure in Fort Worth Republican politics even though her name does not appear on Tuesday’s primary ballot. Taya Kyle, the wife of Chris Kyle, is campaign treasurer for a Republican opponent of longtime Tarrant County Sheriff Dee Anderson, the lawman seen as the face of the manhunt for “affluenza” teen Ethan Couch. Kyle is also in a dispute with her late husband’s former business partner Bo French, who is running as a Republican for a Texas House of Representatives seat from the same county.  Lawyers for Kyle sent a cease-and-desist letter to the French camp last week calling on it to stop using her husband’s name and likeness in campaign materials. “Bo (is) abusing the name of my late husband, a beloved Son of Texas, and a hero to the nation, in an attempt to manipulate voters,” Kyle said in a statement on social media. She did not respond to requests to speak about her political activism. “Her experience with public exposure and scrutiny has taught her not to let her guard down,” said Republican political strategist Bill Miller. “She’s become a very formidable woman.” Chris and Taya Kyle have become stars of the state’s Republican establishment, with Governor Greg Abbott setting up a day to honor the memory of Chris Kyle, who was killed in 2013 by a troubled veteran he was trying to mentor.  Taya Kyle last year endorsed former Governor Rick Perry in his unsuccessful bid for the Republican presidential nomination. She now endorses U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas.  In the sheriff’s race, she may be the difference in the campaign of Bill Waybourn, a former suburban Fort Worth police chief, analysts said. Waybourn, backed by the conservative Tea Party movement, is challenging Anderson, a fellow Republican, who gained national attention in calling for the apprehension of Couch. The teen, whose lawyer said his wealth distorted his moral compass, fled to Mexico in December apparently to avoid apprehension for violating the probation deal that kept him out of jail for a drunken driving wreck in 2013 that killed four people. Kyle, 41, has not indicated any intention to seek elective office, but analysts said that should not be ruled out. “Once someone gets involved and gets their hands wet in politics, it’s hard to get out,” Miller said. \"],[\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Christian groups asking the U.S. Supreme Court to exempt them from the requirement to provide insurance covering contraception under President Barack Obama’s healthcare law face an uphill battle following Justice Antonin Scalia’s death last month. The remaining eight justices will consider seven related cases on whether nonprofit groups that oppose the requirement on religious grounds can object under a U.S. law called the Religious Freedom Restoration Act to a compromise version of the requirement offered by the Obama administration. Among those mounting objections are the Little Sisters of the Poor, an order of Roman Catholic nuns that runs care homes for the elderly. The court, divided 4-4 between liberal and conservative justices without the conservative Scalia, is set to hear the case on Wednesday. Scalia was considered a reliable vote for the religious groups. In 2014, he was in the majority when the court ruled 5-4 that family-owned companies run on religious principles, including craft retailer Hobby Lobby Stores Inc, could object to the provision for religious reasons.  If the four conservatives who sided with Scalia in that case remain unified, the best result the challengers could get would be a 4-4 split. That would leave in place lower-court rulings that favored the Obama administration. “Unless the court’s four justices in the dissent in Hobby Lobby dramatically change their minds, the likely worst outcome for the government would be a 4-4 split,” said Gregory Lipper, a lawyer with Americans United for Separation of Church and State, which filed a brief backing the Obama administration. Lawyers for the challengers forecast that they can win, citing among other things the fact that women can obtain alternative coverage via Obamacare’s online marketplace. “The idea that the government doesn’t have some other way to do this is really a pretty silly argument,” said Mark Rienzi, a lawyer with the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, which represents the Little Sisters. The Christian groups object to a compromise first offered by the federal government in 2013. It allows groups opposed to providing insurance covering contraception on religious grounds to comply with the law without actually paying for the coverage required by the 2010 Affordable Care Act, widely known as Obamacare. Groups can certify they are opting out by signing a form, which they submit to the government. The government then asks insurers to pick up the tab. The groups contend the accommodation infringes on their religious rights because it forces them to authorize the coverage for their employees, even if they are not paying for it. A ruling is due by the end of June. \"],[\"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - A Mexico City school that collapsed in a powerful earthquake last week killing 19 children buckled under the heavy weight of floors added over the years with scant steel support, according to experts and witnesses.    The tragedy at the privately owned Enrique Rebsamen school in southern Mexico City, in which seven adults also died, has become a symbol of the devastation inflicted by the country s 7.1 magnitude quake, the worst in a generation. At least 355 people died in the capital and surrounding states.     The building was badly designed, poorly calculated and poorly constructed,  said Alfredo Perez, a 52-year old civil engineer who dashed to the school shortly after the Sept. 19 quake to help rescue efforts.  The reinforced concrete doesn t comply with specifications in construction regulations.    Alongside rescue workers, Perez said, he pulled bodies from the rubble. Then he sat in one of the undamaged classrooms and drew plans detailing potential design failures in the collapsed building.    Reuters showed those plans to six structural engineers along with Reuters  photos of the ruined structure. They independently concluded that the structure s columns lacked sufficient steel rebar to support all four floors and prevent them from snapping in such a powerful earthquake.   While the quantity of steel required under Mexico s stringent post-1985 building code varies depending on the size of structure, all six engineers said the building s columns were built with too little steel to withstand strong quakes.  Perez and another engineer specified that columns appeared to have less than half the required amount of steel reinforcement. They base their view on the number of vertical and horizontal steel rebar rods in the columns, which are visible in Reuters photos along with the measurements in Perez s plans.  It comes down to the lack of steel,  said Troy Morgan, a New York-based senior managing engineer at Exponent, an engineering consulting firm.    Since a 1985 quake toppled hundreds of buildings in Mexico City, planning officials developed a strict building code at the forefront of international standards for quake-proofing that raised the proportion of required steel reinforcement.   Reuters was unable to locate or contact the school s owner and principal, Monica Garcia. Teachers, current and former students and their families all said she had been at the premises during the quake and survived.   Reuters was unable to identify the builder. A spokesman for the Tlalpan district where the school was located said property owners are not required to notify authorities of the builders or architects they used for modifications. The spokesman said the district had no record of the builder that worked on the new floors at the school. People living by the school said they did not know who had done the work.   The Mexico City urban development department did not respond to requests for comment on whether the inspectors who certified the school had proper licenses or any history of complaints.    Although the school was founded in 1983, before the new code took effect, the administrative building that buckled was expanded from two to four floors over the last decade or so, neighbors and former students said.   Photos published by Google Maps show the building had four floors as of 2009 with an expansion of the top floor by 2014 and a further expansion in 2016.     It definitely did not comply with the post-1985 code,  said Eduardo Miranda, a civil and environmental engineering professor at Stanford who collected statistics on buildings that collapsed in Mexico s 1985 earthquake, citing the code, photos and plans.   Construction permits released by local authorities dated in 1983 and 1984 authorized a four story structure at the school site. The top two floors were added much later, meaning the existing structure should have been brought up to modern standards, according to Mexico City s construction code.  The engineers who studied the photos and plans said the existing building had not been visibly reinforced.   Mexican prosecutors said they had opened a probe into potential criminal responsibility of the owner and private inspectors for the collapse. Prosecutors also said they had opened an investigation in February into whether the school had the proper zoning permits to operate.     Luis Felipe Puente, coordinator of Mexico s Civil Protection department, told Reuters that local officials, the construction company and the owner of the property could all be held accountable if any violations were discovered.    One inspector, Juan Apolinar Torales Iniesta, gave the buildings its most recent safety certificate in June according to documents filed with the local government, which released them publicly.  Torales did not respond to requests for comment sent to telephone numbers and emails listed in a government database. At Torales  government-registered address, a man refused to identify himself and said the registered architectural engineer did not live there.  Claudia Sheinbaum, Tlalpan district mayor, filed a criminal complaint on Thursday accusing two prior attorneys for the district Alejandro Zepeda and Miguel Angel Guerrero of maliciously failing to enforce the law after discovering unpermitted construction between 2010 and 2014 on the upper floors.    What we ve found is truly outrageous,  she said, referring to a document dated Nov. 8, 2013 by the Tlalpan public works department that described demolition work on the upper floors causing structural damage to the building. Despite that document, which she made public and was reviewed by Reuters, the school was allowed to keep operating with a small fine, Sheinbaum said   Guerrero did not immediately respond to requests for comment sent to his email address. Zepeda did not respond to a message sent to his Facebook account.   All six engineers said the addition of two floors dangerously loaded down the building, given its lack of steel support.      If it was kept at two levels, it would have not collapsed...it would not have caused so many deaths,  said Casey Hemmatyar, managing director at Pacific Structural and Forensic Engineers Group, a consultancy firm in Los Angeles.    Based on the position of the ruins, the school lurched as much as 18 feet (5.5 m) towards the street before collapsing, a sign of weak columns, said Geoffrey Hichborn, chief engineer at Building Forensics International, a concrete consulting firm in Anaheim, California.   Mexico City s government has not completed its own analysis, and Sheinbaum said the rubble would be left in place for engineers to investigate.  Documents published by Sheinbaum on Tlalpan district s website, including building inspection reports and closure orders from the district s attorneys, show that officials ordered fourth-floor construction to be halted at several points between 2010 and 2014 because it lacked proper permits.   Sheinbaum s complaint filed Thursday refers to these documents and others filed with the district to say the irregularities were never resolved.     No evidence or documents exist that allow the conclusion that these irregularities were corrected,  the complaint said. Reuters was unable to independently confirm whether or not corrective measures were taken. \"],[\"(Reuters) - Below are people mentioned as contenders for senior roles as U.S. President-elect Donald Trump works to form his administration before taking office on Jan. 20, according to Reuters sources and media reports.

The nationalists - split between those who seek greater autonomy and those who see full independence from France as the end-game - emerged as Corsica s main political force for the first time in French regional elections in December 2015. In a vote on Sunday for a newly created local assembly, the Pe a Corsica (For Corsica), an alliance of the two main nationalist parties, won 45.36 percent of the ballot, putting it in a commanding position for the second round vote on Dec. 10. In the wake of Catalonia s recent independence referendum, Corsican nationalists have downplayed any ambitions for secession, saying the island lacked the demographic and economic clout of the Spanish region.  Corsica has a population of just 320,000 people and a tiny 8.6 billion euro ($10.2 bln) economy. The nationalists  less ambitious demands, and dissatisfaction with the central government in France, probably helped the nationalists attract more votes on Sunday. Pe a Corsica, which unites the moderately autonomist Femu a Corsica and the committed separatist Corsica Libera, has drawn up a 10-year road-map during which it hopes to obtain a new status giving the island greater autonomy and pave the way for stronger economic development.  Paris must at last open dialogue with Corsica,  said Gilles Simeoni, the outgoing president of Corsica s Executive Council and a member of Femu a Corsica.  Corsican people have their own identity and this must be recognized.  The French government said it would not comment on the Corsican vote until after the second round. France is a highly centralized state and its demands for more autonomy have often been met with irritation and a refusal to negotiate by past governments. But support for the nationalist political movement has gained support since the most active clandestine  group, the National Front for the Liberation of Corsica (FLNC), laid down its weapons in 2014 after a near four-decade long rebellion. Corsica s nationalists oppose France s political and cultural dominance over the island, the birthplace of Napoleon annexed by Paris in 1768, and their demands for independence fueled years of bloodshed.   At some point, the wishes of Corsican people will have to be taken into account,  Jean-Guy Talamoni, the president of the Corsican Assembly and leader of the pro-independence Corsica Libera movement, told France Inter radio on Monday.  However, he acknowledged those backing all-out independence were still in a minority.   If a majority of Corsican people want independence in 10 years, in 15 years time, no one will be able to get in their way,  he said. French President Emmanuel Macron s ticket came in fourth in Sunday s vote with 11.26 percent. His Republic On the Move party said the vote showed Corsicans  loss of confidence in Paris and that it aimed to rebuild trust everywhere in France.

More than 600,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled to Bangladesh since late August, driven out by a military counter-insurgency clearance operation in Buddhist-majority Myanmar s Rakhine State.  A top U.N. official has described the military s actions as a textbook case of  ethnic cleansing .  We re deeply concerned by credible reports of widespread atrocities committed by Myanmar s security forces and by vigilantes who were unrestrained by the security forces during the recent violence in Rakhine State,  Tillerson told a joint news conference with Aung San Suu Kyi, the head of a civilian administration that is less than two years old and shares power with the military. Tillerson had earlier held separate talks with Myanmar s military chief, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, whose forces have been accused of atrocities. A senior U.N. official on Sunday leveled allegations of mass rape, killings and torture against the Myanmar military, known as the Tatmadaw, after a tour of refugee camps in the Cox s Bazar region of neighboring Bangladesh. Tillerson called for the Myanmar government to lead a credible and impartial investigation and said those who committed abuses should be held responsible.  The recent serious allegations of abuses in Rakhine state demand a credible and impartial investigation and those who commit human rights abuses or violations must be held accountable,  he said.  In all my meetings, I have called on the Myanmar civilian government to lead a full and effective independent investigation and for the military to facilitate full access and cooperation.  He also said it was the duty of the military to help the government to meet commitments to ensure the safety and security of all people in Rakhine state. A posting on Min Aung Hlaing s Facebook page said Myanmar s military supremo had explained to Tillerson the  true situation in Rakhine , the reasons why Muslims fled, how the military was working with the government to deliver aid and the progress made for a repatriation process to be agreed with Bangladesh. The military launched its clearance operation after an army base and 30 police posts were attacked on Aug. 25 by Rohingya militants, killing about a dozen members of the security forces. Tillerson condemned the militant attacks, but said any response by the security forces needed to avoid to the  maximum extent possible harming innocent civilians . An internal investigation by the military into the  allegations of atrocities that was released this week was branded a  whitewash  by human rights groups. Back in Washington, U.S. senators are pressing for economic sanctions and travel restrictions targeting the Myanmar military and its business interests. Tillerson said he would advise against any broad-based sanctions against Myanmar, as the United States wanted to see it succeed. But he said if there was credible and reliable information on abuses by individuals they could be targeted by sanctions. Tillerson said the United States would work with partners so that those responsible for any atrocities would face consequences,  using all available mechanisms, including those available under U.S. law . Myanmar is undergoing a transition to democracy after decades of rule by the military, but the generals retain extensive powers over security and a veto over reform of a constitution that has barred Suu Kyi from the presidency.  Myanmar s response to this crisis is critical to determining the success of its transition to a more democratic society,  Tillerson said.   It s a responsibility of the government and its security forces to protect and respect the human rights of all persons within its borders and to hold accountable those who fail to do so.  He said the United States would provide an additional $47 million in humanitarian assistance for refugees bringing the total to $87 million since the crisis erupted in August.  The humanitarian scale of this crisis is staggering,  Tillerson said. But he said he was encouraged by talks between Myanmar and Bangladesh to agree on a refugee repatriation process. During the news conference, Suu Kyi was asked to explain why she had not spoken out more strongly over the plight of the Rohingya, as the Nobel peace prize winner s perceived failure to speak up has damaged her international reputation as a stateswoman.  What I say is not supposed to be exciting,  Suu Kyi said, adding that she had aimed to keep the public informed without setting different ethnic, religious communities against each other.  It s important to bring peace and stability to this country and that can only be done on the basis of rule of law and everybody should understand that the role of theirs is to protect peace and stability, not to punish people.     \"],[\"LONDON (Reuters) - British police said they had arrested two more men on Wednesday in connection with the bombing of a commuter train in London last week which injured 30 people, bringing the total in custody to five.

The asylum seekers have barricaded themselves inside the  Manus island center for the past nine days, defying attempts by Australia and Papua New Guinea to close the camp in a standoff the United Nations describes as a  looming humanitarian crisis . The men fear violent reprisals from the Manus island community if they move from the camp to three transit centers, pending possible resettlement to the United States. The camp was closed on Oct. 31 and water and power have been cut off.  You may become very sick under these conditions of overflowing sewerage, heaps of rubbish, no clean running water, no electricity and no food,  Papua New Guinea s Immigration and Citizenship Service Authority said in a two-page notice reviewed by Reuters.  You are therefore instructed to vacate this compound immediately...if necessary, force may be used to relocate those who refuse to move voluntarily for your own sake.  The men inside the camp, who include asylum seekers from Afghanistan, Iran, Myanmar, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Syria, said they will continue to defy attempts to shut the camp. They said they had exhausted their food supplies and were relying on rainwater to drink. Several of the men told Reuters that nearly 100 of them had fallen sick. The notice added that demolition of fences would begin on Thursday. Behrouz Boochani, a Kurdish journalist from Iran who has been detained on Manus island for more than four years, said on Twitter that workers had begun that task.  The refugees are watching them fearfully...(they) are extremely scared by immigration threat but still saying we will not leave this prison camp for another prison camp,  he said.  Using force against ppl who ve been suffering nearly 5yrs is no solution. If you re going to solve this problem send us to safe third country.  Australia has used the Manus island center, and another on the tiny Pacific island of Nauru, to detain asylum seekers who try to reach its shores by boat. It says boat arrivals will never enter Australia, even if they are found to be refugees, as this would encourage people smugglers in Asia. Papua New Guinea s High Court ruled last year that the Manus center, first opened in 2001, was illegal and the camp closed on Oct. 31, when Australian-funded security staff withdrew. Thursday s PNG government notice said the camp will soon revert to the control of the nation s military and anyone there unlawfully will be liable for arrest. Papua New Guinea Prime Minister Peter O Neill on Wednesday said  appropriate means  would be used to apprehend those responsible for  disruption . Australia s Immigration Minister Peter Dutton said on Thursday that the situation was  unacceptable...but the government won t be backing down . The PNG Supreme Court rejected an application by one of the men to restore services on Tuesday, despite pleas from the United Nations to make food, water, medical supplies and power available. Lawyers for the asylum seekers are due to lodge an appeal against later on Thursday. \"],[\"LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May s government was defeated on Wednesday, when lawmakers forced through changes to its Brexit blueprint that ministers said could endanger Britain s departure from the European Union. In a blow to May, already weakened after losing her Conservative Party s majority in a June election, the 650-seat parliament voted 309 to 305 in favor of an amendment to hand lawmakers more say over a final exit deal with the EU. Up until the last minute of an often bitter debate in parliament, May s team tried to convince lawmakers in her party to give up their demands and side with a government fearful that the move will weaken its hand in tough Brexit negotiations. Members of Parliament (MPs) are debating the EU withdrawal bill, which will repeal the 1972 legislation binding Britain to the EU and copy existing EU law into domestic law to ensure legal continuity after  Exit Day  on March 29, 2019. In focus on Wednesday was an amendment put forward by Conservative lawmaker and former attorney general Dominic Grieve who wants parliament to have a meaningful vote on any deal before it is finalised and for it to be written into law.  There is a time for everybody to stand up and be counted,  Grieve told parliament earlier, criticizing some fellow members of the Conservative Party for calling him a traitor over his decision to vote against the government. He dismissed a last-minute pledge by justice minister Dominic Raab for government to write the promise of a meaningful vote into law later on its journey through both houses of parliament as coming  too late . The government was  disappointed  by the vote, a spokeswoman said in a statement, adding that  this amendment does not prevent us from preparing our statute book for exit day . But with May due at an EU summit on Thursday to encourage the other 27 leaders to approve a move to the second phase of Brexit talks and begin a discussion about future trade, the defeat comes at a difficult time for the prime minister. In the European Parliament, which must also ratify any withdrawal treaty with Britain, its Brexit coordinator cheekily tweeted that his British counterparts had  taken back control  - a reference to the catchphrase of pro-Brexit campaigners.  A good day for democracy,  added Guy Verhofstadt. The EU withdrawal bill has been the focus of seven days of often bitter debate, underscoring the deep divisions over Brexit not only among the Conservatives but also in the main opposition Labour Party and across the country. It has also highlighted May s weakness. In June, she gambled on a snap election to strengthen her party s majority in the 650-seat parliament but instead bungled her campaign and ended up with a minority government propped up by the 10 votes of a small, pro-Brexit Northern Irish party. Since then she has struggled to assert her authority over a Conservative Party which is deeply divided over the best route out of the EU.   This defeat is a humiliating loss of authority for the government on the eve of the European Council meeting,  Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said in a statement.  Theresa May has resisted democratic accountability. Her refusal to listen means she will now have to accept Parliament taking back control.  Earlier, May had tried to persuade lawmakers to vote with the government for her Brexit blueprint, saying Grieve s amendment would put added time pressure on a government which wants to make Britain ready to leave the EU in March 2019.  That could be at a very late stage in the proceedings which could mean that we are not able to have the orderly and smooth exit from the European Union that we wish to have,  she told parliament before an hours-long debate on the exit plan. Her spokesman said the government had  in good faith come forward with a strong package of concessions to deal with the spirit of the amendment . Pro-Brexit lawmakers fear the amendment could force Britain to weaken its negotiating stance by offering parliament the opportunity of forcing ministers back to the negotiating table if it feels any final deal is not good enough.  Raab said that could convince the EU that Britain would not walk away from a bad deal.  Actually if that looked likely we d end up with worse terms, and we d be positively incentivizing the EU to give us worse terms,  he told parliament. \"],[\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate will delay its consideration of healthcare legislation while Arizona Republican Senator John McCain recuperates from surgery, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said on Saturday. McCain’s absence cast doubt on whether the Senate would be able to pass the legislation to dismantle and replace Obamacare.  McConnell needs 50 “yes” votes for passage in a chamber the Republicans control by a 52-48 margin. “While John is recovering, the Senate will continue our work on legislative items and nominations, and will defer consideration of the Better Care Act,” McConnell said in a statement.  The announcement came after McCain’s office said he would remain in Arizona next week following a procedure to remove a 2-inch (5-cm) blood clot from above his left eye. Repealing and replacing President Barack Obama’s signature healthcare law was a top campaign promise for President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress. But two Republican senators have already declared their opposition to revised legislation unveiled on Thursday. McCain has expressed concern about the healthcare bill but has not said how he would vote.   The 2008 Republican presidential nominee, McCain was resting comfortably at home in good condition after Friday’s operation, his office said.   “There are few people tougher than my friend John McCain, and I know he’ll be back with us soon,” McConnell said. McCain’s surgeons removed the clot during a minimally invasive craniotomy through an incision in the 80-year-old lawmaker’s eyebrow.  Tissue pathology reports would be available within the next several days. “Thanks to @MayoClinic for its excellent care — I appreciate your support & look forward to getting back to work!” McCain, who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee, said on social network Twitter  late on Saturday. \"],[\"LONDON (Reuters) - British lawmakers ramped up pressure on the government to publish its assessment of the impact Brexit will have on the economy, passing a motion in parliament on Wednesday which could compel the government to release the papers. The government said on Monday it had carried out 58 economic assessments, covering sectors from aerospace to tourism, but has so far refused requests from lawmakers to publish them, saying they could undermine their negotiating position in Brexit talks. That has irked lawmakers - including some from Prime Minister Theresa May s own party - who say the documents should be subject to parliamentary scrutiny and used to help shape the public debate around what a good EU exit deal would look like. Parliament agreed a motion stating that the documents should be released to a parliamentary committee. The government did not oppose the motion but it was unclear if its passage would force them to act.  The debate ended in confusion with the Speaker of the House indicating that he believed the government was obliged to comply with the motion, but saying he would wait to see what their response was before acting further.  We take all parliamentary votes seriously and recognize that parliament does have rights relating to the publication of documents,  a Brexit department spokeswoman said.   Ministers also have a clear obligation not to disclose information when doing so would not be in the public interest. We will reflect on the implications of the vote and respond in due course.  Labour said the result was clear and called on Brexit minister David Davis to set a date for the papers  publication.  Labour has been absolutely clear since the referendum that ministers could not withhold vital information from Parliament about the impact of Brexit on jobs and the economy,  said Labour s Brexit policy chief Keir Starmer. Binding or not, a rancorous debate underlined the extent to which May s approach to Brexit is generating dissent in parliament and potentially undermining her ability to rely on its support when passing crucial laws to implement the EU exit.   I m not going to stand by and see the future of my children s generation and the grandchildren which I hope will follow being trashed or ruined without any form of debate and disclosure as to the consequences,  said Anna Soubry, one of several Conservative lawmakers who said they were ready to rebel. The central plank of May s Brexit strategy, a piece of legislation known as the EU (Withdrawal) Bill, will require all May s lawmakers to back her if the minority Conservative government is to avoid making concessions.  A debate on the bill is due to begin on Nov 14. \"],[\"(Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders on Wednesday cheered the end of U.S. drugmaker Pfizer Inc’s (PFE.N) $160 billion merger with Ireland-based Allergan Plc (AGN.N). “Glad to hear Pfizer is calling off the merger. We need to close the loopholes that let corporations escape paying their taxes,” Clinton said on Twitter.  Sanders said on the social media site that he applauded President Barack Obama for new rules aimed at curbing so-called inversion deals, which Pfizer said led it to scrap the deal. \"],[\"\\\"SIHANOUKVILLE, Cambodia (Reuters) - Between Sihanoukville s beaches and its multiplying casinos,  Lao Qi  and Bun Saroeun run restaurants barely a hundred dusty meters apart. But their fortunes could not be more different. For while Lao Qi is riding the Chinese boom that brought him and thousands of others from China to the Cambodian resort, Bun Saroeun s business was built on low-budget Western visitors. It is far less profitable and now he faces eviction. Sihanoukville starkly illustrates how Cambodia s ever tightening relationship with China is transforming the country. Just as China s aid and investment have helped Prime Minister Hun Sen defy Western criticism of a crackdown on his opponents, they are also binding Cambodia s economy ever more closely to China s. Sihanoukville, which has Cambodia s only deep-water port, was carved out of the jungle in the 1960s and named after former King Norodom Sihanouk. Once a playground for Cambodia s elite, it fell on hard times during the Khmer Rouge genocide and conflicts of the 1970s and 1980s before becoming a stop for backpackers and other Westerners looking for sun, sea, sand and - for some - sex. But a steady trickle of Chinese money into its casinos has now swelled to a tide that promises to remodel a city touted by developers as the first port of call on China s  Belt and Road .      This is like China 20 years ago. The opportunity is huge,  said Lao Qi, 33, who goes by his nickname and first moved here from China s Zhejiang province to work in a casino. His noodles and fried rice can now make him hundreds of dollars a day. Down the road at the Ecstatic Pizza restaurant, 59-year-old Bun Saroeun counts himself lucky to make over $100 a day. Rising hotel prices and the noise of construction are discouraging Western visitors and Cambodian tourists from the city, he says.  A few Chinese came here but now they have their own restaurants,  said Bun Saroeun, whose landlord is now evicting him to redevelop the prime property near the Occhuteal Beach. The Chinese influx is very much by design. In charge of the city is governor Yun Min, the former regional military commander and a close ally of Hun Sen. He made trips to China himself to encourage investors and offer them protection.  We want more of them to come,  he told Reuters, estimating that Chinese already rent half the property in the city.  We benefit from them.

The rescue would steer creditors and holders of Puerto Rico bonds toward a new, independent board that would seek a fair way to write down an estimated $70 billion in debt. Banks, mutual funds, hedge funds and Puerto Rico citizens all hold paper issued by 18 entities on the U.S. commonwealth and many of those investors, if not all, would face a loss. Lawmakers in Congress are being lobbied - and attacked - by investor groups that are trying to protect their bottom lines. “They are deceitful,” said Rep. Rob Bishop, a Utah Republican who leads the House Natural Resources Committee. Bishop said accusations likening the Puerto Rico rescue plan to a government bailout were “crap,” and the plan had the virtue of “protecting taxpayers and not spending government money.” The rescue plan does, however, adopt some principles of bankruptcy law and that makes it controversial. Investors could be forced into a settlement over the objections of holdout bondholders under certain circumstances, according to a draft of the bill. Some lawmakers said allowing Puerto Rico to modify its bonds could mean chaos for municipal markets. “If they can do it for Puerto Rico, they can do it for every other state,” Rep. Tom McClintock said of the damage that the rescue bill would do. McClintock, a California Republican, said he was “very concerned” about the plan after a half-hour meeting Tuesday afternoon of Republicans on the Natural Resources panel. House Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement that he supported Bishop’s effort because it “holds the right people accountable for the crisis (and) shrinks the size of government.” Ryan also said he liked the idea of an independent board settling investor disputes, adding that legislation passed last week to halt payments on Puerto Rico’s debt was “troubling.” The Republican Study Committee, a group of conservative lawmakers, said in a statement it was still reviewing the bill, but “we are encouraged that there appear to be some improvements.” Ryan will need the votes of many fiscally-conservative Republicans - and as is seen likely, some Democrats - if he is to get the rescue package through the House of Representatives. The plan will face a test on Wednesday when the Natural Resources panel begins to amend the plan during a law-writing session known as a “mark up.” An aide to House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said her office was still reviewing the legislation. \"],[\"RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia has expressed hope the United States would not recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and warned such a decision would have serious implications, state news agency SPA reported on Tuesday.  The recognition will have very serious implications and will be provocative to all Muslims  feelings,  SPA said quoting an unnamed official source at the Saudi Foreign Ministry.  The United States administration should take into account the negative implications of such a move and the Kingdom s hope not to take such a decision as this will affect the U.S. ability to continue its attempt of reaching a just solution for the Palestinian cause,  the statement added. On Monday, Saudi Arabia s Ambassador in Washington Prince Khalid bin Salman said any U.S. announcement on the status of Jerusalem before a final settlement is reached in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict would hurt the peace process and heighten regional tensions.  The kingdom s policy - has been - and remains in support of the Palestinian people, and this has been communicated to the U.S. administration,  Prince Khalid said in a statement. U.S. President Donald Trump is weighing whether to recognize Jerusalem as Israel s capital but has not yet made a decision, his son-in-law and envoy for Middle East peace Jared Kushner said on Sunday. A senior administration official said last week Trump could make such an announcement on Wednesday. Israel considers all of Jerusalem to be its capital. Palestinians want the eastern portion of it to be the capital of a future state. U.S. policy for decades has been to reserve judgment on both claims until the parties agree Jerusalem s status in a settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. \"],[\"BEIJING (Reuters) - China is considering a law punishing those who slander heroes and martyrs or cause physical damage to their memorials, state news agency Xinhua said on Friday, the latest piece of legislation to protect the country s symbols of state. Xi Jinping has ushered in new legislation aimed at securing China from threats both within and outside its borders since taking over as president in 2013, as well as presiding over a sweeping crackdown on dissent and free speech. China s largely rubber stamp parliament amended its criminal law last month to extend punishments for publicly desecrating the national flag and emblem to include disrespecting the national anthem. Punishments include jail terms of up to three years. The latest proposed legislation is aimed at protecting the reputation of martyrs - those who have given their lives for China or the Communist Party - and who are already publicly lauded in the country. Memorials to those who fought against the Japanese during World War Two, or in the Chinese civil war against the Nationalists, and others are scattered across the country. School children learn about the feats of the most famous. Xinhua said the new law would offer unspecified punishments to those who insult or slander heroes and martyrs or damage their memorials. The law would also give a responsibility to the media and internet users to report any insults to the honor of martyrs, it said. It is unclear when the proposal could be put into law, but Chinese laws normally go through at least two rounds of drafting before they are passed, meaning it could be some months away. Party history is a sensitive subject in China because so much of the party s legitimacy rests on its position as claiming great historical achievements, such as leading China to victory over Japan during World War Two. Disputes about party history already occasionally make it to Chinese courts. A court ordered a former magazine editor to publicly apologize last year for two articles written in 2013 questioning the details of a well-known story about Communist soldiers fighting the Japanese in World War Two. In the story, the five soldiers jumped off a cliff so the Japanese could not take them alive, although two of them survived. The editor had expressed doubt about how many Japanese the Chinese soldiers killed, how the two survived and the location of the cliff. \"],[\"MADRID (Reuters) - More than 460 people have been injured in disturbances across Catalonia on Sunday, the Barcelona mayor said, as riot police clashed with people who had gathered for a banned referendum on the region s independence from the rest of Spain.

Thirty mostly Democratic lawmakers signed the letter to U.S. Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, and Secretary of Defense, James Mattis, citing expectations that the administration plans to go ahead with the sale. “As you know, the previous administration made the decision in December 2016 to halt a planned sale of precision-guided munitions (PGM) to Saudi Arabia due to concerns over widespread civilian casualties and significant deficiencies in RSAF’s (the Saudi Air Force’s) targeting capabilities,” the letter, dated Friday but released on Monday, said. “According to recent reports, however, the State Department has now reversed course and removed the suspension on these PGM sales,” they said in the letter, led by Representative Ted Lieu, a Democratic member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. The State and Defense Departments do not comment on planned arms sales before formal notification is sent to Congress. In December, then-President Barack Obama’s administration decided to halt the sale of the systems, manufactured by Raytheon Co, that convert bombs into precision-guided munitions because of concerns about the extent of civilian casualties during Saudi Arabia’s campaign in Yemen. Congressional aides told Reuters the Trump administration was on the verge of sending a formal notification to Congress about the sale, which would trigger the formal 30-day review to allow members of Congress to attempt to pass legislation to stop any sale. Trump has said he wants to clear the way for U.S. arms sales abroad, to bolster efforts by U.S. partners to fight militant groups and help create U.S. jobs. His administration recently told Congress it also planned to pursue sales to Bahrain and Nigeria that had been delayed under Obama by human rights concerns. Congressional aides said they expected an effort to pass legislation to stop the PGM sale. However, such legislation has never succeeded. A measure seeking to block the sale of tanks to Riyadh failed in September. “It is in our national security interest – as well as that of our Saudi partners - to ensure that the RSAF has the ability to avoid civilian casualties before the U.S. sells them any additional air-to-ground munitions,” the letter said. \"],[\"KABUL (Reuters) - At least 11 Afghan civilians were killed and 16 wounded on Wednesday when a NATO helicopter attacked a house where Taliban insurgents had taken shelter in Logar province, east of the capital, Kabul, the local governor said. There was no immediate confirmation that NATO or U.S. aircraft were involved, but a spokesman for Resolute Support, the NATO-led mission in Kabul, said in an emailed statement it was aware of the reports and was looking into them. Logar Governor Halim Fedaee said the incident occurred in Dashte Bari district near the provincial capital Pul-e Alam.  The Taliban took position in a civilian house and fired a rocket at a NATO helicopter,  the governor said.  The house owner begged the Taliban to leave, but they didn t. The helicopter took a turn, came and hit this house that caused these deaths.   The incident, a day after reports that an Afghan air strike killed at least 13 civilians in the western province of Herat, underlines the risk that a recent increase in air raids by U.S. and Afghan forces will increase civilian casualties. United Nations figures showed a 43 percent spike in civilian casualties from both Afghan and U.S. air strikes in the first half of the year, with 95 killed and 137 wounded, as the pace of air operations has increased. Civilian casualties caused by U.S. air strikes have long been a source of friction in Afghanistan, and the risk of further casualties may increase if the U.S. steps up operations as part of President Donald Trump s new strategy for Afghanistan. Earlier, Resolute Support denied a Taliban statement that a U.S. helicopter had been shot down in Logar province. It said a helicopter had made a precautionary landing for a maintenance issue. \"],[\"HARARE (Reuters) - Zimbabwe s President Robert Mugabe said on Wednesday the route to leadership was long and full of  pitfalls and death , as he accused his fired deputy and former protege of showing impatience in his bid to succeed him. Addressing supporters at the headquarters of his ZANU-PF party in Harare, 93-year-old Mugabe accused Emmerson Mnangagwa of consulting witchdoctors and prophets as part of a campaign to secure the presidency. Mnangagwa, who was sacked by Mugabe on Monday and expelled from the ruling Zanu-PF party on Wednesday, said he had fled Zimbabwe because of death threats and was safe.  My sudden departure was caused by incessant threats on my person, life and family by those who have attempted before through various forms of elimination including poisoning,  he said in a statement on Wednesday. The head of the influential war veterans association, Chris Mutsvangwa, said that Mnangagwa, 75, would travel to Johannesburg in neighboring South Africa  very soon .  Mugabe said Mnangagwa, nicknamed  Crocodile , had made the same mistakes as Joice Mujuru, who was the president s deputy for 10 years until she was fired in 2014.  You should not try to say because the journey is long, then I should take a short cut to arrive quickly. The road has lions. There are pitfalls. There is death, beware,  he said.  There is no short cut to being the leader of the people. Just as there was no short cut to our independence.  ZANU-PF would move to discipline Mnangagwa s  co-conspirators , Mugabe added. Mnangagwa has not been seen in public since his dismissal from government but his ally Mutsvangwa said he was  safe and beyond the reach of the assassins . Mutsvangwa ruled out trying to remove Mugabe by force and said war veterans, who had publicly backed Mnangagwa and broke ranks with the president last year, would form a broad front with the opposition in elections next year.  We don t want to abuse the military to resolve a political problem. We don t want them to become the arbiter of political power,  Mutsvangwa said. He was critical of Mugabe s wife Grace, who looks set to become vice president after a special ZANU-PF congress in December.  This is a coup by marriage certificate ....and it will be resisted,  he said. \"],[\"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner on Friday vetoed a bill passed by the Democratic-controlled legislature in April to spend nearly $3.9 billion on state services that have not been funded due to an ongoing fiscal 2016 budget impasse. The Republican governor called the legislation “an empty promise.” “The bill purports to appropriate $3.89 billion, including more than $3 billion in general funds that the state does not have, for higher education and social service providers, but provides no source of funding,” Rauner said in his veto message.  The political stalemate between Rauner and Democrats has left Illinois as the only U.S. state without a complete fiscal 2016 budget, operating instead on court-ordered spending and a muddled patchwork of ongoing and stopgap appropriations. Rauner called on lawmakers to pass complete balanced budgets for the current and next fiscal years, although the governor has proposed funding most fiscal 2017 services with a temporary spending plan and K-12 schools with a full-year budget. Illinois’ new fiscal year begins on July 1. The Democrats’ spending bill passed with enough votes in the Senate to override a veto, but fell short of that margin in the House. The measure would have sent money to cash-starved state universities and colleges, covered tuition grants for low-income college students, and funded health and human services that were not subject to court orders. The measure also appropriated about $63 million for unpaid wage increases owed to about 24,000 unionized state workers.  \"],[\"ATHENS (Reuters) - Tayyip Erdogan will travel to Greece on Dec. 7-8, Greek sources said on Friday, in the first visit by a Turkish president in decades that have seen ties at times severely strained over issues from Aegean Sea rights to ethnically-split Cyprus. Erdogan is expected to meet his Greek counterpart and Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras and discuss bilateral relations, security issues and the refugee crisis, following a 2016 EU-Ankara deal aimed at reducing migrant flows to Europe.  He is also expected to visit Thrace in northern Greece, where there is a Muslim minority. Erdogan last visited fellow NAT member Greece in 2010 in his capacity as  prime minister. His visit next week will be the first by a Turkish president to Greece in 65 years.  Greece and Turkey, NATO allies, came to the brink of war in 1996 over the ownership of uninhabited Aegean islets.  Relations have improved since then but they are still at odds over issues from territorial disputes to Cyprus, which remains divided between Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities living on either side of a U.N.-monitored ceasefire line.  Eight Turkish soldiers commandeered a helicopter and flew it to northern Greece as a failed coup unfolded against Erdogan between July 15 and 16, 2016. Turkey has repeatedly demanded Greece hand them over but Greece s highest court has rejected their extradition. Greek police on Tuesday arrested nine Turkish citizens who were later charged with terrorism-related offences. They are accused of hoarding explosives and of links to an outlawed militant organization responsible for suicide bombings in Turkey. They have denied any wrongdoing.

Both deals have been stalled amid concerns raised by Israel that equipment sent to Gulf states could fall into the wrong hands and be used against it, and by the Obama administration’s broader decision-making on military aid to the Gulf.  However, the Pentagon and the State Department both have  signed off on the sale of some 36 F-15 fighter jets to Qatar and 24 F\\u002fA-18E\\u002fF Super Hornets to Kuwait, both built by Boeing. The White House is expected to follow suit shortly. The sale to Kuwait is worth about $3 billion and the one to Qatar is probably close to $4 billion, sources familiar with the matter said. “The last hurdle now is getting approval from the National Security Council and the White House,” said one of the sources. The Pentagon had no immediate comment. A senior Obama administration official said it was the administration’s policy not to comment on potential arm sales until it has formally notified Congress of an intent to sell something. But, the official said, the United States is committed to the security and stability of the Gulf region and defense sales  “fit into the overall U.S. regional diplomatic strategy.” Expected approval of the fighter jet sales comes as the White House seeks to shore up relations with Gulf allies as they increase their military capabilities amid growing fears that Washington is drawing closer to Iran in the aftermath of the nuclear deal with that country. Senior U.S. officials, including Navy Secretary Ray Mabus have publicly urged approval of the weapons sales, which will help maintain production of the fourth-generation Boeing fighter jets, while the newer and more advanced Lockheed Martin Corp F-35 fighter jet enters service in coming years. One senior U.S. defense official said the Pentagon is keen to see the Boeing F-15 and F\\u002fA-18 production lines in St. Louis continue and does not want to “foreclose any options on fourth-generation aircraft at this point.” Boeing already is spending “hundreds of millions” of dollars to buy long-lead materials such as titanium to prepare for a possible Kuwaiti order for F\\u002fA-18E\\u002fF Super Hornets and a  separate U.S. Navy order for 12 jets put on the service’s “unfunded priorities” list submitted to Congress. The Navy is hoping that Congress will provide the funding to pay for the Boeing jets in fiscal 2017, although the planes were not included in its base budget request. It already has earmarked funding for more F\\u002fA-18E\\u002fF jets in fiscal 2018. A larger concern now is the Boeing F-15 line, which is set to end in 2019 after Boeing completes work on a large order for Saudi Arabia, unless a follow-on order is approved. \"],[\"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The powerful former leader of Mexico s largest teacher s union, Elba Esther Gordillo, will be let out of jail under house arrest more than four years after her detention on embezzlement charges, government and judicial sources said on Friday. Gordillo, 72, was unexpectedly arrested in 2013 in the first year of President Enrique Pena Nieto s government, in what appeared to show the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) taking a stand against corruption. But the attorney general (PGR) this week stopped fighting Gordillo s lawyer s attempts to get her out of prison, and a tribunal approved, said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The judicial source said that in a matter of hours or days she would be allowed to go home. The decision to let Gordillo see out her trial under house arrest came as the political party she founded, the New Political Alliance Party (Panal), said it would back the PRI in the 2018 election. \"],[\"ROME (Reuters) - The brother of the man who killed two women with a knife outside Marseille train station last week was probably a foreign fighter in Syria and Iraq, Italian investigators said on Monday. Italian police arrested 25-year-old Tunisian Anis Hannachi in Northern Italy on Saturday evening. He had been in Italy since Oct. 4 or earlier, police said. His older brother, the 29-year-old Ahmed, was shot dead by a French soldier after killing the two women on Oct. 1.  Ahmed lived south of Rome with his Italian wife from 2008 to 2014, and was known to police only for  petty crimes , Italy s chief anti-terrorism prosecutor Franco Roberti told reporters.   Ahmed never showed any signs of radicalization in Italy,  Roberti said.  The investigative hypothesis we re working on is that the younger brother radicalized the older one.  The militant Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the Marseille attack, but did not name Ahmed as the assailant. Anis has refused to talk to Italian investigators, Roberti said. He was arrested on an international arrest warrant issued by the French, who are investigating the Marseille attack as a  probable  terrorist action. It is likely that Anis will be extradited to France in a matter of days, Roberti added.   Anis was flagged as a dangerous individual who probably had been a foreign fighter  in Iraq and Syria, Claudio Galzerano, director of an Italian anti-terrorism police squad, told reporters.  Anis was arrested on suspicion of complicity in his brother s attack and membership of a terrorist group. He had been fingerprinted and photographed by police in 2014, when he reached Italy by boat and was immediately sent back home. However, that previous identification meant police were sure they had arrested the right man when they tracked him down on Saturday evening riding a bicycle in the center of Ferrara, in Northern Italy.  He had no identification on him, gave police a false name, and told them he was Algerian, Galzerano said. Police are now investigating Anis s possible contacts in Italy.  The Marseille attacker s estranged wife told Italy s Corriere della Sera newspaper on Sunday that she did not believe Ahmed had become a radical Islamist.  He didn t care about religion,  Ramona Cargnelutti told Corriere in an interview.  I ve never seen him enter a Mosque.  While admitting she had not seen him for more than two years, she said the murder of the two women was more likely a robbery gone wrong because he was a drug user and always in need of cash. Roberti said Italian prosecutors will be talking to Cargnelutti in the coming days as part of their investigation. \"],[\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has announced the two top White House advisers but still has many key administration positions to fill ahead of his inauguration on Jan. 20.

A change that will mean the violation of Iraq s territorial integrity poses a major risk for Turkey,  Nurettin Canikli said.  The disruption of Syria and Iraq s territorial integrity will ignite a bigger, global conflict with an unseen end . Turkey, with a large Kurdish population of its own in the south of the country, fears that the independence referendum in Iraq could embolden the outlawed PKK which has waged an insurgency in the southeast since the 1980s. Canikli said Ankara could not allow the formation of an ethnic-based state in the south of the country.  Nobody should have any doubt that we will take every step, make every decision to stop the growth of risk factors,  he said. \"],[\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama has approved giving the U.S. military greater ability to accompany and enable Afghan forces battling a resilient Taliban insurgency, in a move to assist them more proactively on the battlefield, a U.S. official told Reuters.  The senior U.S. defense official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the decision would also allow greater use of U.S. air power, particularly close air support. However, the official cautioned: “This is not a blanket order to target the Taliban.” Obama’s decision again redefines America’s support role in  Afghanistan’s grinding conflict, more than a year after international forces wrapped up their combat mission and shifted the burden to Afghan troops. It also comes ahead of Obama’s eagerly anticipated decision on whether to forge ahead with a scheduled reduction in the numbers of U.S. troops from about 9,800 currently to 5,500 by the start of 2017. A group of retired generals and senior diplomats urged Obama last week to forgo those plans, warning they could undermine the fight against the Afghan Taliban, whose leader was killed in a U.S. drone strike in Pakistan last month. Under the new policy, the U.S. commander in Afghanistan, General John Nicholson, will be able to decide when it is appropriate for American troops to accompany conventional Afghan forces into the field - something they have so far only been doing with Afghan special forces, the official said. The expanded powers are only meant to be employed “in those select instances in which their engagement can enable strategic effects on the battlefield,” the official said. That means that U.S. forces should not be expected to accompany Afghan soldiers on day-to-day missions. “This added flexibility ... is fully supported by the Afghan government and will help the Afghans at an important moment for the country,” the official said. The decision is a departure from current U.S. rules of engagement in Afghanistan, which impose limits on U.S. forces’ ability to strike at insurgents. For example, the U.S. military was previously allowed to take action against the Taliban “in extremis” - moments when their assistance was needed to prevent a significant Afghan military setback. That definition, however, left the U.S. military postured to assist them in more defensive instances. The new policy would allow U.S. forces to accompany Afghans at key moments in their  offensive campaign against the Taliban. “The U.S. forces will more proactively support Afghan conventional forces,” the official said. The Taliban control or contest more territory in Afghanistan than at any time since they were ousted by a U.S.-backed intervention in late 2001, and U.S. officials have acknowledged the uneven performance of Afghan security forces. Large portions of Afghanistan, including the provincial capital of northern Kunduz and multiple districts of southern Helmand province, have fallen, at times briefly, to the Taliban over the past year-and-a-half. Many other districts and provinces are also under varying degrees of Taliban control. The new authorities that Obama has given the U.S. military could give it greater leeway in addressing the shortcomings of Afghan security forces. Still, experts warn that its hard to predict when Afghanistan will be able to stand on its own against the Taliban, not to mention the country’s enormous economic difficulties and fractious political system. The U.S government’s top watchdog on Afghanistan told Reuters that the United States had wasted billions of dollars in reconstruction aid to Afghanistan over the past decade, and now a renewed Taliban insurgency was threatening the gains that had been made. \"],[\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Classified documents that the heads of four U.S. intelligence agencies presented last week to President-elect Donald Trump included claims that Russian intelligence operatives have compromising information about him, two U.S. officials said Tuesday evening. They told Reuters the claims, which one called “unsubstantiated,” were contained in a two-page memo appended to a report on Russian interference in the 2016 election that U.S. intelligence officials presented to Trump and President Barack Obama last week. Trump responded on Tuesday evening in a tweet calling the reports: “FAKE NEWS - A TOTAL POLITICAL WITCH HUNT!” The Trump transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment. One of the officials, both of whom requested anonymity to discuss classified matters, said the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other U.S. agencies are continuing to investigate the credibility and accuracy of the claims. They are included in opposition research reports made available last year to Democrats and U.S. officials by a former British intelligence official, most of whose past work U.S. officials consider credible. The official said investigators so far have been unable to confirm the material about Trump financial and personal entanglements with Russian businessmen and others whom U.S. intelligence analysts have concluded are Russian intelligence officers or working on behalf of Russian intelligence. Some material in the reports produced by the former British intelligence officer has proved to be erroneous, the official said. The FBI declined comment. The charges that Russia attempted to compromise New York real estate businessman Trump were presented to the FBI and other U.S. government officials last summer and have been circulating for months. The FBI initially took the material seriously, said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue, which was first reported by CNN.  However, the FBI failed to act on the material, and the former British intelligence officer broke off contact about three weeks before the November election, they said.  The warning of information about Russia’s compromising claims follows growing U.S. intelligence and law enforcement concerns about what Director of National Intelligence James Clapper has called “multifaceted” Russian influence and espionage operations in Europe and the United States.  In addition to hacking computer networks and spreading propaganda and fake news, it includes efforts to cultivate business and political leaders and find compromising personal, financial and other information on persons of interest, U.S. intelligence officials said. The classified briefings last week were presented to Obama and Trump by Clapper, FBI Director James Comey, Central Intelligence Agency Director John Brennan and National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers. U.S. intelligence chiefs included a classified summary of the material to make Trump aware that it is circulating among intelligence agencies, senior members of Congress, government officials and others, one of the officials said. An unclassified intelligence report released on Friday concluded that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an effort to help Trump’s electoral chances by discrediting Democrat Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential campaign. The report said U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that as part of the effort Russia’s military intelligence agency, the GRU, used intermediaries such as WikiLeaks and others to release emails it hacked from the Democratic National Committee and top Democrats. \"],[\"(Reuters) - The U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee has asked the son of President Donald Trump’s former national security adviser to provide documents and testimony as part of the panel’s probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election, a source familiar with the congressional matter told Reuters. Michael G. Flynn was a close aide to his father, former U.S. Army general Michael Flynn, 58, who was fired by Trump three weeks into his White House job in February as he came under scrutiny for his foreign contacts. The son managed his father’s schedule and accompanied him on trips while working at Flynn Intel Group consultancy, including one to Moscow in 2015 for an event where the elder Flynn sat next to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Russia has repeatedly denied the conclusions of U.S. intelligence agencies that Moscow interfered in the presidential campaign to help Republican Trump by hacking Democratic Party emails and spreading propaganda online. Barry Coburn, a lawyer for the younger Flynn, 34, declined to comment on the Senate committee’s request, which was reported earlier by NBC News. The panel could issue a subpoena to the younger Flynn, although he could invoke his Fifth Amendment constitutional protection against self-incrimination and not comply.     The elder Flynn has also been asked by the panel to provide information and to testify. A source close to Flynn said that he had turned over documents to intelligence committees in both the Senate and U.S. House of Representatives.  The source familiar with the congressional investigation said that the Senate committee is not satisfied and wants to obtain more evidence from him. The source also confirmed that the Senate panel was issuing a subpoena to former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser Carter Page after Page declined committee requests that he voluntarily turn over records related to any contacts with Russians.  Page told Reuters in an email on Tuesday that he was “cooperating with everyone in D.C. who might want my help in the interest of helping our country get to the end of this witch hunt.” Page has said it was touched off by the circulation of a dossier produced by former British spy Christopher Steele on purported links between Trump, his advisers and Russia. The Senate committee, which has sought to speak with Steele, is also investigating whether there was any collusion between then-candidate Trump’s campaign and Moscow officials. Trump has denied any collusion by his associates, calling it “fake news.” The Flynn consultancy’s business activities are under scrutiny by congressional and federal investigators mainly because of the lobbying work it did for a Turkish businessman. Various congressional panels are sparring over Steele’s reports outlining Russian financial and personal links to Trump’s campaign and associates. \"],[\"(Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Friday put a restrictive Republican-backed Arizona ballot-collection law on hold until after Tuesday’s election, handing Democrats a victory in an intensifying state-by-state legal battle over access to the polls.  Arizona’s legislature earlier this year passed the law  prohibiting advocacy groups from collecting completed early ballots from voters and delivering them to election offices as part of get-out-the-vote efforts.  Plaintiffs in the case, including the Democratic National Committee, argued the law is unconstitutional because it unfairly impacted the ability of minorities to vote. Polls have shown Republican Donald Trump with a small lead in Arizona over Democrat Hillary Clinton in the presidential race. The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals earlier this week agreed to revisit a ruling that had refused to block the law and hear the case before an 11-judge panel. That panel voted 6-5 on Friday to prohibit Arizona from enforcing the law now, court records showed. Arizona filed an emergency appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court later on Friday, asking it to reverse the 9th Circuit’s order. Democrats have accused Republicans of enacting state laws intended to make it harder for minorities and others who tend to back Democratic candidates to cast ballots. Republicans have called these laws necessary to guard against voting fraud. Judge Sidney Thomas, the 9th Circuit’s chief judge, wrote that the court’s action would not disrupt Arizona’s ability to conduct the U.S. presidential election.  “It simply would enjoin enforcement of a legislative act that would criminalize the collection, by persons other than the voter, of legitimately cast ballots,” Thomas wrote. He was joined by five other judges appointed by Democratic presidents. Five dissenting 9th Circuit judges, all Republican appointees, argued that the court should not have interfered with Arizona law so close to Election Day, while early voting is already underway. The 9th Circuit covers nine Western states, including Arizona. “We are disappointed in this decision as it will confuse voters and depress turnout,” Arizona Secretary of State Michele Reagan said in a statement. A representative for the Democratic National Committee could not immediately be reached for comment. Acting in another voting case on Friday, a U.S. judge in Ohio ordered Trump’s campaign not to verbally harass voters near polling places or take pictures of them in the key battleground state. \"],[\"BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand is putting the finishing touches this month to a lavish five-day funeral ceremony in a final goodbye to its late King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who helped shape the Southeast Asian nation for decades after World War Two. Many of the hundreds of thousands of black-clad mourners are expected to camp for days near Bangkok s Grand Palace to capture a good view of the ceremonies, which will be guarded by 78,000 police officers and culminate in the cremation on Oct. 26.  October is a sad period,  Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, who announced plans for a national election next year, told reporters in the capital on Tuesday.  I ask that politicians and political parties be peaceful and orderly.  Artisans have worked for ten months in Bangkok s ancient quarter to build an elaborate cremation site fashioned after a vision of heaven, where Thais believe dead royals return to live above Mount Meru, a golden mountain in Hindu mythology. The funeral of King Bhumibol, who died on Oct. 13 last year after seven decades on the throne, is also a time of uncertainty for some Thais, said a Thailand-based analyst, who declined to be identified because of sensitivities around the monarchy.  In many ways the king was Thailand and his death has left a huge vacuum in the Thai psyche,  said the analyst, pointing to social and political upheavals in recent decades.   What happens after his funeral? Where will Thailand head next? These are profound questions that must be answered.  The late king was succeeded by his son, King Maha Vajiralongkorn, or Rama X, who has overseen sweeping changes to the royal household, including the running of palace finances. Though steeped in ancient traditions, the funeral of King Bhumibol will permit more public participation than those of previous kings, said Thai monarchy expert Tongthong Chandransu.  A strong bond has been formed between the people and the monarchy   the strongest compared to past reigns,  Tongthong told Reuters.  So we can see more people participation in the royal funeral of this king.  Among the many royal objects restored for the funeral is a golden chariot that will carry the king s body in a giant ornate urn to the cremation site.  The urn will move to the Royal Crematorium before the cremation on the night of Oct. 26, which has been declared a national holiday. More than 3,000 performers will join in a nightlong final tribute of music and puppet shows to end a year of mourning. Thais devoted to the memory of the king have folded paper flowers for his cremation, making 10 million in Bangkok alone, city authorities said.  This is our  Mandela , or our  Princess Diana , moment,  said graphic designer and self-proclaimed royalist Apichai Klapiput.  What the world will see is rivers of tears that show how much Thais love King Bhumibol Adulyadej. He was the people s king.    \"],[\"ABIDJAN (Reuters) - European leaders under pressure from a far-right revival at home hope to avoid a difficult debate about immigration when they meet their African counterparts in Ivory Coast from Wednesday. Reports this month of abuses against African migrants in Libya have sparked anger across the continent however, threatening to drive migration to the top of the summit agenda and shine a spotlight on an issue fraught with political risk.  German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron, who head the Franco-German axis at the heart of the European Union, will have its next major political test in mind when they sit down with African Union heads of state. Italy, on the frontline of the campaign to slow illegal migration to Europe, holds elections early next year and the populist 5-Star Movement is leading opinion polls. The anti-immigrant, eurosceptic Northern League is also gaining support.   We all have our own interests in not turning this into a migration conference,  one EU official said ahead of the meeting to be held in Ivory Coast s commercial capital Abidjan. The summit is meant to focus on development, long the cornerstone of EU policy in Africa and tangentially related to migration. The theme of investing in youth, though, is a nod to the rampant unemployment and poverty that drives many young Africans to leave home in search of a better life. But it now looks increasingly unlikely the EU leaders can avoid hard questions from their African counterparts. Soon after CNN aired grainy images from Libya this month appearing to show migrants being sold as slaves, African governments began recalling diplomats from Tripoli.  Protests erupted in France, Senegal and Benin. Ivory Coast President Alassane Ouattara called for Libyan slave traders to be prosecuted by the International Criminal Court. Libyan authorities have promised to investigate the slavery allegations. But the European Union too has been the target of anger and frustration.  They re the ones who blocked the way and left us in the hands of these Libyans,  said Cherifou Sahindou, sitting at a make-shift tea stand by a muddy, rubbish-strewn track near a mosque in Abidjan s Yopougon neighborhood. Sahindou and some of the other men around the tea stand said they made it to Libya, but no further. All had heard about the slave markets and all knew someone who had  stayed in the water  - the local euphemism for death on the migrant trail. Like many African leaders, Ouattara has called for Europe to broaden the legal avenues for migration from the continent using mechanisms such as student and temporary work visas.  Europe and Europeans ... should not be afraid, because Africa and the African youth can bring a lot to Europe,  he said in an interview with the France 24 news channel this week. But in the current political climate any proposal for more Africans to enter Europe is a non-starter for many EU leaders. Merkel herself is the most high-profile victim of an anti-immigration backlash. At the peak of the migrant influx into Europe in 2015 she declared an open door policy for refugees and asylum seekers, allowing in more than a million migrants. The anti-immigrant far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party campaigned hard against the policy and won some 13 percent of the vote in a September election - complicating Merkel s efforts to form a coalition government and weakening her position as the leading EU advocate within Europe. In an indication of how heated things have become, the mayor of a small town in Germany, who won an award from Merkel for his liberal migrant policies, was stabbed in the neck on Monday in an attack believed to be politically motivated. Other European leaders firmly behind the 28-member bloc are also wary of falling foul to such an explosive issue.  If you say,  I ve got a right to total access without conditions  ... I can t explain that to my middle class, who ve worked, who pay their taxes,  Macron said during a rowdy exchange with students in Burkina Faso on Tuesday.  What do I tell them?  It is those kinds of political calculations that are hindering much-needed policy solutions, said William Swing, head of the International Organization for Migration.  The heart of the problem is the very toxic atmosphere that s been fairly widespread for some years now ... That s not just in Europe,  he told Reuters.  The drivers (of migration) are there and they re not going away. So clearly our policies need to change.   European delegates at the summit, however, are expected to pledge aid, repeating often voiced calls for a  Marshall Plan  for Africa that would create jobs and lift incomes to give would-be migrants a reason to stay at home.  The African security sectors charged with clamping down on migrant flows will also get their share of European money. EU support for the Libyan authorities, including Italian assistance for its coastguard, has helped halve the number of migrants arriving in Europe via the Mediterranean this year.  Though lauded in Italy, the program, which has led to massive detention centers being created in Libya to hold intercepted migrants, was denounced by the United Nation s human rights chief Zeid Ra ad Al Hussein. Abdoulaye Dosso, another man at the tea stand in Yopougon, said he crossed the Sahara desert, played dead to survive as rebels shot other migrants, and then spent weeks in one such camp awaiting repatriation to Ivory Coast.  There have been too many deaths,  he said.  There must be a change.

Most of the world considers the Golan, a high plateau  between northeastern Israel and southwestern Syria, to be occupied by Israel, which annexed the territory in 1981 in a move not recognized internationally. During a briefing with Israeli and foreign media after meeting Trump at the White House, Netanyahu was asked whether he had raised the Golan issue. “Yes,” he replied.  Asked how the U.S. president had responded, he said: “I wouldn’t say that he was surprised by my request.” Netanyahu did not elaborate. Israel made a similar request to the Obama administration in 2015, but it was rejected, diplomats said at the time. While Israel has long coveted sovereignty in the Golan, it is unclear whether the White House would take such a step now, given that it could further complicate the Syrian conflict. If the United States were to recognize Israel’s claim, it would likely anger Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who is backed by Russia and Iran in his war with Islamist militants and rebel groups. The Trump administration has talked about working more closely with Russia to end the Syrian conflict. Recognizing Israel’s sovereignty in the Golan could undermine those efforts. It could also spur Iran and its proxies in Syria, particularly the Lebanese Shi’ite militia Hezbollah, to turn more of their focus against Israel, targeting its forces stationed across the Golan Heights. Israel has warned Hezbollah, with which it fought a six-week war in 2006, against attacking its territory. It has carried out occasional air strikes in the Syrian portion of the Golan to target Hezbollah fighters, including units smuggling arms.  Israel’s argument for sovereignty over the territory is based partly on the fact that Syria has splintered over the past five years of fighting, to the extent that Israel says there is no one to whom it could hand back the Golan. But with the United States and Israel looking to forge an ever-tighter relationship, it is also possible that Trump, who has shown himself to be unpredictable at times, could decide to recognize Israel’s sovereignty. As well as around 25,000 Israeli settlers in the territory, many of them working in agriculture, there are about 20,000 Druze of Syrian citizenship, many of whom have relatives living in just across the valley in Syria.     \"],[\"(Reuters) - Iran said on Friday it had barred a U.S. wrestling team from the Freestyle World Cup competition in retaliation for an executive order by President Donald Trump banning visas for Iranians, state television reported. The Freestyle World Cup, one of the sport’s most prestigious events, is scheduled for Feb. 16-17 and USA Wrestling had previously said it would send a team to the competition in the western Iranian city of Kermanshah. Tehran has already announced it will stop U.S. citizens entering the country following Washington’s decision to ban refugees and citizens of seven majority-Muslim countries including Iran. “A special committee in Tehran reviewed their cases and decided to oppose the visit by the U.S. freestyle wrestling team,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Ghasemi was quoted by state television as saying. “The visa policy of the new American administration gave us no other option but to ban the wrestlers.” USA Wrestling said that neither they nor United World Wrestling have been officially notified that these reports are accurate. “We have no official documentation that the USA Wrestling team will be denied the opportunity to participate at the Freestyle World Cup,” USA Wrestling said in a statement. “The Freestyle World Cup is the annual World dual meet championship, one of the most important events that United World Wrestling hosts each year. “If these reports are true, USA Wrestling is extremely disappointed about this, which we believe would be an unacceptable situation. Wrestling is about competition and goodwill through sport, and is no place for politics.” USA Wrestling said on Monday the United States would send a team to Iran, where U.S. freestyle wrestlers have participated in competitions since 1998.  Nenad Lalovic, president of United World Wrestling, the sport’s international federation, said it was working towards a solution. “Though we had hoped for a different outcome from Iran’s Foreign Ministry, we appreciate the complex nature of this decision. We are currently working to find a solution for the Freestyle World Cup as soon as possible,” he said in a statement. “Despite the travel restrictions between their countries I’ve been encouraged this week by the cooperation and friendship of the Iranian Wrestling Federation and USA Wrestling. “As we’ve seen over the years, wrestling is a sport that unites people and nations. United World Wrestling hosts a full calendar of events every season and we’re certain to see American and Iranian wrestlers on the same mat again in the very near future.” Trump has adopted an aggressive stance towards Tehran since Iran’s ballistic missile test-launch, saying it was now “on notice”. The new U.S. administration is expected to impose fresh sanctions on multiple Iranian entities.  \"],[\"NEW YORK (Reuters) - As Americans vote for a new president on Tuesday, hundreds of thousands of voters in California’s Bay Area and Boulder, Colorado, will also decide whether they want levies on sugary drinks, another step toward making soda taxes a norm. Three cities in California - San Francisco, Berkeley and Albany - and Boulder, Colorado, have become the latest battleground in a so-called “War on Sugar” that centers on sweetened drinks. Over 800,000 voters will decide on ballot measures to introduce taxes of 1 or 2 cents per ounce on soft drinks on Nov. 9, just weeks after the World Health Organization (WHO) advocated that governments should impose these types of levies.  The push for taxes on sugar and sodas has gathered momentum this year, as officials and health advocates seek ways to stem health epidemics of diabetes and obesity. On most ballots, the tax would not apply to diet sodas but does affect some juices, sports drinks and other beverages with added sugar. Reducing consumption of sugary drinks is seen as a relatively easy way for people to cut down on added sugars, recommended by groups including the WHO, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the American Heart Association. The trend has prompted worry and millions of dollars in advertising and lobbying campaigns from beverage industry giants like PepsiCo Inc and Coca-Cola Co that are facing declining sales of their flagship products in markets including the United States.  So far this year, Britain and Philadelphia decided to introduce levies on soft drinks and countries including South Africa have proposed similar measures. This follows a decision by Mexico to introduce such a tax in 2014. The broadening of these efforts raises the prospect of establishing them as the norm after numerous previous attempts failed, advocates say. “The more these taxes pass, the more they will be considered in other jurisdictions,” said Jim O’Hara, health promotion policy director with the Center for Science in the Public Interest in Washington. Both Pepsi and Coke have are increasing options for less sugary drinks, responding to changing consumer tastes. Consumption of carbonated soft drinks hit a 30-year low in the United States last year, as water sales continued their climb, according to Beverage Digest. The majority of California voters support government measure to reduce consumption of sugary beverages, according to a Field Poll released in February. In San Francisco, a 2014 bid for a similar tax failed to pass a two-thirds vote, but is expected by many to succeed this time around, as only a simple majority is required. The votes in the other cities are expected by both advocates and opponents alike to be tighter. Fighting for survival, Big Soda has been outspending advocates of the measure, but not by much. Industry spending to oppose the taxes this year in the Bay Area alone has swelled to around $27 million to $28 million, versus around some $19 million by advocates, according to estimates from both sides. Billionaires including Michael Bloomberg have joined the fray, contributing $15 million to pro-tax campaigns in the Bay Area. The former mayor of New York waged an unsuccessful campaign in the city to cut soda sizes in 2014. Opponents say the tax, which would be levied on distributors, is unfairly targeted at drinks makers and could raise food costs beyond just soda. “In effect, this is a grocery tax. It could be spread out on many items” by distributors, said Joe Arellano, spokesman for the “No Grocery Tax” campaigns in California’s Bay area.  In the California cities, the measures would introduce a penny-per-ounce tax. In Boulder, it would be 2 cents. “There’s no tax we will support to change behavior of consumers. We don’t think they work,” said Susan Neely, head of the American Beverage Association. She cited efforts by soda companies like reducing portion sizes. The group is suing to block Philadelphia’s tax. She said it was unclear yet if the group would challenge the potential levies in California or Colorado. It is unclear how long-lasting the impacts of the taxes in places like Mexico and Berkeley will be, but some early research suggests partial pass-through of the taxes from businesses to customers and an impact on per capita consumption. \"],[\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A healthcare bill being unveiled by U.S. Senate Republicans on Thursday is expected to roll back the Obamacare expansion of the Medicaid healthcare program for the poor and reshape subsidies to low-income people buying private insurance. Those subsidies are expected to be linked to recipients’ income, a “major improvement” from a healthcare overhaul bill passed in the House of Representatives that tied them solely to age, Republican Senator Susan Collins said on Wednesday. The Washington Post reported that the bill would also repeal most of the taxes that pay for the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare, give states wider latitude to opt out of its regulations and eliminate federal funding for Planned Parenthood, a healthcare provider that offers abortion services.  The healthcare bill will be released to the Republican Senate Conference on Thursday morning and posted online, senators said. A vote could come as soon as next week, several senators said. Senate Republicans have been working behind closed doors for weeks on legislation aimed at repealing and replacing major portions of Obamacare, former Democratic President Barack Obama’s signature healthcare law. Obamacare extended insurance coverage to millions of Americans through both subsidized private insurance and an expansion of Medicaid. “There is an urgency to get this done because of the continued collapse of the Obama healthcare law,” Senator John Barrasso, a member of the Senate Republican leadership, told CNN. “People across the country are suffering pain and the pain is getting worse as insurance companies are pulling out.” Democrats accuse Republicans of sabotaging Obamacare, and say the Republican healthcare bill is aimed at cutting taxes for the wealthy. Democratic Senator Patty Murray of Washington said in a statement that leaked details of the bill indicated it was “every bit as devastating for families’ bank accounts and healthcare coverage as the disastrous bill that passed in the House.” President Donald Trump and fellow Republicans campaigned last year on a pledge to replace and repeal Obamacare, which they described as ineffective and government intrusion in a key sector of the economy.          Some Republican senators voiced concern on Wednesday about the rush to consider the major legislation as their party’s leaders prepare to unveil it. Republican Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin said he wanted to read the bill and discuss it with constituents before he votes. “I’d find it hard to believe we’ll have enough time,” he said, adding that if he did not get enough information, “I won’t be voting yes.” Democrats hoping to block the healthcare measure in the Republican-led Senate need at least two Republicans to defect. The Democrats have criticized the behind-the-scenes meetings, and blocked Senate committees on Wednesday from meeting for over two hours in protest.  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, defending the closed-door sessions, has said all Senate Republicans have had a chance to participate in meetings on the bill, and that Democrats are not interested in overhauling Obamacare. Once the plan is unveiled, Senate Republicans will face a skeptical public that thinks the House version would be harmful for low-income Americans and people with pre-existing health conditions, according to a Reuters\\u002fIpsos poll released on Wednesday.  Trump told a rally in Iowa on Wednesday night that he hoped the Senate would come up with a “really good” bill. “I’ve been talking about a plan with heart,” Trump said. He had privately called the House legislation “mean,” according to congressional sources. Several weeks of negotiations over the bill have been plagued by tensions between moderates and conservatives. Much of the battle has been over how quickly to phase out the Medicaid expansion that took place under Obamacare. Moderates favored a seven-year phase-out, but the Senate leadership proposed three years starting in 2020. There was also an argument over Medicaid’s growth rate going forward, with conservatives favoring lowering the growth rate in 2025. “That’s what we’re told it might be,” said Republican Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana.  Cassidy said senators had also been told the legislation would continue funding cost-sharing subsidies made available to help low-income Americans under Obamacare “for a couple of years.” Collins, a moderate Republican from Maine, said she wanted to read an assessment by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office on its impact on cost and insurance coverage before making her decision.  “The first concern is how many people will lose coverage and what do the demographics of that group look like,” she said.  An estimated 23 million people could lose their healthcare under a similar plan narrowly passed last month by the Republican-controlled House, according to the CBO. \"],[\"DUBAI (Reuters) - Qatar must do more to protect construction workers from heat which often reaches levels that are potentially fatal, Human Rights Watch said on Wednesday. HRW and other rights campaigners are frequent critics of Qatar s treatment of migrant laborers whose working conditions have received additional scrutiny as the country prepares to host the 2022 World Cup. The group said existing regulations only set limits on outdoor work during the period June 15 to Aug. 31, and then only from 11:30 a.m. to 3 p.m.   Climate data shows that weather conditions in Qatar outside those hours and dates frequently reach levels that can result in potentially fatal heat-related illnesses in the absence of appropriate rest,  it said. HRW called authorities also to investigate the causes of migrant worker deaths and publish data on such incidents. In 2013, health authorities reported 520 deaths of workers from Bangladesh, India, and Nepal, HRW said.  Like other wealthy Gulf Arab states, Qatar relies on vast numbers of migrant workers, mostly from the Philippines, South Asia and Africa. Around 2 million migrant workers live in Qatar, outnumbering the local workforce by nearly 20 to one. Some 800,000 work in the construction sector. Unions and labor protests are banned and authorities penalize dissent with jail or deportation. The Qatari government s Communications Office said:  Qatar is committed to its labor reform program and is constantly reviewing its policies to ensure that migrant workers receive the necessary on-site protections.  We continue to coordinate closely with the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and international NGOs to implement reforms that will improve the health, safety and rights of migrant workers,  Sheikh Saif Al Thani, head of the Communications Office, said in a statement sent to Reuters. \"],[\"HANOI (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump has written to Vietnamese President Tran Dai Quang to promote more cooperation between the two countries, the government website cited Quang as saying. Vietnam and the United States had advanced ties to a new level under the Obama administration amid a dispute with China over South China Sea issues, while Trump has also expressed his hope for a stronger relationship. Trump sent a letter to Quang “affirming his wishes to promote cooperation on economics, trade, regional and international issues”, the Vietnamese government website said.  Quang made the remarks during a meeting with the U.S. ambassador to Vietnam on Friday. Quang emphasized that Vietnam welcomes U.S. efforts to improve cooperation with countries in the region to maintain the freedom of navigation and aviation.  U.S. Ambassador Ted Osius was reported as saying that Trump is considering attending the upcoming Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Vietnam this year.  Vietnam had been expected to be one of the biggest  beneficiaries of the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) free trade deal which Trump pulled the U.S. out of in January, but Hanoi has also been building links with the United States amid a maritime dispute with China. China claims most of the South China Sea, while Taiwan, Malaysia, Vietnam, the Philippines and Brunei claim parts of the sea that commands strategic sea lanes and has rich fishing grounds along with oil and gas deposits. Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc said last month he was ready to visit the United States to promote ties, particularly trade. \"],[\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. military said on Friday it was identifying new areas where it could work with allies to put pressure on Iran in support of President Donald Trump’s new strategy, which promises a far more confrontational approach to Tehran. Trump struck a blow against the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement on Friday in defiance of other world powers, choosing not to certify that Tehran is complying with the deal and warning he might ultimately terminate it. He also promised to address Iran more broadly, including its support for extremist groups in the Middle East. Major Adrian Rankine-Galloway, a Defense Department spokesman, told Reuters the Pentagon was assessing the positioning of its forces as well as planning but offered few details. “We are identifying new areas where we will work with allies to put pressure on the Iranian regime, neutralize its destabilizing influences, and constrain its aggressive power projection, particularly its support for terrorist groups and militants,” he said. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said his first goal would to talk with U.S. allies in Europe, the Middle East and elsewhere to gain a shared understanding of Iran’s actions. “Certainly we intend to dissuade them from shipping arms into places like Yemen and explosives into Bahrain and the other things they do with their surrogates, like Lebanese Hezbollah,” Mattis said. The U.S. military has long been a strident critic of Iran, accusing it directly and indirectly of trying to undermine the United States and its allies, including in Iraq, Syria and Yemen. The tensions escalated in recent months in Syria, where American pilots shot down two Iranian-made drones this summer.   Still, a more aggressive approach to Iran could trigger a backlash from Iran’s elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and forces that it backs. That includes in Iraq, where U.S. troops are fighting Islamic State and trying to keep their distance from Shi’ite militia aligned with Iran. “U.S. forces in Iraq are quite exposed, and coalition forces are quite exposed to the risk of attack if Iranian elements so choose,” said Jennifer Cafarella, lead intelligence planner at the Institute for the Study of War, a think-tank in Washington. The U.S. military is analyzing an explosively formed penetrator, or EFP, that killed an American soldier in Iraq this month. The reappearance of the device, which Iran-backed Shi’ite militia routinely used to target American troops in Iraq before their withdrawal in 2011, has startled U.S. officials. CIA Director Mike Pompeo noted the device was detonated in an area controlled by a militia backed by Tehran. “We do not have evidence of a direct link to Iran, but we are closely examining this tragic incident,” Pompeo said on Wednesday. Cafarella said the killing of the U.S. soldier may have been a warning from Iran. “I think it is possible that the Iranians have been attempting to signal their commitment to retaliate against the U.S. strategy,” she said. Mattis said the United States was watching for any new provocations from Iran. Asked whether he thought Tehran might retaliate, he said: “It would be ill advised for them to attack us.” Reuters has previously reported that options to increase pressure on Iran include more aggressive U.S. interceptions of Iranian arms shipments, such as those to Houthi rebels in Yemen, It could also direct U.S. naval forces to react more forcefully when harassed by armed IRGC speed boats. The Pentagon on Friday detailed a series of major concern about Iran, including its ballistic missile development and cyber attacks against the United States and U.S. allies.  The Pentagon promised to review U.S. security cooperation activities with allies in the region, something that could lead to alterations in U.S. arms sales and military exercises.  It also signaled a willingness to re-examine the positioning of the roughly 70,000 American troops the Pentagon says are stationed in the Middle East. Still, Mattis said: “Right now we are not changing our posture.” \"],[\"BEIRUT (Reuters) - U.S.-backed militias in Syria have declared victory over Islamic State in its capital Raqqa, a milestone in the fight to roll back the theocratic  caliphate  declared in 2014.. Here are facts about Raqqa: Raqqa sits on the Euphrates river around 90 km (56 miles) from the Turkish border in north central Syria.  Sunni militant group Islamic State overran Raqqa in January 2014, seizing control from rebel factions opposed to the rule of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The United States has said Islamic State planned and sent teams from Raqqa to carry out attacks on cities including Paris, Brussels and Istanbul.  THE ANTI-IS OFFENSIVE The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), an alliance of mostly Kurdish and Arab militias, began to advance towards Raqqa city in November 2016. After encircling the city, they launched the offensive to take it, facing tough resistance.  The United States-led coalition supported the SDF with air strikes and special forces on the ground.  The battle for Raqqa has taken a severe toll on civilians. The United Nations said in March the city contained around 200,000 people, just under its pre-war population.  Since late last year, fighting around and in Raqqa has displaced tens of thousands of people. Many have fled the city to camps in surrounding territory now under the control of the SDF and its strongest component, the Kurdish YPG militia.  Civilians who were trapped inside the Islamic State enclave in the city endured miserable conditions for months, lacking water, power, food and healthcare. As the SDF captured parts of Raqqa they were mostly been cleared of residents.     Air strikes, fighting and Islamic State snipers and mines have killed many hundreds of people.   The coalition says it is careful to avoid civilian casualties in its bombing runs in Syria and Iraq. But the U.N. human rights office and rights group Amnesty International have raised concerns about reports of high civilian deaths.  Islamic State imposed its very strict interpretation of Islamic law on Raqqa s residents. The fighters have carried out public executions, lashings and violent punishments for infringements of their rule. The Raqqa campaign has stirred tension between the United States and NATO-ally Turkey. Potential Kurdish influence in the future of the mainly Arab city is sensitive both for some activists from Raqqa and for Turkey.   The YPG has become the main U.S. partner in the fight against Islamic State in northern Syria. Ankara views it as a Syrian extension of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has waged a three-decade insurgency within Turkey, and fears growing Kurdish power along its border. The SDF s political allies have set up a Raqqa Civil Council of people from the city, which the SDF has said it will hand control to after Islamic State s defeat. This echoes the pattern in other towns and cities that the SDF captured. The U.S.-led coalition has helped train a new police force for the city.  Islamic State has made enemies of all sides in the more than six-year Syrian conflict, with separate offensives now trying to clear it from its last foothold in the towns along the Euphrates river in eastern Syria near the Iraqi border. Besides the U.S.-backed SDF, the Syrian army, with Russian jets and Iran-backed militias, is also waging its own campaign against Islamic State in eastern Syria.         A modern-day provincial transport hub and market town, Raqqa was built by the Abbasid Islamic Caliphate in the eighth century, serving as its capital at one point. It has been inhabited since antiquity and contains important archeological and architectural sites. The United Nations has said they have been extensively looted during the war and religious buildings have been damaged. Islamic State militants released a video of them bombing a large part of the Uwais al-Qarani shrine complex in March 2014. \"],[\"VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis canonized 35 new Roman Catholic saints on Sunday, including three indigenous children martyred in 16th century Mexico and considered the first Christians killed for their faith in the New World. Francis used the occasion to announce that he had decided to call a meeting of bishops, or synod, from countries in the    Pan-Amazon region for October, 2019, to discuss the condition of the Church in the area and the plight of indigenous people. The region includes Guyana, Suriname, French Guyana, Venezuela, Ecuador, Colombia, Bolivia, Peru and Brazil. The three children the pope canonized before a crowd of tens of thousands in St. Peter s Square were of the Talaxcaltec people, an indigenous pre-Colombian group in what is now Mexico. The first child, Cristoforo, was converted to Christianity by Franciscan missionaries and was killed in 1527 by his own father, a tribal chief who spurned his son s attempts to convert him from paganism. The boy was beaten and thrown into a fire when he was 13. Two other indigenous children from the same area, Antonio and Juan, were killed by Indios in the village of Cuauhtinchan in 1529 as a result of their conversion. They are believed to have been 12 or 13 when they were beaten to death for helping Dominican missionaries. The pope also canonized 30 martyrs who were killed for their faith in Brazil in 1645. They included two Portuguese missionaries and 28 followers killed by Dutch colonial soldiers during a period of persecution of Catholics. In announcing the 2019 synod for bishops from the Amazon region, Francis said indigenous people there today were  often abandoned and without the prospect of a bright future, even due to the crisis of the Amazon Forest, a lung of utmost importance for our planet . Francis, an Argentine and the first Latin American pope, has often linked his calls for social justice, particularly for indigenous people, to those for defense of the environment, saying the poor will suffer the most from the effects of climate change. In 2015 he wrote a landmark encyclical, or papal letter, on defense of the environment and he has called for special protection for the Amazon region because of its vital importance to the planet s ecosystem. In his comments on Sunday, the pope did not mention the role of the Church in suppressing native cultures in the New World. But during a visit to Bolivia in 2015, Francis said  many grave sins were committed against the native people of America in the name of God . He asked forgiveness for the Church, for  crimes committed against native peoples during the so-called conquest of America . On Sunday, Francis also canonized Father Faustino Miguez, a Spanish priest who lived in the 19th and 20th centuries, and Father Angelo d Acri, an Italian itinerant preacher who died in 1739 after serving in some of the most remote areas of mountainous southern Italy. \"],[\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration’s ability to win over the U.S. Supreme Court will be put to the test when the nine justices begin their new term on Monday with major cases awaiting on voting rights, religious liberty, union funding and class-action suits. President Donald Trump’s Justice Department already has flipped the government’s position in some important cases, reversing the stance taken under Democratic former President Barack Obama, and could have a receptive audience on the court, whose term runs through June. The addition of Trump’s appointee Neil Gorsuch in April restored the court’s 5-4 conservative majority, as the new justice prepares to begin his first full term. The administration has backed companies against employees and supported voting laws that critics say could prevent eligible people from casting ballots. [Graphic showing major cases: tmsnrt.rs\\u002f2y3eCs6] It also has reversed the Obama administration’s stance in support of protections for gay workers under federal law, an issue that could reach the court within weeks.  The Supreme Court generally gives special deference to the views of the U.S. solicitor general, the federal government’s top lawyer. Trump’s appointee Noel Francisco holds the job. But some justices may look dimly upon the government abruptly changing its position in cases. Former Justice Department lawyer Pratik Shah said a flip-flop can provide an opening for justices sympathetic to the view of the prior administration, who can ask: “What in the law has changed to warrant a different view?” The court’s oldest justice, 84-year-old liberal Ruth Bader Ginsburg, has called the upcoming term “momentous” owing to the importance of the cases on the docket. On Tuesday, the term’s second day, the justices are due to hear a case that could help shape U.S. elections for decades involving the long-standing practice of a majority party manipulating electoral boundaries for future elections to try to cement their hold on power. Wisconsin is appealing a lower-court ruling that the way the Republican-led legislature redrew boundaries following the 2010 census was so far-reaching in its bid to marginalize Democratic voters that it violated the Constitution. In a case expected to be argued in December involving free speech, religious liberty and gay rights, the justices will weigh whether a Denver-area baker who cited his Christian beliefs in refusing to make a wedding cake for a gay couple can be penalized for violating a Colorado anti-discrimination law. The new administration has backed the baker, infuriating groups that support gay, lesbian, transgender and bisexual rights. “President Trump said on the campaign trail that he’s an advocate for LGBT people, but actions speak much louder than words,” said James Esseks, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer who works on gay rights issues. The Supreme Court on Monday canceled arguments that had been scheduled for Oct. 10 in what would have been the biggest case of the term, whether Trump’s ban on people entering the United States from several Muslim-majority countries amounted to unconstitutional discrimination against Muslims. The action came after a temporary ban expired and the administration announced a new set of restrictions. ‘ONE-TWO PUNCH’ A case on the first day of the term on Monday presents a rarity, with the administration facing off against one of the federal government’s own agencies, the National Labor Relations Board. “That will be a first for me in the nearly 25 years I have served on the court,” Ginsburg said at a Georgetown Law Center event on Sept. 20. The administration is no longer defending the NLRB’s position that employment agreements in which businesses require workers to waive their rights to bring class-action claims are invalid. The waivers compel workers to individually arbitrate disputes with employers rather than bringing collective lawsuits with co-workers. The court’s conservative majority is expected to be sympathetic to the arguments made by employers.  The court on Thursday agreed to hear a case that could end an important source of funding for unions representing police, teachers and other government employees. The dispute centers on fees that some states require non-union members to pay to unions in lieu of dues to fund collective bargaining and other organized labor activities.  Claire Prestel, associate general counsel of the Service Employees International Union (SEIU), said those cases could lead to a “one-two punch against workers.” The Obama administration backed the unions in a similar case in which the justices ended with a 4-4 deadlock last year. The Trump administration may change course and back the anti-union challengers. In another about-face, Trump’s Justice Department has also sided with Ohio in its bid to revive a state policy of purging infrequent voters from voter-registration lists, reversing the Obama administration’s stance that the practice was illegal. Obama’s former attorney general, Eric Holder, joined a friend-of-the-court brief criticizing the reversal, saying the Trump administration policy departed from the government’s  interpretation of Ohio’s law dating back more than 20 years and spanning administrations from both parties. The justices are set to hear that case on Nov. 8. \"],[\"BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thirteen activists were ordered to pay a total of $16 million in compensation on Thursday for shutting down Bangkok s two main international airports during protests in 2008. Thailand s Supreme Court told the leading members of the People s Alliance for Democracy (PAD) to pay the money plus interest to the Airports of Thailand operator. Protesters occupied Don Muang and Suvarnabhumi International Airports for more than a week in late 2008, disrupting hundreds of flights and stranding hundreds of thousands of travelers. One of the PAD leaders affected by the ruling, Suriyasai Katasila, told Reuters it might take years for them to find all the money.  If we cannot pay the compensation then the AOT (Airports of Thailand) will have to sue us for bankruptcy,  he said.  I believe what we have done was for the public interest in opposing a corrupt government at the time, it was not motivated by personal interests at all,  he added. PAD was formed 2005 in opposition to Thaksin Shinawatra, the former Thai prime minister who was ousted in a 2006 military coup. It supporters include members of the urban middle class and support the traditional royalist-military elite. A total of 98 PAD protesters, more commonly known as the Yellow Shirts, have also been charged with terrorism and other criminal offences linked to the airports occupation. \"],[\"PARIS (Reuters) - France s foreign minister said on Thursday he would head to Libya  very soon  to push warring parties to support a peace roadmap tentatively agreed in Paris in July.  Libyan Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj and the divided country s eastern commander Khalifa Haftar verbally committed last month to a conditional ceasefire and to work toward holding elections next spring.  I will be traveling to Libya very soon to ensure the follow-up of this meeting and to get the support of all sides to the declaration that was adopted then,  Jean-Yves Le Drian said in a speech to French ambassadors. France, which took a leading role in the NATO air campaign that helped rebels topple Muammar Gaddafi, has sought to play a greater role in Libya, believing diplomatic efforts were stalling and that under President Emmanuel Macron it could fill that void. Officials fear jihadist groups could try to exploit the power vacuum in Libya to regroup after losing substantial ground in Syria and Iraq, and see a resolution to the conflict as vital to ending Europe s migrant crisis.  In Libya, France along with others has a specific responsibility to help this country find unity and stability,  Le Drian said. Past attempts at peace deals in oil-producing Libya have often been scuttled by internal divisions among the myriad of competing armed groups that have emerged since rebels toppled  Gaddafi in 2011.  Diplomats declined to say specifically when Le Drian was traveling due to security reasons.   The French initiative has angered officials in Italy, which has previously taken the lead in efforts to bring peace to its former North African colony and borne the brunt of successive waves of African migrants who have crossed the Mediterranean from Libya. \"],[\"RIYADH (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson arrived in Riyadh on Saturday to attend a landmark meeting between officials from Saudi Arabia and Iraq aimed at improving relations between the two countries and countering Iran s growing regional influence. The chief U.S. diplomat flew into King Salman Air Base a little more than a week after U.S. President Donald Trump unveiled a strategy to contain Iran and compel Tehran to agree to close what he charged are flaws in the multinational 2015 deal designed to prevent Iran developing nuclear weapons. Tillerson s only official meeting on Saturday was a working dinner with Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir. He was stopping in Saudi Arabia on the first leg of a six-day trip that will also take him to Qatar, Pakistan, India and Switzerland. His talks in Sunni Muslim-ruled Saudi Arabia and in Qatar were expected to be dominated by the topic of Shi ite-dominated Iran s growing regional influence. Iran-backed militias have helped turn the tide of Syria s civil war in the government s favor and they have played leading roles in Iraq s battle to recapture Islamic State s self-declared  caliphate.  This week they aided Iraqi security forces in seizing the oil-rich area of the northern city of Kirkuk as part of an effort to crush a bid for independence made by the Kurdish minority. Washington and Riyadh also allege that Iran is supporting Houthi rebels in Yemen against pro-government forces that are supported by a Saudi-led military coalition backed by the United States. Yemen s grinding civil war was expected to be high on Tillerson s agenda. On Sunday Tillerson is due to attend the inaugural session of the Saudi-Iraqi Coordination Council, a body whose creation was promoted by the Trump administration to improve relations between Saudi Arabia, Iran s main regional rival, and Iraq, whose majority Shi ite-dominated government has close ties with Tehran. During his visit Tillerson is also expected to explore the possibility of renewing a push to end a diplomatic and economic boycott of Qatar by Saudi Arabia and other U.S. Arab allies, although he has conceded he is not optimistic. In an interview on Thursday with Bloomberg, Tillerson blamed Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt for the lack of progress toward ending the four-month-old crisis. Saudi Arabia and its allies have accused Qatar of supporting hardline Islamist groups and cozying up to Iran at the region s expense. Doha denies the allegations.  It s up to the leadership of the quartet when they want to engage with Qatar because Qatar has been very clear - they are ready to engage,  said Tillerson, who forged close ties to the Gulf Arab countries in his former position as CEO of Exxon Mobil. A senior UAE official said on Saturday it was up to Qatar to end the crisis ahead of a summit of the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council in December.  The ball is in its court and it is aware of what is required of it,  Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash wrote on his Twitter account. \"],[\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. congressional Democrats filed suit on Thursday seeking the release of government documents related to Republican President Donald Trump’s ownership of a Washington hotel that critics say represents a conflict of interest. In the lawsuit, Democrats on the House of Representatives’ Oversight and Government Reform Committee said the General Services Administration (GSA), the government’s property arm, illegally withheld documents about the Trump International Hotel. The 14-page suit marks the latest legal skirmish over the luxury hotel a few blocks from the White House, which has become a rallying point for anti-Trump protesters. Critics say the hotel violates government rules barring elected officials from taking part in a lease of federal property. Representative Elijah Cummings of Maryland, the committee’s ranking Democrat, said the GSA had ignored federal law by refusing to provide documents about the hotel’s operation, foreign payments to the hotel or the legal reasoning that Trump could be a party to the lease. “We have no transparency - no ability to check for ongoing conflicts of interest or unconstitutional foreign payments,” Cummings said in a statement. The suit filed in U.S. District Court names acting General Services Administrator Timothy Horne as defendant. Pam Dixon, a spokeswoman for the agency, said it would not comment on pending litigation. Cummings and other critics have argued that the hotel housed in the government’s historic Old Post Office represented a conflict of interest because Trump is both landlord and tenant of the building. A GSA contracting officer said in March that the hotel was not in violation of federal conflict-of-interest rules.  Thursday’s lawsuit said the GSA rebuffed three requests from committee Democrats for information about the hotel since Trump took office in January. The requests included ones filed under a law which mandates that a federal agency turn over information requested by at least seven members of the committee. Under the same law, the GSA had produced documents about the  Trump International Hotel while Democrat Barack Obama was president, the suit said. Trump is facing numerous lawsuits targeting his alleged failure to distance himself from his business empire while in office. The president ceded day-to-day control of his businesses to his sons, Eric and Donald Jr., in a move he said would steer clear of conflicts of interest. \"],[\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama on Friday strongly suggested that Russian President Vladimir Putin personally authorized the computer hacks of Democratic Party emails that American intelligence officials say were aimed at helping Republican Donald Trump win the Nov. 8 election. But with only a month left in office, during a somber press conference before leaving for a family holiday in Hawaii, Obama spoke despairingly about the “nasty” state of U.S. politics, saying the chasm between Democrats and Republicans has made it possible for Russia to cause mischief. Obama said he has “great confidence” in intelligence reports he has seen showing that Russians hacked into emails belonging to the Democratic National Committee and to John Podesta, who was campaign chairman for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. The leaked emails revealed details of paid speeches Clinton gave to Wall Street, party infighting and comments from top aides to Clinton who were shocked about the extent of her use of a private server to send emails while secretary of state. The leaks led to embarrassing media coverage and prompted some party officials to resign. Obama, who campaigned vigorously for Clinton, said she was treated unfairly and found the media coverage of her troubling. “This happened at the highest levels of the Russian government,” Obama said when asked whether Putin was personally involved in the hacks. He added that “not much happens in Russia without Vladimir Putin.” Obama said he warned Putin in September to stop meddling in American political campaigns, telling his Russian counterpart to “cut it out” during a face-to-face encounter in China at a Group of 20 meeting. Obama said he did not believe that U.S. electronic voting systems were tampered with. Obama, however, stopped short of directly blaming Putin and said he also wanted to give U.S. intelligence officials more time to produce a report that is due before he leaves office on Jan. 20 and Trump is sworn in as his successor. Obama called Russia a smaller and weaker country than the United States that “does not produce anything that others want to buy, except oil and gas and arms.”  The comments underscored what Obama called the “sadly deteriorated” relationship between Washington and Moscow, which are also at odds over Russia’s role in Syria’s civil war and its aggressive actions in Ukraine.     Russia has denied U.S. accusations that it was behind the hacks. Two senior government officials told Reuters that the Federal Bureau of Investigation backs the CIA’s view that Russia indeed intervened to help Trump win the presidential election. Trump has maintained that he won the election fairly and has bristled at suggestions that Moscow influenced the outcome.    But at one point during the heated presidential campaign, he   publicly encouraged Russia to hack Clinton’s emails. Trump spoke glowingly in the campaign about Putin, and since winning the election he has named top aides who have ties to Russia, including his nominee for secretary of state, Exxon Mobil Corp Chief Executive Rex Tillerson. Obama left open the door to U.S. retaliation against Russia to discourage further cyber attacks - countermeasures that may be up to Trump to implement. Obama said he has had “cordial” discussions with Trump since the election and has stressed that he would do everything he can to ensure a smooth transition. But the outgoing president also criticized Trump’s fellow Republicans broadly. Referencing polls showing that more than one-third of Republicans approve of Putin, who used to lead the KGB spy agency, Obama said that conservative icon “Ronald Reagan would roll over in his grave.”                 “In some cases, you have voters and elected officials who have more confidence and faith in a foreign adversary than they have in their neighbors,” Obama said. Adding to the gloomy tone of Obama’s remarks, he addressed two other difficult foreign policy issues that will outlast his time in the White House.  Obama warned about the economic and geopolitical consequences of any breakdown in the U.S.-China relationship, and said Trump should think carefully about the diplomatic repercussions if he decides to “upend” longstanding U.S. diplomatic norms. Trump angered China earlier this month when he took a congratulatory phone call from Taiwan’s president, Tsai Ing-wen - the first call of its kind since 1979 when President Jimmy Carter acknowledged Taiwan as part of “one China.” Obama also condemned attacks on Syrian civilians trying to flee the city of Aleppo, blaming President Bashar al-Assad and his allies in Russia and Iran for “atrocities.” Obama defended his decision to keep U.S. troops out of Syria and avoid military intervention, although he acknowledged the protracted anguish has weighed on him. “Everything else was tempting because we wanted to do something and it sounded like the right thing to do, but it was going to be impossible to do this on the cheap,” he said. \"],[\"(Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Tuesday upheld an Ohio law passed in 2014 that shortened the state’s early voting period and abolished a so-called Golden Week when residents could register and cast ballots in the same week. The 2-1 decision from a panel of the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reverses a May ruling by U.S. District Judge Michael Watson who struck down the law that limited early voting, saying it violated voters’ rights. Tuesday’s ruling is the latest in a flurry of legal battles over state voting rules ahead of the Nov. 8 election, including stricter voter identification laws in some states and laws on the voting rights of felons in others. . Ohio has long been a battleground swing state in presidential elections where Democrats and Republicans are tightly matched. Ohio’s Republican-controlled legislature abolished “Golden Week” and shortened early voting to 29 days from 35 days, which critics said directly limited opportunities for minority participation in elections. Civil rights groups the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People had challenged the law, but their arguments were not accepted by the majority opinion at the appeals court. In the ruling on an appeal filed by the state government the judges said Ohio is a national leader when it comes to early voting, allowing people to vote early and in person for four weeks. “This is really quite generous,” the ruling said. The ruling said the challenged law does not result in injury under the Constitution or the Voting Rights Act and that despite the changes, “Ohio continues to provide generous, reasonable, and accessible voting options to all Ohioans.” \"],[\"BUCHAREST (Reuters) - Thousands of Romanians were protesting in the capital Bucharest and cities across the country on Sunday against plans by the ruling Social Democrats to overhaul judicial legislation. The plans, initially announced by the justice minister in August and currently in under debate in parliament, could put the judicial system under political control in one of the European Union s most corrupt states.  Thousands of magistrates, centrist President Klaus Iohannis, the European Commission and diplomats have all expressed concern about the proposed legal changes. An estimated 12,000 people were marching towards parliament in Bucharest on Sunday shouting  We don t want to be a nation of thieves .  Thousands more were protesting across the country. The ruling Social Democrat Party has said it aims to approve the judicial overhaul by the end of this parliamentary session. The most contested changes include overhauling a judicial inspection unit, which oversees magistrates  conduct and the way in which chief prosecutors are appointed.   Earlier this year, attempts by the ruling coalition to weaken a crackdown on high-level corruption triggered Romania s largest street protests in decades. Judicial and fiscal changes have dominated the Social Democrats  agenda since coming to power following an election last December. Plans to significantly overhaul the country s taxes have put pressure on Romanian assets. The president and major investors  associations have urged the government to scrap the changes which they have said will throw the economy into upheaval and strain the budget deficit. A major trade union has started the process of calling a general strike and other unions have announced protests set for later this month. The government postponed a meeting to discuss the fiscal changes until Nov. 6. \"],[\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin cast doubt on President Donald Trump’s chances of cutting the corporate tax rate to 15 percent, while Trump met with six senators including three Democrats who set clear conditions for future cooperation with him on taxes. The president is cranking up a publicity campaign to build public support for his general goals of lower and simpler taxes, but no detailed tax plan has been completed or proposed by the White House or the Republicans in control of Congress. Even after months of discussion within the party, basic questions are unanswered, such as whether tax cuts should be designed so they don’t add to the federal deficit and debt, and how deeply business and individual rates should be cut. Mnuchin told a conference in New York hosted by CNBC on Tuesday that Trump, as the president has said for months, would like to cut the corporate income tax rate to 15 percent from 35 percent. Then Mnuchin, a top tax adviser to Trump, said, “I don’t know if we’ll be able to achieve that, given the budget issues, but we’re going to get this down to a very competitive level.” Later in the day, Trump held a dinner at the White House with the six senators. Reflecting his new willingness to engage with the political opposition, three Democrats attended the dinner. In contrast, Republican leaders in Congress have been trying for most of the year to write a tax bill while ignoring the Democrats. Also attending were Vice President Mike Pence, White House economic adviser Gary Cohn and Mnuchin. Pennsylvania Republican Senator Pat Toomey, one of the attendees, said on a conference call later that Trump talked about competitive business taxes, ending taxation of U.S. corporations’ foreign profits, and a middle-class tax cut. After the meal, Trump took some of the senators on a tour of the West Wing. Later, the Democrats expressed an openness to working with Trump on taxes, but stressed certain conditions. West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin said in a statement he would continue to fight for a simpler tax code, but “we must do this without adding to our staggering debt”. North Dakota Democrat Heidi Heitkamp said in a statement the dinner was a “good discussion” and that she told the president any tax package must support working families and farmers. Overhauling the tax code was one of Trump’s main campaign promises in 2016, but he has made little progress toward it. After nearly eight months in office, he has yet to win passage in Congress of any major domestic policy legislation. Besides Manchin and Heitkamp, others at the dinner were Indiana Democrat Joe Donnelly and three Republicans: Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch and fellow tax panel Republicans John Thune and Toomey. Donnelly said in a statement, “Tax reform should include measures to support companies that invest in our workers and penalize companies that ship American jobs to foreign countries.” A major concern on tax cuts is the federal budget deficit. It would balloon if tax rates were cut too deeply without providing offsetting federal spending reductions and closure of tax loopholes, both politically difficult tasks. White House budget chief Mick Mulvaney told Fox News on Tuesday that he hoped tax reform would not be revenue neutral, suggesting he is not overly concerned about the deficit and the national debt, now about $20 trillion. “We need as big and as a dramatic tax reduction and tax reform as we possibly can get,” Mulvaney said. Mnuchin declined to say what business tax rate was achievable. He said he was “incredibly hopeful” a tax plan could be enacted this year, adding it could be retroactive to January. Asked if Trump would hold out for a 15 percent corporate rate, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said: “The president is prepared to push for as low of a rate as we can get.” Republican Paul Ryan, the Republican speaker of the House of Representatives, said last week that “the numbers are hard” to make Trump’s 15-percent corporate tax rate target work. Ryan set his own goal at around 22.5 percent. Trump’s legislative affairs director, Marc Short, said at a Christian Science Monitor event, “We think that what’s best for the American people is a 15-percent corporate rate right now.” Financial markets rallied after Trump’s election victory last November in anticipation of rapid tax cuts, especially for corporations, but those expectations have faded. “The likelihood of passing sweeping corporate reform has diminished,” Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Wealth Management, said in a research note. Democrats, who generally oppose tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, will have negotiating clout in Congress in early December to resist tax changes they oppose, also potentially including a corporate rate cut. Trump may visit as many as 13 states to sell his planned tax cuts to voters in coming weeks, the White House said. The U.S. Senate will begin tax overhaul hearings this week. Republican Senator John Kennedy, a budget committee member, told Reuters he wanted tax plans “with specificity” and expressed frustration at the slow pace of the tax debate. “No more platitudes. Let’s see some meat on the bone,” Kennedy said. “And I’m tired of screwing around. ... The American people are tired of screwing around.” \"],[\"ROME (Reuters) - Italy s defense minister has said there is  some basis  to allegations by two American students that they were raped in Florence by Carabinieri policemen. The two women, aged 19 and 21, have said they were raped in the early hours of Sept. 7 after they were given a lift home from a nightclub in the Italian city by a Carabinieri police patrol. The two policemen have denied the accusations. Italian media say the police were called to the nightclub after a fight broke out on the premises. The students told investigators that two officers had offered to give them a ride back to their residence. The students said they were raped inside the building before they could reach their rooms.  Investigations are still ongoing, but there is some basis regarding the allegations,  Defense Minister Roberta Pinotti told a conference on women s issues late on Friday.  Rape is always a serious matter. But it s of unprecedented seriousness if it is committed by Carabinieri in uniform.  The Carabinieri is a paramilitary police force under the control of the Defense Ministry. It works alongside the national police, which is controlled by the Interior Ministry. Italian media say the two women, who come from the states of Maine and New Jersey, told investigators they had drunk alcohol and smoked cannabis the night of the attack. They said they had been too frightened to scream or shout as the alleged assault took place. Police are carrying out DNA tests to try to verify their accusations, with results expected in the coming days. The case, which has received wide play in the Italian media, comes less than two weeks after a Polish tourist and Peruvian transsexual were brutally raped in the seaside resort of Rimini. Two Moroccans, a Nigerian and a Congolese asylum seeker have been arrested over the attacks, which led to a sharp increase in anti-immigrant sentiment in Italy.  The allegations levelled against the Carabinieri have dismayed the Italian establishment.  If this is true, and I hope that light is shed on the matter as soon as possible, then it would be an act of unheard of gravity,  Tullio Del Sette, the head of the army, told the ANSA news agency.  \"],[\"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU ambassadors have reached an initial agreement to impose more economic sanctions on North Korea, going beyond the latest round of UN measures, officials and diplomats said on Thursday.   Today the PSC (EU member states  ambassadors) agreed on a package of new autonomous measures,  an EU official said. An EU diplomat said around eight new North Korean officials were likely to be added to the EU sanctions list. The decision is likely to be adopted by EU foreign ministers at their next regular meeting on Oct. 16. \"],[\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a moderate Republican from South Florida who has been critical of President Donald Trump, plans to retire when her term is up next year, according to an interview she gave on Sunday to the Miami Herald. The decision by Ros-Lehtinen not to seek re-election could give Democrats a chance to pick up a seat in the 2018 congressional election. Her district has increasingly leaned Democratic, and Democrat Hillary Clinton, Trump’s opponent, won it by 20 percentage points in the 2016 presidential election. Ros-Lehtinen, 64, declined to endorse Trump during the White House race and differed with him on issues such as immigration. She balked at supporting the proposed Obamacare replacement legislation that the president backed. Ros-Lehtinen, who was born in Havana, became the first Cuban-American and the first Hispanic woman elected to Congress in 1989.  The veteran Republican congresswoman had fended off a challenge in 2016 from Democrat Scott Fuhrman. Fuhrman has said he plans to run again for the seat in 2018, when all of the members of the House of Representatives and one-third of the U.S. Senate will face re-election. Trump’s Republicans currently control both the House and Senate. After the Miami Herald article was published, Fuhrman tweeted that he wished Ros-Lehtinen “all the best in retirement” and thanked her for “decades of public service” to the community. Ros-Lehtinen told the newspaper that her decision was motivated by a desire to seek new challenges in her life and did not stem from concern that she would not be re-elected. “There was no epiphany,” she said. “There was no moment, nothing that has happened that I’ve said, ‘I’ve got to move on.’” The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the campaign arm for Democrats in the House of Representatives, said in a statement that Ros-Lehtinen’s plans to retire were a recognition that she was vulnerable. It is “all but guaranteed” that the seat will go to a Democrat when she leaves, the committee said. \"],[\"PARIS (Reuters) - France on Friday called on Iraq s central government to show restraint after taking control of the last district in the oil-rich province of Kirkuk and said Baghdad should take the rights of Kurds fully into account.  Iraqi forces are seeking to reestablish Baghdad s authority over territory which the Kurdish forces occupied outside the official boundaries of their autonomous region, mostly seized since 2014 in the course of the war on Islamic State militants. [L8N1MV1K2]  We ask the federal government to show restraint and fully respect the rights of the Kurds,  foreign ministry spokeswoman Agnes Romatet-Espagne told reporters.  Tens of thousands of Kurds have fled Kirkuk and Tuz to the two main cities of the Kurdish autonomous region, Erbil and Sulaimaniya, according to Kurdish officials. The United Nations expressed concern on Thursday at reports of forced displacement and destruction of Kurdish homes and businesses, mainly in Tuz. Romatet-Espagne said the Kurds also needed to accept a dialogue with Baghdad within the framework of the constitution.  \"],[\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson last month tightened his control over the State Department by taking back powers previously held by the top career foreign service officer, an action critics said would delay major decisions and marginalize career diplomats. The move retracted broad decision-making authority granted to the agency’s third-highest ranking official, the undersecretary for political affairs, by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Most of those powers will be reserved instead for Tillerson and his deputy. Tillerson is broadly reviewing how authority is delegated, a State Department official said, which will “result in a streamlining of delegations, which will promote greater transparency, clarity and effectiveness in decision-making within the Department.”  On July 17, Tillerson reversed Clinton’s 2009 decision to empower the undersecretary for political affairs, currently career diplomat Thomas Shannon, with “all authorities and functions vested in the Secretary of State.” Former officials said Clinton’s delegation of authority was helpful in allowing decisions to be made quickly when she or her deputy were traveling abroad. “Everyone travels all of the time if you’re doing your job right as a diplomat,” said a former State Department official who served during the Obama administration and requested anonymity. “There has to be some delegation of authority, or the work simply doesn’t get done.” Tillerson’s decision came as most of the high-level positions at the State Department are either empty or filled by career officials in an “acting” capacity. The secretary has said he wants to be cautious about hiring while he is conducting a review of the State Department’s organization. On Tuesday, Tillerson acknowledged to reporters that “I have a lot of open slots,” but said he had been able to accomplish a great deal “because there are remarkable, talented professional foreign service officers in this building.” But the slow pace of appointments has logjammed decision-making and resulted in a rank-and-file bureaucracy disconnected from top officials, diplomats and some members of Congress said.  “We don’t know what the policies are, and the diplomats don’t know what the policies are,” Senator Ben Cardin, the senior Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said on Tuesday. The second authority Tillerson took back from the undersecretary for political affairs in July was approval of State Department reports to Congress, which will now sit with the Office of Policy Planning, an internal State Department body usually headed by a political appointee. Unlike other senior officials, the office director and staff do not need Senate confirmation. The State Department is required by law to produce hundreds of reports for Congress each year, including on acts of terrorism, human rights conditions in different countries, countries’ narcotics control strategies, the state of religious freedom around the world, and human trafficking. Typically, such reports are prepared by offices and embassies with expertise in the relevant issue, and are reviewed by the State Department’s Bureau of Legislative Affairs and top aides to the secretary of state before being sent to Congress. Three former officials said giving the policy planning staff final sign-off on the reports could inject political considerations into their preparation. The undersecretary for political affairs is typically a career foreign service officer, and oversees seven regional bureaus. The move represents a “power grab” by the policy planning body, said Eliot Cohen, who served as State Department counselor during former President George W. Bush’s administration. “You need a strong undersecretary for political affairs,” Cohen said. “You can’t run the State Department with a tiny office ... you need to go out and establish good working relationships with the professionals of the department.” \"],[\"CLEVELAND (Reuters) - The mayor of Youngstown, Ohio, on Friday accepted a plea agreement on multiple political corruption charges involving a property deal made while he was a county commissioner in the area, the state’s Attorney General’s office said. Mayor John McNally, a Democrat, pleaded guilty to four misdemeanor counts including unlawful influence of a public official, said Daniel Tierney, spokesman for Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine. Youngstown is a city of 67,000 people about 65 miles southeast of Cleveland. The plea allows McNally, who was elected mayor in 2014, to stay in office. The conspiracy, bribery and perjury charges stem from his nine years as Mahoning County commissioner starting in 2005 until he was elected mayor.  Under Ohio law, a felony conviction bars anyone from holding most public offices for seven years. Prosecutors said McNally was part of a scheme to inflate the cost of moving the Mahoning County jobs and family services office from a rental property to benefit a local business owner.  McNally had previously been indicted on similar charges in 2010. The charges were dismissed, but the judge ruled they could be filed again at a later date. Former Mahoning County auditor Michael Sciortino and Youngstown attorney Martin Yavorcik along with McNally were part of an 83-count indictment brought in 2014 by the Ohio Attorney General’s office alleging a pattern of corruption.  Sciortino, also a Democrat, pleaded guilty to one felony count and two misdemeanor charges including receiving or soliciting improper compensation.  Sentencing for McNally and Sciortino is scheduled for March 28 in Cuyahoga County courthouse, in downtown Cleveland. McNally faces a maximum 18 months in prison, Sciortino faces a maximum of 2-1\\u002f2 years, Tierney said. In addition to the plea in a Cuyahoga County court, Sciortino agreed to plead guilty to one felony and one misdemeanor in Mahoning County court at a later date, Tierney said.  Prosecutors said Sciortino is accused of tampering with records to inflate the cost of moving the county jobs office.  Yavorcik accepted political contributions as a candidate for prosecutor in exchange for a promise to stop investigations into wrongdoing by county officials, according to the indictment. His trial is scheduled for March 14 in Cuyahoga County. \"],[\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Legislation to provide $81 billion in new disaster aid for U.S. states, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands was put on hold by the Senate on Thursday amid attacks from both Republicans and Democrats. The Republican-controlled House of Representatives passed the legislation earlier on Thursday to help recovery efforts stemming from hurricanes and wildfires. But the Senate put off a vote until at least January, according to some lawmakers and aides, after Democrats complained Puerto Rico was not getting enough help and some fiscal hawks fretted about the overall cost. \"],[\"HAVANA (Reuters) - The man forecast to replace Cuban President Raul Castro early next year rejected U.S. demands that the Communist-run country change its political and economic system. In a Sunday speech blasting U.S. pressure on the Venezuelan government and what he termed an effort to discredit the Cuban tourism industry, First Vice President Miguel Diaz-Canel said these and other recent events in the region proved  imperialism can never be trusted, not even a tiny bit, never.   Diaz-Canel was quoting Ernesto Che Guevara at a ceremony commemorating the 50th anniversary of the death of the revolutionary who had helped lead a Bolivian uprising modeled after Cuba s.  Cuba will not make concessions to its sovereignty and independence, nor negotiate its principles or accept the imposition of conditions,  Diaz-Canel said, apparently responding to U.S. President Donald Trump s recent statement at the United Nations that sanctions would not be lifted until the Caribbean island restores democracy and capitalism.  The changes needed in Cuba will solely be carried out by the Cuban people,  Diaz-Canel said. Castro, 86, has announced he will step down as president in February. Experts expect Diaz-Canel, 57, to become the first head of state since the early 1960s without Castro as a last name. There are no direct elections in Cuba for national office. Trump said in June that he would once more tighten sanctions on Cuba and seek a better deal from the country than the gradual detente achieved by predecessor Barack Obama. The Trump administration has drastically reduced staffing at its embassy in Cuba and ordered a reciprocal reduction of Cuban diplomats in Washington due to a series of alleged  health attacks  on U.S. personnel in Havana. The United States has not blamed Cuba for the still unsolved incidents but holds it responsible for not protecting its personnel. The administration has also issued a travel warning stating U.S. citizens might be targeted.  Some unnamed officials are propagating unusual nonsense without any evidence, with the perverse aim of discrediting the impeccable reputation of our country as a safe destination for foreign visitors, including from the United States,  Diaz-Canel said. \"],[\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said on Tuesday that President Donald Trump’s tweeted attack on Senator Kirsten Gillibrand was “nasty,” but Schumer did not join Gillibrand’s call for Trump to resign the presidency over sexual misconduct accusations. “That tweet was nasty, unbecoming of a president,” Schumer told reporters. Gillibrand, a New York Democrat, on Monday called for Trump to resign over sexual misconduct allegations. More than a dozen women have accused Trump of unwanted sexual advances, which he has denied. Trump lambasted Gillibrand on Twitter on Tuesday writing, “Lightweight Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, a total flunky for Chuck Schumer and someone who would come to my office ‘begging’ for campaign contributions not so long ago (and would do anything for them), is now in the ring fighting against Trump.”  \"],[\"LIMA (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack said Tuesday that farm officials want to lay the groundwork so American agricultural exporters can seize new opportunities in Cuba if the trade embargo on the country is lifted. The normalization of trade relations would allow U.S. farmers to use lower transportation costs to edge in on the European Union’s food exports to Cuba, Vilsack said. President Barack Obama has been using his executive powers to chip away at the half-century-old trade embargo, imposed on the communist-ruled nation in 1960, but cannot lift it without approval from Congress that is unlikely under current Republican leadership. “There are still preliminary steps that can be taken to prepare for that day,” Vilsack said in an interview in Peru. “When it happens, the United States will be in a very good position to reclaim a portion of the market we’ve lost.” Vilsack cited soybeans, rice, poultry and biofuels as new markets U.S. farmers could tap in Cuba, which in turn could sell organic products to its former Cold War foe. The Obama administration is asking Congress for $1.5 million for on-the-ground studies into challenges to agricultural trade in Cuba, from pests to a diplomatic void left by decades of hostile relations. “We have not had people on the ground,” Vilsack said. “We need to develop relationships with the people in Cuba so we know who to do business with and who actually makes the deals.” Vilsack, who visited Cuba last month, said state agricultural commissioners and secretaries have also been traveling to the island on trade missions. “They have been down to Cuba and they have come back with small contracts for commodities,” Vilsack said. Vilsack said farmers were the most excited about the reopening of relations with Cuba, once a global sugarcane powerhouse. The U.S. would aim to meet 50 percent of Cuba’s food and agricultural needs if trade resumes fully, up from less than 15 percent now, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said in a statement to Reuters after the interview. Vilsack also said he was optimistic Obama would persuade Congress to pass the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal before the end of his term, despite the recent surge in anti-trade rhetoric in presidential campaigns. “The president is very committed to getting it done and he intends to work as long and hard as he needs to ultimately get it passed,” Vilsack said. \"],[\"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain s ambassador to Myanmar was forced to interrupt Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson earlier this year as he tried to recite a nostalgic colonial poem by Rudyard Kipling in public during a visit to the country s most famous Buddhist site. Johnson, who helped lead the Leave campaign in the 2016 Brexit referendum, is caught on camera starting to recite Kipling s poem, Mandalay, after striking a bell at the Shwedagon pagoda in Yangon.   The temple bells they say,  Johnson says in television footage by Channel 4.  Come you back, you British soldier.  As Johnson continues with his recitation of the poem which  celebrates a soldier s love affair with a local woman during Britain s colonial rule of what was then known as Burma, the ambassador tenses.  You re on mic. Probably not a good idea,  British ambassador Andrew Patrick said.  What, The Road to Mandalay?  Johnson asked.  No. Not appropriate,  the ambassador said.  Johnson replied  good stuff  and then started to take photographs of the scene with his telephone camera. A spokeswoman for the Foreign Office declined to comment.  Prime Minister Theresa May s appointment of Johnson, who in the run-up to Britain s referendum on EU membership compared the goals of the European Union to those of Adolf Hitler and Napoleon, caused consternation in European capitals. In recent weeks, Johnson has attempted to set out his vision of Britain outside the European Union. \"],[\"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin signed into law on Saturday new measures allowing authorities to list foreign media outlets as  foreign agents  in response to what Moscow says is unacceptable U.S. pressure on Russian media. The new law has been rushed through both Russian houses of parliament in the last two weeks. It will now allow Moscow to force foreign media to brand news they provide to Russians as the work of  foreign agents  and to disclose their funding sources. A copy of the law was published on the Russian government s online legislation database on Saturday, saying it entered into force from the day of its publication. Russia s move against U.S. media is part of the fallout from allegations that Russia interfered in last year s U.S. presidential election in favor of Donald Trump. U.S. intelligence officials have accused the Kremlin of using Russian media organizations it finances to influence U.S. voters, and Washington has since required Russian state broadcaster RT to register a U.S.-based affiliate company as a  foreign agent . The Kremlin has repeatedly denied meddling in the election and said the restrictions on Russian broadcasters in the United States are an attack on free speech.  The Russian Justice Ministry last week published a list of nine U.S.-backed news outlets that it said could be affected by the changes. It said it had written to the U.S. government-sponsored Voice of America (VOA) and Radio Free Europe\\u002fRadio Liberty (RFE\\u002fRL), along with seven separate Russian or local-language news outlets run by RFE\\u002fRL. \"],[\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican Senator Thad Cochran has delayed his return to Washington following a medical procedure, his office said on Monday, possibly complicating passage of a budget blueprint that is needed to push through the Republicans’ plan for tax reform. “After a day of monitoring his condition, and on the advice of his physicians and other health care professionals, Senator Cochran has postponed his return to Washington,” said Brad White, chief of staff for the Mississippi legislator. “The senator has expressed his intention to return to the Senate when his health permits, and to fulfill his commitment and duties to the people of his state,” White said in a statement. The Senate is trying this week to pass a partisan budget blueprint that would help guide federal spending. Republicans hold a 52-48 majority in the Senate. If Cochran is not present for votes, Republicans could afford to lose no more than one other vote, assuming all 46 Democrats and two independents oppose the budget measure. In addition to sketching out overall spending levels for this year and beyond, Republicans want to use the “budget resolution” to pave the way for the party later this year or next year to pass a major tax-cut bill without any Democratic support. Cochran, the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, helps oversee the legislation that funds most government programs and activities. In early December, Congress must extend those funds or risk partial government shutdowns.

Security Council censure over the violence that has forced an exodus of nearly 150,000 Rohingya Muslims to Bangladesh in less than two weeks. Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi blamed  terrorists  for  a huge iceberg of misinformation  on the strife in the northwestern state of Rakhine but, in a statement, she made no mention of the Rohingya who have fled. Suu Kyi has come under increasing pressure from countries with Muslim populations, including Indonesia, where thousands led by Islamist groups rallied in Jakarta on Wednesday to demand that diplomatic ties with Buddhist-majority Myanmar be cut. In a rare letter to the U.N. Security Council, Secretary-General Antonio Guterres expressed concern the violence could spiral into a  humanitarian catastrophe .  He warned on Tuesday that there was a risk of ethnic cleansing in Myanmar that could destabilize the region. Myanmar National Security Adviser Thaung Tun said Myanmar was counting on China and Russia, both permanent members of the Security Council, to block a U.N. resolution on the crisis.  We are negotiating with some friendly countries not to take it to the Security Council,  he told a news conference.  China is our friend and we have a similar friendly relationship with Russia, so it will not be possible for that issue to go forward.  Russia s U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said he believed the 15-member Security Council had sent a signal, by meeting behind closed doors on the issue a week ago, that it would like to see the situation calm down.   We called for restraint,  he told reporters on Tuesday.  The Security Council for the time being did what it could do.  The U.S. State Department said Washington was  deeply concerned by sustained reports of significant violence and the impact on civilian populations, including the Rohingya community.  These reports include allegations of violence conducted by security forces and civilians, as well as additional attacks by ARSA,  a spokesman said, referring to Arakan Rohingya Solidarity Organization insurgents.  The spokesman said the United States had discussed the issue with Myanmar  at the highest levels  and was also in touch with its neighbors and other international partners.  We welcome indications that the government is committed to providing access to humanitarian aid via the Red Cross, and we look forward to learning further details.  he added.  Reuters reporters in Bangladesh s Cox s Bazar region have witnessed boatloads of exhausted Rohingya arriving near the border village of Shamlapur. According to the latest estimates from U.N. workers operating there, arrivals in 12 days stood at 146,000. This brought to 233,000 the total number of Rohingya who have sought refuge in Bangladesh since last October. New arrivals told authorities that three boats carrying a total of more than 100 people capsized in early on Wednesday. Coastguard Commander M.S. Kabir said six bodies, including three children, had washed ashore. The surge of refugees, many sick or wounded, has strained the resources of aid agencies and communities helping hundreds of thousands from previous violence in Myanmar. Many have no shelter, and aid agencies are racing to provide water, sanitation and food.  People have come with virtually nothing so there has to be food,  a U.N. source working there said.  So this is now a huge concern   where is this food coming from for at least the elderly, the children, the women who have come over without their husbands?  Suu Kyi spoke by telephone on Tuesday with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, who has pressed world leaders to do more to help a population of roughly 1.1 million he says are facing genocide. In a statement issued by her office on Facebook, Suu Kyi said the government had  already started defending all the people in Rakhine in the best way possible  and warned against misinformation that could mar relations with other countries. She referred to images on Twitter of killings posted by Turkey s deputy prime minister that he later deleted because they were not from Myanmar.  She said that kind of fake information which was inflicted on the deputy prime minister was simply the tip of a huge iceberg of misinformation calculated to create a lot of problems between different countries and with the aim of promoting the interests of the terrorists,  her office said in the statement. Suu Kyi on Wednesday met Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who said he shared Myanmar s concern about  extremist violence  in Rakhine state. Modi s government has taken a strong stance on an influx into India of some 40,000 Rohingya from Myanmar over the years, vowing last month to deport them all. The latest violence began when Rohingya insurgents attacked dozens of police posts and an army base. The ensuing clashes and a military counter-offensive killed at least 400 people and triggered the exodus of villagers to Bangladesh. Suu Kyi has been accused by Western critics of not speaking out for the minority that has long complained of persecution, and some have called for the Nobel Peace Prize she won in 1991 as a champion of democracy to be revoked. Myanmar says its security forces are fighting a legitimate campaign against  terrorists  it blames for a string of attacks on police posts and for burning homes and civilian deaths. It says 26,747 non-Muslims have been displaced. Fleeing Rohingya and rights monitors say the Myanmar army is  conducting a campaign of arson and killings to force them from their homes. Two Bangladesh government sources said Myanmar had been laying landmines across a section of its border for the past three days, possibly to prevent the return of fleeing Rohingya. Bangladesh will formally lodge a protest on Wednesday against the laying of land mines so close to the border, said the sources who had direct knowledge of the situation but asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter.  A Myanmar military source said landmines were laid along the border in the 1990s to prevent trespassing and the military had since tried to remove them, but none had been planted recently. \"],[\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said he “will absolutely do safe zones in Syria” to protect people fleeing violence there. “I’ll absolutely do safe zones in Syria for the people,” Trump said in an interview with ABC News broadcast on Wednesday. “I think that Europe has made a tremendous mistake by allowing these millions of people to go into Germany and various other countries,” he said. \"],[\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - As President Donald Trump bowed his head in the Oval Office earlier this month, Texas Southern Baptist Pastor Robert Jeffress and other U.S. religious leaders laid their hands on Trump’s back and prayed for Hurricane Harvey’s victims. With TV cameras and reporters watching, the scene was a powerful reminder of one of Trump’s most reliable and improbable political assets - his close ties with conservative Christians. A new Reuters\\u002fIpsos poll shows, however, that Trump’s popularity among white evangelicals has weakened, suggesting his grassroots support may not be as unconditional as religious leaders’ public displays of allegiance would suggest.  That may pose a problem for Trump and his allies as the 2018 midterm congressional election season nears. Trump’s strong links to conservative Christians played a key part in his stunning victory in the 2016 presidential election. Though disenchanted evangelicals were unlikely to switch their votes to Democrats, they could stay home next year when U.S. voters elect senators and representatives.    “When your base is starting to even slowly move away from you, that should be a sign of concern,” said Justin Vaughn, director of the Center for Idaho History and Politics at Boise State University in Idaho, a state Trump won handily last year. In a country that is more religious than most other western democracies and where a president’s spiritual life is closely examined, the twice-divorced New York billionaire socialite, who has attended church just twice since his Jan. 20 inauguration, is an unlikely torchbearer for conservative Christians.  He has labored to build and preserve this unlikely alliance, embracing social issues, such as commitment to anti-abortion and religious liberty policies, and picking staunch conservative Neil Gorsuch, for the Supreme Court. Trump also mentions God far more often in public remarks than his two predecessors, a Reuters review showed.(Graphic: tmsnrt.rs\\u002f2y3HxbV) But data from the nationwide online Reuters\\u002fIpsos poll conducted from Jan. 22 to Aug. 25 suggest Trump has been unable to prevent his evangelical support from sliding in line with his overall ratings. The majority of those polled last month who described themselves as both “white” and a “born-again or evangelical Christian” said they approved of Trump, but considerably fewer than when he took office almost eight months ago. The White House did not respond to requests for comment on the poll. During a four-week period in August, 62 percent of white evangelicals said they approved of Trump, while 33 percent disapproved of the president and 5 percent said they had “mixed feelings.” That is a drop from the first four weeks of Trump’s presidency, from late January to mid February, when 73 percent of white evangelicals said they approved of his performance while 23 percent disapproved and 5 percent had mixed feelings. The poll was divided into eight four-week periods, with each including about 2,000 people and a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of about 2 percentage points.    The declines are broadly in line with those recorded among all adult Americans. In interviews, 10 of the surveyed conservative Christians said they were not concerned about Trump’s religion. Rather, they questioned whether he was doing enough to help average Americans and the frequent chaos in the White House. “We can’t go a week without someone leaving his administration. There is no stability in our government,” said  Robert Waldram, a 52-year-old Baptist churchgoer from Williamsburg, Virginia, in a telephone interview. He said he voted for Trump as a better option than Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. But Waldram said he was tired of Trump’s “childlike tantrums on Twitter.” In his first 200 days in office, Trump mentioned God about 100 times in public remarks, excluding the standard “God bless America” that presidents routinely end speeches with, something his ardent supporters welcome as readiness to eschew political correctness.  By this point in their presidencies, Democrat Barack Obama had mentioned God 43 times, while Republican George W. Bush had referred to God in 60 instances. Jeffress, one of the first prominent evangelical pastors to back Trump for president, said his God talk was apolitical. “I understand that cynical people would say this is just for political expediency, but ... I believe this comes out of some deep beliefs that he has personally,” Jeffress said. Trump, who describes himself as Presbyterian, was not known to be an avid churchgoer before becoming president and critics have said his blunders on basic biblical knowledge, harsh attacks on political adversaries, and his demeaning comments about women clash with Christian principles. “He, himself, doesn’t have the most sterling track record in terms of either church attendance or professed or displayed knowledge of scripture,” Gary Scott Smith, a historian and author of “Religion in the Oval Office: The Religious Lives of American Presidents,” said of Trump. The pastors involved with Trump’s evangelical advisory board describe him, though, as very inquisitive about faith and more thoughtful on religion than he might appear in public and conservative pastors have continued to support him through various firestorms.  Evangelicals have had “unprecedented” White House access in this administration, said Richard Land, a board member and president of the Southern Evangelical Seminary, a Christian college. After Trump’s response to violence between white nationalists and left-wing protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia, led to two of his business advisory councils disbanding, there were questions about the evangelical board’s future.  Brooklyn, New York, megachurch pastor A.R. Bernard resigned, but others remained, saying it was their job to provide advice and counsel to Trump, even when they disagree with him, and to press the president on Christian issues. Johnnie Moore, a board member and former official at Liberty University, a religious school, said: “We have a deep personal relationship with him ... He has prioritized issues that are important to us and we appreciate that.” \"],[\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate voted overwhelmingly on Wednesday to advance a bill that would impose new sanctions on Iran, the same day at least 12 people were killed in attacks in Tehran, as lawmakers planned to add a package of sanctions on Russia to the measure. The vote was 92-7 on a procedural motion to end debate on the Iran sanctions bill, clearing the way for a vote later on passage of the legislation. Chuck Schumer, the top Senate Democrat, said most members of his party supported the Iran bill, but that they would only agree to let it go ahead because they expected it would be amended to include “a strong package” of new sanctions on Russia as well. Many lawmakers have been clamoring for new sanctions on Russia over its alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. election, annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea region and support for Syria’s government in that country’s six-year-long civil war. Schumer said he was negotiating with the Senate’s Republican leaders on the Russia sanctions. Some senators had urged that Wednesday’s procedural vote be delayed, arguing that the timing was inappropriate because of the attacks in Iran. “The country has just suffered from two significant terrorist attacks after electing a moderate government with 57 percent of the vote — we need to give Iran the opportunity to recover and set a new course,” Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein said in a statement. A senior Senate aide said the Iran sanctions measure could come up for a vote as soon as next week. The legislation would impose new sanctions on Iran over its ballistic missile development, arms transfers, support for Islamist militant groups and human rights violations. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee passed it 18-3 last month. To become law, the measure would also have to pass the Republican-led House of Representatives and be signed by President Donald Trump. \"],[\"ANKARA (Reuters) - Iran said on Monday that it does not interfere in Lebanon and that comments on Sunday by Saad al-Hariri, who resigned as Lebanese prime minister nine days ago, gave hope he would soon return to his country, state TV reported. The resignation of the Saudi-allied Hariri s and its aftermath have put Lebanon back to the forefront of the conflict between Shi ite-led Iran and its regional Sunni rival Saudi Arabia.  Riyadh blames Lebanon s Iran-backed Hezbollah for the resignation, accusing it of hijacking Lebanese politics. Tehran has accused Riyadh and its allies of trying to stoke tension in the Middle East. In a television interview on Sunday, Hariri said he would return to Lebanon within days and held out the possibility he could rescind his resignation if Hezbollah agreed to stay out of regional conflicts such as Yemen. The comments were his first in public since he quit from Riyadh on Nov. 4.   Hariri s remarks on Sunday gave small hope of the possibility of his return to Lebanon...Iran does not interfere in Lebanon s affairs,  Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi was quoted as saying by state TV.  Lebanese President Michel Aoun refused to accept Hariri s resignation unless he tendered it in person in Lebanon. \"],[\"BERLIN (Reuters) - Following Donald Trump s decision to decertify the Iran nuclear deal this month, shaken European capitals are asking themselves what the U.S. president will do next. Diplomats have sketched scenarios they fear could plunge transatlantic relations into crisis: a trade war, military conflict over North Korea, or the collapse of a Cold War-era arms treaty. They wonder if their post-war alliance can survive if any of them come true. Since Trump took office nine months ago, governments in Berlin, Paris and London have wavered between alarm at his rhetoric and a shaky sense that his worst instincts can be contained by the  grown ups  in his cabinet and pressure from allies. But the Iran decision, taken despite personal appeals from France s Emmanuel Macron, Germany s Angela Merkel and Britain s Theresa May, has changed the calculus in Europe, according to diplomats, politicians and analysts. No longer is there an underlying confidence that Europe can muddle through three more years of Trump without fear of major, and possibly lasting, disruptions to the relationship. Nor is there faith that Trump, when the stakes are high, will listen to what his advisers and partners tell him. The anxiety is especially acute in Germany, whose own identity is anchored in its relationship with the United States and whose reliance on Washington, particularly in defense and security matters, runs deeper than that of France or Britain.  There is a sense of desperation in Berlin, a sense that Trump does not know what is at stake, that he doesn t understand the historical factors that are at play here,  said Wolfgang Ischinger, a former German ambassador to Washington and chairman of the Munich Security Conference.  The transatlantic relationship is all about trust. In that sense, the Iran decision takes us to a new level. It is a breach of trust,  he said. Trump s decision to decertify the Iran deal will not necessarily kill it. That depends on Congress, which must now decide to impose new sanctions against Tehran. But the consensus in Europe is that a landmark diplomatic achievement has been seriously undermined.  Merkel alluded to the breakdown in trust back in May, when she said Europe might not be able to rely on the United States and must take its fate into its own hands. That came after a contentious G7 meeting in Sicily at which Trump ignored pleas from allies to stick with another multilateral agreement, the Paris climate accord. Since then Merkel, focused on an election and efforts to form a coalition, has said little about the transatlantic relationship or Trump. Macron meanwhile, has done his best to charm the American president, inviting him to Paris for Bastille Day celebrations and meeting him again at the United Nations last month.  I don t despair of making him change his mind,  Macron said in New York of Trump s stances on climate and Iran. In private however, European officials say they are worried that Trump s rejection of the Iran deal could be a harbinger of other disruptive salvos from Washington. One senior European diplomat said the next conflict would likely be over trade, describing Trump s attempt to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)   and his threats to abandon it   as a  litmus test . European firms, especially German carmakers who produce in Mexico and export to the United States, could be hit hard by a breakdown of NAFTA. There are also fears that Trump could carry out a threat to introduce steel import tariffs, which would hit European exporters as well as the Chinese.  So far there has been a lot of bark and no bite from Trump on trade, but that doesn t mean it will stay that way,  said the European diplomat.  We have to be prepared for real protectionist measures. Any steps that penalize European firms directly or indirectly would create a downward spiral.  ANTI-AMERICANISM North Korea is another area of concern. Thorsten Benner, director of the Global Public Policy Institute in Berlin, believes the reaction in Europe to a military conflict on the Korean peninsula could be  as messy as the Iraq war . The European public could view Washington as the aggressor in such a conflict. This could fuel anti-American sentiment, making it difficult for European leaders to stand with Trump and emboldening voices that are already calling for a break from Washington   no matter how unrealistic that looks in practice.  We have to wake up to the fact that we may be dealing with Trump for some time, and that there may not be a correction when he leaves,  one German diplomat told Reuters.  It hasn t dawned on people here that this is existential and you have to react.  Concerns about such sentiments led a group of a dozen Germany-based foreign policy experts to issue a manifesto this month, entitled  In Spite of It All, America , which warned Berlin against turning its back on Washington because of Trump. Former ambassador Ischinger shares that view. But he too is concerned the relationship could deteriorate further. One of his biggest fears is a collapse of the INF Treaty, a nuclear arms reduction pact signed by President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in 1987. Washington and Moscow accuse each other of violating the treaty and Gorbachev himself warned this month that it was in peril. Should the INF unravel, Ischinger believes the divisive 1980s debate about deploying nuclear weapons in Europe could resurface with devastating consequences for transatlantic ties.  All hell could break loose, politically speaking,  he said. For generations of Germans, Ischinger says, the symbol of the transatlantic alliance has been U.S. presidents   from John F. Kennedy to Reagan, and from Bill Clinton to Barack Obama.  I can no longer tell my children that they are part of this alliance with Trump as president,  he said.  It is rather sad. I don t know how the loss of this symbol can be replaced.  \"],[\"(Reuters) - Burlington Stores Inc joined other retailers, including Nordstrom Inc, in deciding not to sell products of Ivanka Trump’s brand online, news website Business Insider reported. Burlington will no longer stock the brand’s accessories and clothing online, according to the report, but it was unclear if the off-price retailer would sell the products in its stores.  Burlington and Ivanka Trump’s representatives were not immediately available for comment. Earlier this month, Nordstrom said it would stop carrying Ivanka Trump’s apparel because of falling sales, pushing President Donald Trump to defend his daughter on Twitter by saying she was treated “unfairly” by the retailer. Neiman Marcus [NMRCUS.UL] has also said it would not sell Ivanka Trump’s jewelry line while TJX Cos Inc told its employees to dump any signs related to the brand. HSN Inc has stopped selling Trump Home products, but still sells Trump presidential memorabilia. Sears Holdings and its unit, Kmart, had also removed 31 Trump Home items from their online product offerings to focus on more profitable items this month. \"],[\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Several U.S. states and immigrant advocacy groups vowed on Tuesday to fight President Donald Trump’s decision to end a program that protects people brought illegally to the United States as children from deportation. But legal experts said the challenges will face an uphill battle. Democratic state attorneys general in California, New York, Washington and Massachusetts said they will sue to defend the Obama-era policy known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, and the immigrants known as Dreamers. “We are going to court to defend DACA and to fight for these Dreamers,” said Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healy. The states have not said what their legal claims will be.     The Trump administration on Tuesday announced it would phase out the program but urged Congress to enact immigration reform if it wants to protect DACA recipients. [nL2N1LM0HT] Whatever lawsuit the Democratic states file, winning will not be easy, said Jonathan Adler, a law professor at Case Western Reserve University College of Law. “DACA did not create any legally enforceable rights, and certainly did not create any right to indefinite presence in the country,” he said. One immigrant group, the National Immigration Law Center, has already filed court papers seeking to block the Trump administration’s action by amending an existing lawsuit pending in New York. The case was filed last year on behalf of DACA recipient Martin Batalla Vidal, an immigrant from Mexico who came to the United States when he was 7. It originally contested a ruling enjoining a program of former President Barack Obama that offered protection to undocumented parents of U.S. citizen children.  In the new filing, Vidal’s lawyers outlined a two-prong challenge to Trump’s DACA action. One claim was that the move violated the federal Administrative Procedure Act, a law requiring government agencies to follow set processes when making major policy changes. Batalla Vidal’s lawyers said Trump’s announcement was an “abrupt policy shift” affecting nearly 800,000 program participants who had assumed the protections would remain in place.  Trump promised during his presidential campaign to dismantle DACA but since taking office in January has taken a softer tone. The lawyers noted that he told DACA recipients he would “take care” of them. The filing also asserts that the new policy is discriminatory and was “substantially motivated by the animus of the president and his administration toward Latinos and Mexicans.”  Stephen Yale-Loehr, an immigration law professor at Cornell Law School, said any litigation against Trump’s action will face multiple obstacles. Among them is the fact that courts are “generally more deferential to immigration actions by the executive branch than in other areas, because immigration touches on sovereignty and national security,” he added. \"],[\"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa s political parties should be required to disclose the source of their funding, a court ruled on Wednesday, potentially exposing the patronage networks that have influenced power in the two decades since apartheid. The ruling by the Western Cape High Court, which orders parliament to amend access-to-information laws, comes against opposition from some parties who fear disclosure could jeopardize funding. Judge Yasmin Meer said in court papers that disclosure of the private funding of political parties and independent candidates was required for the effective exercise of the right to vote in elections and to make political choices. She instructed parliament to amend the Promotion of Access to Information Act (PAIA) accordingly. The application challenging the constitutionality of PAIA, which exempted party funding, was brought by non-profit organization My Vote Counts (MVC), which welcomed the judgment.  This means that there must be a legislative mechanism that allows access to this information,  MVC said in a statement.  However there are concerns this could impact on funding and potentially expose parties to embarrassment, an analyst said.   There s a potential of significant embarrassment. I think you going to find some people who appear to be strongly aligned to one party are actually giving money to another,  said political analyst at NKC Research Gary van Staden. Main opposition party the Democratic Alliance, which was among the responding political parties, said some of its donors would not like to be made public for fear of discrimination.  The ruling African National Congress party, which was also among the respondents, was not immediately available for comment. \"],[\"BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand s military government on Tuesday said it will not yet lift a ban on political activity, despite a general election scheduled for next year and growing pressure from political parties to lift it. The ban on political party gatherings has been in place since the military seized power in a 2014 coup but there have been growing calls from all political groups to end the ban. Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha cited persistent political divisions and mud-slinging as reasons why the ban should stay.  We will not lift the ban today but don t be frustrated,  Prayuth told reporters after a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday.  Today we are still speaking evil. You must stop this so that everyone is at ease,  Prayuth said, urging all sides to put aside their differences. Earlier this month, Prayuth said Thailand would hold a general election in November 2018 - the news was largely welcomed by investors in Southeast Asia s second-biggest economy. There has been little opposition to junta rule since 2014, partly because authorities have arrested and jailed dozens of critics. The government had said that parties needed to wait until after the funeral of Thailand s late King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who was cremated last week, for a decision on when normal political life will resume. Tensions have been festering in Thailand since 2006 when a coup removed then-Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra. Since then, the country has witnessed bouts of unrest including deadly street protests. Thailand is divided broadly between those who align themselves with Thaksin and his sister, former Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra, whose government was removed in the 2014 coup, and the elite in the capital Bangkok. Thaksin is credited by some as being the first Thai prime minister to tap into the potential of the rural electorate. But he made many enemies among the elite who accuse him of corruption - which he denies. Both Thaksin and Yingluck live abroad. Yingluck fled Thailand in August ahead of a verdict against her in a negligence trial for which she was later found guilty and sentenced to five years in prison. Thaksin fled to avoid a 2008 jail corruption sentence. Politicians from major parties were upset about the decision not to lift the political activity ban on Tuesday.  I want the junta to show some sincerity about the election by lifting the ban,  Sunisa Lertpakawat, a member of Thaksin s Puea Thai Party, told Reuters.  We haven t got much time.  \"],[\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Wednesday dropped a U.S. commitment to a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the  longstanding bedrock of Washington’s Middle East policy, even as he urged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to curb settlement construction. In the first face-to-face meeting between the two leaders since Trump’s victory in the 2016 election, the Republican president backed away from a U.S. embrace of the eventual creation of a Palestinian state, upending a position taken by successive administrations and the international community. “I’m looking at two states and one state, and I like the one both parties like,” Trump told a joint news conference with Netanyahu. “I can live with either one.” Trump vowed to work toward a peace deal between Israel and Palestinians but said it would require compromise on both sides, leaving it up to the parties themselves ultimately to decide on the terms of any agreement. But he offered no new prescription for achieving an accord that has eluded so many of his predecessors, and Palestinian anger over his abandonment of their goal of statehood could scrap any chance of coaxing them back to the negotiating table.  Dropping a bombshell on Netanyahu as they faced reporters just before sitting down for talks, Trump told him: “I’d like to see you hold back on settlements for a little bit.” The right-wing Israeli leader appeared momentarily startled. It was a rare concession sought by Trump as the two leaders tried to set a new positive tone after eight years of friction  under Trump’s Democratic predecessor, President Barack Obama. Netanyahu insisted that Jewish settlements were “not the core of the conflict” and made no public commitment to reduce settlement building in the occupied West Bank. He later told reporters traveling with him that he hoped to “reach an understanding” with Trump on settlements. Trump echoed Netanyahu’s calls for Palestinians to recognize Israel as a Jewish state – something they have refused to do – and to halt incitement against Israelis. But even as Trump promised to pursue peace, saying “it might be a bigger and better deal than people in this room even understand,” he made no effort to address the deep distrust and other obstacles that have prevented any substantive negotiations since 2014. Setting an initially chummy tone, Trump greeted Netanyahu on a red carpet rolled out to the White House driveway. The two leaders smiled, shook hands and chatted amiably before heading inside, accompanied by first lady Melania Trump and Netanyahu’s wife, Sara. Among the questions that figured prominently on the agenda was the future of the two-state solution – the idea of creating a Palestine living peacefully alongside Israel. Foreshadowing Trump’s policy shift, a senior White House official said on Tuesday that peace did not necessarily have to entail Palestinian statehood. Palestinians responded by warning Trump that such a move would seriously damage U.S. credibility. Giving a meandering response to a question on the issue, Trump suggested that he could abide by whatever path the two sides decided. “I’m happy with the one they like the best,” he said. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas seized on Trump’s settlements comment to demand a complete halt to such building - which Palestinians see as meant to deny them a viable state - and said he remained committed to “the two-state solution and to international law.” United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned   against abandoning the idea of a sovereign Palestinian state alongside Israel, saying there was “no alternative.” Netanyahu committed, with conditions, to the two-state goal in a speech in 2009 and has broadly reiterated the aim since. But he has also spoken of a “state minus” option, suggesting he could offer the Palestinians deep-seated autonomy and the trappings of statehood without full sovereignty. At the news conference, he never ruled out a two-state solution, but also made it sound like an almost impossible ideal. He said it would require preconditions, including the Palestinians’ recognition of Israel as a Jewish state and Israel’s retaining security control “in the area west of the Jordan River” - which would encompass all of the West Bank. Netanyahu and Trump shared several warm handshakes during the news conference, especially after Trump’s opening remarks, when he said the United States was Israel’s greatest friend. But Trump also managed to catch Netanyahu off guard, at one point saying that if a solution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict was going to be reached “both sides will have to make compromises.” The president then turned to Netanyahu and said: “You know that, right?” Netanyahu replied with a chuckle, “Both sides.” The two leaders agreed that there was an opening for enlisting Israel’s Arab neighbors - which share its concerns about Iran - into any future peace efforts. But a retreat from the principle of Palestinian statehood would cast doubt on the chances for cooperation from the broader Arab world. Martin Indyk, a former Middle East negotiator under Obama and now at the Brookings Institution think tank in Washington, said of the possibility that Washington might ditch its support for an independent Palestinian nation, “It’s another nail in the coffin of the peace process, which already had a lot of nails in it.” The one-state idea would be deeply problematic for both sides. One concept would be two systems for two peoples, which Palestinians would see as apartheid. Another version would mean equal rights for all, including for Palestinians in an annexed West Bank, but that would compromise Israel’s Jewish character. Palestinians have expressed fear that their leadership will be frozen out by Netanyahu’s close bond with Trump. But CIA director Mike Pompeo met Abbas in Ramallah on Tuesday, U.S. and Palestinian officials said. For Netanyahu, the talks with Trump are an opportunity to reset ties after a frequently combative relationship with Obama. The prime minister, under investigation at home over allegations of abuse of office, wanted no visible gaps between U.S. and Israeli thinking during his visit. Trump, who has been in office less than four weeks and whose foreign policy apparatus is in disarray following the forced resignation of his national security adviser Michael Flynn,  brings with him an unpredictability that Netanyahu’s staff hoped would not impinge on the discussions. The two leaders, who seemed to strike up an emerging “bromance” in social media exchanges since the U.S. election, sought to demonstrate good personal chemistry face-to-face as well. Meetings with Obama were at best cordial and businesslike, at worst tense and awkward. In one Oval Office encounter in 2011, Obama grimaced as Netanyahu lectured him in front of the cameras on the suffering of the Jewish people through the ages. \"],[\"PARACHINAR\\u002fPESHAWAR, Pakistan (Reuters) - A suspected U.S. drone strike killed three people in the tribal area of Pakistan near the Afghanistan border on Friday, a senior regional official said, in what Afghan Taliban sources say was an attack targeting a Haqqani network militant. If confirmed, it would be the first U.S. drone strike inside Pakistan since President Donald Trump outlined a new Afghanistan strategy and pushed Islamabad to take greater action against Pakistan-based Haqqani militants who are allied to the Afghan Taliban. Baseer Khan Wazir, the political agent and the most senior administrator in the Kurram Agency region in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), said the drone strike took place close to the border with Afghanistan.      Two missiles were dropped on the home of Maulvi Mohib and three people have been killed,  Wazir said. A spokesman for the U.S.-led international force in Kabul had no immediate information on the report but said he would look into it. Two Afghan Taliban sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Mohib was affiliated with the Haqqani network.  He remained associated with the Haqqani network but wasn t a prominent figure,  said one senior Taliban member. A second commander confirmed that Mohib was part of the Afghan Taliban:  We don t differentiate the Haqqani network and Taliban. This is just a propaganda of the western media,  he said. U.S. officials in Washington are currently discussing what measures to take if Pakistan continues to turn a blind eye to Haqqani militants operating on its soil. Pakistan denies there are any militant havens inside the nuclear-armed nation. Analysts have been predicting an increase in drone attacks inside Pakistan ever since Trump came into power, but since January there have only been a few. Another option being weighed by Washington, according to U.S. officials, is targeted sanctions against Pakistani officials with links to extremist groups such as the Haqqani network. But Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi told Reuters on Monday that such a move would be counter-productive, hurting both countries  fight against militancy.    \"],[\"TRIPOLI (Reuters) - Air strikes killed at least 15 people in the besieged eastern Libyan city of Derna late on Monday, a medical source and a resident said, in an operation condemned by the United Nations due to the high civilian death toll. The U.N. Support Mission in Libya said at least 12 children and women were among the dead in Derna, a city about 265 km (165 miles) west of the Egyptian border controlled by a coalition of Islamist militants and rebel veterans known as the Derna Mujahideen Shura Council (DMSC). The medical source said all the victims appeared to be civilians. The coastal city has long been under siege by the eastern-based Libyan National Army (LNA), which has occasionally carried out air strikes against it, as has Egypt, which backs the LNA. Both denied carrying out Monday s strikes. The air strikes, lasting around an hour, hit the Dahr al-Hamar district in the south of Derna and Al Fatayeh, a hilly area about 20 km (12 miles) from the city, a resident said.  An Egyptian military source said Egypt was not responsible for the air strike, while one Egyptian TV station said Libyan planes had conducted it. The LNA denied this and said there had been a  terrorist attack  in the area. Egypt s foreign ministry issued a statement condemning the air strikes, which it said had killed innocent civilians. The Tripoli-based U.N.-backed government, which opposes the LNA-backed by a rival administration in the east, denounced the air strikes and announced three days of mourning. Islamic State established a foothold in Derna in late 2014, but was driven out by the DMSC the following year. \"],[\"VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - The former president of a Vatican-owned hospital in Rome on Saturday was convicted of abuse of office for diverting nearly half a million dollars of funds to renovate a top cardinal s luxury apartment. The Vatican court, a three-judge panel, gave Giuseppe Profiti a one-year suspended sentence. The prosecution had asked for three years for the former head of the prestigious Bambino Gesu hospital. It also reduced the seriousness of the charge against Profiti to abuse of office from the initial embezzlement. Massimo Spina, the hospital s treasurer, was acquitted. Testimony at the trial, which began in July in the city-state s courtroom, again exposed lack of transparency in the financial handling of Vatican assets in Italy, where it owns numerous institutions and much real estate. Profiti and Spina were charged with spending 422,000 euros ($481,000) in 2013 and 2014 on refurbishing the large Vatican retirement home of Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, the Holy See s former number two. His retirement apartment, which has a huge terrace and breath-taking view of the dome of St. Peter s Basilica, has become a symbol of the difficulty of the frugal-minded pope s efforts to rein in the luxury some Church leaders still enjoy. Bertone, 82, was the Vatican secretary of state, effectively the deputy pope, for most of the pontificate of former Pope Benedict and was one of the most powerful men in the Roman Catholic Church. He was removed from office in 2013, eight months after the election of Francis. The renovation started a few weeks later on the spacious property, which is next door to the Vatican guest house where the pope lives in a modest suite. Bertone hired the construction firm of a friend to do the reconstruction work, bypassing the customary bidding process, and made a down payment with his own money. The company eventually went bankrupt but the foundation that runs the hospital sent 422,000 euros to a London-based company affiliated with the construction firm. Neither Bertone nor the owner of the construction company were called to testify at the trial. When the Vatican confirmed last year that Profiti and Spina were under investigation, a lawyer for Bertone said the cardinal had never asked for or authorized payment for the restoration work from hospital funds. Profiti said the hospital used some of its funds to renovate Bertone s apartment because the cardinal had agreed that it could be used for fundraising. After the scandal was first revealed in a book, Bertone gave 150,000 euros of his own money to the Bambino Gesu to make amends for damage done to the hospital s image.   \"],[\"NEW YORK (Reuters) - When U.S. Senate Republicans unveil their plan to overhaul America’s healthcare system, they will face a skeptical public that already does not buy the justification for an earlier version that passed the House of Representatives, according to a Reuters\\u002fIpsos poll released on Wednesday.   The June 9-13 poll shows that a majority of the country thinks the American Health Care Act would be harmful for low-income Americans, people with pre-existing health conditions and Medicaid recipients.  Overall, 41 percent of American adults oppose the House plan, while 30 percent support it. Another 29 percent said they “don’t know,” according to the poll.  “It’ll make people’s deductibles skyrocket” said Shannon Sowards, 39, of Memphis, Tennessee, a Trump supporter who took the poll. “So I’m not for this healthcare act. I’m for insurance for everyone.” The Senate is expected to release its full plan on Thursday. (Click here to view the poll's topline results: tmsnrt.rs\\u002f2sqhmM3) The gap between what Republicans say their plan will do and what people think it will do further complicates matters for Senate Republicans, who already have been criticized for drafting their bill in secret. “It would be great if a politican had the nerve to be brutally honest” and tell people that healthcare costs are going up, said Joseph Antos, a healthcare expert at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. “None of them seem to.” For years, Republicans have promised voters they would replace Democratic former President Barack Obama’s healthcare law, which they say is too costly and intrusive. When House Republicans pitched their health plan earlier this year, U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan boasted that it would lower premiums, protect people with pre-existing conditions and improve public “access” to high-quality, low-cost healthcare. U.S. Representative Tom MacArthur of New Jersey, who helped shape the House bill, said it “would make coverage of pre-existing conditions sacrosanct for all Americans.” The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, however, presented a different view of the bill. It estimated that under the House plan 23 million people would lose their health coverage by 2026 in an effort to cut the federal deficit. According to the poll, nearly 60 percent of adults said they thought it would make insurance more expensive for low-income Americans and people with pre-existing conditions. Fifty-seven percent said it would make Medicaid less available, and 69 percent said it would cut federal money for Planned Parenthood. Thirteen percent felt that the House plan would improve the quality of their healthcare, and 9 percent said it would make their healthcare cheaper. About 28 percent of Americans said they would be “less likely” to support their congressional representative if he or she supported the House plan. Another 16 percent said they would be “more likely” to support their representative and 33 percent said it would make “no difference.” Republican respondents were more supportive of the House plan than others. And even those Republicans who did not like the House plan said that it is probably an improvement over the current healthcare system. “It’s not going to change my political views” said Barb Huntington, 64, of Murrells Inlet, South Carolina, a Trump supporter who took the poll.  Huntington, who buys health insurance through her state’s Obamacare exchange, said her premiums went up by $25 per month this year. Huntington said she would not be surprised if they keep going up no matter what the Republicans do. “It’s going to be like that every year, and we’ll be lucky to have what we have,” she said. The Reuters\\u002fIpsos poll was conducted online in English across the United States. It gathered responses from 1,492 adults, including 671 Democrats and 501 Republicans. It has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3 percentage points for the entire group, 4 percentage points for Democrats and 5 percentage points for Republicans.

U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday that Iran was violating  the spirit  of the 2015 deal under which it got sanctions relief in return for curbing its nuclear program. State television quoted Khamenei as saying Iran was standing firm  and any wrong move by the domineering regime regarding the (nuclear accord) will face the reaction of the Islamic Republic.  Washington extended some sanctions relief for Iran on Thursday under the nuclear deal with world powers, but said it had yet to decide whether to maintain the agreement.  Trump must make a decision by mid-October whether to certify that Iran is complying with the deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). If he does not, Congress has 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions.  Today, despite all the commitments and discussions in the negotiations, America s attitude toward these negotiations and their outcome is completely unjust and amounts to bullying,  Khamenei said in a speech to Iranian police academy graduates.  The Americans should know ...there will be no retreat by the Islamic Republic.  The Foreign Ministry in Tehran condemned as  continued Iranophobia  Washington s move on Thursday to impose sanctions on 11 individuals and firms, including two based in Ukraine, state news agency IRNA reported. The U.S. Treasury accused the 11 of supporting Iran s ballistic missile program or its Revolutionary Guards, or engaging in cyber attacks against the U.S. financial system. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Sunday he believed Iran was in technical compliance with the nuclear deal but had stepped up destabilizing activities in Yemen and Syria and continued to have an active ballistic missile program.  None of that, I believe, is consistent with that preamble commitment that was made by everyone  in the nuclear deal, he told CBS   Face the Nation.  Iran said last month it could abandon the nuclear agreement  within hours  if the United States imposed any new penalties, after Washington ordered unilateral sanctions over Tehran s ballistic missile tests. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, speaking on Sunday before leaving to attend a U.N General Assembly meeting in New York, said Washington should join the countries that continued to support the nuclear deal, which he compared to a dinner party.  They can choose the right path and also enter the room where the food is served. We would not have a problem with that,  IRNA quoted Rouhani as saying.   The United States imposed unilateral sanctions, saying Tehran s ballistic missile tests violated a U.N. resolution that endorsed the nuclear deal and called on Tehran not to undertake activities related to ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons. Iran denies its missile development breaches the resolution, saying the missiles are not designed to carry nuclear weapons. \"],[\"BANGKOK (Reuters) - It will be business as usual this month for Thailand s lucrative tourism industry as the country gears up for the lavish funeral of its revered King Bhumibol Adulyadej, the tourism agency said on Monday.  Tourism accounts for about 10 percent of Thailand s GDP and has been one of the few bright spots for Southeast Asia s second-largest economy, which has struggled since a 2014 coup by the military. One of the world s most popular travel destinations has observed a year-long period of mourning after the death in October last year of King Bhumibol, who ruled for seven decades, and will be cremated on Oct. 26 in a ceremony lasting five days.   Tourism activities will continue as normal around the country, even though Thai people will be in mourning,  Tanes Petsuwan, a deputy governor of the Tourism Authority of Thailand, told Reuters.  There are no restrictions on tourists at all and they can still enjoy  Amazing Thailand  while they are here,  he said, referring to a tagline trumpeted in tourism advertisements.   However, Bangkok s Grand Palace and the Temple of the Emerald Buddha, two key landmarks in the capital, will be closed for most of the month to host the cremation.  In a travel advisory last month, the tourism agency asked tourists to behave appropriately and respect Thai sensitivities during what promises to be an emotionally-charged time for many.  We would like to request that the solemnity of the royal cremation is observed, and visitors should refrain from any inappropriate or disrespectful behavior,  it said.  While not required to wear black, tourists should stick to  respectful clothing , it added.  With its beaches, Buddhist temples and infamous night life, Thailand remains a magnet for travelers despite weathering more than a decade of unrest, including two coups, deadly floods in 2011 and a wave of bombs in tourist towns last year. It expects to welcome a record 32.4 million visitors this year.  King Bhumibol was succeeded by King Maha Vajiralongkorn, who ascended the throne in December last year. King Vajiralongkorn has since overseen several shake-ups of palace staff and moved some agencies under his direct control, including the Crown Property Bureau, which manages most of the royal family s wealth. \"],[\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday rejected a union’s appeal of a lower court’s ruling that allowed Atlantic City’s Trump Taj Mahal casino, founded by Donald Trump but now owned by billionaire investor Carl Icahn, to break its contract with union workers to secure a bankruptcy rescue deal. The high court’s decision not to hear the appeal by Unite Here Local 54 leaves in place a January decision by the Philadelphia-based 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that cleared the way for the casino to exit Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The struggling casino has since emerged from bankruptcy and is now owned by Icahn Enterprises LP. It was the New Jersey city’s largest casino when Trump opened it in 1990 but it later fell on hard times along with other Atlantic City casinos. Trump, the billionaire real estate developer and presumptive Republican U.S. presidential nominee, founded the casino and it bears his name, but he has said he no longer has a stake in it. In 2014, the casino’s owner, Trump Entertainment Resorts Inc, filed for bankruptcy. Last year, it convinced a U.S. bankruptcy judge that it had to impose a new lower-cost contract on unionized workers in order to secure Icahn’s rescue deal. The union appealed, arguing that because the collective bargaining agreement expired before the bankruptcy, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court lacked jurisdiction. The appeals court sided with Trump Entertainment, saying a bankruptcy judge must be free to evaluate a labor contract that may determine the fate of a business. \"],[\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States is pressing for the delivery of World Food Program shipments to Yemen and the installation of new cranes at a key port amid a conflict in the nation that has killed or wounded more than 60,000 people, the State Department said on Monday.  John Sullivan, the U.S. deputy secretary of state, discussed Yemen with the leaders of international organizations on Friday and underscored that Washington was pressing for restoration of full humanitarian and commercial access to Yemen, the department said. Sullivan told the leaders the United States was calling for  the delivery of World Food Program shipments that have not reached Hudaydah since late November, and the installation of new cranes at Hudaydah port,  it said in a statement. \"],[\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Republican, will not accept a nomination to be a U.S. presidential candidate, his spokeswoman, AshLee Strong, said on Wednesday. “The speaker is grateful for the support, but he is not interested. He will not accept a nomination and believes our nominee should be someone who ran this year,” Strong said in an email to Reuters. She was responding to a report by Politico that quoted former Speaker John Boehner as saying that Ryan should be the Republican nominee for president if the party fails to choose a candidate on the first ballot at the convention in July.  “If we don’t have a nominee who can win on the first ballot, I’m for none of the above,” Boehner said at the Futures Industry Association conference in Boca Raton Florida, Politico reported on Wednesday. “They all had a chance to win. None of them won. So I’m for none of the above. I’m for Paul Ryan to be our nominee.” Ryan, who is from Wisconsin and became House speaker last year, has been touted as a possible dark horse candidate for president, should the Republican convention fail to agree on any of the current contenders on the first ballot. Ryan has repeatedly insisted that he does not want to run for president this year, and a committee that sought to draft him closed last week after Ryan’s office urged a halt to its activities. Ryan ran for vice president in 2012 on the unsuccessful Republican ticket with presidential contender Mitt Romney.  U.S. Republican front-runner Donald Trump scored big wins in Republican primaries in Florida, Illinois and North Carolina on Tuesday which brought him closer to the 1,237 delegates he needs to win the nomination. But he still might fall short of the majority required, enabling the party establishment to put forward another name at the July convention in Cleveland. A spokesman for Boehner said Wednesday that the former speaker, who is from Ohio, had endorsed that state’s Governor John Kasich in the presidential race. “His (Boehner’s) off-the-cuff comments this morning were about a hypothetical scenario in which none of the current candidates are able to secure the nomination at the convention,” the spokesman, Dave Schnittger, said. \"],[\"QUETTA, Pakistan (Reuters) - Gunmen in southwestern Pakistan killed four members of a Shi ite Muslim Hazara family, including a 12-year-old boy, on Sunday, in the latest sectarian attack on the minority community, a senior police official said.  Two men on a motorcycle opened fire on a family of eight while they at a filling station some 30 kilometres (19 miles) north of Quetta, the capital of Pakistan s Baluchistan province. Aside from those killed, two others were wounded. Two  female members of the family were unscathed, having remained in their vehicle.  This was a sectarian attack,  senior police officer Tanveer Shah told Reuters, adding that no group has claimed responsibility for the shooting. Hazaras are frequently targeted by Taliban and Islamic State militants, and other Sunni Muslim militant groups in both Pakistan and Afghanistan.  Many Hazaras fled to Pakistan during decades of conflict in neighboring Afghanistan, and nearly half a million now live in and around Quetta. In 2013, three separate bombings killed over 200 people in Hazara neighborhoods, raising international awareness of the plight of the community. More than 20 Hazaras have been killed in similar shootings in Baluchistan in the past two years, police say.  The ongoing violence in the province has fueled concern about security for projects in the $57-billion China Pakistan Economic Corridor, a transport and energy link planned to run from western China to Pakistan s southern deep-water port of Gwadar. \"],[\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency will reconsider a rule on greenhouse gas emissions from oil and gas operations and delay its compliance date, the agency said on Wednesday in the Trump administration’s latest move to reduce regulations. Oil interest groups, including the American Petroleum Institute and the Texas Oil and Gas Association, had petitioned the EPA a year ago to reconsider the rule limiting emissions of   methane and other pollutants from new and revamped oil and gas wells and systems.  The EPA said in a statement that it would delay the rule’s June 3 compliance date by 90 days and take public comments during that period. Under Democratic President Barack Obama, the EPA released the first methane limits on the facilities in May 2016, saying it would cost energy companies $530 million, but would lead to $690 million in benefits, including lowering medical bills.  Scott Pruitt, the EPA chief in the administration of Republican President Donald Trump, joined dozens of other states  in challenging the rule when he was attorney general of oil-producing Oklahoma. Pruitt has said he does not believe that greenhouse gas emissions are the main driver of climate change.  Energy companies had complained that the methane rule would add costs to wells that were not producing much oil and gas, and that it was duplicative as the sector had already reduced the emissions. Environmentalists believe limiting methane, a gas about 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide in trapping heat, is a low-hanging fruit in efforts to curb climate change.  Michelle Robinson, director of the clean vehicles program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said EPA was favoring industry over science. “Instead of looking backwards to review well-reasoned rules based on clear science, the administration should be moving forward,” and extend methane limits, she said.  Wednesday’s move signaled another retreat from climate change action after the Trump administration in March halted an effort to gather methane data from existing oil and gas operations to rein in leaks of the powerful greenhouse gas. In late March, Trump signed an order to undo climate regulations, following up on a campaign promise.  Pruitt said the EPA is continuing to follow through with Trump’s order. “American businesses should have the opportunity to review new requirements, assess economic impacts and report back, before those new requirements are finalized,” he said. \"],[\"MANILA (Reuters) - Two leaders of a militant alliance loyal to the Islamic State group were killed on Monday in clashes with the armed forces of the Philippines in southern Marawi City, the defense minister said on Monday.  They were killed,  Defence Secretary Delfin Lorenzana told reporters, referring to Omarkhayam Maute and Isnilon Hapilon. Another rebel commander, Malaysian Mahmud Ahmad, was still at large, he said. Hapilon is the anointed  emir  of Islamic State in Southeast Asia, and Omarkhayam Maute is one of two brothers at the helm of the militant group that has been fighting the military since a siege of Marawi City began on May 23. \"],[\"JUCHITAN, Mexico (Reuters) - Destruction wrought by Mexico s massive earthquake has put a spotlight on the quasi-matriarchal indigenous traditions of the worst affected town, with women and third-gender  muxes  playing a leading role in the aftermath of the disaster.  Located in Mexico s narrow isthmus region, about 400 miles (644 km) southeast of capital Mexico City, Juchitan bore the brunt of the 8.1 magnitude earthquake that flattened thousands of buildings in the humid market town in a matter of seconds and took at least 98 lives nationwide. In vivid contrast to Mexico s macho, male-dominated society, travelers have noted since at least the 1800s the relative equality of Juchitan s mainly Zapotec men and women, as well as the prominence of muxes, Zapotecs born biologically male who mix gay and feminine identity. After the earth shook violently just before midnight on Thursday, women, muxes and men all leapt into action, in many cases pulling away rubble with their bare hands.  I carried my mother out as I left the house, and then my brother and I went to rescue my aunt who was trapped,  Peregrina Vera, a tall, 26-year-old muxe, said in a sing-song voice, her long hair tied in a bun.  She then helped pull up rubble to free her grandmother after hearing shouts for help, Vera said, sitting in an outdoor patio just beyond the collapsed walls of her house, where two aggressive pet ducks snapped brightly colored bills at visitors. Locals say there is a muxe in every Juchitan family. They are widely accepted despite an ingrained Roman Catholic heritage and known for dedication to family, especially for taking care of mothers as other siblings move out. Among the severely damaged buildings was the downtown market, the most important for miles around and the heart of Zapotec women s economic power for more than a century. Slated for demolition due to the quake damage, its loss is a blow to Juchitan s women. Irma Lopez, 44, who sold traditional indigenous clothing, was proud that 80 percent of market vendors were women but said it meant they were particularly hard hit by the destruction.   We are the ones who have lost the most,  Lopez said, standing just outside the market as a light rain fell. She was waiting for relatives to help remove her last boxes of merchandise, as trucks pulled up to haul away her and other women s goods. In an 1859 account, French traveler and historian Brasseur de Bourbourg appreciatively described the sprawling marketplace as run by strong, unrestrained women who  openly made fun of their men ... with a shamelessness hardly equaled.  Roughly eight in 10 residents of Juchitan are indigenous, mostly Zapotec. Women are typically also in charge of family finances, said Felina Santiago, a muxe and beauty shop owner, speaking outside her badly damaged home.   Many say Juchitan is the ultimate matriarchy. It s a city of women who fight, who work hard,  Santiago said.  Now more than ever, we re going to work to get back on our feet,  she said, just as a structure on her block loudly collapsed, causing a sudden stir as neighbors rushed to the spot. No one was hurt. In Juchitan s Seventh Division residential neighborhood, Margarita Lopez, a 56-year-old domestic worker, craned her head as she stood in a crowd of women waiting for a promised delivery of government aid, which turned out to be mostly canned food.  Yes, we have our husbands, and we don t leave them behind. But we women matter more. We take decisions, more than the men do,  she said, as others nearby nodded in agreement. Lopez spoke of how it is common in the city of about 100,000 people for husbands to help with household chores like cooking and washing dishes, in a country where such tasks are traditionally seen as the preserve of women. Men find the division of labor in the area  natural,  said male Juchitan surgeon Ovidio Pineda. Women and men  share the decisions, share the responsibilities,  he added. Martha Toledo, whose bar housed in a 200-year-old building collapsed in the quake, killing three clients, said the disaster would not crush Juchitan s spirit, as another aftershock sent her and others running to safety.      Women stand out here, in terms of work and intelligence and experience,  she said, wearing a traditional huipil top and standing near the pile of rubble that was once the bar.  We have to rebuild and rise like the phoenix,  she said, breaking out into a song in the Zapotec language with the chorus  I want to shout, I am alive!  \"],[\"BEIJING (Reuters) - The former Communist Party boss of one of China s most important cities, the southwestern megalopolis of Chongqing, has been expelled from the party and will be prosecuted for corruption, state news agency Xinhua said on Friday.

Months before he leaves the White House in January, Obama wrote that a certain anxiety over globalization had taken hold in the United States, not unlike the discontent leading to Britain’s vote in June to leave the European Union.  “The world is more prosperous than ever before and yet our societies are marked by uncertainty and unease,” the Democratic president wrote. “So we have a choice - retreat into old, closed-off economies or press forward, acknowledging the inequality that can come with globalization while committing ourselves to making the global economy work better for all people, not just those at the top.” Calling capitalism the greatest driver of prosperity the world has ever known, Obama argued that trade had helped the U.S. economy much more than hurt it. His enthusiastic advocacy for trade runs counter to the stated policies of both his potential successors, who say many trade deals hurt U.S. workers. The Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal championed by the president is opposed by Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and his Democratic rival in the Nov. 8 election, Hillary Clinton, whom Obama has endorsed. Obama listed four major structural challenges facing the United States - “boosting productivity growth, combating rising inequality, ensuring that everyone who wants a job can get one and building a resilient economy that’s primed for future growth.” Trumpeting the achievements of his eight-year presidency, led by preventing the 2007-2009 recession from turning into a depression, Obama said a foundation was laid for a better future. “America must stay committed to working with all nations to build stronger and more prosperous economies for all our citizens for generations to come,” he wrote. \"],[\"LONDON (Reuters) - Tehran vowed on Tuesday to stand alongside Baghdad and Ankara  against the outcome of an independence referendum staged by Kurdish authorities in northern Iraq, a day after thousands of Iranian Kurds marched in support of the vote. State media also quoted an army commander as saying that new missile systems were installed on Tuesday, a day after the referendum, in western provinces that border Iraqi Kurdish areas to  firmly respond to any invasion . Iran, Iraq and Turkey - countries with Kurdish minorities - have all denounced the referendum as a threat to the stability of a region already beset by conflict, while the United States has expressed similar disquiet. Ali Akbar Velayati, the top adviser to Iran s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, stepped up the pressure as the Iraqi government ruled out talks on possible secession for Kurdish-held northern Iraq and Turkey threatened sanctions.  The Iraqi people won t stand silent. Iran and Turkey and other regional countries won t stand silent and will stand against this abhorrent deviation,  Velayati was quoted as saying by ISNA news agency.  The Muslim nations will not allow the creation of a second Israel.   Velayati did not say what action Iran had in mind. However, the country s media have compared the Kurds  desire for a homeland with the 1948 creation of Israel. The Islamic republic regards the Jewish state as its greatest enemy along with the United States. Initial referendum results indicated 72 percent of eligible voters had taken part and an overwhelming majority, possibly over 90 percent, had said  yes , Kurdish TV channel Rudaw said. Final results are expected by Wednesday. Undaunted by years of official suppression of dissent, residents in a number of mainly Kurdish cities in northwestern Iran danced in circles as night fell on Monday, chanting slogans praising Kurdish nationalist movements.  Videos posted on social media showed drivers beeping their car horns in celebration and people clapping in the cities of Marivan and Baneh. Many wore masks so as not to be identified by the security forces. About 30 million ethnic Kurds are scattered across the region but have no country of their own. With 8 to 10 million living in Iran, Tehran fears pressure for secession will grow among a minority which has a long history of struggle for its political rights. A strong police presence tried to control the celebrating crowd. There were reports of clashes between the demonstrators and security forces in the cities of Mahabad and Sanandaj. In Sanandaj the crowd waved the flag of Kurdistan, a banned symbol for the Kurds  desire for independence.  This referendum will encourage Iranian Kurds to be more determined to seek their rights,  said Zaribar, a Marivan resident and member of the Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan, a secular armed group which launches periodic attacks in Iran.   This referendum was not a threat to Iraq s neighbors, but it s a starting point to resolve the issues of Kurds, especially in Iran,  added Zaribar, who declined to give his full name. Tehran announced a ban on direct flights to and from Iraqi Kurdistan on Sunday at the request of the central government in Baghdad and called for a land blockade of the autonomous region by all neighboring countries. Media gave no further details of the newly-installed missile systems. However, Iranian fighter jets flew in a show of force over western provinces of Iran as part of a military drill, including the Kurdish cities of Sardasht and Oshnavieh. Although many Iranian Kurds would like to copy the referendum model, the road to autonomy or independence would be more difficult under the Islamic Republic s theocratic rule and its military might. The Revolutionary Guards have put down unrest in Kurdish areas for decades, and the hardline judiciary has sentenced many activists to long jail terms or death. Iran sent Guards Commander Qassem Soleimani to northern Iraq last week in a failed final effort to persuade the Kurdistan regional government from holding the referendum. One Kurd from Baneh, who gave his name as Arbaba, said he was exhilarated  from the bottom of my heart for victory in the referendum . However, he was worried it would increase pressure on Iranian Kurds to prevent them from going down the same path.  The Iranian regime will militarize the Kurdish areas even more,  Arbaba said. For the Iranian state the referendum of the Kurds  demand for state of their own was a  Zionist plot  aimed at bringing instability to the region.  This view that a wandering scattered nation would only find peace if they find a homeland, was the core philosophy for creation of Israel,  wrote the Kayhan, a hardline newspaper closely associated with Supreme Leader. Israel has backed Kurdish independence. It has maintained discreet military, intelligence and business ties with Kurds since the 1960s, viewing the minority as a buffer against shared adversaries. \"],[\"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A sluggish forecast for U.S. economic growth as well as an increase in U.S. states’ Medicaid and pension contribution costs is creating a budgetary squeeze in many state capitols, according to a research report issued by S&P Global Ratings on Monday.  While the risk of a recession within the next 12 months has fallen into a 15-20 percent range from 20-25 percent, the rate of economic expansion “is expected to remain fairly anemic at 1.8 percent over the longer term (roughly 10 years), well below the 3.0 percent average growth rate that prevailed from 1980 to 2000,” the report said. “And while the risk that federal policy could trigger a recession has eased, the potential for a dramatic scaling-back of federal aid for Medicaid has never been greater,” the report said. The slow-growth economy is producing sluggish revenue trends for the states, said Gabriel Petek, an analyst at S&P, in a telephone interview.  S&P does not expect Washington will enact a federally funded public infrastructure package in the next two years, which will put further stresses on state budget management. Addressing deferred maintenance and inadequate capacity in public infrastructure will depend heavily on state and local government solutions, the report said. Without a possible bump in growth from a federal infrastructure package, projected GDP growth for 2017 was lowered to 2.2 percent from 2.3 percent, the report said. “Anything that is done at the federal level would imply that more of the burden has to be picked up by the state and local government level in the area of infrastructure investment,” Petek said. The report added that the U.S. mid-Atlantic region (New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania) will have the slowest growing economy compared to other regions. Real GDP growth for the region is projected at 1.25 percent for 2017, the report said. The best performing region forecast for the current year, with an economic growth forecast of 2.88 percent is the Mountain region (Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, Wyoming). Overall, regional economies growth rates are expected to peak in 2018 before some of those gains ebb, the report’s data showed. The best performing region forecast for 2018 are the states in the West South Central region (Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Arkansas) with a combined growth rate of 3.36 percent, followed closely by the Mountain region at 3.29 percent and Pacific region at 2.93 percent. \"],[\"BERLIN (Reuters) - Half a year ago, the political stars seemed perfectly aligned for a deep reform of the European Union and its euro currency. Emmanuel Macron had won the French presidency on a promise to relaunch Europe. And Angela Merkel, on track to win a fourth term as German chancellor, looked ready to embrace his bold vision, telling an audience in Bavaria that it was time for Europe to take its fate into its own hands. Following the collapse of German coalition talks, however, the prospects for a meaningful leap forward in European cooperation, driven by newly minted governments in Berlin and Paris, look dimmer than ever.   Political uncertainty has crossed the Rhine,  said Jean Pisani-Ferry, an economist and academic who helped write Macron s election program.  Europe has gotten used to having a strong German government with clear positions. That is something we may not have for some time.  Germany now faces months of political limbo which will narrow an already tight window for agreeing reforms of euro zone governance and EU defense and asylum policies. Should Germany be forced to hold new elections, its partners may have to wait until next summer for a government to take form. By then, Europe will be entering crunch time in its Brexit negotiations with Britain, preparing for sensitive discussions on a long-term EU budget and gearing up for the election of a new European Parliament. Euro zone leaders were due to begin a six-month discussion on closer integration of their 19-nation currency bloc next month at a special summit in Brussels. Now that debate seems likely to be delayed and officials say the chances of reaching any conclusions by June 2018, as proposed by European Council President Donald Tusk, are slim.  Things will go on hold until there is a formal acting German government,  one euro zone official said.  At this stage I don t see what steps the leaders could take in December or June for deepening euro zone integration when there is a German government without a mandate.  Another casualty could be the completion of an EU pact on closer defense cooperation, known as PESCO.  Berlin and Paris had hoped to sign it into law at a regular EU summit next month. Now diplomats involved in EU foreign policy say that may be overly ambitious. Germany has also been a driving force behind EU efforts to reform its asylum policies in the wake of the 2015 refugee crisis. Those discussions, pitting countries like Italy and Greece against Poland and Hungary, were already bogged down. Without a new government in Berlin, there is next to no hope of a breakthrough.  We have so many things we need to do urgently that slowing us down is not good for Europe as a whole,  Frans Timmermans, a former Dutch foreign minister who is deputy head of the European Commission, told CNN.  He played down the risks, however, saying:  It might slow us down a little bit but I don t think it would take Europe off course, whatever happens.  Perhaps the only pressing issue which will not be significantly affected by the political uncertainty in Germany is Brexit, where there is a broad political consensus among German parties. That means that Merkel, who will remain in place in a caretaker capacity until a new coalition is formed, should have sufficient room to maneuver in talks that, in any case, are being led by the European Commission and its chief negotiator Michel Barnier. Still, hopes that the two political earthquakes of 2016   Britain s decision to leave the EU and the election of U.S. President Donald Trump   might shock European capitals into bold reforms, once elections in the Netherlands, France, Germany and Austria were out of the way, are fading. Even before the liberal Free Democrats (FDP) walked out of coalition negotiations with Merkel s conservatives and the Greens in the early hours of Monday, doubts were rising about whether she would have the flexibility to meet Macron halfway as head of an awkward three-way  Jamaica  alliance. Now that those talks have collapsed, she would appear to have three options: convince the Social Democrats (SPD) to enter another right-left  grand coalition ; form a minority government with the Greens or the FDP; or take the risk of new elections. So far the SPD leadership has shown no signs that it will go back on its pledge to go into opposition. On Monday, Merkel appeared to rule out a minority government. So unless something changes, a new election could be the only way forward. That would probably not take place before March or April, around the same time that Italy is due to hold elections which could also result in a hung parliament. Crucially, polls suggest that a new German election would not give Merkel more coalition options than she had coming out of the Sept. 24 vote. Indeed, if voters blamed her conservatives for failing to form a government the first time around, she could emerge even  weaker than she is now. That would be a further blow to German political stability and to Macron s European ambitions. \"],[\"HANOI (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said in a tweet on Sunday that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un had insulted him by calling him  old  and said he would never call Kim  short and fat.  Trump made the comment after attending the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Vietnam. In a series of tweets he also said Chinese President Xi Jinping was  upping sanctions  on North Korea in response to its nuclear and missile programs and that Xi wanted Pyongyang to  denuclearize.  During Trump s visit to Beijing last week Xi reiterated that China would strive for the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula but offered no hint it would change tack on North Korea, with which it fought side by side in the 1950-53 Korean war against U.S.-led forces. One of Trump s tweets read:  Why would Kim Jong-un insult me by calling me  old,  when I would NEVER call him  short and fat?  Oh well, I try so hard to be his friend - and maybe someday that will happen!  Speaking later in Vietnam s capital, Hanoi, Trump said  it would be very, very nice  if he and Kim became friends.  That might be a strange thing to happen but it s a possibility,  he said. Trump has traded insults and threats with Kim in the past amid escalating tension over Pyongyang s nuclear and missile programs as North Korea races toward its goal of developing a nuclear-tipped missile capable of reaching the United States -something Trump has vowed to prevent. North Korea conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear bomb test on Sept. 3, prompting another round of U.N. sanctions. In September Kim described Trump as a  mentally deranged U.S. dotard  whom he would tame with fire. His comments came after Trump threatened in his maiden United Nations address to  totally destroy  the country of 26 million people if the United States were threatened. After North Korea s Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho addressed the U.N. General Assembly in September Trump tweeted:  Just heard Foreign Minister of North Korea speak at U.N. If he echoes thoughts of Little Rocket Man, they won t be around much longer!  North Korea has conducted dozens of ballistic missile tests in defiance of U.N. sanctions. It has vowed to never give up its weapons programs, saying they are necessary to counter hostility from the United States and its allies. The United States has said that all options, including military, are on the table, although its preference is for a diplomatic solution. \"],[\"MANILA (Reuters) - The Philippines  national police chief said on Tuesday that Reuters had timed a report on a deadly anti-drug raid to make his officers  look bad  as President Rodrigo Duterte mulls returning them to drug-war operations. Police killed three men in a poor Manila neighborhood on Oct. 11 in what they said was self-defense during a legitimate anti-drug operation. But security camera footage and eyewitness testimony published by Reuters on Monday contradicted the police report and suggested they may have executed the three men.  They come out with damaging reports about the PNP when we are about to return,  said police chief Ronald Dela Rosa, referring to the Philippines National Police.  That means our enemies really don t want us to return to the war on drugs,  he said, speaking to reporters at the Supreme Court in Manila. In October, Duterte banned the police from leading anti-drug operations, handing the task to the state-run Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency. Duterte has hinted that he will soon allow police to resume operations, although his spokesman Harry Roque said on Tuesday  the matter remains pending . Police say they have shot dead more than 3,900 drug suspects in self-defense during Duterte s 17-month anti-drug campaign that has triggered growing public distrust and criticism.  Police said that one of the men they killed during the Oct. 11 raid was dealing drugs before they arrived, but the footage showed him chatting with friends. Police said they shot the three men in self-defense after they opened fire on undercover operatives. Residents told Reuters the men were unarmed. Joel Coronel, the chief of Manila Police District, which carried out the raid, said it was a  high-risk  operation against  three suspected drug traffickers reported to be armed and dangerous .  So far our reports indicate that we have observed all the rules in police operating procedures,  he said. \"],[\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - White House national security adviser Michael Flynn privately discussed U.S. sanctions against Russia with Moscow’s ambassador to the United States during the month before President Donald Trump took office, the Washington Post reported on Thursday. Citing unnamed current and former U.S. officials, the Post said some senior U.S. officials interpreted the contacts as a “potentially illegal” signal to Russia that it could expect a reprieve from sanctions imposed by the Obama administration in December. Reuters could not immediately confirm the Washington Post report. Reuters reported last month, citing three sources familiar with the matter, that Flynn had held five phone calls with Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak on Dec. 29, the day then-President Barack Obama retaliated for Moscow’s alleged interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The Post said Flynn on Wednesday denied that he had discussed sanctions with the Russian ambassador, but on Thursday backed away from the denial through a spokesman. Flynn “indicated that while he had no recollection of discussing sanctions, he couldn’t be certain that the topic never came up,” the Post quoted the spokesman as saying. Officials said this week that the FBI is continuing to examine Flynn’s contacts with Kislyak, according to the paper. “Several officials emphasized that while sanctions were discussed, they did not see evidence that Flynn had an intent to convey an explicit promise to take action after the inauguration,” the Post said. \"],[\"(Reuters) - Democratic presidential hopefuls Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton battled over their progressive credentials at a town hall on Wednesday, but also reflected on their spirituality, a topic that more commonly dominates the narrative on the other side of the political aisle. Sanders, speaking at the televised event in Derry, New Hampshire, built on an earlier back-and-forth between the two candidates on Twitter and in appearances in the state, which  hosts the second party-nominating contest on Feb. 9, reminding voters that he and Clinton have made different decisions on backing the Iraq war, taking money from Super PACs and energy policies. “Some of my best friends are moderates, but you can’t be a progressive and a moderate at the same time,” Sanders said at the town hall, hosted by CNN, which included questions from voters. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton spoke immediately after Sanders at the town hall.  “I was somewhat amused today that Senator Sanders has set himself up to be the gatekeeper on who is a progressive, because under the definition that was flying around on Twitter and statements from his campaign, Barack Obama would not be a progressive, Joe Biden would not be a progressive ... so I’m not going to let that bother me,” she said. Her campaign issued a press release during Sanders’ appearance, listing Clinton’s efforts “fighting for progressive causes” including health care and education. “I know where I stand, I know who stands with me, I know what I’ve done,” Clinton said. Moderator Anderson Cooper, referring to criticism from Sanders that Clinton is too close to Wall Street, asked her about the more than $600,000 she received from speaking to the investment bank Goldman Sachs. “That’s what they offered,” Clinton said, adding that the payments haven’t had any effect on her calls to rein in the big banks. The two candidates arrived in New Hampshire on Tuesday, a day after Clinton marked a narrow victory in the Iowa caucuses, the first nominating contest leading up to the Nov. 8 presidential election.  Sanders, an independent U.S. senator from Vermont who is a democratic socialist, is polling more than 15 points ahead of Clinton in New Hampshire, but is trailing her nationally by roughly the same amount. During the town hall, Sanders fielded a question about how he would appeal to a broader swath of the electorate, including minority and religious voters - blocs he will need to draw to the polls if he hopes to maintain momentum against Clinton in upcoming nominating contests in the South and West. “Everybody practices religion in a different way. To me, I would not be here tonight, I would not be running for president of the United States, if I did not have very strong religious and spiritual feelings,” said Sanders, who, if elected, would be the first Jewish U.S. president. “My spirituality is that we are all in this together,” Sanders added. Clinton, a former first lady and former U.S. senator who has spent decades in public life, fielded a question that elicited a similarly spiritual response, speaking of balancing the role of public servant and her sense of self. “I get a scripture lesson every morning from a minister that I have a really close personal relationship with,” Clinton said. “He gets up really early to send it to me, so you know, there it is, in my inbox at 5 a.m.” Clinton is seeking to manage expectations about her performance in next week’s New Hampshire primary, saying Sanders has an advantage because he is from a neighboring state. But Clinton shows huge polling leads in the next round of primary contests in Nevada and South Carolina. The results from New Hampshire could shift momentum in the Democratic race. Clinton had hoped for a strong finish against Sanders in Iowa to vanquish his insurgent candidacy. In New Hampshire, she hopes to overcome his polling lead.

Obama specifically named journalist Austin Tice who disappeared in Syria in 2012, Caitlan Coleman held in Afghanistan, and retired FBI agent Robert Levinson, who went missing in Iran more than nine years ago. Earlier this week, the families of four Americans killed by Islamic State urged Obama to do everything possible to bring home Tice, the only U.S. journalist known to be held in war-torn Syria. The parents of the slain hostages criticized Obama for not personally naming Tice in his remarks at this year’s White House Correspondents’ Association Dinner when Obama said that he would “fight for the release of American hostages held against their will.”  They said Tice’s return would be a test of the of the success of the administration’s new policy. The White House undertook a six-month review of its hostage policies after complaints from families that their initiatives to free relatives captured abroad had been discouraged and sometimes blocked by government officials. As part of the overhaul, Obama named James O’Brien special presidential envoy for hostage affairs at the State Department to help coordinate the efforts of law enforcement and diplomats. “But I know our work will not be done until our fellow Americans who are held against their will, and whose families mark their calendars by the days since they’ve held their loved ones, are reunited,” Obama said.     \"],[\"BEIJING (Reuters) - The former head of China s powerful internet regulator is under investigation for suspected corruption, the ruling Communist Party said, the latest senior official to be caught up in a sweeping campaign against graft. Lu Wei was suspected of serious discipline breaches, the party s corruption-busting Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI) said in a brief statement late on Tuesday, using a euphemism for graft. Reuters was unable to reach Lu or a representative to seek comment. At the height of his influence, Lu, a colorful and often brash official by Chinese standards, was seen as emblematic of China s increasingly pervasive internet controls.  Organizers of China s first World Internet Conference in 2014, set up under Lu to promote Beijing s vision of internet governance, irked foreign tech firms by seeking their agreement on a last-minute declaration on  internet sovereignty .  Tech industry representatives ultimately declined to sign the pledge, and rights groups condemned the declaration as an attempt to undermine internet freedom. In 2015, he told reporters,  Indeed, we do not welcome those that make money off China, occupy China s market, even as they slander China s people. These kinds of websites I definitely will not allow in my house.  But courting China s powerful internet regulator, the Cyberspace Administration of China, was a key task for companies hoping to stay in his good graces or gain access to the huge internet market. When Lu visited Facebook Inc s U.S. campus in 2014, Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of the social networking site that has long been blocked in China, greeted Lu in Mandarin, according to a Chinese government website. But Lu s downfall, foreshadowed by his June 2016 replacement as head of the internet regulator and the loss of his other posts, is unlikely to signal a reversal of internet control policies, which have tightened further under successor Xu Lin. In a separate statement on its website on Wednesday, the CCDI emphasized the significance of Lu being the first  tiger , or senior official, to be brought to heel for corruption since the key 19th Communist Party Congress held last month. It said that under Lu, the cyberspace administration did not carry out President Xi Jinping s instructions in a timely or resolute fashion.  The improper use of power occurred on occasion, and the safeguarding of political security was not strong enough,  it said, without elaborating on any of Lu s specific wrongdoings.       Lu worked his way up though China s official Xinhua news agency before becoming head of propaganda in Beijing and then moving to internet work in 2013. He became a deputy propaganda minister after being replaced at the internet regulator.  The government has blocked sites it deems could challenge Communist Party rule or threaten stability, including sites such as Facebook and Google s main search engine and Gmail service. Xi has waged war against deep-rooted corruption since taking office five years ago, punishing hundreds of thousands of officials. \"],[\"KABUL (Reuters) - Spreading violence in Afghanistan is forcing many schools to close, undermining fragile gains in education for young girls in a war-ravaged country where millions of girls have never been to school, said a Human Rights Watch report released on Tuesday. After more than a decade and a half of international intervention in Afghanistan, corruption, insecurity, waste, and other problems mean around two-thirds of Afghan girls still do not go to school, the rights group said. Despite the challenges, millions of children have received education, but those gains are now threatened by spreading violence and declining international funding, the report found.  As security in the country has worsened, the progress made toward the goal of getting all girls into school may be heading in reverse   a decline in girls  education in Afghanistan,  the authors wrote.  In the most insecure areas of the country, schools are closing at an alarming rate due to insecurity.  While the war has affected schools since at least 2005,  as the fighting has escalated and spread to previously secure areas, more schools have closed . In Kandahar, for example, at least 130 of 435 schools were closed over the summer, a local government official told HRW. Threats from Islamic State militants forced the closure of at least 61 schools in the northern province of Jawzjan, education ministry spokesman Kabir Haqmal told Reuters.       He said he could not yet comment on the report s findings, but acknowledged that  Security has a great impact on education, and when there are challenges, fewer girls attend.  Access to education can be undermined by factors ranging from limited numbers of qualified teachers and community opposition to a lack of sanitary facilities. One of the more successful education programs is also one of the most threatened by a drop in international funds, the HRW report found. So-called  community-based education  (CBE) programs have helped expand access to schools in many areas, the researchers said. But such programs were only a temporary solution, as they were all run by non-profit groups out a shrinking pool of international donations, they said.  The absence of long-term strategic thinking by government and donors exposes CBE programs, and students, to unpredictable closures,  they added.  International aid has been essential to the progress in expanding access to education since 2001,  they concluded, but ranked bureaucratic hurdles, corruption, and insecurity among the reasons why the government often left the funds unspent. \"],[\"ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey urged the United States on Monday to review its suspension of visa services after the arrest of a U.S. consulate employee sharply escalated tension between the two NATO allies and drove Turkey s currency and stocks lower. Relations between Ankara and Washington have been plagued by disputes over U.S. support for Kurdish fighters in Syria, Turkey s calls for the extradition of a U.S.-based cleric and the indictment of a Turkish former minister in a U.S. court. But last week s arrest of a Turkish employee of the U.S. consulate in Istanbul marked a fresh low. Turkey said the employee had links to U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, blamed by Ankara for a failed military coup in July 2016. Gulen denies any connection with the coup. The U.S. embassy in Ankara condemned Ankara s charges as baseless and announced on Sunday night it was halting all non-immigrant visa services in Turkey while it reassessed Turkey s commitment to the security of its missions and staff. Within hours, Ankara announced it was taking the same measures against U.S. citizens seeking visas for Turkey. The U.S. ambassador said the duration of the visa services  suspension would depend on talks between the two governments about the reasons for the detention of local staff in Turkey. In a written statement late on Monday, Ambassador John Bass said the length of the suspension would also depend on  the Turkish government s commitment to protecting our facilities and personnel here in Turkey . He noted that the move was not a visa ban on Turkish citizens, that valid visas could still be used and visa applications could be made outside of Turkey. The U.S. Embassy had been unable to learn the reasons for the arrest of its Turkish staff member last week or what evidence exists against the employee, Bass said, adding that he had not been allowed sufficient access to the employee s lawyer. Justice Minister Abdulhamit Gul said that if Washington had serious security concerns about its missions in Turkey, steps would be taken to address them.  But if it s an issue regarding the arrest of the consulate employee, then this is a decision the Turkish judiciary has made,  Gul told A Haber television.  Trying a Turkish citizen for a crime committed in Turkey is our right.  The Turkish foreign ministry summoned a U.S. diplomat to urge the United States to lift the visa services suspension, saying it was causing  unnecessary tensions , and President Tayyip Erdogan also criticized the U.S. move.  For the (U.S.) embassy in Ankara to take such a decision and implement it, it is upsetting,  Erdogan told a news conference during a visit to Ukraine. State-run Anadolu news agency said another U.S. consulate worker had been summoned to testify over his wife and daughter s suspected links to Gulen - which it said had emerged during the questioning of Metin Topuz, the employee arrested last week. The diplomatic spat spooked investors. The lira dropped 3.4 percent and stood at 3.7385 against the dollar after being quoted overnight as touching a level of 3.9223. The main BIST 100 stock index fell as much as 4.7 percent, closing the day down 2.73 percent at 101,298 points. Airline shares were particularly hard hit, with flag carrier Turkish Airlines falling 9 percent. The central bank said it was following developments closely.  This looks like a really serious situation,  said Blue Bay Asset Management strategist Timothy Ash. He added that the central bank would need to move quickly to calm market nerves and possibly hike interest rates - something Erdogan has resisted. Turkey s leading business association, TUSIAD, warned that the dispute would harm bilateral economic, social and cultural ties, and called for disagreements to be settled calmly. The row with the United States coincides with deep strains in Turkey s relations with Germany, another key ally, and with Turkish military activity at the Syrian and Iraqi borders, though their market impact has so far been limited. U.S.-Turkish tensions have risen in recent months over U.S. military support for Kurdish YPG fighters in Syria, considered by Ankara to be an extension of the banned PKK which has waged an insurgency for three decades in southeast Turkey. Turkey has also pressed, so far in vain, for the United States to extradite Gulen, viewed in Ankara as the mastermind behind the failed coup in which more than 240 people were killed.  Friction with the United States has also arisen from the indictment last month by a U.S. court of Turkey s former economy minister Zafer Caglayan on charges of conspiring to violate U.S. sanctions on Iran. Sinan Ulgen, an analyst and former Turkish diplomat, said those underlying disputes had created a crisis of confidence which made this latest fall-out particularly bitter.  This harshness is a result of a build-up,  he said.  We should not consider this as solely a reaction to the detentions of consulate employees . \"],[\"PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) - The head of the Democratic Party resigned on Sunday amid a furor over embarrassing leaked emails, hoping to head off a growing rebellion by Bernie Sanders supporters on the eve of the convention to nominate Hillary Clinton for the White House. Lingering bitterness from the heated primary campaign between Clinton and Sanders erupted after more than 19,000 Democratic National Committee emails, leaked on Friday, confirmed Sanders’ frequent charge that the party played favorites in the race. In a statement, DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz said the best way for the party to accomplish its goal of putting Clinton in the White House was for her to step aside after the convention. Sanders had demanded earlier in the day that Wasserman Schultz resign. The furor was a blow to a party keen on projecting stability in contrast to the volatility of Republican candidate Donald Trump, who was formally nominated at a raucous convention in Cleveland last week. It also overshadowed preparations in Philadelphia for Clinton’s coronation as the nominee to face Trump in the Nov. 8 presidential election. She will be the first woman nominated for president by a major U.S. political party.  The four-day Democratic convention will open on Monday. In some good news for Clinton, The New York Times reported that businessman and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg will endorse her in a prime-time speech on Monday, saying she will be the best choice for moderate voters in 2016. The cache of emails leaked on Friday by the WikiLeaks website disclosed that DNC officials explored ways to undermine Sanders’ insurgent presidential campaign, including raising questions about whether Sanders, who is Jewish, was really an atheist. Sanders said Wasserman Schultz, a U.S. representative from Florida, had made the right decision for the future of the Democratic Party. “The party leadership must also always remain impartial in the presidential nominating process, something which did not occur in the 2016 race,” he said. The Clinton camp questioned whether Russians may have had a hand in the hack attack on the party’s emails and were interested in helping Trump, who has exchanged words of praise with Russian President Vladimir Putin. “What’s disturbing to us is that experts are telling us that Russian state actors broke into the DNC, stole these emails and other experts are now saying that Russians are releasing these emails for the purpose of helping Donald Trump,” Clinton campaign chairman Robby Mook said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort said the Clinton camp was trying to distract from its party discord ahead of the convention. “What’s in those emails show that it was a clearly rigged system, that Bernie Sanders ... never had a chance,” Manafort said on ABC.  Clinton, 68, a former secretary of state, and Sanders, 74, an independent U.S. senator from Vermont who ran for president as a Democrat, waged a bruising months-long battle for the nomination. Branding himself a democratic socialist, Sanders galvanized young and liberal voters with his calls to rein in Wall Street and eradicate income inequality.    But Sanders repeatedly voiced frustration with a DNC and party establishment he felt was stacked against him, and the resentment from Sanders and his supporters threatened to disrupt the convention. “I’m not shocked but I’m disappointed,” Sanders said of the emails earlier on Sunday on ABC’s “This Week.” The emails showed DNC officials pondering various ways to undercut Sanders. Brad Marshall, the DNC’s chief financial officer, apologized on Facebook on Saturday for an email in which he discussed how some voters in upcoming nominating contests in Kentucky and West Virginia would reject an atheist. “He had skated on saying he has a Jewish heritage,” Marshall wrote in a May 5 email to three top DNC officials. No names were mentioned, but Sanders was the only Jewish candidate. “I think I read he is an atheist. This could make several points difference with my peeps. My Southern Baptist peeps would draw a big difference between a Jew and an atheist.” Clinton told CBS’s “60 Minutes” in an interview that aired on Sunday that she had not read any of the emails but it was “wrong and unacceptable” to bring religion into the political process. The emails angered many Sanders supporters who were already dismayed by Clinton’s choice on Friday of low-key U.S. Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia as her vice presidential running mate. Kaine, 58, who could appeal to independents and moderates, has never been aligned with party liberals. Sanders, who has endorsed Clinton and will speak on her behalf to the convention on Monday, said he would have preferred she pick U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a favorite of the party’s liberal wing, as her No. 2. “I have known Tim Kaine for a number of years. ... Tim is a very, very smart guy. He is a very nice guy,” Sanders said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”  “He is more conservative than I am. Would I have preferred to see somebody like an Elizabeth Warren selected by Secretary Clinton? Yes, I would have,” he said.  Carrying pitchforks meant to portray Clinton as the devil, hundreds of Sanders supporters took to the streets of Philadelphia earlier on Sunday to say they felt betrayed by the DNC. “It just validated everything we thought, everything we believed to be true, that this was completely rigged right from the beginning, and that you know it was really about what they were doing everything to set it up so she would win,” Sanders supporter Gwen Sperling said. DNC Vice Chairwoman Donna Brazile will serve as interim chair through the election, the DNC said on Twitter. \"],[\"ANKARA (Reuters) - Exhausted and exposed to freezing cold, survivors of a weekend earthquake in western Iran begged authorities for food and shelter on Tuesday, saying aid was slow to reach them. Iranian officials called off rescue operations earlier in  the day on the grounds that there was little chance of finding more survivors from the quake, which killed at least 530 people and injured thousands of others. It was Iran s deadliest earthquake in more than a decade.  Survivors, many left homeless by Sunday s 7.3 magnitude quake that struck villages and towns in Kermansheh province along the mountainous border with Iraq, struggled through another bleak day on Tuesday in need of food, water and shelter. Iran has so far declined offers of foreign assistance to deal with the aftermath of the tremor, which officials said damaged 30,000 homes and completely destroyed two villages.  The U.S. government expressed condolences to the Iranian people despite President Donald Trump s  aggressive  policy towards the Islamic Republic, Iranian state media reported.   We are hungry. We are cold. We are homeless. We are alone in this world,  a weeping Maryam Ahang, who lost 10 members of her family in the hardest hit town of Sarpol-e Zahab, told Reuters by telephone.  My home is now a pile of mud and broken tiles. I slept in the park last night. It is cold and I am scared.   Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei urged state agencies on Tuesday to speed up aid efforts. President Hassan Rouhani paid a visit to the stricken region, promising to resolve  the problems in the shortest time .  Thousands of people huddled in makeshift camps while many others chose to spend another cold night in the open because they feared more tremors after some 230 aftershocks.    In some areas, no building was left standing and those that were had been deserted for fear they could come crashing down at any moment. Houses in impoverished Iranian villages are often made of concrete blocks or mudbrick that can quickly crumble and collapse in a strong quake.  State television aired footage of weeping villagers carrying away bodies wrapped in bloodied blankets and bed sheets and scrabbling with their bare hands through rubble in search of friends and relatives.  It was my cousin s birthday ... All the relatives were there ... like 50 people. But now almost all are dead,  Reza, who refused to give his full name, told Reuters from Sarpol-e Zahab town. He lost 34 members of his family on Sunday.    We spent two nights in the cold. Where is the aid?   On the Iraq side of the frontier, nine people were killed and over 550 injured, all in the northern Kurdish provinces. Television showed rescue workers combing through the rubble of dozens of villages immediately after the quake. But by Tuesday morning Iranian officials said there was no longer any likelihood of finding survivors and called off the search.  Hospitals in nearby provinces took in many of the injured, state television said, airing footage of survivors waiting to be treated. Hundreds of critically injured were dispatched to hospitals in Tehran.   Iran s Red Crescent said emergency shelter had been provided for thousands of homeless people but a lack of electricity and water, as well as blocked roads, hindered aid supply efforts.  People in some villages are still in dire need of food, water and shelter,  said Faramraz Akbari, governor of Qasr-e Shirin county in Kermanshah province.  State TV showed dozens of green and white tents dotting Sarpol-e Zahab, many containing two or three families. Groups clustered around bonfires trying to warm themselves.  It is cold. My children are freezing. We have water and food but no tent. The quake did not kill us but the cold weather will kill us,  a woman in her 30s said.   The mayor of the city of Ezgeleh said 80 percent of its buildings had collapsed. Survivors desperately needed tents with elderly people and babies as young as a one-year-old sleeping in the cold for two straight nights.  People are hungry and thirsty,  a local man told ISNA news agency.  There is no electricity. Last night I cried when I saw children with no food or shelter.   Some people were angry that among the collapsed buildings were homes built under an affordable housing scheme initiated in 2011 by then-President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.   The people should build their own houses. They build better houses than those built under projects and schemes,  Rouhani said in Kermanshah, state TV reported.  I promise you, those responsible will be punished.  Iran is crisscrossed by major geological fault lines and has suffered several devastating earthquakes in recent years, including a 6.6 quake in 2003 that reduced the historic southeastern city of Bam to dust and killed some 31,000 people. \"],[\"TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan s President Tsai Ing-wen has accepted the resignation of Premier Lin Chuan, the ruling party said on Monday, a departure that had been widely expected because of the president s falling public support. Taiwan presidents often shuffle premiers in response to dips in popularity. Lin had faced mounting pressure to step down as Tsai s popularity plummeted to 29.8 percent by August, a private foundation survey has shown. When she took office in May 2016, her approval rating was as high as 70 percent.  The president has accepted his resignation after sincere talks,  Tsai s Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said in a statement.  Under Taiwan s system, the president is the more important office, holding the jobs of commander in chief and head of state. The prime minister is appointed by the president to lead the cabinet. Tsai is likely to be looking ahead to her 2020 re-election campaign. Frozen relations with China, a backlash over pension reforms and a revised labor rule, among other controversies, have put pressure on her to replace Lin, in preparation for that campaign. Lin said the party had  reached a point where we must embark on the next stage of the mission .  So I ve resigned to pave the way for the president to re-organize her team and resources for that purpose,  he said. The presidential office said a new premier would be announced on Tuesday. William Lai, the popular mayor of the southern city of Tainan and a leading DPP figure, is widely expected to replace Lin.  A Lai premiership would not necessary help the president to improve her ratings, some analysts said.  They need a reboot, because current ratings for both are low,  said Alex Huang, a professor of Tamkang University, Taipei, referring to Tsai and Lin, adding that it must have been a hard decision for Tsai because of their friendship.  Lin is sort of biting the bullet to clear the path ahead for the president and the next premier,  Huang said. Some representatives of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) have expressed scepticism that Tsai would build an effective partnership with Lai, if he did replace Lin.  I d like to see how they both work together,  said Lai Shyh-bao, a KMT legislator.  Both Tsai and Lai have reputations for being overbearing and domineering.  Lin has been criticized not just by legislators from the opposition, but also from his own DPP. Tsai had praised him as  a great communicator  when she introduced him last year. Lin, a close confidant of the president who retains her trust, could become the next central bank governor when current governor Perng Fai-nan retires next year.   \"],[\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Infighting dogged the Democrats on Wednesday as Bernie Sanders’ campaign accused party leaders of bias against him and many Democrats urged Sanders to keep his supporters in check. The tensions after a chaotic weekend convention in Nevada emerged as Republicans begin to rally around their own outsider presidential candidate, billionaire businessman Donald Trump, in the general election. Trump, who has all but secured his party’s nomination, has turned his focus to November, outlining to Reuters on Tuesday  proposals including scrapping financial regulation and the Paris climate accords. On Wednesday, he  released a list of potential Supreme Court nominees. More Democrats urged Sanders on Wednesday to take a stronger stand against his supporters’ uprising in Nevada over the delegate selection process. They said he did not go far enough in condemning the unrest, which included a thrown chair, yelling and threats to convention leaders. “That was the time to have sent a full-throated message to his followers: that we don’t do this kind of thing,” U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein of California said on CNN. Democrat Barbara Boxer, the other U.S. senator from California, was at the Nevada convention and expressed her concern to Sanders in a phone call on Tuesday night.  “I feared for my safety and had a lot of security around me,” she said. “I’ve never had anything like this happen.” Sanders’ campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, in a series of television interviews, accused Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the Democratic National Committee chairwoman, of bias against Sanders from the beginning and “throwing shade” on his campaign. “There’s a tremendous amount of frustration out there and people want to have a fair process,” Weaver said on CNN. Senior U.S. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada and Wasserman Schultz on Tuesdsay both also called on Sanders to do more to rein in his supporters. Sanders had said he condemned violence and harassment against individuals but framed Nevada’s incident as a warning to Democratic leaders to treat his supporters with fairness. The U.S. senator from Vermont is determined to fight on against front-runner Clinton in what has become a longer-than-expected and sometimes acrimonious battle. In contests on Tuesday, Clinton narrowly edged out Sanders in Kentucky, a state where she had not been expected to win. Sanders won Oregon, a state that played to his strengths. Democrats are faced with a delicate balancing act as long as Sanders remains in the race, needing to pivot toward Trump without taking Clinton’s nomination for granted and alienating passionate backers of Sanders. Sparring between the Sanders camp and the Democratic Party leaders over the Nevada events threatened party unity before the Democrats’ national convention in July in Philadelphia. “Unaddressed, the toxic relationship between DNC @ @SenSanders campaign, so evident last night, could cast dark cloud over Philly convention,” David Axelrod, a former top strategist for President Barack Obama, said on Twitter. Despite having an almost unassailable lead in the number of delegates needed to clinch the Democratic nomination, and with the  primary battle heading toward the final contests next month, Clinton will need Sanders supporters on her side in the general election. According to a recent Reuters\\u002fIpsos survey, what played out in Nevada is just a glimpse into the uphill battle Clinton faces in courting them. If Clinton wins the nomination, for every six Democrats who support Sanders, one will switch their allegiance to Trump in the general election and two say they would not support either candidate. Only three of every six say they would support Clinton as the party’s nominee.  Sanders’ campaign has long accused party leaders of favoring Clinton, a former U.S. senator and secretary of state, for the presidential nomination in the face of his unexpectedly strong primary challenge. On Saturday, his supporters in Nevada became angry at the delegate selection process, booing, yelling and hurling insults, and at least one chair, toward the convention leaders. Nevada Democratic Party chairwoman, Roberta Lange, said she and her family, including a 5-year-old grandson, have received death threats and numerous callers have disrupted her workplace. On Wednesday, Lange said she wanted Sanders to acknowledge the threats, and apologize. “His statement was pretty weak,” she said on CNN. “Until you say you’re sorry, until you say what happened in Nevada should not have happened and it was wrong and it was fueled by your senior campaign staff people, then that’s an apology and then I think there’s some responsibility is taken.” \"],[\"VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - The Vatican s first auditor-general, who resigned without explanation in June, has broken his silence, saying he was forced to step down with trumped-up accusations after discovering evidence of possible illegal activity. Speaking to reporters from four media organizations including Reuters in the office of his lawyers in Rome, Libero Milone also said he believed that some in the Vatican wanted to slow down Pope Francis s efforts at financial reform. He said he could not give details of the irregularities he had found because of non-disclosure agreements. Reuters was unable to independently verify his assertions, which the Vatican strongly contested. The Holy See s deputy secretary of state, Archbishop Giovanni Angelo Becciu, told Reuters in an interview that Milone s claims were  false and unjustified .  He went against all the rules and was spying on the private lives of his superiors and staff, including me,  Becciu said.    If he had not agreed to resign, we would have prosecuted him.  Domenico Giani, the Vatican s police chief, told Reuters there had been  overwhelming evidence  against Milone. Neither Becciu nor Giani provided details to support their assertions. The 69-year-old left the Vatican two years after being hired with great fanfare to introduce more transparency into the sometimes murky finances at the headquarters of the Roman Catholic Church. At the time of his resignation, with three years left on his contract, neither the Vatican nor Milone, formerly chairman and CEO of the global accounting firm Deloitte in Italy, gave any explanation for his departure. A Vatican statement at the time said only that it was  by mutual agreement . Milone, who had also worked for the United Nations and the car giant Fiat, said Becciu had ordered him to resign on the morning of June 19. Milone was told that he was being dismissed on the basis of a seven-month investigation by Vatican police.  The facts presented to me on the morning of the 19th were fake, fabricated,  he said.  I was in shock. All the reasons had no credible foundation.  Both Becciu and Giani, the police chief, said Milone had been given a choice: resign or face public prosecution by the Vatican s courts.  In a certain sense, we were protecting his reputation,  Becciu said. Milone said he had been accused of misuse of funds for hiring an outside firm to check the security of computers in the Vatican offices where he worked with a staff of 14, including two deputy auditors-general.  A document from the Vatican prosecutor authorizing the search of his offices on the day of his resignation, which Milone s lawyers showed to reporters, said he had carried out investigations  in clear violation  of the statutes of his department. It was not clear which statutes were said to have been violated. Article two of the statutes says the auditor-general has  full autonomy and independence , including to  receive and investigate any reports on anomalous activities  of Vatican entities.  My work has to be independent. It is very difficult to act with independence when departments blocked our activity or tried to control it,  he said. The search warrant also said he had looked into the affairs of high-ranking Church members without authorization. Milone said this referred to him looking into suspicions about the possible conflict of interest of an Italian cardinal, whom he declined to name. His investigation found nothing, but Milone said he believed he was being punished for starting it in the first place. He said his troubles had begun on the morning of Sept. 27, 2015, when he suspected that his office computer had been tampered with. He contacted an external company that had done work for him before to check for surveillance devices  because there are no such specialized people  in the Vatican. The company discovered that his computer had been the target of an unauthorized access, and that his secretary s computer had been infected with spyware that copied files. Reuters was not able to independently determine which company had been hired or its findings. Becciu said there was proof that the outside contractor had been helping Milone to spy on others. Milone said that, after about 12 hours of questioning by Vatican police, he had decided to sign a resignation letter in order to  protect my family and my reputation . Asked why he had waited three months before telling his side of the story, Milone said he had wanted to think  and let things settle .  I wrote to the pope in mid-July and gave him my point of view, explaining that the whole thing was a set-up,  he said, adding that the pope had not replied. Becciu said the pope had been told of the investigation and the evidence before Milone was asked to resign. \"],[\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama said on Friday his top legislative affairs aide, Katie Beirne Fallon, is leaving the White House and will be replaced by her deputy, Amy Rosenbaum, a former aide to House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi. Obama, in a statement, credited Fallon with helping the White House “build up our relationships with folks in both parties” in Congress on issues like the budget, the Iran nuclear deal, and reauthorizing the Ex-Im Bank. \"],[\"DUBAI (Reuters) - Eight women and two children from the same Yemeni family were killed when an air strike by forces of the Saudi-led coalition involved in the country s three-year-old war hit a wedding party, residents said on Monday. The 10 people were returning on Sunday evening from a wedding in Marib province, an area east of the capital Sanaa held by the Iran-allied Houthi group, when their vehicle was struck, the sources said. A spokesman for the coalition, which denies targeting civilians and says that every report of an attack is investigated, did not respond to an email requesting comment.  The residents said the victims, all female, were part of the same family, but gave no further details on their ages or if anyone else was traveling with them. The coalition has been conducting regular air strikes in Houthi-held areas as part of a campaign to restore President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi to power. The United Nations says that more than 60,000 people have been killed or wounded in the conflict, which also displaced more than two million and triggered a cholera epidemic that has infected about one million people. \"],[\"MADRID (Reuters) - Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont will speak in the regional parliament next Tuesday, a parliamentary spokeswoman said on Friday. Catalan parliamentary leaders will meet at 1330 GMT on Friday to decide the timing on this speech. It was unclear whether the meeting of the parliament scheduled for Monday to discuss the result of the banned referendum on splitting from Spain and a potential declaration of independence would still go ahead. Another regional government official, Raul Romeva, told BBC radio earlier that Catalonia s parliament would defy a Spanish court ban and go ahead on Monday with a debate that could lead to a declaration of independence from Spain. \"],[\" MUNCIE, Indiana (Reuters) - One night a month, retired auto workers shuffle into a former elementary school classroom here to discuss their legal fight against the company that cancelled their health care benefits seven years ago.  But the conversation often turns quickly to presidential politics.  “It can get pretty heated,” says Gerald Poor, the group’s 77-year-old president, of their political discussions. “I call it to order if it gets out of hand.”  Their anger is understandable. The group is a remnant of a once-powerful United Auto Workers union local, which at its peak in the 1960s represented over 5,000 workers who made transmissions in Muncie for BorgWarner Inc, the global auto parts maker. An American flag drapes the wall at one end of the room, portraits of former labor bosses line the other, salvaged from a union hall that had its own baseball field.  For this group of mostly white, working-class men, the last two decades have brought much loss. In this election – with the victory of the populist Donald Trump as the Republican Party nominee and the strong run by the populist Bernie Sanders for the Democratic Party crown – many say they feel they’re finally being heard again.  Working-class white men were once a force to be reckoned with in American politics. Many here speak wistfully of how John F. Kennedy stopped at BorgWarner to talk to workers when he campaigned in 1960. For these men, this year’s election is a rare taste of the clout they once took for granted.  In the primary, Trump received the most votes of any candidate in either party in Delaware County, which encompasses Muncie. Just over 52 percent of Republican voters went for Trump. Democrats picked Sanders over Hillary Clinton by an even wider margin.  “Candidates in the past made a lot of promises to the working class in this country and failed to follow through with it,” says 66-year-old Bruce Reynolds, who followed his father and grandfather into a career at BorgWarner.  Gazing through the rusted chain link fence that encircles the sprawling, abandoned factory, where he notes with precision that he worked for “32 and a half years,” he says he’s still skeptical of both side’s promises.  Neither Trump nor Clinton was his first choice. Reynolds and his wife voted for Sanders in the primary, he says. Among other things, they couldn’t support Clinton: She’s the wife of former President Bill Clinton, who signed the North American Free Trade Agreement, which many here blame for Muncie’s economic decline. They were uneasy with the often fiery rhetoric of Trump, the other side’s top candidate.  Yet both plan to vote for Trump in November, and Reynolds says they’ve grown comfortable with the choice.  “I know, it sounds like we’re confused,” he says. But they’re not.  Like many Trump supporters, he glides over the unappealing aspects of the candidate’s message to lock onto those that he likes. For Reynolds, it’s the hope of bringing back jobs for his children, some of whom still struggle to find decent work.  Trump’s gloomy world view is often dismissed as hyperbole, such as when he described crime and collapsed economies in America’s cities at the Republican National Convention. But for someone in Muncie, that’s not far off reality.  An analysis by Reuters found Delaware County is an extreme example of the declining fortunes of America’s white working-class men.  In 2000, white men with less than a college degree accounted for about three-quarters of all white men living in the county. By 2014, their proportion had dropped by about 5 percentage points, according to the US Census Bureau. But while this group’s share of the population held relatively steady, the earnings of white men with full-time jobs had fallen dramatically.  In 2000, 47 percent of white men working full time were in the bottom third of earners, with incomes of $50,000 or less, based on 2015 dollars. By 2014, 60 percent of them were in the bottom third.  Meanwhile, the percentage of white men in full-time jobs making between $50,000 and $100,000 dropped from 43 percent to 32 percent. And the percentage in the ranks of earners above $100,000 slipped from 11 percent to 8 percent.  In essence, white men in Muncie have slid down from every rung of the economic ladder. They have clustered at the bottom, poorer and more isolated than ever before, even as the overall U.S. economy has grown and globalized.  The same trend is visible in faded industrial pockets from New Jersey and upstate New York to Alabama and Kentucky.  According to the data, in about 1,800 counties across the United States—nearly 60 percent of those where data is available—the share of white men in the lowest group of earners has grown over this period. The trend is particularly pronounced in the Rust Belt states of Michigan, Ohio and Indiana.  Jonathan Haidt, a social psychologist at New York University’s Stern School of Business, studies how people adopt their political beliefs. “Trump is the first candidate to speak to—and speak for—working-class white men in a long time,” Haidt says. That separates him from the last two Republican nominees. Mitt Romney, who lost in 2012, didn’t do that, “and John McCain didn’t particularly reach out to that constituency” in 2008.  As for Trump’s extreme positions and outright falsehoods, Haidt notes, “If your hero says things that are untrue, you’ll cut him slack.”  Muncie was once the epitome of America’s muscular manufacturing economy. After natural gas was discovered here late in the 19th century, the city attracted dozens of energy-intensive glass manufacturers, most notably Ball Corp, which built sprawling factories that churned out millions of mason jars.  The auto industry followed, and Muncie became a hub for transmission making. The term “Muncie transmission” is still used by hot rod enthusiasts when talking about gearboxes produced here by General Motors Corp in the 1960s. One particularly powerful version is the “rock crusher,” used in Corvettes and other muscle cars.  BorgWarner, based in Auburn Hills, Michigan, has even deeper roots in Muncie than GM. Warner Gear was founded here in 1901 and merged with other businesses to create what became BorgWarner in the late 1920s. Many former workers here still call it Warner Gear.  In the 1920s, a husband-and-wife team of sociologists picked the city to study the values in a typical American community. They called it “Middletown,” to conceal the identity of a place they felt was emblematic of the country as a whole. Muncie residents soon figured out it was all about them.  The Center for Middletown Studies—at Ball State University—has continued the work, compiling oral histories and, in recent years, focused on the devastation of deindustrialization. James Connolly, a history professor who runs the center, says that more than anything else, Muncie’s working-class white men feel a loss of power. When the big factories were humming, the unions were an unstoppable force—not just for getting good paychecks and lush benefits, but a voice in almost everything else.  To illustrate this power, he cites a locally famous episode from the 1960s, when waitresses at a big downtown hotel went on strike for higher wages.  “A group of police got rough and tried to break up the pickets,” says Connolly. A local union leader—who had nothing to do with the waitresses, other than knowing about them through community connections—called the then-mayor, who was visiting Washington, and “ordered him home” to intervene. The mayor returned and the police backed off.  “The strikers weren’t union members—but there was a system of connections that gave them a sense of control,” says Connolly. With the decline of the unions, working-class people “feel like they’ve been robbed of that voice.”  And yet unions, which were unable to prevent the factory closures that ravaged the city, are often viewed just as suspiciously here as most national politicians are. That tension is visible at the old school where the BorgWarner retirees meet.  The Muncie Delaware County Senior Center was created to give retirees from the big factories—particularly men—a place to go for companionship and activities. One recent day, the room the BorgWarner retirees use was filled with seniors learning line dancing.  “Some people don’t like the photos” of the union leaders, says Jim Shields, a janitor, motioning toward the 10 portraits that adorn the front of the room. They feel the images carry an implicitly political, pro-union message. So, there was a fuss the last time the building was used as a polling station, he said. “We had complaints.” Now, when the BorgWarner retiree group isn’t meeting, Shields carefully drapes a long bolt of fabric over the pictures to conceal them.  Michael Hicks, a Ball State economist who studies manufacturing, says a mix of exasperation with unions and the political elite created the perfect opening for Trump. “It’s always easier to blame a larger force for your problems, whether that’s Mexicans or greedy factory owners,” he says. “But these people aren’t stupid. They know the jobs aren’t coming back.” The bigger concern for many of them, he says, is what will happen to their children.  The Reynolds family is a good example. Bruce Reynolds’s oldest son, Bruce Jr, is a Baptist pastor and is supporting Trump, albeit reluctantly. “I don’t think any of them can fix it,” Bruce Jr says of the fallout he sees from economic hardship in his congregation, from growing drug addiction to broken families.  Reynolds’s second son, Robert, followed his father into BorgWarner after high school. That job didn’t last. After just four years, he was laid off in 1994 during a wave of downsizing. He and his father say it was a trauma from which he never fully recovered.  “I make $8 an hour less now than I made 21 years ago,” says Robert, who enthusiastically backs Trump. After a series of low-paying jobs, including a stint at Wal-Mart and as a manager of a video store, he now works overnight shifts at a warehouse for $18 an hour. He likes the job, he says, although the company recently cut three paid holidays, including the Fourth of July.  Robert concedes that he finds the Republican candidate’s approach to foreign policy worrisome. “You wonder if something will upset him and he’ll declare war,” he says. “That would be awful.” He also doesn’t like how race and immigration has become a theme in the campaign. “This country was built on bring us your tired, your poor—I think we should honor what our forefathers built,” he says.  But he also doesn’t believe Trump’s message is racist. “I think he’s looking at all the illegal activity going on in the U.S. and how it affects the job market,” he says. “He’s just not very tactful” in how he expresses this. Meanwhile, Trump’s promise to restore the economy is the draw.  To be sure, Muncie has retained some of its smaller factories, and other jobs have come in, including a call center that tracks down delinquent student loans and a Caterpillar Inc locomotive factory that moved into an old plant. But none of these are unionized, and the wages and benefits aren’t as high as the old places offered.  One frustration for locals is that the statistical measures of the economy don’t seem to reflect what they see around them. Muncie’s jobless rate is 5.7 percent, less than one percentage point higher than the national rate of 4.9 percent or Indiana’s 4.6 percent.  But the impact of deindustrialization—including the exodus of over 10,000 factory jobs since 1970 in a city of only 70,000 people—is visible almost everywhere.  Most of the departing companies tore down their factories, leaving lots strewn with weeds and rubble. BorgWarner left a handful of structures—including a 1.2 million-square-foot sprawl of red brick and steel near the edge of town.  The city, especially the once-thriving white working-class neighborhoods on the south side, is now dotted with over 2,000 abandoned houses. Some can’t be occupied because they were contaminated by chemicals left behind by meth labs.  Meanwhile, the FBI recently opened a probe of the city government, which appears to be focused on possible corruption in its blight clearing program and the sanitation district. The FBI wouldn’t comment on the investigation, and Mayor Dennis Tyler said he can’t talk about it. There have been no indictments in the case, and it’s possible no charges will result.  Mayor Tyler, a Democrat, notes the jobless rate stood just under 10 percent four years ago, when he took office, so there’s been improvement. But he understands working-class frustration.  “They feel they’ve intentionally been left behind by trade agreements this country imposed on them over the last 25 years,” says Tyler.  Trump’s appeal here isn’t restricted to working-class white men. Another local supporter is Todd Murray, president and CEO of family-owned Mursix Corp, which makes auto parts including tiny switches that go inside door locks and interior lights. His company has grown rapidly in recent years and now employs over 300 people.  Murray says he knows some of Trump’s trade proposals—such as putting hefty tariffs on goods from Mexico and China—could hit his own business. He exports 60 percent of his output, mostly to Mexico, and operates his own small plant in China. But he insists he’s “not smart enough to know how that would all shake out.” He still strongly favors the Republican standard bearer, who he sees as more pro-business.  But the economy alone doesn’t explain Trump’s appeal. Another family with deep roots at BorgWarner is the Lephart clan. At one point in the 1950s and 1960s, the patriarch and nine of his sons worked there, a fact immortalized in the company magazine by a photo of the group posed on a tall step ladder, each holding a lunch bucket, except for the brother at the top, who holds the family dog.  David Lephart, whose father is one of the nine brothers, avoided the decline entirely through shrewd job-hopping and retraining—but he’s still a Trump supporter. He commutes to a UAW job as a pipefitter at a GM plant in Marion, Indiana. He earns about $100,000 a year, with overtime, he says, and has put both of his children through college.  The 58-year-old says one thing that influenced his transition from Democrat to Republican was talking to his children, whom he describes as part of the “business world.” His son is now a stockbroker in Indianapolis.  “For the first half of my life, I thought Democrat was the only way to be,” Lephart says. “There’s this belief that you can’t be Republican and union—but I don’t believe that any more.”  \"],[\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Monday defended his conduct at a January confirmation hearing where he denied having contacts with Russian officials during the course of the presidential campaign when he was an adviser to Donald Trump. “My answer was correct,” Sessions, who last week said he would stay out of any probe into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, wrote in a letter to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley. Sessions repeated that he spoke to Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak during the Republican National Convention in Cleveland in July, and again at his Senate office in Washington in September. At a news conference on Thursday, Sessions said he should have said during the confirmation hearing that he had met with the ambassador in his role as a senator. The Washington Post first disclosed the meetings on Wednesday. Many Democrats, who are pushing for a broad probe of ties between Trump campaign associates and Russian operatives, have called for Sessions to resign. Sessions, then a U.S. senator from Alabama, was a high-ranking player in Trump’s 2016 campaign. Sessions’ denial of contacts with Russians had come in response to a question by Democratic Senator Al Franken about what he would do if reports of contacts between Trump associates and Russians were true. “I did not mention communications I had had with the Russian Ambassador over the years because the question did not ask about them,” Session wrote in the letter to Grassley, which he said was meant to supplement his January testimony. Sessions said his recusal would apply not just to any alleged Russian contact with the Trump campaign, but also with the Trump transition team and administration. “This should not be taken as any evidence of the existence of any such investigation or its scope,” he added. The Republican president has backed his attorney general and accused Democrats of blowing the issue out of proportion for political purposes. U.S. intelligence agencies concluded last year that Russia hacked and leaked Democratic emails during the election campaign as part of an effort to tilt the vote in Trump’s favor. Russia has denied the allegations. \"],[\"(Reuters) - A blackout of television cameras in the U.S. House Representatives during the Democrats’ gun control sit-in may have spurred public interest in the protest as it forced the demonstrators to use social media to broadcast their message. Democrats leapt on Facebook Live and Twitter’s Periscope after the cameras, controlled by the House, went dark Wednesday when presiding House officer and Republican Representative Ted Poe declared the chamber not in order during the protest. As Democrats took to alternative forms of video broadcasting, their message gained tremendous momentum from social media. On Twitter, the hashtags #NoBillNoBreak and #HoldTheFloor have been tweeted at least 1.4 million times. Of the roughly 20 members of Congress who remained at the sit-in overnight, 19 of them used Facebook Live for a total combined viewership of 3 million. “It really connected with people out there,” Congressman Scott Peters told Reuters. “This whole phenomenon with [live video] struck a nerve.” Peters used the application Periscope, which is connected to the social media platform Twitter, to send out video. “Without that, think about it, it would have been a caucus meeting where we talk to ourselves,” he added.  In remarks Wednesday outside the Capitol, House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi praised how her party harnessed social media. “Without you and without the technology of Periscope [the sit-in] would just be a debate in the Halls of Congress unrecorded because they turned off the microphones,” Pelosi said. “But we raised our voices. They turned off the cameras and we went to Periscope.” Congressman Mark Takano, who began posting live videos from the chamber to his Facebook page Wednesday afternoon and continued to throughout the night, said the social media video helped him connect with constituents. “Once I got started with the live streaming I didn’t feel like I could let down the people who were following me,” said Takano. “It was a way to push out a message.” Even C-SPAN, which typically broadcasts footage recorded by the House cameras, picked up live video from four different members of Congress roughly two hours after the House cameras shut down, according to communications director Howard Mortman. It marked the first time the channel broadcast a live social media feed from the House floor. “Something interesting is happening with Facebook Live that’s bringing more openness to the political process,” said Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook, in a post to his social media profile Thursday. “It’s a way to share anything you want with the world using just your phone.” \"],[\"UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Samples taken from the site of a deadly toxic gas attack in Syria and analyzed by British scientists have tested positive for sarin or a sarin-like substance, Britain’s U.N.

Flynn pleaded guilty earlier this month to lying to the Federal Bureau of Investigation during his interview in Mueller’s probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election and whether Trump’s campaign colluded with Russia. Flynn has agreed to cooperate with Mueller’s investigation. Moscow has denied interfering in the election and Trump has denied any collusion. U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan told the government in a filing to turn over any exculpatory evidence, known as “Brady” material, that could potentially help Flynn’s defense or information that is “material either to the defendant’s guilt or punishment.” The order by the judge is considered routine, and the government by law is required to turn over such information to the defense if it exists. A sentencing date has not been set, but a status report ahead of sentencing is due by Feb 1. \"],[\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Billionaire investor Wilbur Ross is expected to be easily confirmed as U.S. Commerce Secretary on Monday, clearing President Donald Trump’s top trade official to start work on renegotiating trade relationships with China and Mexico. The vote will insert a major new voice into Trump’s economic team, one that strongly influenced his criticism of the North American Free Trade Agreement and a now-scrapped Asia-Pacific trade deal. Ross’ nomination is scheduled for a vote on Monday at around 7 p.m. (0000 GMT). It was advanced by the Senate in a 66-31 procedural vote on Feb. 17, signaling solid support from Democrats. Part of that support stems from praise that Ross has drawn from the United Steelworkers union for his efforts in restructuring several bankrupt steel companies in the early 2000s, saving numerous plants and thousands of jobs. But he also has come under criticism from some left-wing groups as another billionaire in a Trump cabinet that claims to be focused on the working class, and for being a “vulture” investor who has eliminated jobs. Reuters reported last month that Ross’s companies have shipped some 2,700 jobs overseas since 2004.   The 79-year-old investor will oversee a sprawling agency with nearly 44,000 employees responsible for combating the dumping of imports below cost into U.S. markets, collecting census and critical economic data, weather forecasting, fisheries management, promoting the United States to foreign investors and regulating the export of sensitive technologies. While Commerce secretaries rarely take the spotlight in Washington, Ross is expected to play an outsize role in pursuing Trump’s campaign pledge to slash U.S. trade deficits and bring manufacturing jobs back to America. Trump has designated Ross to lead the renegotiation of NAFTA with Mexico and Canada, a job that in past administrations would have been left to the U.S. Trade Representative’s office. Ross will join other major players on the economic team, including U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Gary Cohn, director of the White House National Economic Council. Some experts said Ross could serve as a counterweight to advisers such as Peter Navarro, the University of California-Irvine economics professor who heads Trump’s newly created White House National Trade Council. Navarro has advocated a controversial 45 percent across-the-board tariff on imports from China that Trump threatened during his campaign.        “I expect that Ross will quickly become the administration’s chief trade spokesman, and that Navarro’s influence will be felt indirectly, rather than through public statements or testimony,” said Gary Hufbauer, a senior fellow and trade expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. At his confirmation hearing, Ross downplayed chances of a trade war with China, while calling it the “most protectionist” large economy. He vowed to level the playing field for U.S. companies competing with Chinese imports and those trying to do business in China’s highly restricted economy. Ross, estimated by Forbes to be worth $2.9 billion, built his fortune in the late 1990s and early 2000s by investing in distressed companies in steel, coal, textiles and auto parts, restructuring them and often benefiting from tariff protections put in place by the Commerce Department. \"],[\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Expanding the U.S. Navy to 355 ships as recommended by military leaders and backed by President Donald Trump would cost some $400 billion more over the next 30 years than the currently planned 308-ship fleet, according to a study released on Monday. The annual cost to build, crew and operate a 355-ship fleet would be about $102 billion, or 13 percent more than the $90 billion needed for the currently planned Navy, according to the study by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The $102 billion cost of the 355-ship fleet is 33 percent more than Congress appropriated in 2016 for the current 275-ship Navy, the CBO said. To achieve the larger force, the Navy would need $26.6 billion annually for ship construction, which is 60 percent more than the average amount that Congress has appropriated for shipbuilding in the past 30 years, the CBO study said. The Navy’s 2017 shipbuilding plan called for boosting the size of the fleet to 308 ships, which was expected to cost $21.2 billion per year to implement over 30 years. With Trump pressing for an expansion of the fleet to 350 ships during the presidential campaign last year, the Navy released a new force structure assessment in December seeking a 355-ship Navy. Taking into consideration older ships being retired, creating a 355-ship fleet would require the Navy to buy about 329 new ships over 30 years, compared with 254 under its previous plan for a 308-ship fleet, the CBO study found. The Navy would have to buy about 12 ships per year under the larger fleet plan, versus about eight per year under the earlier plan. The larger fleet would require more civilian and uniformed personnel and more aircraft, pushing up overall operating costs, the CBO said. The increase in shipbuilding would force all seven U.S. shipyards to expand their work forces and improve their infrastructure in order to meet the demand for vessels, the CBO said. The greatest challenge would be building submarines to meet the force structure requirements, the report said. The study said the earliest the Navy could achieve a 355-ship fleet would be the year 2035, or 18 years from now. \"],[\"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Bonds sold by U.S. states, cities, schools and other issuers in the municipal market could be held as liquid assets by banks under legislation introduced on Tuesday in the U.S. Senate, bolstering the case for purchasing the debt while helping financial institutions weather market crises. The bipartisan measure would classify high-quality municipal bonds at the same level as corporate debt, allowing banks to use munis to comply with new 30-day federal liquidity requirements. Federal rules approved in 2014 and effective next year are aimed at ensuring big banks will be able to access sufficient cash during a financial crisis. But the rules excluded muni bonds from the types of securities that count as high quality liquid assets, or HQLAs.  Muni debt issuers fear the exclusion would deter banks from buying muni debt, hurting their ability to fund everything from schools and bridges to water treatment plants and hospitals. “If banks retreat from the muni-bond market, it could choke off a critical source of investment on which our cities and localities rely. This bill protects the stability of our markets while providing continued access to muni bonds for local governments,” Senator Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said in a statement.   Schumer, along with Senators Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, and Mike Rounds, a South Dakota Republican, led a group sponsoring the legislation. Putting munis on par with corporate debt “would be acceptable,” according to Washington State Treasurer James McIntire, president of the National Association of State Treasurers (NAST), which has been pushing for the inclusion of munis under the rules.  A House bill would also allow banks to count munis toward banks’ liquidity but at a higher face value, 85 percent, versus 50 percent in the Senate bill, according to NAST. \"],[\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum expressed alarm on Monday over “hateful speech” at a white nationalist meeting over the weekend, and a restaurant apologized for hosting the group after a woman tweeted a picture of herself making a Nazi salute. The National Policy Institute, a think tank that is part of the alt-right movement that includes neo-Nazis, white supremacists and anti-Semites, held a gathering at the federally owned Ronald Reagan Building on Saturday. The alt-right movement came to the fore during the U.S. presidential election. President-elect Donald Trump has drawn criticism for naming Steve Bannon, former head of a website linked to the alt-right, as his chief White House strategist.  Trump’s transition team issued a statement on Monday saying Trump has continued to denounce racism, CNN reported. “President-elect Trump has continued to denounce racism of any kind and he was elected because he will be a leader for every American,” Trump-Pence Transition spokesman Bryan Lanza said in a statement.  The gathering on Saturday drew scores of protesters who blocked traffic around the building to express their outrage over the meeting.  A video by The Atlantic taken inside the conference showed Richard Spencer, leader of the National Policy Institute, shouting, “Hail Trump, hail our people, hail victory!” as some of the people in attendance lifted their hands in a Nazi salute. “The Holocaust did not begin with killings: it began with words,” the Holocaust Memorial Museum said in a statement. “The museum calls on all American citizens, our religious and civic leaders and the leadership of all branches of the government to confront racist thinking and divisive hateful speech.” Some of those who attended the nationalist meeting later gathered for a banquet at Maggiano’s Little Italy restaurant in northwest Washington. Protesters converged on the site and prompted the restaurant to close to protect the safety of staff and guests, the management said in an apology on Facebook. The restaurant said the booking was a last-minute affair made under a different name, so staff were unaware that the National Policy Institute was dining there and did not know what the group represented. “After the event, an attendee sent a tweet in which she made a ‘Seig Heil salute’ in support of Hitler and white supremacy. This expression of support of Hitler is extremely offensive to us, as our restaurant is home to teammates and guests of every race, religion and cultural background,” the Facebook post said. The restaurant apologized to the surrounding neighborhood and said it was donating the profits from its sales on Friday, $10,000, to the Washington office of the Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish civil rights group. The Ronald Reagan Building, the biggest structure in the U.S. capital city, is federally owned, but run by Trade Center Management Associates, a unit of Drew Co., a Boston real estate development company. The firm defended allowing the nationalist group to use the venue. It said in a statement that its contract mandates that unless there is a security threat by an organization or person who asks for meeting space, the building is available for rental. The agenda of the National Policy Institute’s Saturday meeting included a breakdown of the 2016 election and plans for the growth of the alt-right. The nonprofit Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate groups, described Spencer as an “academic racist” who backs creation of an Aryan homeland. Twitter Inc suspended several accounts linked to the alt-right last week, including Spencer’s.  The move followed the microblogging service’s announcement that it would upgrade some features to better combat cyber-bullying. \"],[\"PARIS (Reuters) - With U.S. President Donald Trump tightly aligned with Saudi Arabia against Iran, France is positioning itself as a broker between the Sunni and Shi ite Muslim rivals, but neutrality may leave it with little leverage.  With tensions between Riyadh and Tehran rising sharply since Saad Hariri s resignation as Lebanon s prime minister, President Emmanuel Macron made an unscheduled stopover to meet Saudi s powerful Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on Thursday. The move, made ahead of a possible visit by Macron to Iran next year, is in line with the young president s foreign policy style of being engaged but non-committal, trying to mediate between all sides without unsettling anyone.  There is a stronger capacity for initiative than before,  former foreign minister Alain Juppe told journalists on Friday.  It reminds me a little of (President Nicolas) Sarkozy leaving for Georgia in 2012. It s good that the president is getting his hands dirty. It s an initiative he has taken and may work.  During a visit to Dubai on Thursday, Macron was carefully balanced, calling for a firm international stance over Iran s nuclear and ballistic missile program while implicitly warning that Riyadh s approach toward its rival was excessive.  That tightrope walking may help protect French business ties in Iran and buy time with the Saudis, but diplomats are concerned the 39-year-old president, new to international affairs, may ultimately leave France exposed.  We should be reducing our exposure to the region. We have a lot of hits to take without having pressure points to weigh on them,  said a French diplomatic source.  I don t think it s in our interest to play a role in quarrels between powers.  Under Sarkozy and Francois Hollande, who respectively aligned themselves with Qatar and Saudi Arabia, France nurtured new links with the Sunni-ruled Gulf Arab states and adopted a tough stance on Iran during nuclear negotiations. But during his election campaign, Macron promised a different approach. He openly criticized Saudi Arabia and Qatar for their perceived support of Islamist groups across the region, and since the nuclear deal brought an end to sanctions, France has revived old business and investment ties to Iran. Yet over the same period, Saudi s 32-year-old crown prince has shaken up the landscape. He has forged close ties with Trump, adopted an ever more confrontational line against Iran and, in the past week, dramatically uprooted his own nation s political structures.   France is trying to act as a balance between Iran and Saudi Arabia,  said Dominique Mo si, special adviser in charge of international relations at the Paris-based Montaigne Institute.  At a time when the situation is worsening in the region, it is offering itself as an intermediary after Trump chose one camp over the other,  he said, referring to Trump s decision to decertify the Iran nuclear deal.  Macron has tried to be nuanced, offering something to everyone. He has vowed to stick to the nuclear deal with Iran, while talking up ties with Trump and Saudi Arabia. At the same time, he has threatened new sanctions against Tehran over its ballistic missile program and promised to address its growing hegemony in the region. Iran for one isn t buying it.  I don t think this policy works,  said a senior Iranian official speaking on condition of anonymity.  If a country like France tries to appease, the effect on someone like Trump will be contrary and will simply embolden the administration.   French officials insist Paris has a role to play in various international conflicts given its position as a veto-wielding member of the U.N. Security Council and its historical ties in the Middle East. They say that by remaining neutral, France will prove credible and consistent in the long-term. Since Macron took power he has offered to mediate in Libya, Ukraine, Syria, the Qatar crisis and even Venezuela, each time carefully trying to avoid taking sides. But it may not pay off.  France has understood full well that there is a leadership problem on the part of the Americans and it understands that it s potentially an opportunity to make a difference,  said Jalel Harchaoui, a geopolitics researcher at Paris 8 University.  But so far it seems that Macron and his team have been very distracted, in a hurry to announce big initiatives but delivering very little.  \"],[\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Thursday blasted currency devaluations around the world for hurting the U.S. economy and costing American jobs, and defended his calls for a tougher U.S. stance on trade. Asked about the European Central Bank’s decision on Thursday to cut interest rates, Trump told CNBC that such devaluations were driving manufacturing and other jobs outside of the United States. “We just sit back and do nothing,” Trump said. “That’s getting to be very dangerous as far as I’m concerned.” A more effective economic move than devaluations would be charging a tax on products made abroad and sold in the United States, particularly those from China, Trump said. “China is the grand master of all,” Trump said. “I have great relationships and business relationships with China, and even those people say they can’t believe what they’re getting away with.” Additionally, the front-runner for the Republican nomination in the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election said that while he supports free trade if it is “fair,” the United States has been taken advantage of in negotiations. Trump also said if elected president he would move quickly to stop corporate inversions - when a U.S. company acquires an overseas firm and reduces its tax bill by moving its headquarters to the purchased firm’s location. Trump said he thinks corporate inversions cost the United States twice as much as estimated. He said drugmaker Pfizer Inc and other companies that have recently left the country show “there are things that are very structurally wrong with what we’re doing.” “I think it’s $5 trillion, but I don’t think our country has any idea what it is, but I think it’s much more than $2.5 trillion,” he said, referring to U.S. tax revenue lost when companies pull off corporate inversions. Trump said Republicans and Democrats agree they want to halt such inversions, but “they can’t make a deal because they don’t have leadership.” “I could make a deal in 15 minutes by getting people in a room,” Trump said. “Everybody wants that money to come into the United States. ... It would be so easy.”  (Additional reporting by Susan Heavey; Editing by Will Dunham) This article was funded in part by SAP. It was independently created by the Reuters editorial staff.

Trump, who had long said the top U.S. priority in Syria should be to fight Islamic State, immediately ordered a list of options to punish Assad, according to senior officials who took part in the flurry of closed-door meetings that played out over two days. Confronting his first foreign policy crisis, Trump relied on seasoned military experts rather than the political operatives who had dominated policy in the first weeks of his presidency and showed a willingness to move quickly, officials involved in the deliberations said.  On Thursday afternoon, Trump ordered the launch of a barrage of cruise missiles against the Shayrat air field north of Damascus, which the Pentagon says was used to store the chemical weapons used in the attack. “I think it does demonstrate that President Trump is willing to act when governments and actors cross the line ... It is clear that President Trump made that statement to the world,” Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told reporters. Senior administration officials said they met with Trump as early as Tuesday evening and presented options including sanctions, diplomatic pressure and a military plan to strike Syria drawn up well before he took office. “He had a lot of questions and said he wanted to think about it but he also had some points he wanted to make. He wanted the options refined,” one official said.  On Wednesday morning, Trump’s military advisers said they knew which Syrian air base was used to launch the chemical attack and that they had tracked the Sukhoi-22 jet that carried it out.  Trump told them to focus on the military plans. “It was a matter of dusting those off and adapting them for the current target set and timing,” said another official. That same afternoon, Trump appeared in the White House Rose Garden and said the “unspeakable” attack against “even beautiful little babies” had changed his attitude toward Assad. Asked then whether he was formulating a new policy on Syria, Trump replied: “You’ll see.” By late afternoon on Thursday, the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff met at the Pentagon to finalize the plan for the military strikes as Trump headed to his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida for a summit meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping. At another meeting there, Trump signed off on the missile attacks and went to dinner with Xi.  Two U.S. warships – the USS Ross and the USS Porter – fired 59 cruise missiles from the eastern Mediterranean Sea at the targeted air base at around 8:40 p.m. ET (00:40 GMT), just as the two presidents were finishing their meals. Throughout the three days of meetings, Trump’s key military advisers were national security adviser H.R. McMaster, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Joseph Dunford, officials said. In a White House marked by palace intrigue, McMaster has jostled for influence with Stephen Bannon, Trump’s chief strategist, who lost his seat on the National Security Council on Wednesday just as the military preparations were developing.   Tillerson’s State Department told allies on Thursday that a strike against Syria was imminent, without providing details, one official said. But the move angered Russia, a major ally of Assad, and appeared to diminish chances of closer cooperation with Moscow that Trump has said is possible, especially in fighting the Islamic State militant group.  Tillerson played down suggestions that Trump was dropping his “America First” approach to foreign policy. And one of the other officials involved in the planning said the cruise missile launch was a “one-off” strike rather than the start of an escalating campaign.  \"],[\"BOSTON\\u002fLONDON (Reuters) - Stocks are listing, bonds are drifting and suddenly gold is back in vogue. Global investors appear to be facing the prospect that next week’s U.S. presidential election may not play out as they have been expecting. Until last Friday, when the FBI said it had re-opened a probe of Democrat Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server while she was secretary of state, the prevailing view among the investment set had her coasting to victory. And most investors have said in surveys they were more comfortable with that outcome than a victory by Republican Donald Trump. Now, though, several polls depict an ever-tightening race as the clock counts down to Election Day on Tuesday, although the latest Reuters\\u002fIpsos poll showed Clinton still with a 6-point lead. Investors generally see Clinton as a known quantity who would not make major changes that would upend financial markets, while Trump’s positions have been difficult to nail down. Yet against the tumultuous political backdrop, some of the biggest American stock funds remain either too sanguine, too confused or too focused on extending the bull market to guard against an Election Day result that could shock the world like the Brexit vote did in June. U.S. large-cap mutual funds, which oversee $4 trillion in assets, are heading into the showdown for the White House with only a thin layer of cash to absorb any potential shocks from the stock market.  Gerry Sullivan, who runs USA Mutuals’ $234 million Barrier Fund, said it would be hard to reposition his portfolio even if he knew the election results ahead of time.  “There is so much confusion,” Sullivan said. U.S. funds that invest in stocks with large market capitalizations are not showing any drastic moves toward precaution. Overall, they have only 3.1 percent of their assets dedicated to cash, according to the latest data from Morningstar Inc. These same funds held more cash, about 3.4 percent, before Barack Obama defeated John McCain in 2008. Multi-asset investors are more defensively positioned, especially those outside the United States, according to the latest Reuters asset allocation poll. Funds in Europe held 8.1 percent of their portfolios in cash in late October, while U.K.-based funds had some 9.6 percent of their holdings parked on the sidelines. “Investors are holding higher-than-normal levels of cash,” said Mark Haefele, global chief investment officer for UBS Wealth Management in London, who oversees around $2 trillion in assets. “That’s one way of hedging the uncertainty.” Nonetheless, Haefele said: “We’ve not seen significant de-risking around the election, but we have seen generally a consistent level of caution in the global client base.” With uncertainty about the outcome on the rise, a risk-off mood has enveloped markets around the world.  The S&P 500 index has declined for eight days in a row, its longest losing streak since the market crash in October 2008, while a benchmark for global stocks, the MSCI All-World Index, has dropped for seven of the last eight sessions. Both sit near four-month lows.  Safe-haven bonds, recently under pressure from expectations the U.S. Federal Reserve is on track to raise interest rates this year, have seen only a modest boost in the meantime, but gold has surged to a one-month high near $1,300 an ounce. “The trades you’re seeing in the market at the moment will go further in the event of a Trump victory,” said Mike Bell, global market strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management in London. “You’d expect more downside to U.S. equities, the dollar and Treasury yields.” More than half of the stock and bond fund managers polled by Northern Trust in the third quarter said they expected the election to cause a large increase in market volatility. Prices for certain S&P 500 index options expiring in the days after the election indicate a market swing of between 2 and 4 percent, in either direction, by then. Still, portfolio managers sitting on a lot of cash, some with more than 20 percent of assets, say the stockpile is not a sign of worry about the outcome of the race.  “It’s due to the diminished risk-reward profile of investment opportunities in a mature profit cycle,” said Meggan Walsh, a portfolio manager at the $18 billion Invesco Diversified Dividend Fund. “We do not feel the election is an investable event.” Some value-oriented large-cap fund managers say the stock market is over-valued and they are on high alert for a market correction as the election coincides with a bull market nearing completion of its eighth year.  “It can be tempting to forget that nasty downturns happen with some regularity, and there is never a bell rung to announce their arrival,” portfolio managers Arik Ahitov and Dennis Bryant recently warned investors in the $800 million FPA Capital Fund.  After Britain surprised the world with a vote to leave the European Union, the S&P 500 Index tumbled nearly 4 percent on June 24. It soon recovered, however, and had regained record territory by mid-August. Even in Britain, the referendum’s unexpected outcome has yet to show it has long-lasting effects for investors outside of the currency market, where the British pound has sunk to a three-decade low against the dollar. London’s FTSE 100 index is up around 14-percent from its post-Brexit trough. The FPA Capital Fund managers had nearly 28 percent of the fund’s $800 million in assets in cash during the third quarter. They see the stock market as too expensive and are ready for a high level of panic, if that happens, according to their October letter to investors. “An elevated level of forced selling, combined with a lack of liquidity, might result in challenges for many fully invested products such as index funds, many ETFs, and funds that have no to very low levels of cash cushions,” the FPA Capital Fund portfolio managers said.  “In a down market, cash helps mitigate losses and affords one the opportunity to buy when others are being forced to sell, generally the best time to buy.”    \"],[\"PARIS (Reuters) - France s foreign ministry on Friday nuanced comments made earlier by its minister, suggesting that former Lebanese Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri may not be free and urging that he continue to play his rightful role in the country. Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian had told Europe 1 radio that as far as France was aware, Hariri  was free of his movements  and that it was  important he made his own choices.   However, when asked by reporters in a daily briefing to clarify those comments, a foreign ministry spokesman said France wanted Hariri to be free, suggesting he may not be.  We wish that Saad al-Hariri has all his freedom of movement and be fully able to play the essential role that is his in Lebanon,  deputy foreign ministry spokesman Alexandre Georgini said. He added that France s envoy to Saudi Arabia had seen Hariri after a short-trip to the United Arab Emirates earlier this week. French officials said the ministry s latest comments were the most accurate. France s ambassador to Saudi met Hariri before President Emmanuel Macron s unscheduled visit to Riyadh to meet Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on Thursday. Paris has close ties with Lebanon, a former colony, and with Hariri, who has a home in France after spending several years in the country. Macron said in Dubai on Thursday there had been informal contacts with Hariri, but no request to transfer him to France. Two top Lebanese government officials said on Thursday that Riyadh was holding Hariri captive and a third told Reuters that the Saudi authorities had ordered Hariri to resign while he was in Riyadh last weekend, and put him under house arrest. Le Drian is due in Saudi Arabia on Nov. 16 and is scheduled to also travel to Iran later in the month.  \"],[\"PARIS (Reuters) - France s hard-left CGT trade union called a third strike against President Emmanuel Macron s overhaul of employment laws on Monday but failed to get other unions to rally behind it. The three main unions have been divided over how to respond to the labor law reforms, with the Communist Party-rooted CGT taking to the streets while the more moderate CFDT, now France s biggest union, and the Force Ouvriere preferring negotiations.  France was once a champion of social protest, with unions able to paralyze swathes of the economy and force ministers to back down on reforms. But hardline unions are now grappling for relevance as strikes become less frequent and less disruptive.  Macron s government s spent weeks negotiating with the unions during the summer over measures to give companies more power to set working conditions as well as making it easier to hire and fire workers. Last month, it signed the bill into law by decree.  We are continuing with the fight against the labor law decrees,  Fabrice Angei, a senior CGT unionist, told reporters after a two-hour long meeting with the CFDT, FO and other unions. The CGT hopes it can win concessions for as long as the decrees are not physically written into the labor code. Up to now, the CFDT has said it will focus on other battles ahead such as reform of the pension and unemployment insurance systems.    Monday s meeting over labor reform action came on the eve of a separate nationwide strike by public sector workers. Strike notices have been lodged in schools, hospitals, airports and government ministries over plans to axe 120,000 jobs, freeze pay and reduce sick leave compensation.  It is the first time in a decade that all nine unions representing 5.4 million public workers have united behind a protest call and will be an important test of public appetite to protest against the reforms. If turnout is low on Tuesday, Macron could feel emboldened as he presses ahead with revamping France s generous unemployment insurance in a bid to spur those who lose their jobs to get back to work more quickly. \"],[\"(Reuters) - Australia said on Sunday it is stopping  undesirables  such as terrorists, pedophiles, organized criminals and drug smugglers from boarding flights to the country, defending its hardline immigration policy that has drawn criticism from rights groups.  Immigration Minister Peter Dutton said that Australian Border Force Airline Liaison Officers were operating in major transit airports to push those threats  beyond our borders .  Where other countries  allow people to arrive and then assess the threat then , the  Australian model  was to bar those considered a threat.   (Liaison officers) try to identify the threats   particularly given that we ve got foreign fighters coming back through Southeast Asia and all over   the idea is to stop them getting on planes,  the minister told the Nine Network.  According to media, immigration officials prevented 1,043 passengers from boarding flights to Australia since 2013. Australia has seen the rise of nationalist, anti-immigration politics with far-right wing parties such as One Nation garnering strong public support, while the popularity of the ruling center-right government has been languishing. Under its policy on asylum seekers arriving by boat, Australia turns back unauthorized vessels at sea to their port of origin when it can and sends those it cannot to controversial camps in the South Pacific for long-term detention. Earlier this year, the government announced it would raise the bar for handing out citizenships by lengthening the waiting period, adding a new  Australian values  test and raising the standard for English language as part of a shake up of its immigration program. \"],[\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on Friday announced his selections for his top security posts, including the head of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), his national security adviser and attorney general. An official with Trump’s transition team told Reuters that Trump had chosen retired General Michael Flynn as national security adviser, U.S. Senator Jeff Sessions to serve as attorney general, and U.S. Representative Mike Pompeo to lead the CIA. All three accepted, the official said.      Below are details about his selections: Sessions, 69, was the first U.S. Senator to endorse Trump’s presidential bid and has been a close ally since. A conservative from Alabama, he is serving his fourth term in the chamber, where he is a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee with oversight of federal courts, immigration, crime and terrorism.  The son of a country-store owner, he is a former Army Reserve captain and served as the U.S. Attorney for Alabama’s Southern District under former President Ronald Reagan and later as Alabama’s Attorney General.  Although he was confirmed by the Senate for his U.S. Attorney post in 1981, he was denied a federal judgeship in 1986 when a Senate panel failed to advance his nomination amid allegations he had made racially-charged remarks, which he denied.  Sessions must secure confirmation by the U.S. Senate to lead the Justice Department as attorney general, but he would only need to win majority support in the chamber, which is controlled by Republicans. Sessions has long taken a tough stance on immigration, opposing any path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. During the Republican George W. Bush administration, he blasted a bipartisan effort to create a guest-worker program for illegal immigrants backed by Bush. NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: RETIRED LIEUTENANT GENERAL MICHAEL FLYNN Flynn, 57, was an early supporter of Trump and serves as vice chairman on his transition team. A former director of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), he began his U.S. Army career in 1981 and served deployments in Afghanistan and Iraq. He later worked in the Office of the Director of Intelligence.        Once a registered Democrat, Flynn became head of the DIA in 2012 under President Barack Obama and but retired a year earlier than expected according to media reports and became a fierce critic of Obama’s foreign policy.  He went on to launch his own consulting firm that has come under scrutiny for its ties to a Turkish businessman. He told the Wall Street Journal on Thursday that he would sever ties with the firm to serve Trump.     Flynn has said the United States should work more with Russia on global security issues. In an August interview with the Washington Post, he defended a paid speech for state-run Russian Television.     Pompeo, 52, is a third-term congressman from Kansas who serves on the U.S House Select Intelligence Committee, which oversees the CIA, National Security Agency (NSA) and cyber security. Pompeo also was a member of the House Select Committee on Benghazi investigating the 2012 attack on a U.S. compound in Libya.  The California native graduated first in his class from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point and served as a platoon leader in the U.S. Army before leaving military as a captain to attend Harvard Law School. In 1996, he moved to Kansas to launch an aircraft parts company. The firm’s decision to open a factory in Mexico came under fire when Pompeo later ran for public office. Pompeo defended his work, saying the company had created jobs in the state. His ties to Koch Industries, owned by billionaire conservative donors Charles and David Koch, has also drawn scrutiny. He won re-election in the Nov. 8 election with 61 percent of the vote, according to Kansas’s unofficial election results online. Pompeo has been critical of former U.S. intelligence contractor Edward Snowden who leaked National Security Agency information, saying in a 2014 letter that his telecast appearance at an event undermined the ideals of “fairness and freedom.”    (This version of the story was refiled to remove extraneous “to” in headline) \"],[\"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Kurdish-led Syrian groups plan to attend Russia s proposed Syria peace talks in the Black Sea resort of Sochi, Kurdish officials have said. The Syria peace congress was originally scheduled for Nov. 18 but was postponed and the Kremlin said on Thursday that no new date had been set. If the invitation is renewed,  we will attend Sochi and every other meeting that concerns the Syrian crisis as representatives of the people s will  Sihanouk Depo, an official of Syria s main Kurdish party, PYD, told an affiliated website on Wednesday.  We are still invited,  Badran Jia Kurd, a senior Kurdish official, told Reuters on Thursday. If the framework for the congress still stands,  we will attend , said Jia Kurd, an adviser to the administration that governs Kurdish-led autonomous regions of Syria. It would mark the first time Syria s main Kurdish groups are brought into peace talks. Although they now run at least a quarter of Syria, they have so far been left out of international talks in line with Turkish wishes. Before the Sochi talks were postponed, the PYD said in November it had been invited and favored attending. Since the conflict erupted in 2011, the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia and its allies have carved out autonomous cantons in the north. The YPG spearheads the Syrian Democratic Forces, an alliance of Kurdish and Arab militias fighting Islamic State militants with Washington s backing.  Their territorial grip has expanded since joining forces with the United States, though Washington opposes their autonomy plans.  Turkey views the PYD and the YPG as offshoots of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has fought a decades-long insurgency inside Turkey. Last month, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan s spokesman said Russia had told Ankara that the PYD would not be invited to the peace talks.    The Kurdish groups share enmities with both Syrian President Bashar al-Assad s government and with neighboring Turkey. This week, Assad described the U.S.-backed militias as  traitors . On Wednesday, in an interview with Iran s Arabic language Al-Alam television, Syria s deputy foreign minister Faisal Mekdad equated the Kurdish-led forces with Islamic State.  There is another Daesh called SDF,  he said, using the Arabic acronym for the militant group that until recently controlled swathes of territory in Iraq and Syria. In his interview on Wednesday, Depo said:  Any attack from the regime will be a failed venture.  \"],[\"NEWARK, N.J. (Reuters) - The bribery case against U.S. Senator Bob Menendez survived a key test on Monday, as the federal judge overseeing his trial rejected a defense motion to throw out the most serious charges. U.S. District Judge William Walls in Newark, New Jersey, allowed the trial to proceed on all charges, five days after suggesting he was inclined to dismiss the heart of the case based on a U.S. Supreme Court decision last year that narrowed the legal definition of public corruption. Prosecutors have accused Menendez, a 63-year-old Democrat, of taking bribes from Florida ophthalmologist Salomon Melgen in exchange for using his office to help the doctor in a variety of ways. Both men deny wrongdoing and say Melgen was acting out of friendship. After prosecutors rested their case on Wednesday, defense lawyers renewed their argument that the Supreme Court’s decision last year vacating the corruption conviction of former Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell also undermined the bribery counts against Menendez. Walls initially appeared ready to accept the contention that the McDonnell ruling invalidated a bribery theory known as “stream of benefits,” in which someone offers bribes essentially to keep a politician on retainer, rather than paying for specific acts. But following additional filings over the weekend and more arguments on Monday, Walls said he believed the stream of benefits theory is still valid under the law. The McDonnell decision has caused several other corruption convictions to be overturned, including those of former top New York state lawmakers Sheldon Silver and Dean Skelos. During the trial’s first six weeks, prosecutors presented evidence that Menendez pressured federal officials to secure visas for Melgen’s girlfriends, resolve a port dispute involving one of Melgen’s businesses and change a Medicare reimbursement policy after the agency determined Melgen had overbilled it by millions of dollars. In exchange, Melgen showered Menendez with private flights, luxury vacations and hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign backing, prosecutors said. The defense is expected to begin on Monday afternoon. It is unlikely that Menendez will take the witness stand, though his lawyers have not said whether he plans to do so. The case has been closely watched in Washington, where Republicans hold a 52-48 edge in the Senate. If Menendez is convicted and either resigns or is expelled before Republican New Jersey Governor Chris Christie’s term expires in January, then Christie would name his replacement. \"],[\"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain and the European Union have failed to fully agree a deal on Brexit, the BBC Europe editor said on Monday.  No deal today I ve just been told #brexit,  Katya Adler said.  \"],[\"UNITED NATIONS\\u002fYANGON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Friday that the United States was demanding  the immediate release  of two Reuters reporters arrested in Myanmar  or information as to the circumstances around their disappearance.  The United States joined mounting demands for the reporters to be freed. The United Nations, United Kingdom, Sweden and Bangladesh, among others, have denounced the arrests. The journalists, Wa Lone, 31, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 27, went missing on Tuesday after being invited to meet police officials over dinner on the northern outskirts of the city of Yangon. They had worked on stories about a military crackdown in Rakhine state, which has triggered the flight of more than 600,000 Rohingya Muslims to Bangladesh since late August. As of Friday, Reuters had not been formally contacted by officials about the detention of the reporters. The Ministry of Information has said that Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo  illegally acquired information with the intention to share it with foreign media,  and released a photo of the pair in handcuffs. Reuters President and Editor-in-Chief Stephen J. Adler has called for the immediate release of the journalists, saying in a statement on Wednesday that the global news organization was  outraged by this blatant attack on press freedom.   A court official in the northern district of Yangon where they were detained said that no paperwork had been filed relating to either journalist. The official said that usually cases are lodged 20-30 days after an arrest as suspects can be held in custody for up to 28 days without being charged. On Wednesday, Myanmar s Ministry of Information said the reporters and two policemen faced charges under the British colonial-era Official Secrets Act, though officials have since disclosed that they have not been charged. The 1923 law carries a maximum prison sentence of 14 years. Last month, the United States called the Myanmar military operation against the Rohingya population  ethnic cleansing  and threatened targeted sanctions against those responsible for what it called  horrendous atrocities.   Tillerson said at the United Nations on Friday that the United States had identified one individual as a sanctions target and was examining others over the campaign in Myanmar against minority Rohingya Muslims. Myanmar s 2-year-old government, led by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, has faced heavy international criticism for its response to the Rohingya crisis, though it has no control over the generals with whom it shares power. Rights monitors have accused Myanmar s military of atrocities, including killings, mass rape and arson, against the stateless Rohingya during so-called clearance operations after Rohingya militants  Aug. 25 attacks on 30 police posts and an army base. Amnesty International has called for a comprehensive arms embargo against Myanmar as well as targeted financial sanctions against senior Myanmar military officials. In calling for release of the Reuters reporters on Friday, Tillerson said,  A free press is vital to Myanmar s transition and becoming a viable democracy, and we want Myanmar s democracy to succeed.   He said the U.S. embassy in Myanmar was  expressing our concerns over the detention of individuals, demanding their immediate release or information as to the circumstances around their disappearance.  The embassy said in a statement on its Facebook page on Friday,  We remain concerned about Reuters journalists Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo.   Their families and others have not been allowed to see them, and don t even know where they are being held.  Tillerson s comments came in the wake of a rising chorus of concern in the West over Myanmar s action. The leaders of the U.S. Senate Human Rights Caucus, Republican Thom Tillis and Democrat Chris Coons, said they were  gravely concerned  about the arrests. Earlier on Friday at the United Nations, British Minister for Asia and the Pacific Mark Field said,  We will make it clear in the strongest possible terms that we feel that they need to be released at the earliest possible opportunity.  The nonprofit Committee to Protect Journalists also called for the reporters  unconditional release, saying,  These arrests come amid a widening crackdown which is having a grave impact on the ability of journalists to cover a story of vital global importance.    Swedish Foreign Minister Margot Wallstrom said the arrests were a  threat to a democratic and peaceful development of Myanmar and that region .  We do not accept that journalists are attacked or simply kidnapped or that they disappear,  Wallstrom told reporters on Friday at the United Nations. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on Thursday that the arrests were a signal that press freedom is shrinking in Myanmar and the international community must do all it can to get the reporters released. Britain has expressed  grave concerns  to the government of Myanmar over the arrest of the two journalists, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson told reporters in London on Thursday.  We are committed to freedom of speech and people s ability to report the facts and bring into the public domain what is happening in Rakhine state,  he said. Bangladesh, which is struggling to cope with the influx of  refugees into its southern tip, also condemned the arrests of reporters working for an agency that had shone a light for the world on the strife in Rakhine state.  We strongly denounce arrests of Reuters journalists and feel that those reporters be free immediately so that they can depict the truth to the world by their reporting,  said Iqbal Sobhan Chowdhury, information adviser to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.     In Japan, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe s spokesman Motosada Matano, said his government is closely watching the situation. He said Japan has been conducting a dialogue with the Myanmar government on human rights in Myanmar in general.  \"],[\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Cuba will make it easier for its U.S.-based citizens to travel to the island, Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez said on Saturday, in a gesture to win support from Cuban Americans during a diplomatic crisis over allegations of mysterious health attacks.  The U.S. government closes, and Cuba opens,  Rodriguez told a meeting of pro-Havana Cuban Americans in Washington. He said Cuban citizens in the United States would no longer need to have a special review of their Cuban passports to rehabilitate them before traveling to the island.  Rodriguez said that procedure had become more difficult due to staff shortages at the Cuban embassy after the U.S. government expelled 15 Cuban diplomats this month due to the dispute over the mystery attacks on U.S. personnel in Cuba.  It s unacceptable and immoral, from the point of view of the Cuban government, for people to be harmed by a difference between governments,  he said.  Some Cuban Americans said Havana was simply acceding to demands that it should have acceded to long ago, like allowing them home without a special procedure.  While the United States has not formally accused Cuba of carrying out what it says are attacks that have caused hearing loss and cognitive issues in its diplomats, President Donald Trump said last week Havana was responsible. Cuban government officials accused Trump this week of slandering their country. Tension over the alleged attacks, some of which involved high-pitched sounds, came after Trump said in June he wanted to partially roll back the historic detente between the United States and Cuba, ordering tighter restrictions on travel and trade. These have yet to be unveiled. Rodriguez said Cuba was making it easier for the children of Cubans in the United States to attain Cuban nationality and allowing Cuban Americans to travel to the country on cruise ships that embark at two ports on Cuba. Havana will also allow some Cubans who left the country illegally to return, he said.             There are roughly 2 million Cubans or Americans of Cuban origin in the United States. One attendee at the event, Andres Pertierra, a U.S.-born citizen with a Cuban father, said he was excited he now qualified for a Cuban passport.   These changes inspire gratitude and bring Cubans abroad closer to Cuban government,  said the legal assistant.  The Cuban government is making sure that it is clear that the weight of responsibility for failure to normalize falls squarely on the shoulders of the Trump administration.  \"],[\"LIMA (Reuters) - An emissary of an independence movement in the Western Sahara has spent two weeks in Lima airport and refuses to leave, after she was denied entry to Peru for alleged political activities on a prior visit, Peru s foreign ministry said on Wednesday. Jadiyetu El Mohtar is a Spanish citizen who describes herself as the ambassador to Peru for a disputed area in the Western Sahara known as the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR). Peru is one of a few dozen countries that has recognized the self-declared SADR, which the Polisario independence movement claims is a separate state from Morocco. SADR is not recognized as a state by the United Nations and Peru suspended diplomatic ties with SADR in 1996.   El Mohtar had hoped to help reestablish those ties, she told Reuters by phone from the international arrivals area of Lima s airport. She said she was awaiting an appeal to the decision to block her entry. Peru said El Mohtar had violated the terms of a tourist visa by taking part in political activities during a previous visit. It has refused to grant her another visa and urged her to comply with an order to fly back to Spain. El Mohtar has denied any wrongdoing and said her stay in Peru in July and August included meetings with environmentalists and feminists and did not violate migratory laws.  I am sleeping on an inflatable mattress,  El Mohtar said.  I have come to work to pave the way for re-establishing diplomatic relations with Peru.  Peru s foreign affairs ministry said it was not considering reestablishing diplomatic ties with SADR and does not recognize Polisario representatives as diplomats. El Mohtar said she has visited Colombia, Ecuador and Cuba without any problem. Earlier this year, Peru banned a Canadian activist and a U.S. journalist from Peru after they screened a film critical of a mining company in an Andean region while on tourist visas. In April, the U.N. Security Council unanimously backed attempts to restart talks between Morocco and Polisario over the Western Sahara conflict, and extended its peacekeeping mission there for another year. \"],[\"INDIANAPOLIS, Ind. (Reuters) - U.S. Republican Ted Cruz carefully left the door open to a future run for president on Tuesday after a campaign that outlasted a long list of rivals but could not overcome the anti-establishment appeal of Donald Trump. Cruz, who still holds his U.S. Senate seat from Texas for another two years before facing re-election in 2018, told supporters in Indiana where he lost badly in the state’s primary, that his campaign was suspended but that his role in the future of the party was not over. “I am not suspending our fight for liberty,” Cruz said. He could be among several Republicans who may resurface in the 2020 presidential campaign after failed bids this time, should the presumptive nominee this year, Donald Trump, falter in the Nov. 8 election. The 45-year-old Cruz became a favorite of evangelicals and the party’s conservative wing after he won Iowa’s caucuses, the first nominating contest of the race. He built the best organization of any other Republican campaign this year, but his zealous conservatism fell victim to Trump’s outsider appeal. In the days leading up to the Indiana vote, Republicans were reminded of Cruz’s take-no-prisoners approach in the Senate when former House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner called him “Lucifer in the flesh” and the “most miserable son of a bitch” he had ever worked with on Capitol Hill. The next test for Cruz will be determining what role he will play in the general election and whether, after months of attacks, he will throw his support behind Trump. Trump clearly would like his support as he tries to unite the Republican Party after a bitter primary battle. “I want to congratulate Ted Cruz,” Trump said in New York at a victory rally. “He’s a tough, smart competitor.” Cruz, the son of a Cuban immigrant, gained prominence in conservative circles as the Texas solicitor general, arguing cases on religious liberty and states’ rights. After he was elected to the Senate in 2012, he alienated colleagues but drew national attention for his role in the 2013 government shutdown.  In a 21-hour talkathon, in which he sought to convince lawmakers to cut funding for President Barack Obama’s signature health-care law, Cruz chided the “cheap suits” and “bad haircuts” of some politicians and read the children’s book “Green Eggs and Ham” by Dr. Seuss. Cruz cast himself as the leader of a grassroots conservative army when he jumped into the White House race in March 2015, and he argued he was the only candidate who could unite disparate groups of the Republican Party, such as social conservatives and libertarians. He was buoyed by early wins in Iowa and at home in Texas, and Cruz claimed he was the Republican best suited to take on Trump after candidates favored by the party’s establishment, such as Jeb Bush, left the race. As Cruz ended his campaign, vendors hawking campaign-themed apparel outside the Indianapolis event quickly discounted the merchandise bearing Cruz’s campaign slogan, lowering prices from $20 a shirt to just $5. Supporters lingered in the remodeled train station where Cruz held his rally, some crying and others hugging one another as the news sunk in. Despite having long odds when he announced his candidacy, Cruz beat expectations.      “Cruz certainly performed better than anyone in Washington expected, and he still has Texas wired. However, no one is stopping the Trump machine now,” Texas-based Republican strategist Joe Brettell said. \"],[\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Republicans and Democrats have reached agreement on legislation that allows new sanctions against Russia, Iran and North Korea, leading congressional Democrats said on Saturday, in a bill that would limit any potential effort by President Donald Trump to try to lift sanctions against Moscow.      The Countering Iran’s Destabilizing Activities Act, which was passed by the Senate a month ago, was held up in the House of Representatives after Republicans proposed including North Korea sanctions in the bill. The House is set to vote on Tuesday on a package of bills on sanctions covering Russia, Iran and North Korea, according to House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy’s office. The measure will “hold them accountable for their dangerous actions,” McCarthy said in a statement Saturday. Under the proposed bill, Trump must submit to Congress a report on proposed actions that would “significantly alter” U.S. foreign policy in connection with Russia, including easing sanctions or returning diplomatic properties in Maryland and New York that former President Barack Obama ordered vacated in December. Congress would have at least 30 days to hold hearings and then vote to uphold or reject Trump’s proposed changes. Many lawmakers hope the bill will send a message to Trump to keep a strong line against Russia.  Trump, who met Putin at the Group of 20 summit in Hamburg earlier this month and said it was an “honor” to meet him, has been criticized for seeking to reset U.S.-Russian relations. His administration has been bogged down by ongoing investigations of possible ties between his 2016 campaign and Russia. With the bill, Republicans and Democrats are seeking to punish Russia for its 2014 annexation of Crimea, a peninsula belong to Ukraine, and for meddling in the 2016 presidential election. Putin has denied any meddling in the U.S. democratic process last year. Trump has said that his campaign did not collude with Russia. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said Russia’s “outrageous and unacceptable” behavior in the 2016 U.S. election and in Europe “demand that we have strong statutory sanctions enacted as soon as possible.” Even so, she expressed concerns that by including North Korea the legislation could face procedural delays in the Senate. Senior Republican lawmakers did not immediately comment on the latest bill. In Brussels, the European Union sounded an alarm about the U.S. moves to step up sanctions on Russia, urging Washington to coordinate with its Group of 7 partners.  The European Commission, the EU’s executive body, warned of possibly “wide and indiscriminate” “unintended consequences,” notably on the EU’s efforts to diversify energy sources away from Russia. McCarthy and Ed Royce, chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said in a statement the revised bill helps “bolster the energy security of our European allies by maintaining their access to key energy resources outside of Russia.” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said a strong sanctions bill “is essential,” and said in a statement that he expects “the House and Senate will act on this legislation promptly, on a broad bipartisan basis.” Senator Ben Cardin, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said the agreement was reached after “intense negotiations.” “A nearly united Congress is poised to send President Putin a clear message on behalf of the American people and our allies, and we need President Trump to help us deliver that message,” he said in a statement. \"],[\"ROME (Reuters) - Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni will meet U.S. President Donald Trump in the United States on April 20, diplomatic sources said on Monday. Italy holds the rotating presidency of the Group of Seven industrialized nations and is due to host a summit of leaders in Sicily in May, which is expected to be Trump’s first trip to Europe as president. Trump has already met a number of major power leaders in Washington since taking office in January, including British Prime Minister Theresa May and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. \"],[\"PARIS (Reuters) - French state-controlled utility EDF (EDF.PA) wants to take part in Saudi Arabia s plans to build nuclear power reactors, its chief executive told Reuters on Monday. Saudi Arabia, which wants to reduce oil consumption at home, is considering building 17.6 gigawatts of nuclear-powered electricity generating capacity by 2032 and has sent a request for information to international suppliers to build two reactors.  Sources familiar with the situation said last month EDF has already held talks with Saudi Arabia about selling Areva-designed European Pressurized Reactors (EPR) and that it wants to participate in a possible Saudi nuclear tender. Levy said that EDF wants to take part in the country s move away from relying on fossil fuels for its energy supplies.   We will respond to this opportunity in all the energy technologies in which we have competencies, that is in solar, wind and nuclear,  Levy said. Russian and South Korean companies have already said they plan to bid for the Saudi work on nuclear power while sources have said Toshiba-owned U.S. firm Westinghouse (6502.T) is in talks with U.S. peers to form a bidding consortium.  In 2009 EDF and Areva lost out to South Korea s KEPCO (052690.KS) in the bidding to build nuclear reactors in the United Arab Emirates, the first such project in the Middle East.  EDF is set to buy French nuclear group Areva s reactor engineering division Areva NP in a deal expected to be finalised before the end of this year. Levy said EDF is on track to finalize the deal before the end of this month. \"],[\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department has approved the possible sale to India of one Boeing C-17 transport aircraft, with an estimated cost of $366 million, a Pentagon agency said on Monday. The Defense Security Cooperation Agency said in a statement it notified Congress on Monday of the sale, which includes four turbofan engines, a missile warning system, a countermeasures dispensing system and an identification friend or foe transponder.      \"],[\"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain won a vote of confidence from its economically important life sciences sector on Wednesday as several major drug companies committed to invest in the country under the government s industrial strategy plans after Brexit. The move is welcome news for Prime Minister Theresa May, who has struggled to win over large sections of industry as Britain prepares to leave the European Union. Thanks to the strength of UK universities and the presence of two major pharmaceuticals companies in GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca, the drugs industry has been a bright spot in the British economy for many years.  But the highly regulated sector faces potential obstacles to trade as a result of Brexit unless London and Brussels manage to align regulatory regimes for medicines. In a bid to soften the blow, the government has backed a report by immunologist and geneticist John Bell designed to boost the pharmaceutical sector via fresh public-private collaborations. That has paved the way for the Life Sciences Sector Deal, which will see GSK invest 40 million pounds ($54 million) of new money in genomic research, including a plan to sequence DNA from all 500,000 volunteer participants enrolled in UK Biobank, the world s most detailed biomedical database. GSK s head of research Patrick Vallance said the deal showed Britain remained an attractive place for drug discovery, but he cautioned:  The UK needs to recognize going forward that science is an international endeavor, not a parochial endeavor.  Other investments by pharma companies include plans by Johnson & Johnson and the Medicines Co to work on new clinical trials and genetic research by AstraZeneca. U.S. drugmaker Merck & Co had already announced plans to expand UK research operations under the deal last week. In all, the government said the deal brought together existing and future commitments by 25 global organizations. Other companies in discussions with the government about investments include Philips, Roche Diagnostics, Siemens, GE Healthcare and Toshiba Medical Systems. As a key part of the deal, the government said it was committed to increasing investment in R&D to 2.4 percent of GDP by 2027 and 3 percent over the longer term. \"],[\"(Reuters) - Two key U.S. congressional committee members on Friday called for an investigation into whether Mylan NV, under fire for raising the price of its EpiPen device, overcharged the government’s low-income healthcare program for the allergy treatment. In a letter to the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, Senator Ron Wyden and Representative Frank Pallone, both Democrats, seek clarification of whether EpiPen was classified as a generic, “non-innovator” drug, or a brand-name drug by the Medicaid program. Under current law, branded drugs, and generic drugs available from a single source, are required to pay a rebate amount of at least 23.1 percent of the average manufacturer price. Generic drugs are subject to a much lower 13 percent rebate. Mylan, in an emailed statement, said it has complied with all laws and regulations regarding Medicaid rebates, and intends to file with regulators, by next April as required under new guidelines, for EpiPen to be classified as a “non-innovator” product. The device jabs a dose of the drug epinephrine into the thigh to counter dangerous allergic reactions such as to peanuts, food allergies and bee stings.  Mylan, whose tax address is in the Netherlands but which has corporate headquarters in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, has raised the U.S. price of EpiPen from less than $100 when it acquired the product in 2007 to more than $600. Amid an outcry by parents, consumer groups and U.S. politicians, the company said on Monday it will soon launch the first generic version of the device for $300, half the list price of its branded product.  Wyden, ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee, and Pallone, ranking member of the House Energy & Commerce Committee, said in the letter on Friday: “It has recently come to our attention that Mylan has classified EpiPen as a generic drug” under the Medicaid rebate program, even though it is considered a new drug by the Food and Drug Administration. Shares of Mylan, which fell 4.7 percent to close at $39.97 on Friday, have dropped 19 percent since mid-August. \"],[\"TRIPOLI (Reuters) - At least five African migrants died and more were missing off western Libya on Monday after a boat carrying about 140 people capsized and then some migrants refused rescue by the Libyan coast guard and tried instead to swim to a German rescue vessel. The migrants  rubber boat overturned some 30 miles off the Libyan coast, said Libyan officials and rescue workers in Tripoli to where the coast guard brought some 45 survivors. A video obtained by Reuters showed how, during the rescue operation, some migrants tried jumping off the Libyan patrol boat which had rescued them to reach a ship of Seawatch, a German non-governmental organization, a few meters away. Some screamed to be allowed to leave the Libyan boat as the German vessel came closer. The Libyans tried to discourage the migrants from trying to reach the German boat, Seawatch said. The incident sparked mutual recrimination by Seawatch and the Libyan coast guard. At least five migrants had died, including a toddler, due to the  violent and reckless behavior of (the) Libyan coast guards,  Seawatch said on its Twitter feed, adding that 58 had been rescued.  The so-called Libyan Coastguard forced as many as they could into their vessel to take them back to Tripoli,  the German group added. The Libyan coast guard said an unknown number of people had died after their inflatable boat had sunk and Abu Ajala Amer Abdelbari, a coast guard commander, said the German NGO had undermined its rescue operations by approaching its boat.  The Seawatch was approaching while we were rescuing migrants,  he said.  This was encouraging the migrants to swim to the Seawatch and a (nearby) French navy ship.  The survivors brought to Tripoli were from West African countries including Nigeria and Senegal.  I wanted to reach Italy. I don t know what to do now,  said Dora Onoruyi, a 23-year old arts student from the southern Nigerian city of Benin known as hub for human traffickers to smuggle women to Italy where they often end up as prostitutes.  I see no future in Nigeria, there are no jobs,  she said, standing next to a group of weeping Nigerian survivors. Libya is the main departure point for migrants trying to travel by boat to Europe. But numbers crossing to Italy have fallen sharply since July due to a drop in people smuggling and increased activity by Libya s European-backed coastguard. \"],[\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Republican plan backed by President Donald Trump to overhaul the U.S. healthcare system passed through a second congressional panel on Thursday, despite controversy among lawmakers, hospitals and insurers about its unknown costs and impact on coverage. The House of Representatives Energy and Commerce Committee approved the proposal to repeal and replace former President Barack Obama’s “Affordable Care Act” by a vote of 31-23, after debating the draft legislation for more than 24 hours. The plan had been approved early on Thursday by the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee. \"],[\" SEOUL, (Reuters) - In 2009, a pop video from North Korea celebrated a new national hero - one that outside experts would later realize was at the heart of the secretive state s banned nuclear and missile programs.  That hero, widely available in factories across the world, was the Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machine.  Big, grey and boxy, CNC machines use pre-programmed guides to produce intricate parts for everything from automobiles and mobile phones to furniture and clothes. They offer accuracy that human machine tool operators are unable to achieve.  In North Korea, thanks to a combination of homemade technology and reverse engineering, the machines now play a critical role in the weapons programs. They allow Kim Jong Un to build nuclear bombs and missiles without relying as heavily on outside technical aid or imports.  Nuclear weapons experts say this has helped him accelerate missile and nuclear testing despite international sanctions on the transfer of sensitive equipment.  Special Section: North Korea revealed. Interactive: Nuclear North Korea  Interactive: Kim s latest act of defiance  North Korea s centrifuges and new missiles all depend on components made with CNC machine tools,  said Jeffrey Lewis, head of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the Middlebury Institute of Strategic Studies at Monterey, California.   (They) are the essential underlying technology for producing missiles and nuclear weapons,  said Lewis.  Since 1996, CNC machines have been included in the Wassenaar Arrangement   an international arms control regime aimed at stopping the proliferation of equipment with both civilian and military uses. North Korea is not a signatory.  The country s celebrations of its CNC technology have been fulsome. Hundreds of dancers in luminous orange and green performed the CNC pop song, titled  Break through the cutting edge,  at a Korean Workers  Party celebration in 2010. In 2012, the year the South Korean hit  Gangnam Style  was released, the North s CNC title was on karaoke machines nationwide, according to Choson Exchange, a Singapore-based company that trains North Koreans in business skills. The official video for the song opens with a long-range North Korean rocket soaring into a blue sky.  North Korea likely started to develop its own CNC machines in the early 1990s as part of a drive to build sophisticated missiles and nuclear weapons, nuclear experts say. It probably learned how to make them by taking apart machines it had imported from the Soviet Union.  Its first homemade CNC machine was introduced in 1995. Former leader Kim Jong Il gave the machine the  Ryonha  brand, according to a 2009 article in the country s official newspaper, Rodong Sinmun. That was the first time state media mentioned the technology.  By 2009, the machines had become a mainstay of North Korean propaganda, as Pyongyang launched a nationwide campaign to boost domestic industry. Sanctions were mounting after its second nuclear test and a long-range missile launch that year.  At the time, arms control experts raised concerns about a visit by former leader Kim Jong Il to a North Korean factory where homemade CNC machines appeared to be producing aluminum tubes. These could be used for nuclear centrifuges.   By around 2010, it seemed they were capable of manufacturing various types of CNC machines,  said Kim Heung-gwang, a North Korean defector who taught at Pyongyang s Hamhung Computer Technology University before defecting to South Korea.  But it wasn t until 2013 that the Korea Ryonha Machinery Joint Venture Corporation, which produced the machines, was blacklisted by the U.N. Security Council for supporting the weapons programs.  And it was only in August this year that U.S. intelligence officials told Reuters North Korea likely has the ability to produce its own missile engines themselves. (Full Story)  Now, Kim Heung-gwang estimates, North Korea has about 15,000 CNC machines. He bases this on North Korean state media reports and photos as well as interviews with more than a dozen defectors who were scientists, professors or factory workers.  Pyongyang hailed the homemade machines as a triumph for its governing ideology of  Juche , which champions self-sufficiency. But that wasn t strictly true.  In August 2016, state media released photos of Kim Jong Un visiting a factory using CNC machines with the logo of Swiss engineering firm ABB ABB.UL, one of the leading players in the global CNC machine market. It s not clear when or how the machine reached North Korea.  ABB said the firm respects all applicable trade sanctions against North Korea, and undertakes not to deliver ABB equipment to the country.  That said, we cannot rule out that some of our equipment may have been resold to DPR of Korea without our knowledge or permission,  the company said in response to a Reuters inquiry, using North Korea s official title.  A United Nations panel monitoring sanctions on North Korea said in a report this year that Tengzhou Keyongda CNC Machine Tools Co of China had been a supplier of Pyongyang s new CNC machines. A sales representative for Tengzhou Keyongda told Reuters the company stopped selling CNC machines to North Korea four years ago, and no longer maintains trade relations with the country.  Despite sanctions, CNC machines are commonplace across North Korean manufacturing and can be brought in through China and Russia, said Lee Choon-geun, a senior fellow at the Science and Technology Policy Institute in South Korea.  The biggest loophole has been that while some CNC machines are banned because they can have both military and civilian functions, most serve civilian industry.  Given their dual-use capability, you could even import the machines for other purposes, take them to pieces and use them however you want,  said Lee.  The CNC song highlights this in its opening line:  Whatever it is, once we put our mind to it, there s a program to make it,  it says.  \"],[\"DUBAI (Reuters) - Bahrain s top Shi ite Muslim cleric underwent surgery on Friday, activists said, after he was hospitalized following months under virtual house arrest. News of Ayatollah Isa Qassim s fragile health has stoked tension in Bahrain as the Sunni Muslim-led monarchy pursues a crackdown on dissent by majority Shi ites.  The leading Shia cleric was transferred this morning at 7:30 am to Ibn al-Nafees Hospital to undergo urgent surgery,  the London-based Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy (BIRD) said in a statement.  Upon his arrival, he went into surgery and he is expecting further operations.  Qassim, who is believed to be in his 70s, was suffering constant pain and excreting blood, citing a groin hernia, diabetes and a form of heart disease, the group said on Nov 27. The Interior Ministry said in June 2016 that Qassim s citizenship had been revoked, accusing him of trying to divide Bahraini society, encourage youths to violate the constitution and promote a sectarian environment in the Gulf Arab state. The decision sparked angry protests in Bahrain and drew sharp condemnation from regional Shi ite power Iran and statements of concern from the United States and Britain. In May, five people were killed when security forces raided Qassim s homevillage to disperse followers. The Sunni-ruled kingdom   where the U.S. Fifth Fleet is based   has pursued a crackdown on members of the Shi ite community since, with Saudi help, it quashed 2011  Arab Spring  protests calling for more rights and representation. Authorities have closed opposition political groupings, revoked dissidents  passports and arrested suspected militants accused of being backed by its arch-foe, Shi ite Iran. \"],[\"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said on Friday it was not possible to put a concrete figure on the amount of money Britain will have to pay the EU upon exiting the bloc because numbers may change in the future.

He said he was satisfied with the agreement between the EU and Britain that no EU country, including Britain, would have to pay more or receive less as a result of Britain s decision to leave the bloc in 2019. \"],[\"BOSTON (Reuters) - Americans blame political gridlock in Washington for the country’s declining economic competitiveness and hold both Democrats and Republicans responsible, a Harvard Business School study released on Wednesday found. The study noted that U.S. gross domestic product grew at a rate of about 2 percent since 2000, well below the 3 to 4 percent average in the prior half-century. It said a range of factors including a complicated corporate tax code, tangled immigration system and aging roads contribute to the slow growth.   The study contends that factors including a growing wealth gap, declines in productivity growth and a rise in the number of working-age people neither employed nor seeking jobs show that the U.S. economy is becoming less competitive. A majority of the school’s alumni surveyed said they believed the U.S. political system was hurting the economy. That view crossed party lines, with 82 percent of Republicans, 74 percent of independents and 56 percent of Democrats agreeing. “Only a minority of members of either party felt that their own party was acting in a way that supported economic growth,” said Jan Rivkin, a professor at Harvard Business School and co-author of the report. The survey did not ask whether respondents preferred Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump or Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. Some respondents worry that neither candidate for the White House could overcome gridlock in Washington, Rivkin said, adding “Anyone elected into the current system would face pressure toward paralysis.” A concurrent survey of the general public found smaller, but still significant, numbers blaming the political system for a languishing U.S. economy. Some 49 percent of Republicans, 38 percent of independents and 26 percent of Democrats at large said politics were hurting growth. The study contends partisan gridlock is preventing the federal government from tackling structural problems facing the U.S. economy, and suggested steps to address that gridlock. Among them: Changing rules that allow lawmakers to “gerrymander” districts to ensure one party’s dominance; reforming campaign finance; setting term limits in the House and Senate, and eliminating party control of the federal legislative process.  The study comes a day after the Census Bureau reported median household income surged 5.2 percent last year to $56,500, its highest since 2007. The surveys included responses from 4,807 alumni of Harvard Business School from May 3 through June 6 and 1,048 members of the general public polled June 10-26. The public survey had a margin of error of 3.3 percentage points, margin of error does not apply to the alumni survey as it was not a random sample. \"],[\"LONDON (Reuters) - A man who refused to provide passwords to his electronic devices when stopped by British police was found guilty under terrorism laws at a court in London on Monday, in a case that campaigners say threatens personal privacy. Muhammad Rabbani, 36, the international director of campaign group CAGE was found guilty of wilfully obstructing or seeking to frustrate an examination or search, and given a conditional 12-month discharge, and was ordered to pay a 620 pound ($830) fine. CAGE is an advocacy group which campaigns against the impact of counter-terrorism policies, and came to international attention over its links to Jihadi John, a British Islamic militant, before he went to Syria. Rabbani said he was returning from a wedding in Qatar when he was stopped at Heathrow last November. Police seized his phone and computer, and demanded the passwords for the devices. Rabbani said that he had not provided the passwords as he wanted to protect the privacy of a client who he was working with on an anti-torture case. However, judge Emma Arbuthnot found that Rabbani was lawfully required to provide the passwords. Rabbani said he would appeal the decision. He was held under Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000, which was used to detain David Miranda, the partner of the journalist who brought leaks from former U.S. spy agency contractor Edward Snowden to world attention in 2013.  Rabbani said that the law poses a threat to personal privacy, and told reporters and supporters outside the court that the decision  highlights the absurdity of the Schedule 7 law.    They accept that at no point was I under suspicion, and that ultimately this was a matter of having been profiled,  he said, referring to the judge and prosecution.  There are important implications for our collective privacy, as Schedule 7 acts as a digital strip-search.  But the police welcomed the verdict.  Today s verdict is an important one. It s crucial that police are able to use the legislation that exists to help keep the public safe,  said Commander Dean Haydon, head of the Met Police Counter Terrorism Command, in a statement, adding that Schedule 7 was a vital tool in the fight against terrorism.  The Met has retained Rabbani s phone and laptop and is continuing its efforts to examine the contents.

In July, Sri Lanka signed a long-delayed $1.1 billion deal to lease its southern Hambantota port to China, ignoring an appeal by opposition parties to debate the pact in parliament. The $1.5-billion port, close to the main shipping route from Asia to Europe and likely to play a key role in China s  Belt and Road  initiative, has been mired in controversy since a Chinese firm agreed to take an 80 percent stake in it. The pact signed last year sparked widespread public anger, as Chinese control of the port, which included a plan for a 99-year lease of 15,000 acres (23 sq miles) to develop an adjacent industrial zone, provoked fears it could be used by Chinese naval vessels. Sri Lanka Foreign Minister Tilak Marapana told a reception in Beijing to mark the 60th anniversary of establishing diplomatic ties that the two countries  friendship went back centuries.  Sri Lanka is very keen to reach an early conclusion to the free trade agreement with China in the near future that would expand more trade avenues for both countries,  Marapana said.  China has been a reliable and important partner in our drive towards economic development and Sri Lanka is appreciative of the country s commitment and assistance,  he added, without mentioning any specific projects. As one of the first countries to help in Sri Lanka s post-war reconstruction after the 2009 end of its 26-year civil war, China s ties with Sri Lanka have unnerved India, traditionally the island nation s most important partner.     By 2014, Chinese navy submarines were also docking in Colombo, raising alarm in New Delhi and prompting a push by the administration of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to claw back influence in the region.  Sri Lanka is deeply appreciative of China for being a true and trusted friend and ally during our times of need,  Marapana said. \"],[\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s administration has been contacting U.S. energy companies to ask them about their views on the U.N. global climate accord, according to two sources with knowledge of the effort, a sign Trump is reconsidering his 2016 campaign pledge to back out of the deal. The sources, who asked not to be named because they are not authorized to speak publicly on the subject, said many of the companies reached by the administration had said they would prefer the United States remain in the pact, but would also support reducing U.S. commitments in the deal.  The accord, agreed by nearly 200 countries in Paris in 2015, would limit planetary warming in part by slashing carbon dioxide and other emissions from the burning of fossil fuels. As part of the deal, the United States committed to reducing its emissions by between 26 and 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025. The sources did not name the companies contacted.  One of the sources said the companies were “publicly traded fossil fuel companies,” and added the White House would consider their input in making a decision on the Paris accord shortly. The source said the White House has been leading the discussions with the fossil fuel companies and the State Department, which represents the United States in climate negotiations, had not taken part.   A White House official declined to comment. Trump has called climate change a hoax and vowed during his campaign for the White House to “cancel the Paris Climate Agreement” within 100 days, claiming it would be too costly for the U.S. economy.  Since being elected he has been mostly quiet on the issue. In a New York Times interview in November he said he would keep an open mind about the Paris deal. He and members of his family and inner circle also met with climate change advocate and former Vice President Al Gore in December.     Officials for Exxon Mobil, ConocoPhillips, Chevron, Peabody Energy Corp and others did not immediately comment when asked about whether they had been contacted by the White House about the Paris accord. But several, including Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips, have expressed public support for the pact. The World Coal Association, which represents Peabody and other miners, has also said it supports the deal. Exxon Mobil Chief Executive Darren Woods recently called the pledges that came out of the Paris agreement an “effective framework” for dealing with emissions, and pointed to Exxon’s own work to cut its carbon emissions. In comments on Exxon’s website, Woods wrote: “I believe, and my company believes, that climate risks warrant action and it’s going to take all of us – business, governments and consumers – to make meaningful progress.”   Rex Tillerson, Exxon’s former CEO and now U.S. Secretary of State, also supported remaining a part of the climate change discussion during his confirmation hearing. He said he did not see climate change as an imminent national security threat but said the U.S. would be “better served by being at that table” and remaining a party to climate change negotiations. Conoco CEO Ryan Lance similarly said he favored the U.S. remaining in the Paris agreement, during CERAWeek comments last week, in part because it could create opportunities for its natural gas operations and its investments in carbon-capture and storage.  Benjamin Sporton, the president of the World Coal Association, had a similar stance: “With a number of well-developed carbon capture and storage projects, the United States is already a global leader in cleaner coal technology. Given the role given to low emissions coal technology in the Paris Agreement by many developing economies, there are clear benefits to remaining within the agreement.”  J. Robinson West, former chairman of Magellan Petroleum Corp., and now a managing director at Boston Consulting Group, said President Trump’s anti-Paris accord sentiments probably reflected his dealings with the CEOs of smaller companies that operate only in the U.S. “The independents are anti-climate change ... all this stuff costs them money. The global companies operate all over the world. They have to operate at one standard - the highest standard - wherever they operate,” he said.  Global oil companies have spent heavily on environmental initiatives in recent years. Exxon Mobil, for example, logged $4.9 billion in environmental spending in 2016, about 2.24 percent of total revenue, according to its annual report with the Securities and Exchanges Commission. ConocoPhillips spent $627 million, or 2.57 percent of revenue. \"],[\"BOCHUM, Germany (Reuters) - A 77-year-old spy, known as Germany s James Bond for his secret missions during and after the Cold War, was convicted of tax evasion on Thursday and handed a suspended two-year sentence.  Werner Mauss, whose career spanned 40 years, says on his website that he was involved in smashing more than 100 criminal gangs and in the arrests of around 2,000 individuals. In a trial that has been going on for about a year, Mauss - who wore a hooded jacket in court - was accused of concealing millions of euros from German tax authorities in offshore accounts between 2002 and 2011.  Ultimately, the extent of the damage is only one aspect to consider (in determining the sentence),  said Volker Talarowski, spokesman of the court in Bochum.  All aspects have to be considered, among them the age of the defendant. The defendant is 77 years old and he has never been sentenced, and he has achieved a special life s work.  German authorities say nothing about Mauss. But media credit him with being one of Germany s most distinguished undercover agents. The Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper said he had had 100 different identities and a line to the chancellor s office. The charges were raised after the Sueddeutsche Zeitung  named him as being involved with shell companies exposed by the  Panama Papers , documents leaked by law firm Mossack Fonseca.  He is one of the most mysterious figures in post-war German history. He was used by countries, companies and individuals as a private agent,  the newspaper said at the time.  He worked for the German foreign and domestic intelligence agencies and the police.  They named him  the Institution M.  Mauss argued the offshore accounts were set up by third parties to pay for undercover missions, such as the freeing of hostages. He says he was involved in finding treasure from Cologne Cathedral hidden near Belgrade in the 1970s and catching the robbers.  He also says he helped in the arrest of Red Army Faction militant Rolf Pohle in Athens, as well as being involved in hostage releases in Lebanon and Colombia.  \"],[\"PRETORIA (Reuters) - South Africa s High Court ruled on Wednesday that President Jacob Zuma must set up a judicial inquiry into state influence-peddling within 30 days, the latest in a series of judicial blows to his scandal-tinged administration. Upholding a recommendation by South Africa s corruption-fighting Public Protector, High Court Judge President Dunstan Mlambo said an application by Zuma challenging the inquiry was  ill-advised and reckless  and an abuse of the judicial process. The ruling comes days after the same court dealt a stinging rebuke to Zuma by ruling that his appointment of a state prosecutor to decide whether to reinstate corruption charges against him was not valid and should be set aside immediately. Zuma had challenged the right of the Public Protector to call for a judicial inquiry and the appointment by the chief justice of a judge to head it, saying it was the president s prerogative whether to set up such an inquiry. It was not immediately clear if Zuma would appeal against  Wednesday s ruling and his spokesman was not immediately available to comment. The 75-year-old president has faced and denied numerous corruption allegations since taking office in 2009 and has survived several votes of no-confidence in parliament.  In October, the Supreme Court of Appeal upheld an earlier High Court decision reinstating nearly 800 corruption charges relating to an arms deal that were filed against Zuma but shelved before he ran for president in 2009. The revival of the charges could increase pressure on Zuma to step down before his term ends in 2019. Several judicial setbacks have undermined Zuma s authority and some analysts say it could diminish his influence over who succeeds him when the ruling African National Congress (ANC) chooses a new leader this month. Political instability, including questions over who will replace Zuma has been cited by credit rating agencies as a major factor behind their decision to cut South Africa to  junk . Africa s most industrialized economy has grown lethargically over the last six years and the jobless rate stands near record levels. Analysts say the political crisis is making it hard to reform the economy, improve social services and fight crime. The influence-peddling inquiry was recommended in a report released a year ago by the Public Protector, whose job is to uphold standards in public life.  Zuma also sought to block the release of the report, entitled  State of Capture , which focused on allegations that Zuma s friends, the businessmen and brothers Ajay, Atul and Rajesh Gupta, had influenced the appointment of ministers. Zuma and the Guptas have denied all accusations of wrongdoing. Ordering Zuma to pay the costs of the latest court challenge, Judge President Mlambo said the South African leader s conduct was  clearly objectionable ... and amounts to clear abuse of the judicial process . A judicial commission was best suited to investigate the allegations against Zuma, Mlambo said, adding:  The allegations ... detailed in the report are extremely serious.   The court ordered that once the inquiry is set up, it should complete its task and present its report to Zuma within 180 days. The president would then have to inform parliament within 14 days of what action he planned to take based on the inquiry s findings, the court said.  In a statement, the ANC   some of whose lawmakers are critical of Zuma   said a judicial inquiry was crucial in verifying the allegations in the watchdog s report.   We therefore trust President Jacob Zuma will implement this judgment without delay in the interest of our country,  it said.   Opposition leader Mmusi Maimane, who was at the court, welcomed the ruling.  The judgment lays out a timeline ... we hope to get to the bottom of this,  Maimane said, adding that his party would oppose any appeal in the case should Zuma launch one.    Thuli Madonsela, the report s author, who was also at the court, said:  An allegation that the state has been captured in the interests of the president and his friends is an allegation that needs to be investigated immediately.  Her 355-page report stopped short of asserting that crimes had been committed, saying the watchdog lacked the resources to reach such conclusions and that they should be investigated by a judicial inquiry. Zuma has said he will appeal against the High Court s ruling on Friday that his appointment of a state prosecutor was not valid and that Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa should instead appoint a new public prosecutor within 60 days. Ramaphosa, the main rival for the ANC leadership to former African Union chairwoman Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, who is Zuma s favored candidate and ex-wife, has recently stepped up criticism of Zuma s scandal-plagued government.  \"],[\"SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chilean President Michelle Bachelet welcomed more than 60 Syrian refugees to the country s capital of Santiago on Thursday, as Chile joined other Latin American nations in offering safe harbor to families fleeing Syria s civil war. At a ceremony at the country s airport in Santiago, Bachelet  greeted 14 newly arrived Syrian families, who will be resettled in furnished homes with social benefits, including monthly stipends, schooling, healthcare and language classes.  We know you have struggled and what we hope is that, in our country, you will find a place to rebuild your lives,  Bachelet said. More than 2 million people fleeing wars or persecution have joined the ranks of the world s refugees in 2017, according to the United Nations, even as the United States and countries in Europe have begun to implement ever more restrictive asylum policies. The humanitarian crisis has prompted several South American nations, including Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Colombia, to begin accepting small numbers of refugees from Syria. \"],[\"GENEVA (Reuters) - The World Health Organization (WHO) on Friday urged U.S. President-elect Donald Trump to expand Obamacare and ensure all Americans have access to healthcare. The real estate magnate takes office next month after promising to repeal outgoing President Barack Obama’s signature healthcare policy which helped millions more Americans get medical insurance but has been a target of Republican attacks. Agnes Soucat, the WHO’s director of health system governance and financing, said there were various ways of providing health cover to more people, and it amounted to “political choices.” “We as the WHO really encourage the new administration to make sure that the social contract is expanded and that all U.S. citizens have access to health care,” Soucat told a news briefing in Geneva. The United States is the only country among the 35 member states of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) not to provide universal health care, a key  U.N. Sustainable Development Goal for 2030, she said. The Affordable Care Act, known commonly as Obamacare, has provided some 25 million previously uninsured Americans with health cover. Republicans say it has created unwarranted government intervention in personal healthcare and private industry. Trump in late November picked Republican U.S. Representative Tom Price, an orthopedic surgeon from Georgia and Obamacare critic, to be his health secretary. Price has long championed a plan of tax credits, expanded health savings accounts, and lawsuit reforms to replace Obamacare. Republicans are divided over how quickly an Obamacare repeal should go into effect, with some saying a delay would give them time to work on a replacement, instead of throwing millions of Americans out of their health insurance with no substitute. “There are different strategies to make universal health care particularly pro-poor,” Soucat said. “So what we are saying is, yes, this would be a setback if people would lose coverage.” \"],[\"ATHENS (Reuters) - Two Macedonian nationals wanted by Interpol have been arrested in Greece over their alleged involvement in a wiretap scandal that brought down Macedonia s government, a police official said on Thursday. Two years of political turmoil were triggered in 2015 after opposition parties accused then prime minister Nikola Gruevski and his counter-intelligence chief of orchestrating the wiretapping of more than 20,000 people. The EU, which Macedonia aspires to join, was forced to broker an agreement in which parties agreed to hold early elections and establish the office of a special prosecutor to investigate the content of the wiretaps. A new government was formed in May.  The two Macedonians, aged 51 and 35, are accused of destroying machines used in wiretapping, a police official said on condition of anonymity.  They were arrested on Wednesday at the airport in the northern Greek city of Thessaloniki carrying fake Bulgarian passports, the official said. Greek police said the men were also accused of setting up a criminal gang to carry out technology-related crimes.  They are due to appear before a prosecutor on Thursday. In June, Macedonia s special prosecutor filed charges against 94 people, including former high government officials, over their involvement in alleged crimes revealed in tapes that emerged during the surveillance scandal. \"],[\"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India will provide Myanmar with $25 million for development projects including prefabricated houses in troubled Rakhine state to enable the return of Rohingya Muslims who have fled the area, the foreign ministry said on Thursday. More than 600,000 Rohingya have escaped to Bangladesh after attacks by insurgents on Myanmar security forces in August triggered a military crackdown that the United Nations has called ethnic cleansing.  The international community demands the Rohingya be allowed to go home in safety, and Bangladesh and Myanmar have begun talks on repatriation, but huge doubts remain about the Rohingya ever being able to return in peace to rebuild homes and till fields. India, which is concerned about the influx of the refugees into its territory, has stressed economic development of the Rakhine region as a way to help lower tensions.  Foreign Secretary Subrahmanyam Jaishankar held talks with Myanmar leaders on Wednesday and signed a memorandum of understanding to support development of Rakhine and help create jobs.   This is intended to help the Government of Myanmar achieve its objective of restoration of normalcy in Rakhine State and enable the return of displaced persons,  the Indian foreign ministry said in a statement.  Under this MoU, Government of India proposes to take up, among others, a project to build prefabricated housing in Rakhine State so as to meet the immediate needs of returning people.   India will spend $25 million over the next five years on development of the impoverished region, foreign ministry spokesman Raveesh Kumar said.  Besides housing, the proposals include building schools, healthcare facilities and building bridges and roads.  India has been trying to promote economic cooperation with Myanmar to try to push back against China s expansive involvement in infrastructure development across south Asia.  Beijing has also stepped into the Rohingya crisis and proposed a three-phase plan including a ceasefire, bilateral talks and then tackling poverty long-term. \"],[\"CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump named 64 agriculture policy advisors on Tuesday, including the governors of Iowa and five other farm states and a former federal agriculture secretary. The announcement came as Trump, a New York businessman seeking his first elected office, looks to improve his standing among voters, particularly those in swing states such as Iowa, where some recent opinion polls show Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in a tight race.  Republican Governors Terry Branstad of Iowa, Sam Brownback of Kansas, Jack Dalrymple of North Dakota, Dennis Daugaard of South Dakota, Mary Fallin of Oklahoma and Pete Ricketts of Nebraska were included on a list of advisors distributed by Trump’s campaign. Branstad spokesman Ben Hammes said in an interview that the governor will focus on increasing government support for renewable energy as part of the committee. Also on the list were John Block, U.S. agriculture secretary under Republican President Ronald Reagan from 1981 to 1986, and former Governors Rick Perry of Texas and Jim Gilmore of Virginia, who both unsuccessfully ran against Trump for the Republican nomination. “The members of my agricultural advisory committee represent the best that America can offer to help serve agricultural communities,” Trump said in a statement. Members of an executive board will “convene on a regular basis,” he said. Committee members have already talked via telephone to outline some of the issues they expect to tackle, committee member A.G. Kawamura said in an interview. They range from immigration and climate change to global trade and “how to define food and energy security for the U.S. in the years ahead,” said Kawamura, a former California agriculture secretary. Battles between the agriculture sector and its critics have grown fierce in recent years - from fights over water access in California and declining grain prices, to mounting pressure from consumer groups over how food is produced and labeled. Both presidential campaigns have largely ignored the sector, though, Kawamura said, adding that lack of discussion was one of the reasons he joined Trump’s committee. In June, representatives of about a dozen agricultural associations, including the American Farm Bureau Federation and the National Farmers Union, met with staffers for Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton for the first time to begin a discussion on farm policy. Clinton had a 6-percentage-point lead over Trump in a Reuters\\u002fIpsos tracking poll released on Tuesday. \"],[\"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Yahoo Inc YHOO.O came under renewed scrutiny by federal investigators and lawmakers on Thursday after disclosing the largest known data breach in history, prompting Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) to demand better terms for its planned purchase of Yahoo’s internet business. Shares of the Sunnyvale, California-based internet pioneer fell more than 6 percent after it announced the breach of data belonging to more than 1 billion users late on Wednesday, following another large hack reported in September. Verizon, which agreed to buy Yahoo’s core internet business in July for $4.8 billion, is now trying to persuade Yahoo to amend the terms of the acquisition agreement to reflect the economic damage from the two hacks, according to people familiar with the matter. The U.S. No. 1 wireless carrier still expects to go through with the deal, but is looking for “major concessions” in light of the most recent breach, according to another person familiar with the situation. Asked about the status of the deal, a Yahoo spokesperson said: “We are confident in Yahoo’s value and we continue to work towards integration with Verizon.” Verizon had already said in October it was reviewing the deal after September’s breach disclosure. Late on Wednesday, it said it would “review the impact of this new development before reaching any final conclusions” about whether to proceed.  The company declined to comment beyond that statement on Thursday.  Verizon has threatened to go to court to get out of the deal if it is not repriced, citing a material adverse effect, said the people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential. No court in Delaware, where Yahoo is incorporated, has ever found that a material adverse effect has occurred that would allow companies to terminate a merger agreement.  Nevertheless, the threat of a court case on the issue has been successfully used by companies to renegotiate deals, and experts said that some concessions from Yahoo are likely, given the magnitude of the cyber security breaches. Renegotiating the deal’s price tag would be the simplest but also least likely scenario because the impact of the data breaches will not be apparent for some time, according to Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business.  A more likely concession would be for Yahoo to agree to compensate Verizon after the close of the deal, based on the liabilities that occur. The two companies may also agree to extend the close of the deal to allow for more time for information to come in on the impact of the breaches, Gordon suggested. Verizon shares rose 0.4 percent to close at $51.81, in line with the S&P 500 Index .SPX. Yahoo closed down 6.1 percent at $38.41.  Yahoo said late on Wednesday that it had uncovered a 2013 cyber attack that compromised data of more than 1 billion user accounts, the largest known breach on record.  It said the data stolen may have included names, email addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth, hashed passwords and, in some cases, encrypted or unencrypted security questions and answers. The company added that some of its partners were affected. One such partner, Europe’s Sky Plc (SKYB.L), said Yahoo provides email services to its 2.1 million Sky.com email account holders, but it was unclear how many of those accounts were affected.  The announcement followed Yahoo’s disclosure in September of a separate breach that affected over 500 million accounts, which the company said it believed was launched by different hackers.  The White House said on Thursday the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation was probing the breach. Several lawsuits seeking class-action status on behalf of Yahoo shareholders have been filed, or are in the works. Meanwhile, Democratic Senator Mark Warner of Virginia said he was looking into Yahoo’s cyber security practices. “This most-recent revelation warrants a separate follow-up and I plan to press the company on why its cyber defenses have been so weak as to have compromised over a billion users,” he said in a statement. Warner, who will become the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee next year, described the hacks as “deeply troubling.”  New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman urged anyone with a Yahoo account to change their passwords and security questions and said he is examining the breach’s circumstances and the company’s disclosures to law enforcement.  Germany’s cyber security authority, the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI), advised German consumers to consider switching to safer alternatives for email, and criticized Yahoo for failing to adopt modern encryption techniques to protect users’ personal data. “Considering the repeated cases of data theft, users should look more closely at which services they want to use in the future and security should play a part in that decision,” BSI President Arne Schoenbohm said in a statement. The latest breach drew widespread criticism from security experts, several advising consumers to close their Yahoo accounts. “Yahoo has fallen down on security in so many ways I have to recommend that if you have an active Yahoo email account, either direct with Yahoo of via a partner like AT&T, get rid of it,” Stu Sjouwerman, chief executive of cyber security firm KnowBe4 Inc, said in a broadly distributed email.  A Yahoo spokesperson, in response to criticism of the company’s security measures, said on Thursday: “We’re committed to keeping our users secure, both by continuously striving to stay ahead of ever-evolving online threats and to keep our users and platforms secure.”  \"],[\"CARACAS (Reuters) - In another setback for Venezuela s dispirited opposition, four of its five state governors broke with their coalition s official stance on Monday to swear themselves in before a pro-government legislative superbody. The Democratic Unity coalition went into the Oct. 15 gubernatorial polls as favorites for a big win against President Nicolas Maduro s candidates because of voter anger at a brutal economic crisis in the OPEC member. But it ended up taking just five of 23 states. Initially alleging fraud, the opposition later acknowledged that abstentionism in its ranks played a big part in the defeat, which shed doubt on its ability to beat the ruling socialists in next year s presidential vote. After the regional ballot, the coalition said none of its winning candidates would  kneel  before the pro-Maduro Constituent Assembly body, which it has refused to recognize since its establishment in an election in July.   But the newly elected governors for Tachira, Merida, Nuevo Esparta and Anzoategui - all from the Democratic Action party, one of Venezuela s biggest and oldest - swore themselves in before assembly directors as a prerequisite to taking office. After presiding over the ceremony, Constituent Assembly head Delcy Rodriguez chided the one winning opposition candidate, Juan Pablo Guanipa of oil-rich Zulia state, who held out.  These actions will have consequences,  she said. Maduro previously warned there may be a new election in any state where the winner does not swear loyalty to the assembly. Guanipa, of the Justice First party, which has a militant line against Maduro, said he would not legitimize the  fraudulent  Constituent Assembly whose election the opposition boycotted.  Zulia will never kneel before the dictatorship,  he added. Critics see the creation of the Constituent Assembly, which has superseded all powers including the opposition-led congress, as the cementing of dictatorship in Venezuela. Major Western and Latin American nations have refused to recognize its legitimacy. But Maduro said it was the only way to bring peace back after four months of opposition protests this year that led to 125 deaths, thousands of arrests and injuries, and widespread damage to property and infrastructure. Appearing on state TV late on Monday, Maduro said he had congratulated the four Democratic Action governors by telephone and would meet with them, possibly as soon as Tuesday.   I ve told them:  Let s turn the page ... and get down to work,  he said. Democratic Action is one of the biggest parties in the opposition coalition, and its decision on Monday infuriated many opposition supporters who viewed it as a sellout. The move could presage a complete reformulation, or possible breakup, of the coalition, which consists of more than two dozen parties and has long suffered from infighting.  We are going to see a new unity. In the worst crises and circumstances, opportunities always crop up,  wrote opposition leader Henrique Capriles, of the Justice First party, hinting at imminent changes.    The coalition s biggest triumph was a resounding victory at December 2015 legislative elections. But it has been in the doldrums since Maduro survived this year s protests, and many Venezuelans perceive its leaders as elitist.  Further pummeling his foes, Maduro named five senior officials as  protectors  for the states won by the opposition, undermining its influence on the ground by granting new funding and parallel responsibilities to government figures there.        \"],[\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney on Friday announced he will vote for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas in Utah’s Tuesday nominating contest, citing a desire to halt the momentum of party front-runner Donald Trump.  “Today, there is a contest between Trumpism and Republicanism. Through the calculated statements of its leader, Trumpism has become associated with racism, misogyny, bigotry, xenophobia, vulgarity and, most recently, threats and violence. I am repulsed by each and every one of these”, Romney, the 2012 Republican Party nominee, wrote on Facebook. “The only path that remains to nominate a Republican rather than Mr. Trump is to have an open convention,” he said. “At this stage, the only way we can reach an open convention is for Senator Cruz to be successful in as many of the remaining nominating elections as possible.” \"],[\"LONDON (Reuters) - The wife of British aristocrat Lord Lucan, who vanished without trace 43 years ago after the murder of his children s nanny, has been found dead, London police said on Wednesday. The mystery of what happened to Richard Lucan, a dapper, moustachioed lord known as  Lucky , has fascinated the public for decades and speculation about his whereabouts has long been a staple of the British press. Lord Lucan disappeared hours after nanny Sandra Rivett was found bludgeoned to death in his house in central London in 1974. A car he was using was later found on the south English coast with a length of lead piping. It was alleged the peer had mistaken the nanny for his estranged wife Veronica, who was also attacked and fled to a nearby pub covered in blood to raise the alarm. She later identified her husband as the assailant. Police said on Wednesday they had found the body of 80-year-old Lady Lucan after forcing entry to a house in the upmarket Belgravia area of London.  The death is being treated as unexplained but is not believed to be suspicious,  police said. Over the years, the British press have reported supposed sightings of Lord Lucan across the world, including in Australia, India, the Netherlands and South Africa   but his relatives believe him to be dead. The London High Court declared him dead in 1999 and last year a judge issued a death certificate allowing his son George Bingham to inherit his title.  My own personal view, and it was one I took I think as an eight-year-old boy, is he s unfortunately been dead since that time (of his disappearance),  Bingham said last year. One of numerous theories about what became of Lucan, who would now be 82, was that he shot himself and was then fed to tigers at the zoo of his friend John Aspinall. Aspinall himself said in 2000 that Lucan had weighted himself down with a stone and drowned himself in the English Channel. \"],[\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican lawmakers will not take up a bipartisan plan to stabilize Obamacare insurance markets or try again to repeal and replace the law this year, House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said on Wednesday, signaling his party was shelving the matter until the 2018 U.S. congressional election year. President Donald Trump promised as a candidate last year to dismantle Obamacare. While the House passed such a bill last May, the Senate tried but failed to do so in July and September thanks to deep intra-party divisions and fears that millions of Americans would lose their healthcare coverage. “I think that is something we should do next year,” Ryan said in an interview with Reuters when asked about prospects of the House passing a bipartisan bill that would reinstate federal subsidies to private insurers to help lower-income people buy medical coverage through the Affordable Care Act, dubbed Obamacare. Asked whether the seven-year Republican effort to repeal and replace Obamacare was now dead, Ryan responded, “No.” But he added, “I can’t imagine we can do that this year.” Congress has a packed calendar between now and the end of 2017. It includes a major tax cut package that President Donald Trump wants lawmakers to pass by the end of the year as well as legislation to avert a potential government shutdown looming in December.  Trump has been frustrated by the inability of a Congress led by his own party to pass the bill, and has taken steps that bypass lawmakers to chip away at the law. Trump this month cut off billions of dollars in Obamacare subsidies to insurers, known as cost-sharing reduction payments, saying they are unlawful and enrich insurance companies. Republican Senator Lamar Alexander and Democratic Senator Patty Murray last week unveiled a bipartisan bill to maintain those subsidies for two years and give states some added flexibility for administering health insurance while also maintaining many of Obamacare’s patient protections. The plan drew bipartisan support in the Senate, but Trump came out against it after initially backing it. The subsidies are a critical element of Obamacare. Insurers say they do not profit from the subsidies, but pass them on directly to consumers to reduce deductibles, co-payments and other out-of-pocket medical expenses for low-income people. Ryan said he favored a more conservative short-term Obamacare fix offered by leading Republicans in the House and Senate. It includes provisions to suspend requirements for individuals and employers to obtain health coverage under Obamacare. Democrats are likely to balk over concerns that the measure could undermine the viability of Obamacare’s subsidized insurance market for individuals. Republicans call Obamacare a government intrusion in the U.S. healthcare system while Democrats note that the 2010 law brought insurance to 20 million Americans. Congressional elections are set for November 2018, with party primaries earlier in the year. \"],[\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama called incoming Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte on Tuesday to congratulate him on his election win, stressing that their countries’ alliance was based on a commitment to human rights and the rule of law, the White House said. U.S. officials have signaled that Washington is ready to work with Duterte despite allegations of human rights abuses in the city he led as mayor for over two decades. Obama’s deputy national security adviser, Ben Rhodes, told a Washington seminar earlier on Tuesday that the U.S. administration was aware there was some “controversy” surrounding Duterte and “statements that drew attention in the past,” but he did not elaborate. Obama offered his congratulations to Duterte as the “presumptive president-elect.” He won the largest share of the votes in a May 9 presidential election, according to an unofficial count by a poll watchdog, although the official result has yet to be confirmed. Obama “highlighted the enduring values that underpin our thriving alliance ... and the longstanding ties between our two peoples, including our shared commitments to democracy, human rights, rule of law, and inclusive economic growth,” the White House said. Washington hoped “to build on progress made with the last administration” in the Philippines, Rhodes said. “This is a new government and we’ll want to hear from them directly what their priorities are,” he said when asked about the election, adding that Washington wanted to see continued efforts to respect the rule of law and combat corruption. Duterte has been criticized for allowing a spree of vigilante killings under his administration in Davao city, and critics fear he could let them happen on a larger scale as president. He has denied ordering any of the killings, but has not condemned them. Washington has steered clear of the controversy, however, which analysts say reflects the reality of U.S. national security interests given China’s increasingly assertive stance in Asia and maritime disputes in the South China Sea. Duterte’s vows to restore law and order resonated with voters, but his incendiary rhetoric and advocacy of extrajudicial killings to stamp out crime and drugs have alarmed many people. Rhodes noted U.S. support for Manila efforts to resolve its territorial dispute with China in the South China Sea through international arbitration, and a recent deal allowing a greater U.S. military presence in the Philippines.  “We believe that now as much as ever it’s important that the U.S. and Philippines are seen working together,” he said. The U.S. stance on Duterte could echo its approach toward India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi. At one point, Modi was unable to obtain a U.S. visa because of concerns about sectarian riots in the state of Gujarat when he was chief minister, but was later invited to the White House when he became prime minister. \"],[\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill on Wednesday to provide $622.1 million to control the spread of the Zika virus, far below President Barack Obama’s request and lower than Senate legislation. The bill passed the Republican-controlled House 241 to 184, largely along party lines, and sets up a confrontation with both the Republican-majority Senate and the Democratic Obama administration.  The White House has threatened to veto the House bill, saying it was “woefully inadequate.” The Obama administration has requested $1.9 billion. On Tuesday, the Senate cleared the way for expected approval by the chamber on Thursday of $1.1 billion to fight the mosquito-borne Zika virus, which has been linked to birth defects. Unlike the Senate legislation, the House bill requires that the $622.1 million be fully offset with spending cuts elsewhere. Many conservative Republicans in the House refuse to approve Zika funds that would add to federal budget deficits, while Democrats and some Senate Republicans favor treating the problem as an emergency that would not have to be financed with spending cuts. House Republicans argue their bill, when coupled with $589 million the Obama administration already shifted to Zika from unused funds to battle Ebola, would provide enough money through Sept. 30, the end of this fiscal year. It was unclear how long it might take the Senate and House to work out their differences once they pass their respective bills. U.S. health officials have concluded that Zika infections in pregnant women can cause microcephaly, a birth defect marked by small head size that can lead to severe developmental problems in babies. The World Health Organization has said there is strong scientific consensus that Zika can also cause Guillain-Barre, a rare neurological syndrome that causes temporary paralysis in adults. Last year, Brazil began detecting an increase in microcephaly, and the virus has been spreading rapidly in the Americas, with new cases now being reported in warm climates in southern U.S. states including Florida. The Obama administration says it needs the emergency funds to help state and local governments eradicate mosquitoes that spread the virus and to develop a vaccine. \"],[\"DOHA (Reuters) - Qatar s ruler said he is ready for U.S.-hosted direct talks aimed at solving the worst diplomatic crisis in the Gulf in years but has yet to hear a response to U.S. President Donald Trump s invitation to the four Arab states boycotting Doha. Speaking to U.S. broadcaster CBS News, Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani said he wanted an end to the dispute, which erupted on June 5 and pits Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt against Qatar.  Nothing is going to be above our dignity, our sovereignty. But we want it to end. I always say that,  he told the  60 Minutes  program in an interview aired on Sunday.  If they (are) going to walk one meter toward me, I m willing to walk 10,000 miles towards them,  he said. The four countries have cut diplomatic, transport and trade ties with Qatar, the world s top seller of liquefied natural gas, accusing it of financing terrorism. Doha denies the charges. The dispute has hit travel and food imports and ratcheted up tensions in a wealthy region which plays a leading role in global energy markets as well as events across the wider Middle East.  On Sunday, Bahrain s foreign minister called for freezing Qatar s membership out of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) to preserve its unity, adding that Bahrain will not attend the upcoming GCC summit if Qatar does not change its stand. Qatar hosts Al Udeid air base, the largest U.S. military facility in the Middle East. Sheikh Tamim said Trump had told him  I will not accept my friends fighting amongst themselves,  and that in talks on the sidelines of a United Nations  meeting in September he had made an offer to host talks in the United States.  I told him straightaway,  Mr President, we are very ready. I ve been asking for dialogue from day one,  Sheikh Tamim said, adding that the meeting was supposed to happen very soon and that he had not heard a response from the other countries. Trump, who has said he would be willing to mediate in the dispute, said in September he had a  very strong feeling  it would be solved  pretty quickly . Earlier in September, Saudi Arabia suspended any dialogue with Qatar, accusing it of  distorting facts,  just after a report of a phone call between the leaders of the two countries suggested a possible breakthrough in the dispute. Saudi Arabia s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman spoke by  phone with Qatar s emir on Sept. 8 in the first publicly reported contact between the two leaders since the crisis began. There has been no further contact reported since then. In the CBS interview, Sheikh Tamim reiterated that Qatar would not close down the Doha-based Al Jazeera television network, as demanded by the four countries who accuse the broadcaster of bias and interfering in their affairs. Al Jazeera says it is an independent news service giving a voice to everyone in the region. Sheikh Tamim also said he feared for the region if any military actions were taken as part of the crisis.  I m fearful that if anything happens, if any military act happens, this region will be in chaos,  he said. \"],[\"BEIJING\\u002fNEW DELHI (Reuters) - As U.S. President Donald Trump and some of America s democratic allies talk up a vision of  Indo-Pacific  cooperation, China is determined to ensure that the future belongs to  Asia .   The increasing use of the phrase  Indo-Pacific  by Trump and his team during their marathon Asian jaunt this week, instead of the  Asia-Pacific  term that has long been common in business and diplomacy, is being greeted with thinly-veiled sneers in Beijing.  Trump choosing to use the term and actually making it happen are two totally different things,  Diao Daming, an American studies expert at Renmin University in Beijing, told a forum on Friday.    The region is leading global development and Trump wants America to be first, so he could not ignore its existence. He had to say something to the region, so we have  Indo-Pacific . But as yet it s just a concept and we don t know what it means.  Beyond the wordplay lies both concern and scepticism in Beijing at U.S. attempts to complicate China s strategic domain, particularly by encouraging rival power India to work more closely militarily with Japan. Tokyo recently backed New Delhi during India s border stand-off with China.    Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying did not dignify  Indo-Pacific  by name in a statement this week, but noted that  this concept has been mentioned many times .    We hope that the Asia-Pacific region can become a stable, prosperous and orderly region....where we are capable of managing differences and have the wisdom to resolve the disputes,  she said.    Indo-Pacific  has grown in usage across diplomatic and security circles in Australia, India and Japan in recent years, shorthand for a broader and democratic-led region in place of the  Asia-Pacific , which to some places an authoritarian China too firmly at the center.   Trump and his team have given it fresh currency in recent days, starting in Seoul and Tokyo, building on the rhetoric of his secretary of state Rex Tillerson, who last month talked of the need to support a  free, open and thriving Indo-Pacific .   Describing the Indian and Pacific Oceans as a  single strategic arena , Tillerson went further as he described India and the United States as  bookends  within that region.    In concrete terms, it will lead to great co-ordination between the Indian, Japanese and American militaries including maritime domain awareness, anti-submarine warfare, amphibious warfare, and humanitarian assistance, disaster relief, and search and rescue,  he said.   Not all allies are convinced, however.   When Trump s White House issued a statement after the U.S.-South Korea summit on Wednesday describing the alliance as a  linchpin for stability, security and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific , South Korea s presidential Blue House issued a note of caution.   While the phrase  Indo-Pacific  matched some of South Korea s policies aimed at diversification,  we felt there was more discussion necessary to see whether it is an appropriate term to be used in our efforts toward...joint strategic goals , the Blue House statement said.   Welcoming the trend is Indian navy Captain Gurpreet Khurana, who was among the first to coin the Indo-Pacific concept in an academic paper back in 2007.   The rise of India as an economic power following its free market reforms and then its gradual military build-up was itself a key factor in the increasing significance of the Indian Ocean, he said.    India could no longer be excluded from any over-arching reckoning in the Asia-Pacific, be it economic or security related,  said Khurana, of the military-funded National Maritime Foundation. Chinese officials and experts have long bristled at any perceived attempt to contain a rising China.  But Trump s Indo-Pacific policy should not be underestimated by China, because India, Japan and Australia are united by being on the wrong side of China s development strategy for the region, according to Jia Wenshan, an expert on China s foreign policy at the Beijing-based Center for China and Globalization.  China needs to as soon as possible deal with the Indo-Pacific alliance, as it is absolutely in conflict with Belt and Road,  Jia said, referring to the Chinese president s signature initiative to re-establish trade and infrastructure ties between China and nations throughout Central and Southeast Asia.  Behind Indo-Pacific you have Japan s economic support, India s development speed and Australia s fears of China, these are all strategic realities.  \"],[\"TOKYO (Reuters) - Israel is willing to resort to military action to ensure Iran never acquires nuclear weapons, the intelligence minister said on Thursday in Japan where he is seeking backing for U.S. President Donald Trump s tougher line on Tehran. Trump said on Oct. 13 he would not certify Iran is complying with an agreement on curtailing its nuclear program, signed by his predecessor, Barack Obama, opening a 60-day window for Congress to act to reimpose sanctions.  If international efforts led these days by U.S. President Trump don t help stop Iran attaining nuclear capabilities, Israel will act militarily by itself,  Intelligence Minister Israel Katz said in an interview in Tokyo.  There are changes that can be made (to the agreement) to ensure that they will never have the ability to have a nuclear weapon.  Israel has taken unilateral action in the past without the consent of its major ally, the United States, including air strikes on a suspected nuclear reactor in Syria in 2007 and in Iraq in 1981. A strike against Iran, however, would be a risky venture with the potential to provoke a counter strike and roil financial markets. An Israeli threat of military strikes could, nonetheless, galvanize support in the United States for toughening up the nuclear agreement but it could also backfire by encouraging hardliners in Iran and widening a rift between Washington and European allies. So far, none of the other signatories to the deal - Britain, France, Germany, Russia, China, Iran and the European Union - has cited serious concerns, leaving the United States isolated. Japan relies on the U.S. military to help defend it against threats from North Korea and elsewhere. Tokyo s diplomatic strategy in the Middle East, where it buys almost all its oil, is to maintain friendly relations with all countries, including Iran.   I asked the Japanese government to support steps led by President Trump to change the nuclear agreement,  said Katz, who is a member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu s right-wing Likud party.  The question of whether Japanese companies will begin to work in Iran or not is a very important question.  Katz s visit to Tokyo comes ahead of a planned trip by Trump from Nov. 5 for a summit with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Officials at Japan s Ministry of Foreign Affairs were not immediately available to comment. Israel, Katz said, wants the nuclear agreement to be revised to remove an expiration date, and to impose tighter conditions to stop Tehran from developing new centrifuges used to make weapons-grade nuclear material.  He also urged sanctions to stop Iran from establishing  Syria as a military base to launch attacks on Israel and action to put a halt to Tehran s development of ballistic missiles.  We will not allow Iran to transform Syria into forward base sea harbors, air bases and Shia militias,  he said.  We will act together with the United States and other countries in the world until they stop the ballistic missiles that threaten Israel.   The U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday backed new sanctions on Lebanon s Iran-backed Hezbollah militia.  \"],[\"SYDNEY (Reuters) - North Korea has sent a letter to Australia s parliament, warning it is a nuclear power and will not be cowed by U.S. President Donald Trump s threats to destroy it, according to a copy of the letter published in an Australian newspaper on Friday.  If Trump thinks that he would bring the DPRK, a nuclear power, to its knees through nuclear war threat, it will be a big miscalculation and an expression of ignorance,  said a facsimile of the letter, published by the Sydney Morning Herald and verified by Australia s foreign ministry.  Trump threatened to totally destroy the DPRK ... it is an extreme act of threatening to totally destroy the whole world.  A spokeswoman for Australia s Foreign Minister told Reuters the Herald report was accurate and the paper s copy of the letter, dated Sept. 28, was genuine. Titled  Open Letter to Parliaments of Different Countries,  the note said it was sent from North Korea s Embassy in Jakarta, Indonesia, to Australia s Embassy in the same city, as well as to other countries, without naming them. DPRK stands for the Democratic People s Republic of Korea, North Korea s official name. Tension has soared on the peninsula following a series of weapons tests by North Korea and a string of increasingly bellicose exchanges between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Trump, in a speech last month at the United Nations, threatened to  totally destroy  North Korea if necessary to defend itself and allies and called the North s leader Kim Jong Un a  rocket man  on a suicide mission. The letter calls for  countries loving independence, peace and justice  to discharge their duty and keep  sharp vigilance against the heinous and reckless moves of the Trump administration trying to drive the world into a horrible nuclear disaster.  At a press conference in Sydney, Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said the note was an  unprecedented  communication.  It is not the way they usually publish their global messages. The collective strategy of imposing maximum diplomatic and economic pressure through sanctions on North Korea is working. This is a response to the pressure.  \"],[\"(Reuters) - U.S. Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly signed a memorandum on Thursday rescinding an Obama-era plan to spare some illegal immigrant parents of children who are lawful permanent residents from being deported, the department said in a statement. The program, which was announced by President Barack Obama in 2014, never took effect because it was blocked in federal court.  Obama had hoped that overhauling the U.S. immigration system and resolving the fate of the estimated 11 million people in the country illegally would be part of his presidential legacy.    However, President Donald Trump has vowed to crack down on illegal immigration. The plan unveiled by Obama intended to let roughly 4 million people - those who have lived illegally in the United States at least since 2010, have no criminal record and have children who are U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents - get into a program that shields them from deportation and supplies work permits. However, it was quickly challenged in court by Republican-governed Texas and 25 other states that argued Obama had overstepped the powers granted to him by the U.S. Constitution by infringing upon the authority of Congress.  A federal appeals court blocked the program, and the U.S. Supreme Court let that ruling stand in a 4-4 split decision last year. Kelly said in a statement on Thursday he was rescinding the initiative, known as DAPA, because “there is no credible path forward to litigate the currently enjoined policy.” An earlier program, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), offers some 750,000 immigrants brought to the country illegally as children the chance to attend school and to work.  Trump has previously said his administration was devising a policy on how to deal with individuals covered by DACA, but no formal changes have been announced. “They shouldn’t be very worried,” Trump said of DACA recipients in a January ABC News interview. “I do have a big heart.” \"],[\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Republican chairmen of two U.S. House of Representatives committees asked the Justice Department on Monday to launch an investigation into whether Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton committed perjury during testimony to Congress about her use of a private email server. “The evidence collected by the FBI during its investigation of Secretary Clinton’s use of a personal email system appears to directly contradict several aspects of her sworn testimony” to Congress, House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte said in a letter to U.S. Attorney Channing Phillips requesting the probe. After a year-long investigation of Clinton’s emails, the FBI recommended that no criminal charges be brought against the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee for the Nov. 8 election. That recommendation was accepted by Attorney General Loretta Lynch. The FBI found, however, that she was “extremely careless” while secretary of state in her handling of email documents that contained classified information. Representative Elijah Cummings, the senior Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform panel, accused Republicans of a political vendetta following years of Republican-led investigations of Clinton in the House. “Republicans are now squandering even more taxpayer dollars in a desperate attempt to keep this issue alive and bring down Secretary Clinton’s poll numbers ahead of the election,” Cummings said. Clinton has said that she did not believe she was handling classified information on the private email system. Chaffetz has also asked the Federal Bureau of Investigation  to give him access to its investigative files on Clinton. \"],[\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter on Tuesday called for changes in the U.S. military that would cut inefficiencies, streamline the acquisition process and improve the ability to respond quickly to threats such as Islamic State. The proposals by Carter, speaking to an audience at Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank in Washington, cut across all branches of the Defense Department because they affect its top leadership and service chiefs. He said some of the measures could be put in place “over the coming weeks” under existing authority while others will require legislative action. Some of the proposals aim to overcome organizational inefficiencies within the vast U.S. military that Carter believes do not allow it to best address transregional threats like the one from the Islamic State militant group, which stretches from Afghanistan to Africa. Carter’s proposals, which did not go into specifics, follow a review of the Goldwater-Nichols law of 1986, which made sweeping changes to the structure of the U.S. military and has been criticized for being outdated. Senator John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, looking at whether Goldwater-Nichols needed to be updated because of changing security threats including Islamic State and North Korea. Carter said the role of chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff ought to be clarified to help move troops quickly across regional commands and provide military advice for current and future operations. He said the Pentagon would try to simplify some headquarters positions so that some jobs now filled by four-star generals could be done by lower-ranking officers in the future. Carter added that service chiefs would be involved more in making decisions on defense acquisitions. He said the Pentagon would seek to streamline the acquisitions process by reducing the amount of paperwork required. In order to make the acquisition process simpler, Carter said he would look at potentially reducing the number of members on the Defense Acquisition Board, which gives advice on acquisition programs. In recent congressional testimony, Michele Flournoy, a former top U.S. Department of Defense official, said the Goldwater-Nichols law was leading to a “tyranny of consensus” and “bloated headquarters.” Reaching a consensus had “become an end in itself in too many areas,” including strategy development and acquisition, she said in her written testimony. \"],[\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Monday responded to charges against former campaign manager Paul Manafort by saying the allegations predated his tenure on Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, but the indictment states the activities continued into 2017. “Sorry, but this is years ago, before Paul Manafort was part of the Trump campaign. But why aren’t Crooked Hillary & the Dems the focus?????” Trump wrote, referring to his former Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton. The indictment says Manafort and associate Rick Gates conspired to defraud the United States “from in or about and between 2006 and 2017.” \"],[\"ROME (Reuters) - Italy s Senate passed into law on Thursday a bill allowing severely ill people to refuse treatment that would prolong their lives. The bill passed 180 votes to 71 in the face of opposition from right wing parties. It allows all adults to prepare a document to express their preferences on how to be treated if they lose the faculty to choose or express their choice. Some 10 years after legislation on patients  rights to choose what care to receive at the end of their lives was first proposed, the lower house of parliament approved the bill in April. This will be one of the government s last acts before parliament is dissolved ahead of elections next year. The ruling Democratic Party (PD) had pledged another civil rights measure, making it easier for the children of migrants to obtain citizenship, but this law now looks unlikely to pass.  Parliament s decision makes everyone takes a step forward in terms of civilization for the country and of human dignity,  Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni, who is not a party leader and is unlikely to run in the election, said in Brussels.  By Italian parliamentary standards, the bill s passage was relatively swift thanks to an agreement between two of the biggest parties - the PD and the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement - to vote it through. The deal was a rare example of cooperation between the two parties, which are usually bitter enemies. The anti-immigrant Northern League, which vies with former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi s Forza Italia party for the most votes on the right, fiercely fought the bill. Forza Italia also opposed it, though less strongly.   This law is a precursor to euthanasia,  said Northern League senator Gian Marco Centinaio. Final discussion of the bill coincided with the high-profile case of a disc jockey paralyzed and blinded in a road accident who went to Switzerland to be helped to die. A Radical party member and right-to-die activist who accompanied Fabiano Antoniani, known as DJ Fabo, to the Swiss clinic, is currently on trial in Milan for aiding suicide. In the living wills, which can be recorded on video if the patient cannot write, food and water can be refused as well as medical treatment. However if a patient refuses treatment, the doctor is still obliged to reduce their suffering, and can also use sedation. The law also gives doctors scope to object on conscientious or religious grounds. \"],[\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A federal grand jury on Friday approved the first charges in the investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, a source briefed on the matter told Reuters. The indictment was sealed under orders from a federal judge so it was not clear what the charges were or who the target was,  the source said, adding that it could be unsealed as early as Monday. The filing of charges by the grand jury in Washington was first reported on Friday by CNN, which said the target could be taken into custody as soon as Monday. U.S. intelligence agencies concluded in January that Russia interfered in the election to try to help President Donald Trump defeat Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton through a campaign of hacking and releasing embarrassing emails, and disseminating propaganda via social media to discredit her campaign. Special counsel Robert Mueller, a former director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, is investigating whether Trump campaign officials colluded with those Russian efforts. “If the Special Counsel finds it necessary and appropriate, the Special Counsel is authorized to prosecute federal crimes arising from the investigation of these matters,” Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said in a May 17 letter appointing Mueller. Sources familiar with Mueller’s investigation said he has used that broad authority to investigate links between Trump aides and foreign governments as well as possible money laundering, tax evasion and other financial crimes. Peter Carr, a spokesman for Mueller, declined to comment on Friday. Trump, a Republican who was elected president last November, has denied allegations that his campaign colluded with Russians and condemned investigations into the matter as “a witch hunt”. The Kremlin has denied the allegations. Mueller’s investigation also includes an effort to determine whether Trump or any of his aides tried to obstruct justice.  The special counsel’s team has conducted interviews with former White House chief of staff Reince Priebus, former spokesman Sean Spicer and other current and former White House officials. In July, FBI agents raided the home in Virginia of Trump’s former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, whose financial and real estate dealings and prior work for a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine are being investigated by Mueller’s team. Mueller was appointed to lead the investigation a week after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey, who was heading a federal probe into possible collusion with Russia. Trump initially said he fired Comey because his leadership of the FBI was inadequate and hurt morale, but in a later interview with NBC he cited “this Russia thing” as his reason.  The Russia investigation has cast a shadow over Trump’s nine-month-old presidency and widened the partisan rift between Republicans and Democrats. Republican lawmakers earlier this week launched investigations to examine several of Trump’s longstanding political grievances, including the FBI probe of Hillary Clinton’s emails and her alleged role in a sale of U.S. uranium to a Russian firm. Mueller’s team has also investigated Michael Flynn, who was an adviser to Trump’s campaign and later briefly served as his national security adviser. Flynn was fired from that post in February after misleading Vice President Mike Pence about the extent of his conversations with Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak last year. While he was on Trump’s campaign team, Flynn also had a $600,000 contract from a Turkish businessman to help discredit  U.S.-based Turkish cleric Fethullah Gulen, accused by Turkey’s government of instigating a failed coup in July 2016. Former CIA director James Woolsey, who was also an adviser to the Trump campaign, has alleged that Flynn discussed with the businessman and two Turkish government ministers the idea of covertly spiriting Gulen out of the United States to face charges in Turkey. Jonathan Franks, a spokesman for Woolsey, said on Friday that Woolsey and his wife have been in communication with the FBI and Mueller’s team about the claim. Woolsey and his wife, Nancye Miller, “have responded to every request, whether from the FBI, or, more recently, the Office of the Special Counsel,” Franks said in a statement.  Flynn has previously denied through a spokesperson that such a plan was ever discussed.  Reuters reported on Thursday that Woolsey and his wife last year pitched a $10 million project to the same Turkish businessman who had agreed a smaller contract with Flynn. They did not win a contract. Bidding for a lobbying or consulting contract with a foreign company or government is not illegal but Flynn came under scrutiny because he waited until March to retroactively register with the Justice Department as a foreign agent for the work he did on the Gulen project. \"],[\"LONDON (Reuters) - Survivors of a blaze that killed 71 people six months ago in the Grenfell Tower social housing block in west London wept during a multi-faith memorial service at St Paul s Cathedral on Thursday attended by members of the royal family. Bereaved relatives held pictures of their loved ones as they commemorated Britain s deadliest fire since World War Two, a tragedy that has profoundly shocked the nation. Fire broke out in the middle of the night on June 14 and quickly gutted the 24-storey building, which was home to a multi-ethnic community living in a poor area within one of London s richest boroughs, Kensington and Chelsea. The disaster highlighted the area s extreme disparities in living conditions between rich and poor and fueled a debate over why safety concerns voiced by tower residents before the fire had been ignored. The service reflected the multi-cultural character of the Grenfell community, with Christian and Muslim prayers and music from Middle Eastern, Caribbean and Western traditions. It also addressed the anger of many survivors over what they perceive as the neglect of their community before and after the fire. A majority of the hundreds of people displaced by the fire are still staying in hotels because suitable permanent homes have not been provided yet.  Today we ask why warnings were not heeded, why a community was left feeling neglected, uncared for, not listened to,  Graham Tomlin, Bishop of Kensington, told the congregation.   Today we hold out hope that the public inquiry will get to the truth of all that led up to the fire at Grenfell Tower ...  and we trust that the truth will bring justice.  Police are investigating the fire and say charges may be brought against individuals or organizations. A separate public inquiry is under way on the causes of the fire and the authorities  response. Prime Minister Theresa May, opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, London Mayor Sadiq Khan, heir-to-the-throne Prince Charles and his sons Prince William and Prince Harry were among those attending the service along with bereaved families and firefighters who took part in the rescue effort on the night. The devastation inside Grenfell Tower was such that it took police and forensic scientists several months to recover and identify all human remains. The final death toll was 53 adults and 18 children. The service began when a white banner bearing a large green heart emblazoned with the word  Grenfell  was carried through the congregation to the pulpit by a Catholic priest and Muslim cleric from the area around the charred tower. Later, a young Syrian musician played a mournful tune on the oud, an instrument commonly played in the Middle East and parts of Africa, where many Grenfell residents had ties.  A choir of Muslim schoolgirls performed a song called  Inshallah , and survivor Nadia Jafari, who escaped from the tower but lost her elderly father Ali, read a poem called  Remember Me  by the 13th century Persian poet and scholar Rumi. The service also included a rendition of Leonard Cohen s  Hallelujah  performed by a Caribbean-style steel band, and a performance of  Somewhere  from the musical  West Side Story.  Schoolchildren from the Grenfell area scattered green hearts, a symbol of solidarity with the victims and survivors, around the cathedral s altar. \"],[\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House Republicans are unlikely to begin tackling tax reform legislation until the summer, after first moving to revamp the nation’s healthcare system, House Speaker Paul Ryan said on Thursday. In an interview with Fox News, the Wisconsin Republican said lawmakers had to make good on their pledge to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, before they can turn to rewriting the U.S. tax code. “It’s just the way the budget works that we won’t be able to get the ability to write our tax reform bill until our spring budget passes, and then we write that through the summer,” Ryan told Fox News. “We feel the need to rescue (healthcare),” he said. “That’s why we’re going with healthcare first, and that’s the first budget. And then in the spring, when we do our second budget, that’s where tax reform comes.” Ryan later told reporters at his weekly press conference that he hoped to move on healthcare legislation by the end of March. His comments came as Trump, who has called on Congress to act swiftly to enact his sweeping agenda, met with the Republican chairman and ranking Democrats on the Senate Finance and Ways and Means committees. The two panels oversee tax writing, among other issues, but the White House meeting appeared to mostly focused on trade. Any tax reform package would also have to pass the Senate, where it could face resistance over a border adjustment tax provision. Republicans, who control both houses of Congress as well as the White House, have pledged a range of overhauls after eight years of the Democratic Obama administration, even as tensions have arisen over timetables and priorities. “Enough ‘all talk, no action.’ We have to deliver,” Trump told Republican lawmakers at their retreat in Philadelphia last month, pushing them to move on tax reform as well as his planned U.S.-Mexico border wall and repealing Obamacare. Trump has also vowed major spending to overhaul the nation’s roads, bridges and other infrastructure. Democrats have said they could back such a plan but would not support privately funded efforts that could lead to people paying tolls and other costs. Ryan dismissed the idea of using taxpayer funds on infrastructure, however.  Instead, he told Fox News, House Republicans will weigh how to “leverage more private sector spending” for projects such as pipeline overhauls and reforming the Federal Aviation Administration to revamp the air traffic control system. \"],[\"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain will honour its commitments made while a member of the European Union, but specific figures on how much the country will pay for Brexit are subject to negotiations, a spokesman for Prime Minister Theresa May said on Tuesday.  All I can point you to is the PM s position as set out many times in terms of the fact that the UK will honour commitments we ve made during the period of our membership. No EU member state will need to pay more or receive less over the remainder of the current budget plan,  he told reporters.  In terms of specific figures or scenarios, they are all subject to negotiation.  \"],[\"LUXEMBOURG (Reuters) - The European Union on Monday reaffirmed its support for a 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers despite sharp criticism of the accord by President Donald Trump, and it urged U.S. lawmakers not to reimpose sanctions on Tehran. Trump defied both U.S. allies and adversaries on Friday by refusing to formally certify that Tehran is complying with the accord, even though international inspectors say it is, and said he might ultimately terminate the agreement. EU foreign ministers meeting in Luxembourg said a failure to uphold an international agreement backed by the U.N. Security Council could have serious consequences for regional peace, and also undermine efforts to check North Korea s nuclear ambitions.  As Europeans together, we are very worried that the decision of the U.S. president could lead us back into military confrontation with Iran,  German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel told reporters. After a closed-door meeting chaired by EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini on Iran, the ministers issued a joint statement saying the 2015 deal was key to preventing the global spread of nuclear weapons.  The EU is committed to the continued full and effective implementation of all parts of the JCPOA,  it said, referring to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the formal name of the accord with Iran agreed in July 2015 in Vienna.  Trump meanwhile renewed his criticism of the accord, and raised the possibility he might try to end it completely.   We ll see what phase two is. Phase two might be positive, and it might be very negative. It might be a total termination. That s a very real possibility. Some would say that s a great possibility,  the U.S. president said in Washington. He repeated his contention that the JCPOA was  a horrible deal for the United States.  EU foreign ministers said the accord was crucial to opening up Iran s $400-billion economy and finding a new market for European investors. Unlike the United States, the EU saw relations with Iran flourish in the late 1990s until revelations about Tehran s nuclear plans in 2002.   Non-proliferation is a major element of world security and rupturing that would be extremely damaging,  French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told reporters.  We hope that Congress does not put this accord in jeopardy.   Mogherini said she would travel to Washington early next month to try to muster support for the accord.  The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) says Iran is complying with its commitments under the accord, which Trump has branded  the worst deal ever negotiated . The EU still has sanctions in place against members of Iran s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, a major target of Trump s criticism. The EU ministers also discussed on Monday Iran s ballistic missile program, which they want to see dismantled. Tehran says that program is purely defensive. Negotiated after 12 years of talks, the accord with Iran is the most significant diplomatic success for the bloc in several decades.  Many worry that the EU s reputation as an honest broker in a host of future conflicts may not recover if the U.S. Congress reimposes sanctions on Iran and causes the deal - which had the  strong backing of Trump s predecessor Barack Obama - to unravel. Most U.N. and Western sanctions were lifted more than 18 months ago under the deal, though Tehran is still subject to a U.N. arms embargo, which is not part of the deal. EU foreign ministers also approved a new batch of economic sanctions on North Korea after its atomic test last month that included an oil embargo and investment ban. But some still hold out hope of repeating the Iran nuclear deal with Pyongyang at some future date. Sweden is one of only seven EU countries with an embassy in Pyongyang and its foreign minister, Margot Wallstrom, reiterated that Stockholm could be counted on to help negotiate if asked. But Germany s Gabriel warned that Trump s decision not to certify the Iran accord could scupper such hopes, a position echoed by Mogherini, although she stressed that no such EU mediation was underway.  My concern is that, if we want to talk to North Korea now, the possible end for the nuclear deal with Iran would jeopardize the credibility of such treaties,  Gabriel said.      \"],[\"MECCA, Saudi Arabia (Reuters) - Saudi King Salman, receiving dignitaries attending the annual Muslim haj pilgrimage, said on Saturday the kingdom had made progress in eradicating terrorism aimed at attacking its holy sites, state news agency SPA reported. Saudi Arabia, which stakes its reputation on its guardianship of Islam s holiest sites and organizing the haj, has been hit by bombings in recent years and uncovered plots to carry out attacks in Mecca.  The limbs of terrorism have sought to harm the holy cities, paying no attention to their sanctity,  SPA quoted King Salman as telling foreign dignitaries at a reception he held in Mecca, where more than 2 million pilgrims are performing haj.   But the kingdom, by the grace of God and in cooperation with its sisters and friends, has made big successes in eradicating terrorism and has worked decisively and with determination to dry its sources,  he added, without elaborating. Salman also said Saudi Arabia had devoted all its material and human resources to ensure the safety of pilgrims who come from all over the world to perform the five-day ritual, a religious duty to be undertaken once in a lifetime by every able-bodied Muslim who can afford the journey.  We are determined, with God s permission, to continue to provide the highest level of services for the two holy mosques ... to ensure the safety of those who seek the sacred house of God,  he said. The pilgrimage has frequently been hit by stampedes and fires. In the most recent incident, hundreds of pilgrims were killed in a crush two years ago. \"],[\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A member of the Federal Election Commission on Friday called on President Donald Trump to share any evidence he has to support a statement that voter fraud caused him and former Senator Kelly Ayotte to lose in New Hampshire in the 2016 U.S. election. “The scheme the President of the United States alleges would constitute thousands of felony criminal offenses under New Hampshire law,” FEC Commissioner Ellen Weintraub said in a statement. (bit.ly\\u002f2lAnk7t) Trump blamed voter fraud for his and Ayotte’s losses in New Hampshire in November’s election while speaking on Thursday with a bipartisan group of U.S. senators, saying that Ayotte’s re-election bid was spoiled by “thousands” of people from neighboring Massachusetts voting in New Hampshire, according to media reports. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton narrowly won New Hampshire’s four electoral votes by nearly 3,000 votes, while Ayotte, a Republican like Trump, lost by only 743 votes. Weintraub, who was appointed by former Republican President George W. Bush, asked Trump to “immediately share his evidence with the public and with the appropriate law-enforcement authorities so that his allegations may be investigated promptly and thoroughly.” Trump said on Sunday he would put Vice President Mike Pence in charge of a special commission to investigate voter fraud, despite numerous studies showing that such fraud is rare in the United States. Trump has said that fraud may account for his loss nationwide in the popular vote to Clinton by nearly 3 million votes. \"],[\"PRAGUE (Reuters) - Czech lawmakers voted on Wednesday to let police bring fraud charges against Andrej Babis, the leading candidate to become prime minister in next month s elections. Babis, a billionaire businessman and founder of the poll-leading ANO party, denies allegations that he hid ownership of one of his firms to receive a 50-million Czech crown ($2.29-million) EU subsidy meant for small business in 2008. The 63-year-old former finance minister has dismissed a police investigation into the case as a ploy by political and business adversaries to chase him out of politics.  You will not silence me, intimidate me, stop me. And you will not get rid of me,  Babis told parliament before MPs overwhelmingly voted to lift the immunity from prosecution granted to lawmakers. He ended up backing the motion himself, saying he wanted to clear his name, though other ANO party deputies boycotted the vote.  So, give me up. I ask you to lift my immunity so that the truth can be revealed,  he told the lower house.  Wednesday s decision, backed by 123 to four, does not stop Babis from standing in the Oct. 20-21 election. But it could dent his support. Several potential coalition partners have said they could not work with a prime minister charged with a crime. Babis s ANO party, a junior member in a Social Democrat-led government, leads opinion polls by a double-digit margin - though there have been no major surveys taken since the police requested his immunity be lifted on Aug. 10. The party has promised to revamp politics and root out what Babis calls mafia-like networks of business and political interests. Governments led by the traditional parties - the center-right Civic Democrats and the center-left Social Democrats - brought the country into NATO and the European Union but lost many voters in recent years amid a series of corruption scandals. Babis s adversaries argue he got rich in the environment that he now criticizes, often doing business with the state. His Agrofert group is the biggest Czech private employer with more than 30,000 staff. The subsidy under investigation, was paid for building a conference center near Prague called Stork Nest, before Babis entered politics. The police investigation is expected to last well beyond the October vote and Babis will win immunity again if reelected to parliament, as expected, which would force the police to ask again for permission to charge him. \"],[\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A visa program aimed at diversifying the U.S. immigrant population came under attack from President Donald Trump on Wednesday after he learned that the man accused of killing eight people in New York City on Tuesday used it to enter the country.        Sayfullo Saipov, who was charged in Tuesday’s truck attack, immigrated to the United States from Uzbekistan in 2010 after winning a lottery enabling him to obtain a so-called “diversity visa,” two government officials confirmed to Reuters.  The program, established by Congress and coordinated by the State Department, has its roots in efforts to bring more Irish and Italian immigrants into the United States. Citizens of countries that send relatively few immigrants to the United States can enter a lottery that grants winners permanent U.S. residency. Applicants must have at least a high school education or its equivalent, or relevant work experience. Just under 11.4 million applicants entered the 2016 lottery for 50,000 slots available to winners and their close family members, according to State Department figures. The visa program has succeeded in diversifying the mix of immigrants that come into the United States each year, but has also drawn criticism for being vulnerable to fraud and for posing national security risks. Trump said on Wednesday he would ask Congress to “immediately” initiate efforts to kill the program, and Republican House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, who has long called for an end to diversity visas, said in a statement that they pose “a threat to the safety of our citizens.” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer helped create the program in 1990 when he was a member of the House of Representatives. But he was also part of a group of lawmakers in 2013 who crafted a bipartisan immigration bill that would have done away with the program. That bill was passed by the Senate but was killed by the Republican-led House. Top congressional Democrats on Wednesday defended the program, saying it subjects all visa recipients “to the same stringent vetting as all other immigrant visa programs.” The only other known instance of a diversity visa beneficiary carrying out a deadly terrorist attack in the United States occurred in 2002. That year, an Egyptian man who had received a diversity visa through his wife years earlier shot and killed two people in a Los Angeles airport. The man had earlier sought asylum in the United States but was rejected. Ultimately, he was allowed to stay in the country after his wife won the lottery. As early as 2004, the State Department’s then-deputy inspector general, Anne Patterson, told Congress her office believed the diversity program “contains significant vulnerabilities to national security” and that terrorists could “attempt to use it to enter the United States as permanent residents.” The agency watchdog recommended barring citizens of countries that sponsor terrorism from the program. Over the years, government audits have exposed sophisticated fraud schemes targeting the program, including extortion rackets, sham marriages and the use of fake identification documents.  In 2007, Congress’s Government Accountability Office issued a report noting that federal law enforcers “believe that some individuals, including terrorists and criminals, could use fraudulent means to enter or remain in the United States.”  The report found, however, “no documented evidence” that diversity visa immigrants “posed a terrorist or other threat.”  A September 2013 State Department inspector general report found that “organized fraud rings masquerading as travel agencies” had hijacked the diversity visa program in Ukraine. Under the scheme, Ukrainians were entered in the lottery without their consent, and then held up for money in exchange for the chance to claim a visa or encouraged to enter into sham marriages if they won. \"],[\"RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia’s foreign ministry condemned the passage of a U.S. law that would allow families of victims of the Sept. 11, 2001  attacks to sue the kingdom for damages, calling it a matter of “great concern” in a statement on Thursday. The U.S. Senate and House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly on Wednesday to approve legislation that will allow the families of those killed in the 2001 attacks on the United States to seek damages from the Saudi government. “The erosion of sovereign immunity will have a negative impact on all nations, including the United States,” said the Saudi statement, which was carried on state news agency SPA after a day of stony silence from Riyadh. The foreign ministry expressed hope that the U.S. Congress would correct the legislation “to avoid the serious unintended consequences that may ensue,” without elaborating on what the consequences might be. Riyadh has always dismissed suspicions that it backed the attackers, who killed nearly 3,000 people under the banner of Islamist militant group al-Qaeda. Fifteen out of the 19 hijackers were Saudi nationals. The Saudi government financed an extensive lobbying campaign against the “Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act”, or JASTA, in the run-up to the vote, and warned it would undermine the principle of sovereign immunity. But Saudi officials who had lobbied against the bill stopped short of threatening any specific retaliation if the law was passed. The Saudi riyal fell against the U.S. dollar in the forward foreign exchange market on Thursday after the law was passed. Analysts said a successful lawsuit against the Saudi government would be unlikely at best, but speculated that the uncertainty surrounding the legal implications could negatively affect bilateral trade and investment with a major ally. Saudi Arabia’s Gulf state neighbor, United Arab Emirates, warned of the long-term grave repercussions of Congress overriding Obama’s veto. In a tweet late on Thursday, Anwar Gargash, the UAE’s minister of state for foreign  affairs, called the U.S. Congress move “a dangerous precedent in international law that undermines the principle of sovereign immunity and the future of sovereign investments in the United States”.  In a later tweet Gargash said his country’s reactions on both the legal and investment fronts should not be hasty and that “easing the damage requires joint action”.  \"],[\" (In this June 9 story, corrects name of company in paragraph 6 to California Resources Corporation; adds “million” in final paragraph) WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke will make a recommendation to the White House on Saturday on whether to rescind or resize the Bears Ears monument in Utah, setting the tone for the Trump administration’s broader study of which lands protected by past presidents should be reopened to development. It is unclear when the decision will be made public.  While the land encompassed by the 1.35 million-acre Bears Ears monument is not believed to contain massive amounts of coal, oil or gas, several other monuments on Zinke’s review list may, making the Bears Ears decision important to industry groups. Here is a list: Barack Obama designated this 704,000 acres of southeastern Nevada a national monument in 2015. The area sits in the Chainman Shale play, which is believed by some in the drilling industry to be a promising reserve.  Barack Obama designated this 1.35 million acres in southeastern Utah a national monument in late 2016, shortly before leaving office. The area, which surrounds a pair of iconic buttes, has moderate oil and gas potential, and one oil company, EOG Resources, was granted drilling leases within its boundaries shortly before the designation.  Bill Clinton designated this 178,000-acre area in southwestern Colorado a national monument in 2000, but because it was already an active zone for the oil and gas industry, he granted drillers an allowance to continue to operate there, with limitations. Bill Clinton designated this 204,000-acre area in California a national monument in 2001. It is located in an area that has seen oil exploration in the past and has some moderate potential for commercial reservoirs. California Resources Corporation has pre-existing drilling rights on part of the monument, but has not yet made a big find. GRAND STAIRCASE-ESCALANTE: Bill Clinton designated this 1.9 million acre swath of southern Utah a national monument in 1996. It holds roughly 62 billion tons of coal, along with coal bed gas, and potentially commercial quantities of oil, according to the Utah Geological Survey. (here ) Bill Clinton designated this 495,000 acre area of central Montana a national monument in 2001. In 1995, the U.S. Geological Survey estimated the area held somewhere between 58.2 and 719.9 billion cubic feet of natural gas, along with between 14 million and 180 million barrels oil.

Washington provided intelligence to Russia that helped thwart a potentially deadly bombing, U.S. and Russian officials said on Sunday, in a rare public show of cooperation despite deep strains between the two countries.  It cannot be called anything but an ideal example of cooperation in fighting terrorism,  Peskov told reporters at a conference call.  We should aim for such standards.  The tip-off resulted in the detention of seven alleged supporters of the Islamic State militant group in St. Petersburg last week, Peskov said. Russia s Federal Security Service said on Friday that IS had planned attacks in public places on Dec. 16 and weapons and explosives were found when the suspects were searched. Peskov said Russian and American security services have contacts but this was the first time when their cooperation was so efficient.  This was very meaningful information that helped to save many lives,  the spokesman told reporters. Asked if President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump and Putin had discussed a possible meeting, Peskov replied that the issue  had not been brought up yet . \"],[\"BEIJING (Reuters) - China s Earthquake Administration said on Saturday that a small earthquake recorded earlier in the day in North Korea was not a nuclear explosion and had the characteristics of a natural tremor.

Bahraini officials did not respond to a request for a comment on the reports about Ayatollah Isa Qassim s state of health. News about his condition has stoked tension in Bahrain as the Sunni Muslim-led monarchy pursues a crackdown on dissent by majority Shi ites that has included closing down two main political groupings and banning activists from travel or putting them on trial. Activists said Qassim, who is believed to be in his 70s, was suffering constant pain and excreting blood. Doctors who visited him on Sunday at his home in the village of Duraz, outside the capital Manama, have diagnosed him to be suffering from a  groin hernia requiring emergency operation , according to the London-based Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy (BIRD).  Such an operation carries a high mortality risk at Sheikh Isa Qassim s age. He also suffers high blood pressure, diabetes and a form of heart disease,  BIRD added in a statement. Sheikh Maytham al-Salman, a prominent Bahraini interfaith activist, said the Manama government was responsible for Qassim s health as it controlled access to medical treatment.  The international community must ensure Bahrain is pressured to ensure the safety of Sheikh Isa Qassim is protected,  he added in comments published by BIRD. The Interior Ministry announced in June 2016 that Qassim s citizenship had been revoked, accusing him of trying to divide Bahraini society, encourage youths to violate the constitution and promote a sectarian environment in the Gulf Arab state. The decision sparked angry protests in Bahrain and drew sharp condemnation from regional Shi ite power Iran and statements of concern from the United States and Britain. In May, five people were killed when security forces raided Qassim s homevillage to disperse followers who had camped out outside his house, and arrested 286 people, according to the interior ministry. Bahrain, where the U.S. Fifth Fleet that helps secure the Gulf s oil-shipping lanes is based, crushed Arab Spring protests in 2011 led by Shi ites demanding a bigger share in running the country. But unrest has lingered on with occasional outbursts that are put down by force by the authorities.     \"],[\"ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey said on Friday that U.S. President Donald Trump told President Tayyip Erdogan he had issued instructions that weapons should not be provided to Kurdish YPG fighters in Syria, and that the Turkish government hoped to see that order carried out.

Things happened on our platform in this election that should not have happened,  Sandberg said in an interview in Washington with Axios news that was broadcast on its website.  We told Congress and the intelligence committees that when they are ready to release the ads, we are ready to help them.  Axios asked Sandberg what the world s largest social network knew about the extent of Russia s use of its platform and if ads on Facebook that had been placed by Russian accounts and Donald Trump s presidential campaign had overlapped in terms of target audiences. She appeared to sidestep the questions and said only that targeting on Facebook was often very broad.  The interview was the first by a senior Facebook executive since the company disclosed last month that it had found some 3,000 politically divisive ads believed to have been bought by Russia before and after the presidential campaign. U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia used cyber-enabled means in an attempt to help Trump win the White House, an allegation the Kremlin has denied. Sandberg was in Washington for meetings with U.S. lawmakers.  Sandberg told the Congressional Black Caucus on Thursday that Facebook planned to add an African-American to its board of directors, a source familiar with the closed-door meeting said, but she offered no details. The board has been criticized for its lack of diversity.  She and two other Facebook executives, Erin Egan and Elliot Schrage, also met privately with Representative Jackie Speier, a California Democrat and member of the House Intelligence Committee. Facebook and other major internet companies including Alphabet s Google (GOOGL.O) and Twitter (TWTR.N) are on the defensive as they try to limit fallout from a torrent of  revelations about how Moscow sought to use their platforms to sow discord in the United States and influence the election. Sandberg told Axios that Facebook began hearing rumors around Election Day last November of Russian attempts to use the platform to spread propaganda but did not give a precise timeline about when the company began its review. Sandberg said she supported the public release of those ads, and the pages to which they were connected. Information about how the ads targeted specific types of users would also be released, she said. Asked if Facebook contributed to Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton s defeat last year, Sandberg, an open Clinton supporter during the campaign, did not answer directly but said it was important the website was  free from abuse  during any election in any country. Congressional committees and special counsel Robert Mueller are investigating Russian interference in the election, including whether there was any collusion between Trump associates and Moscow. Trump has denied that there was any collusion between his campaign and associates and Russia. Sandberg acknowledged that the company had erred in how it handled the issue of foreign interference last year.  It s not just that we apologize. We re angry, we re upset. But what we really owe the American people is determination to do a better job of preventing foreign meddling,  she said.  We don t want this kind of foreign interference  on Facebook, Sandberg said.  She said the company had been too permissive at times in terms of how advertisers were allowed to target users. Sandberg said it was important to protect  free expression  on Facebook and that if the Russian ads had been bought by legitimate accounts instead of fraudulent ones, many would have been allowed to run on the site. She criticized Twitter s decision this week to remove a campaign video from Republican Representative Marsha Blackburn, who is running for a U.S. Senate seat in Tennessee. Twitter took down the video, saying a remark Blackburn made about opposing abortion was inflammatory. Twitter later reversed its decision.  In that ad, there are a lot of things that people don t like, that I don t like. ... But the question is,  Should divisive political or issue ads run?  Our answer is yes because when you cut off speech for one person you cut off speech for all people,  she said. Sandberg said Facebook wanted other internet companies to work toward making ad purchases more transparent, and she said  Facebook was talking with lawmakers who want to introduce legislation on the issue. Representatives from Facebook, Google and Twitter are expected to testify about Russian influence at hearings before the Senate and House intelligence committees on Nov. 1. \"],[\"GUADALUPE, Mexico\\u002fTORNILLO, Texas (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s plan to end the policy of “catch and release” - where illegal immigrants are caught and then freed pending hearings - could hit a wall, immigrant advocates warn, and not the one he is planning to build on the Mexican border. “OK, Mr Trump, you don’t want them released, show me where you are going to hold them - show me the building,” said Ruben Garcia, the director of Annunciation House, a Roman Catholic charity in El Paso, Texas, that gives shelter to migrant families.  Garcia’s group received more than 400 migrants released by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement just between Monday and Wednesday, the day Trump announced tougher measures to curb illegal immigration. “They are releasing them not because they want to do catch and release, but because detention centers don’t have enough space,” said Garcia. That underscores one potential problem of ending the practice of “catch and release” - almost half the immigrants apprehended by U.S. officials are now Central American families or children, and only a tiny number of detention spaces are available for those categories of immigrants. Trump did announce plans to increase the number of family detention centers, but establishing them will take time and could face legal challenges, legal experts on immigration said.   A Reuters review of U.S. Customs and Border Patrol data shows an accelerating trend of Central American families who hand themselves in at the border and are released while awaiting deportation or a decision on an asylum request. In the last three months of 2016, the number of people - almost all of them families and children - who handed themselves in to agents along the U.S.-Mexican border rose by a quarter versus the same period the year before, CBP data shows.  Agents apprehended a total of 136,670 people crossing the Mexican border, the highest number since 2008, and 48 percent of those were unaccompanied children or families with children.  Nearly 45,000 parents with children were apprehended in the October-December quarter, but the border currently has beds for only around 3,300 people in this category of immigrants, mostly at the Karnes and Dilley detention centers in Texas, according to ICE data from 2016. Because most of the families are from Central America, they cannot immediately be turned around and sent back to Mexico. Lack of space in detention centers for parents with children means that almost all such migrants, who are mostly fleeing poverty and violence in Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, are fitted with an electronic ankle bracelet, given a court date and released. Many end up requesting asylum, a process that can take five or more years to be resolved, immigration lawyers say. Even without requesting asylum, it can take years to deport families through the United States’ bunged-up immigration courts. Trump could expand a policy practiced under former President Barack Obama of using military bases to temporarily house more immigrants. The Fort Bliss base in El Paso has housed thousands of children since September, for example. He could also explore ways to refit other existing facilities to help handle the flood of families. Building more detention centers like Karnes and Dilley will take longer. They also typically face legal challenges by civil rights lawyers concerned about the living conditions in them. Trump could also seek to expand an Obama program aimed at increasing the number of Central American asylum seekers who make their initial claim from their home country. In the long term, he could ask Mexico to let immigrants make the asylum claims from there, although ties between the two countries are now seriously frayed because of Trump’s vow to force Mexico to pay for a wall on the southern U.S. border. Garcia, the shelter director, acknowledged that if Trump was finally successful in opening thousands more detention spaces for families, that would slow the numbers coming.  “The word would spread that the probability they will be locked up and put on a plane had become much higher,” Garcia said. Central Americans are usually deported from the United States on flights back to their home countries. While the number of “turn-ins” - those who hand themselves in to U.S. authorities - are highest around McAllen, Texas, the jump has been particularly noticeable in the El Paso sector of the border with Mexico. Here, 60 percent of the immigrants apprehended between October and December were children or families. For years a quiet spot on the immigration map, El Paso saw 5,200 families apprehended in the period, nearly three times as many compared to the same period a year ago, and 1,972, or double, the number of unaccompanied children. U.S Border Patrol agent Jose Romero has observed the trend first-hand along the tall, rust-colored fence punctuated with rural border crossings stretching some 40 miles (65 km) from El Paso to beyond Tornillo, Texas. “A lot of the traffic we are seeing right now is family groups ... coming across and they are looking for an agent right away to turn themselves in,” Romero said, calling it a change from the past, when more people were trying to sneak in undetected. “They want to be apprehended.” The fence, finished in 2010, ends abruptly near pecan orchards and irrigation ditches on the Texan side, across the Rio Grande from Mexico’s drug war-torn Valle de Juarez, a  cotton-farming region now littered with burned-out homes. Last February, Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto and Obama’s secretary of commerce, Penny Pritzker, opened a major new border crossing from Tornillo on the Texan side, to Guadalupe on the Mexican side, hoping to boost trade between the countries. By November, truck traffic was still light across the bridge. Instead, ICE opened a temporary holding center, with 500 places in white tents on the asphalt on the U.S. side of the bridge, to help process some of the surging numbers of migrant families apprehended by U.S. officials in the surrounding area. \"],[\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Tax-policy writers in the U.S. House of Representatives are considering legislation to bring tax relief to businesses and individuals affected by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, the top House lawmaker on tax issues said on Tuesday. Representative Kevin Brady, Republican chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said staff was working with lawmakers from affected states to craft a bill that would help lessen the blow of property losses, facilitate access to retirement savings and encourage charitable giving. He said the committee could act on legislation before Oct 1. “They’re really looking at how do we get our small businesses back up and running, how do we get customers to them and how do we help families and communities rebuild,” Brady told reporters.  In past years, aides say Congress has sought to help disaster victims through a number of tax innovations including special tax credits for low-income housing, tax deferrals on gains from insurance payments and special refunds on tax filings from past years. Irma has caused widespread damage in Florida, weeks after Harvey inundated Houston and southeast Texas with record flooding last month. \"],[\"MANCHESTER, England (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May set out her quest to tackle social and racial injustice on Tuesday, hoping to shift the focus of her Conservative party s annual conference away from rifts over Britain s exit from the European Union and her leadership. After a bruising start to the party s annual meeting in the city of Manchester, May will try to reset the agenda after remarks on Brexit policy by foreign minister Boris Johnson that deepened divisions in her top team of advisers. She said an audit will be published on Oct. 10 spelling out the  uncomfortable truths  of life in Britain, showing how people of different racial backgrounds are treated in the health, education, employment and the criminal justice system. Her ministers will also announce policies to try to prove critics wrong and show that her government is working, including measures to toughen sentences of people streaming or browsing extremist material, and to increase nurse training.  In doing this ground-breaking work we are holding a mirror up to our society,  May said in a statement.  My most fundamental political belief is that how far you go in life should be based on your talent and how hard you work - and nothing else.  But in early morning broadcast interviews, May was repeatedly asked about her relationship with Johnson after he set out four personal red lines for the Brexit negotiations to unravel more than 40 years of union.  I don t set red lines,  May told BBC television, describing her cabinet of top ministers as united over Brexit.  Leadership is about ensuring that you have a team of people who aren t yes men, but a team of people of different voices around the table so that we can discuss matters, come to an agreement and then put that government view forward, and that is exactly what we ve done.  May promised to build a  country that works for everyone, not just the privileged few  when she became prime minister just over a year ago after Britons voted narrowly to leave the EU and her predecessor David Cameron stepped down. But she has had to shelve many of her domestic policies - such as social care and corporate reforms - since losing the Conservatives  majority in parliament in a June election. That setback has undermined the party s confidence in her ability to lead it into the next election, due in 2022. The preliminary findings of the audit showed that the unemployment rate for black, Asian and minority ethnic people of working age is nearly double that for white groups, while more than nine in 10 headteachers are white, the government said. The findings, the government says, can help better target training and mentoring programs.  The idea itself is not new,  May said.  Charles Booth s maps of rich and poor areas in Victorian London drew attention to hardship that was too often hidden   but this focus on how ethnicity affects people s lives will present findings that are uncomfortable.  \"],[\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Libertarian Party presidential candidate Gary Johnson and Green Party hopeful Jill Stein have failed to quality for the first planned U.S. presidential debate on Sept. 26, the Commission on Presidential Debates said on Friday. The commission, citing the averages the various candidates have achieved in selected polls, confirmed that Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton had met the criteria. It also said that the vice presidential running mates of the two leading candidates were the only two to qualify for the vice presidential debate set for Oct. 4. The first presidential debate will be held at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York and the vice presidential debate at Longwood University in Farmville, Virginia. Using the average of five national polls, Clinton scored 43 percent, Trump 40.4 percent, Johnson 8.4 percent and Stein 3.2 percent, the commission said. Selection for the debates requires at least 15 percent support. Johnson and Stein were both constitutionally eligible and had ballot access in enough states to theoretically win an electoral college majority, but missed the polling threshold. Stein’s campaign website said she and her running mate Ajamu Baraka will both attend the first presidential debate, and urged supporters to join them. The campaign said it might ask supporters to attempt to escort the candidates into the debate in an action that “may lead to arrest — it is possible but not definite. There will be actions you can take with us at Hofstra that do not risk arrest.” The campaign said it is “organizing nonviolent civil resistance training for this.” Johnson said in a statement that: “I would say I’m surprised that the CPD has chosen to exclude me from the first debate, but I’m not.” The commission was a private organization created by the Republican and Democratic parties “for the clear purpose of taking control of the only nationally televised presidential debates voters will see,” Johnson said. The last time a third-party candidate was allowed to participate in the televised debates was in 1992, when Ross Perot met the requirements running as an independent. \"],[\"ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey cautioned its citizens on Saturday to take care when traveling to Germany, citing what it said was an upswing in anti-Turkish sentiment ahead of a German national election later this month. The advisory is likely to further exacerbate tensions between the two NATO allies, whose ties have soured following last year s failed coup against Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and his subsequent crackdown on alleged coup supporters.  The political leadership campaigns in Germany are based on anti-Turkey sentiment and preventing our country s EU membership. The political atmosphere... has actually been under the effects of far-right and even racist rhetoric for some time,  Turkey s foreign mininstry said in a statement. Last weekend German Chancellor Angela Merkel said during a televised election debate that she would seek an end to Turkey s membership talks with the European Union, in an apparent shift of her position that infuriated Ankara.  Merkel, whose conservative Christian Democrats (CDU) have long been skeptical about Turkey s EU ambitions, is expected to win a fourth term in office in Germany s Sept. 24 election.  Turkish citizens who live in, or who plan to travel to, Germany should be cautious and act prudently in cases of possible incidents, behavior or verbal assaults of xenophobia and racism,  the foreign ministry said. The advisory marks a reversal of roles. Earlier this year Germany warned its own citizens traveling to Turkey about increased tensions and protests ahead of a Turkish referendum on April 16 which considerably expanded Erdogan s powers. Merkel and other EU leaders have strongly criticized Erdogan s actions since the failed coup, saying his purges of Turkey s state institutions and armed forces amount to a deliberate attempt to stifle criticism. More than 50,000 people have been detained and 150,000  suspended in the crackdown, including journalists and opposition figures. Some German nationals have also been targeted. Turkey says the purges are necessary given the extent of the security threat it faces. \"],[\"DUBAI (Reuters) - Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Wednesday U.S. President Donald Trump would fail in his hardened stance towards Iran, saying Tehran was stronger than during the time of the  more powerful and smarter  Ronald Reagan.   Reagan was more powerful and smarter than Trump, and he was a better actor in making threats, and he also moved against us and they shot down our plane,  Khamenei said in a speech carried on state television. In 1988, a U.S. warship shot down an Iranian passenger plane over the Gulf, killing all 290 aboard, in an incident which Washington said was a mistake. Tehran said it was a deliberate attack on Iran, then at war with neighboring Iraq.   But Reagan is gone and, according to out beliefs, he now faces God s retribution ... while Iran has made great advances in all areas since Reagan s time,  Khamenei added.   This trend will continue under the current American president and any hopes on their part that the Islamic Republic would back off or weaken is futile.  Trump refused in October to certify that Tehran is complying with its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers and warned he might ultimately terminate the agreement. He announced the shift in U.S. policy in a speech in which he detailed a more aggressive approach to Iran over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs and its support for militant groups in the Middle East. Under the nuclear deal, sanctions on Iran were lifted in return for Tehran rolling back technologies with nuclear bomb-making potential. \"],[\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday urged Senate Republicans to pass a “generous” replacement program for Obamacare, as the Senate struggled to produce an alternative to the healthcare law. Capitol Hill sources who asked not to be named said Trump described the version of the legislation that passed the House last month as “mean.” That House bill was widely criticized for letting states seek waivers from insurance protections for people with pre-existing conditions. Trump discussed the healthcare bill at a White House lunch he hosted for Republican senators in a bid to help the lawmakers find common ground to move forward with healthcare reform legislation this summer. The White House declined to comment on private conversations between Trump and lawmakers. During the portion of the lunch open to reporters, Trump told the lawmakers their healthcare bill would need to be “generous” and “kind.” “That may be adding additional money into it,” he said, without offering details on how much money might be needed or how it might be used. Trump stepped up pressure for the repeal with a tweet Tuesday morning declaring that the Affordable Care Act, nicknamed Obamacare, “is in a death spiral.” He cited the government’s announcement Monday that some 2 million people who signed up for Obamacare have dropped out this year.  Although Trump’s Republican Party has a majority in both houses of Congress, Trump blamed “obstructionist” Democrats for the lack of progress in repealing President Barack Obama’s signature domestic achievement. Senator John Thune, the No. 3 Republican in the Senate, who attended the lunch meeting, said Trump was open to suggestions that some federal cost-sharing payments to health insurers under Obamacare continue in the near term but that the president did not make any definite pronouncements on that issue. Those payments help cover out-of-pocket medical expenses for low-income Americans. Trump has said he might consider withholding them but insurers say that would wreak havoc in the markets. Thune also said Trump did not give any deadlines to the senators on passing the bill. “I hope that we can stay on schedule to have floor action before the Fourth of July break,” Thune said.       The House of Representatives narrowly approved its version of repeal last month but Senate Republicans have been unable to coalesce around their own version of a bill, with moderates and conservatives pushing in different directions in meetings behind closed doors. The senators Trump invited to lunch included Republicans from both ideological camps. Moderates Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski were on the list as well as conservatives Ted Cruz and Mike Lee. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said senators are closer to bringing up a proposal and other Republicans have predicted for some time that a bill would be ready for a vote before the August recess. Senate aides said the Senate bill was not expected to touch insurance protections that are included in Obamacare for people with pre-existing medical conditions, after the controversy over the House bill that would let states seek waivers from those protections. In states with such waivers, people with pre-existing conditions could still get coverage but they would not be shielded against potentially higher costs. Another senator at the lunch, Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, said after the meeting that there still was a lot of work to do before legislation can be unveiled.  “The total bill hasn’t been resolved,” he said. \"],[\"NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenya s government denied a request by Supreme Court judges for extra security after one of their bodyguards was shot, preventing them from holding a hearing that could have delayed last week s presidential election, a senior judicial source said on Tuesday. The court has been center stage since it annulled an Aug. 8 vote won by President Uhuru Kenyatta, citing procedural irregularities and ordering a repeat vote within 60 days. The decision was the first of its kind in Africa, where governments often hold sway over judges. It angered some of Kenyatta s supporters, who said the judges had thwarted the will of the people. Kenyatta won 98 percent of the vote in the Oct. 26 re-run after opposition leader Raila Odinga boycotted it on the grounds it would not be fair because the election board had failed to implement reforms he sought after the court decision. The Supreme Court had been due to meet on Oct. 25 to deliberate on an eleventh-hour request to delay the re-run. But the day before, the bodyguard of its deputy chief justice was shot as he bought pot plants beside a highway. Only Chief Justice David Maraga turned up for the Oct. 25 hearing. Without a minimum quorum of five judges, Maraga said the court could not make a ruling on the petition, paving the way for the election re-run to go ahead. Asked about the request by the judges, Interior ministry spokesman Mwenda Njoka said security for all judges was enhanced in the wake of the shooting.  If anybody is telling you to the contrary, they are not telling the truth,  he told Reuters. The government said the bodyguard s shooting was a robbery rather than an attempt to intimidate the judges, whom Kenyatta had branded as  crooks  after they voided the August election. Treating the shooting as a regular crime angered the judges, who demanded they get extra security, the judicial source said.  In Kenya, ordinary criminals don t attack government vehicles driven by armed government agents who know how to shoot,  the source said. The justices demanded that their security should be publicly guaranteed given the tensions over the election or else they would refuse to attend hearings, the source said. At least 55 people have died in political violence since the August vote. The European Union monitoring mission raised the issue of intimidation after the Supreme Court hearing failed to go ahead on Oct. 25, saying it was vital that judges be allowed to work  in freedom and safety .  The lack of a quorum is highly unusual for a Supreme Court hearing and has raised serious questions among Kenyan stakeholders, including about possible political interference,  it said in a statement that day. \"],[\"BERLIN (Reuters) - Frauke Petry, the former co-leader of the far right Alternative for Germany (AfD), will unveil her new  Blue Party  on Friday, promising a  reasonable conservative  agenda that would appeal to a broad base of Germans, she told a newspaper group. Petry, a 42-year-old chemist, was for a time the most visible face of the AfD, helping to build the public appeal that saw it win 12.6 percent of the vote last month and become the first far right group in the German parliament since the 1960s. But although she has long espoused strong anti-immigrant views, she berated other leading figures in the AfD for holding positions too far outside the mainstream and making it impossible for the party to join a coalition government. During the months leading up to the election she took a lower profile role in campaigning, all but vanishing from TV screens as more radical figures became the party s public faces. She won a seat in parliament on the AfD s list last month, but quit the party the next day in a surprise announcement at its victory press conference, pledging to sit in parliament initially as an independent. She told RND newspaper group in an interview published late on Thursday that she would hold a small initial event to announce her new Blue Party on Friday in her home state of Saxony in the former communist East. More rallies would follow around the country from November under the banner of  Blue Change  or  Blaue Wende , she said. Wende is the term widely used to describe the dramatic shift in German society after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989.  Blue stands for conservative, but also liberal policies in Germany and in Europe,  she told RND, adding that her new group would seek to replicate the success of the Christian Social Union (CSU), the Bavarian sister party of Chancellor Angela Merkel s conservatives, on a national level. The CSU, part of Merkel s conservative bloc in parliament, has taken a harder line than Merkel s own Christian Democratic Union over immigration, but fields candidates only in Bavaria, a state that accounts for 15 percent of Germany s population.   Every third German would like a reasonable, conservative political offering,  she said, adding that many frustrated voters had supported the pro-business Free Democrats, the AfD or  Merkel s CDU on Sept. 24 for lack of a better alternative. Petry said she had begun working on plans for her new party as early as August, after AfD members refused to accept her more moderate proposals at a party congress in Cologne. RND said German election authorities listed the new party as having been founded on Sept. 17, a week before the vote. Petry defended her decision to quit the AfD while keeping her seat won on its list, saying she would remain loyal to her voters.  The mandate doesn t belong to the party, even if it was won with party funds,  she said. The AfD is ostracized by all other parties, which refuse to work with it. None even wants to sit next to the AfD in parliament. \"],[\"(Reuters) - New Jersey Governor Chris Christie on Monday vetoed a bill that would have required President Donald Trump to release his tax returns in order to run for re-election in the state, calling it “politics at its worst.” The Democrat-controlled state legislature had passed the bill in March in response to Trump’s refusal to make public his tax returns when he ran for president as a Republican last year. Under the law, any candidate for president or vice president could not appear on the ballot without releasing at least five years of returns. Before Trump, every major presidential candidate had done so voluntarily since the 1970s. Christie, who became one of Trump’s earliest high-profile backers after his own White House run fizzled and served on Trump’s transition team, said the legislation was an unconstitutional “form of therapy” for Democrats unwilling to accept Trump’s win over Democrat Hillary Clinton. “The hypocrisy and false outrage underlying this bill is stunning - even by Trenton standards,” he said in a statement accompanying the veto. New Jersey was the first of at least 20 states considering similar legislation to send a bill to its governor’s desk for consideration. The chairman of the state assembly’s judiciary committee, Democrat John McKeon, called Christie’s comments “grandstanding and childish rhetoric.” “This much is clear – Governor Christie is obsessed with protecting and showing allegiance to President Trump,” McKeon added in a statement. “Sad!” The state Senate majority leader, Democrat Loretta Weinberg, said voters “deserve to know what financial ties and interests candidates for the presidency and vice presidency have, including with other countries.” Trump’s critics have said his tax returns represent the only way to assess any potential conflicts of interest related to his sprawling business empire. Democrats have also suggested the returns could reveal politically damaging information, such as Trump’s possible use of loopholes to avoid paying income taxes. During the campaign, Trump said he would not release the returns because he was being audited, and the White House has made it clear he has no intention of doing so after winning the election. \"],[\"(Reuters) - After months of internal discord, Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday were still trying to craft a bill to overhaul the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, a law they have been attacking since it was enacted in 2010. Two attempts in recent weeks to pass an overhaul bill have collapsed in confusion, with conservatives pushing for a more complete repeal and moderates keen to avoid going too far for fear of angering their constituents. Obamacare brought health insurance coverage to millions of Americans. The first version of the Republican bill, known as the American Health Care Act, or AHCA, would have left 24 million more Americans without coverage, according to an estimate by nonpartisan congressional researchers. The House has recently added two amendments to the AHCA to try to appease both conservatives and moderates. Here are the latest versions of the bill’s main provisions:  The Republican plan would maintain some of Obamacare’s most popular provisions. It would allow young adults to stay on their parents’ health plan until age 26 and it would ban insurers from setting a lifetime dollar limit on coverage. An amendment introduced by moderate Republican Representative Tom MacArthur would let states opt out of Obamacare’s mandate that insurers charge sick and healthy people the same rates. It would also allow states to opt out of Obamacare’s requirement that insurers cover 10 essential health benefits, such as maternity care and mental health treatment.  The measure would provide states with $100 billion, largely to fund high-risk pools to provide insurance to the sickest patients. An amendment added Wednesday would provide another $8 billion over five years to help those with pre-existing conditions pay for health insurance. The bill would let insurers mark up premiums by 30 percent for those who have a lapse in insurance coverage of about two months or more. Insurers won another provision they had long sought: The ability to charge older Americans up to five times more than young people. Under Obamacare, they could only charge up to three times more. The Republicans want to end in 2018 Obamacare’s income-based tax credits that help low-income people buy insurance. These would be replaced with age-based tax credits ranging from $2,000 to $4,000 per year that would be capped at upper-income levels. While Obamacare’s credits gave more help to those with lower incomes, the Republican plan would be largely age-based. The Republican bill would abolish most Obamacare taxes, including on medical devices, health insurance premiums, indoor tanning salons, prescription medications and high-cost employer-provided insurance known as “Cadillac” plans. Those taxes paid for Obamacare. Republicans have not said how they would pay for the parts of the law they want to keep. The bill would also repeal the Obamacare financial penalty for the 2016 tax year for not purchasing insurance, as well as a surtax on investment income earned by upper-income Americans. It would repeal the mandate that larger employers must offer insurance to their employees.  Under Obamacare, more than 30 states, including about a dozen Republican states, expanded the Medicaid government health insurance program for the poor. About half of Obamacare enrollees obtained insurance through the expansion. The bill would allow the Medicaid expansion to continue until January 1, 2020, providing states chose not to expand. After that date, expansion would end and Medicaid funding would be capped on a per-person basis. State Medicaid plans would no longer have to cover some Obamacare-mandated essential health benefits, fulfilling a Republican promise to return more control to the states. \"],[\"NEW YORK (Reuters) - President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday promised a “major border tax” on companies that shift jobs outside the United States, further pressuring American businesses days after Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCHA.MI) (FCAU.N) said heavy tariffs could force the company to shutter Mexican plants. Since the Nov. 8 election, Trump has taken to Twitter to call out by name a number of manufacturers with both planned and existing operations outside of the country. On Wednesday, he returned to the issue in his first news conference since the election. Trump, who will be sworn into office on Jan. 20, warned of a “very large border tax” on companies that shift production to foreign countries. “You want to move your plant, and you think, as an example, you’re going to build that plant in Mexico, and you’re going to make your air conditioners or your cars, or whatever you’re making, and you’re going to sell them through what will be a very, very strong border ... Not going to happen. You’re going to pay a very large border tax,” he warned.       U.S. automakers in particular have felt the brunt of Trump’s ire, as he has called for the industry to return to former manufacturing hubs in the American Midwest from Mexico, which accounts for a fifth of all vehicle production in North America and has attracted more than $24 billion in auto investment since 2010, according to the Ann Arbor, Michigan-based Center for Automotive Research.     Trump thanked Fiat Chrysler and Ford Motor Co (F.N) for announcements in the past week of investments in Midwestern plants. He added that he hoped General Motors Co (GM.N), the No. 1 American automaker, would take similar steps to expand U.S. operations. On Monday, Fiat Chrysler Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne said, “It’s possible, if the economic terms imposed by the U.S. administration on anything that comes into the United States that, if they’re sufficiently large, that it would make the production of anything in Mexico uneconomical. “We would have to withdraw,” Marchionne said. “It is quite possible.” Trump also reiterated his criticism of Lockheed Martin Corp’s (LMT.N) F-35 fighter jet program, saying it was “way, way behind schedule and many, many billions of dollars over budget.” After the news conference, Lockheed Martin said in a statement read on CNBC, “We understand President-elect Trump’s concerns about the F-35 program and we’ve given him our full commitment to drive down cost aggressively.” In its annual State of the American Business Address on Wednesday morning, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which traditionally has worked in concert with the Republican Party, urged Trump not to add to the “burdens” of exporters by erecting barriers to trade that could hamper economic growth. \"],[\"MIAMI (Reuters) - Two Florida ports have canceled plans to sign cooperation pacts with Communist-ruled Cuba after state Governor Rick Scott threatened to cancel their funding if they did business with the “Cuban dictatorship.” The news comes as Cuba watchers are looking closely for signs of how the United States’ fragile detente with Cuba will fare under President Donald Trump. Trump has threatened to scrap moves to normalize relations, one of former President Barack Obama’s signature foreign policy initiatives, if he doesn’t get “a better deal.” “Disappointed some (Florida ports) would enter into any agreement with Cuban dictatorship,” Scott wrote on Twitter on Wednesday. “I will recommend restricting state funds for ports that work with Cuba in my budget. Port authorities along the U.S. Southern coast are strong proponents of increased trade and travel with Cuba, and some have expressed interest in using Mariel, located on the northwest coast of the Caribbean island, as a transshipment hub. The Ports of Everglades and Palm Beach had been planning to sign agreements with Cuba during the visit of a Cuban trade delegation this week but said they decided to withdraw the deals. Port of Everglades spokeswoman Ellen Kennedy said this move would not impact trade with Cuba, which was conducted by tenants rather than the ports themselves. One of Port Everglades’ tenants, Crowley Maritime Corporation, has been exporting U.S.-made goods including poultry and medicine to Cuba since obtaining a license to do so from the Office of Foreign Asset Control in late 2001.  On Tuesday, Crowley also imported two containers of charcoal from Cuba, the first direct legal import from Cuba to the United States in more than half a century. Kennedy said the memorandum of understanding had been  designed to be a “good will gesture” to form a strong alliance with Cuban ports. Cuba and the United States have restored diplomatic ties and signed various cooperation agreements since Obama agreed with Cuban President Raul Castro in December 2014 to work to normalize relations. Obama, a Democrat, used executive orders to circumvent the longstanding U.S. trade embargo on Cuba and ease some restrictions on travel and business. The embargo can only be lifted by the U.S. Congress, which is controlled by Republicans. Trump, who can reverse Obama’s executive orders, has threatened to end the detente if Cuba does not make further political and other concessions, although he has not specified what these should be. \"],[\"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Former FBI Director James Comey’s testimony that U.S. President Donald Trump expected loyalty and hoped Comey would drop an investigation of a former top aide could bolster obstruction of justice allegations against Trump, several legal experts said.  Such allegations might be used as the basis for impeachment proceedings, some of the analysts said. Any such step would face a steep hurdle, however, as it would require approval by the U.S. House of Representatives, which is controlled by Trump’s fellow Republicans. According to written testimony posted on the Senate Intelligence Committee’s website on Wednesday, Comey said Trump told him during a one-on-one Feb. 14 conversation that former national security adviser Michael Flynn was a “good guy” and hoped that Comey could see his “way clear” to letting go a probe into ties between Flynn and Russia. Trump had fired Flynn the previous day in a controversy over contacts between the retired general and the Russian ambassador to the United States.  Comey’s account, released ahead of his appearance before the committee on Thursday, could show that Trump intended to impede the Flynn investigation, said Michael Gerhardt, a professor of constitutional law at the University of North Carolina School of Law.  “The express discussion of loyalty is disconcerting,” and could heighten speculation that the “president was trying to exert some pressure or at least exert some influence over the Russia investigation,” Gerhardt said. Comey, who was fired by Trump on May 9, was leading an FBI investigation of Flynn as it looks into allegations of links between Russia and Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign. Moscow and Trump have both denied any collusion. Trump’s lawyer, Marc Kasowitz, did not immediately respond to a Reuters query about whether Comey’s testimony would support an obstruction case. But he said in a statement that Trump felt “vindicated” by Comey’s confirmation he was not under investigation in any Russia probe.     To build a criminal obstruction of justice case, federal law requires prosecutors to show that a person acted with “corrupt” intent. It does not matter whether the person succeeds in impeding an investigation.  While a sitting president is unlikely to face criminal prosecution, obstruction of justice could form the basis for impeachment.  Bruce Green, a professor at Fordham University School of Law, said it would be difficult to show Trump intended to impede the Flynn investigation. He said Trump could say he was merely vouching for Flynn’s character and voicing concerns about how the probe was interfering with his ability to function as president. Alan Dershowitz, a professor emeritus at Harvard Law School and well-known defense lawyer, added that Trump’s comments to Comey were “ambiguous statements” and “not even close to obstruction of justice.”  Other legal experts said, however, that details surrounding the Feb. 14 conversation could indicate that Trump intended to interfere with the Flynn probe.   According to Comey, Trump told his close advisers, including Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Jared Kushner, to leave the room so he could speak to Comey privately. “Asking others to leave the room could suggest the president was aware that there was something wrong with what he was doing,” said Andrew Wright, a professor of constitutional law at Savannah Law School. Wright said there were other damaging details in Comey’s testimony, including that Comey did not document his conversations with former President Barack Obama but “felt compelled” to do so after his first conversation with Trump. Comey’s testimony does “maximum damage” to Trump, Wright said. Gerhardt agreed the testimony was a blow to Trump, saying: “Some people who weren’t concerned before should be concerned now.”  \"],[\"LONDON (Reuters) - Pro-European campaigners accused ministers of failing to take preparations for Brexit seriously enough on Thursday, after a committee of lawmakers published the government s sector-by-sector analysis on the impact of leaving the European Union. The analyses have become a focal point for critics of the government s approach to Brexit since last year s referendum vote to leave. The government revealed in October the 58 economic sectors  it had analyzed to help it prepare for leaving, but refused requests to publish them. Brexit minister David Davis said the reports contained  excruciating detail  and that their publication could undermine negotiations with the EU. However, lawmakers demanded to see the papers and used an unusual parliamentary procedure to compel the government to hand them over to a parliamentary committee. The committee published them on Thursday, but with some sensitive sections redacted.  There is little or nothing in them that couldn t be learned from the annual reports of different trade bodies,  said Pat McFadden, a member of the committee and spokesman for the Open Britain campaign group.  Breezy busking won t cut it when people s jobs and livelihoods are on the line. Winging it should not be a matter of principle,  the opposition Labour Party lawmaker said.  Since his initial remarks, Davis has stressed that the work does not constitute a formal impact assessment - a detailed document setting out the economic implications of policy decisions. He said earlier this month that it was too soon for such work to have been conducted.  The documents released on Thursday cover sectors from asset management to tourism, describing each sector, the current EU regulatory regime and a summary of how trade is conducted in these areas. A section entitled  sector views  was redacted by the committee. Non-profit organization The Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, which has previously warned of the risks posed by leaving the EU, also criticized the documents.  What leaps out at you is the total absence of analysis. Search, and you do not find,  said the organization s director Richard Black.  \"],[\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The State Department is considering formally declaring the crackdown on Myanmar s Rohingya Muslims to be ethnic cleansing, U.S. officials said on Tuesday, as lawmakers called for sanctions against the Southeast Asian country s military. Pressure has mounted for a tougher U.S. response to the Rohingya crisis ahead of President Donald Trump s maiden visit to Asia next month when he will attend a summit of Southeast Asian countries, including Myanmar, in Manila. U.S. officials are preparing a recommendation for Secretary of State Rex Tillerson that would define the military-led campaign against the Rohingya as ethnic cleansing, which could spur new sanctions, the U.S. government sources said. The proposal - part of an overall review of Myanmar policy - could be sent to Tillerson as early as this week, and he would then decide whether to adopt it, according to the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity. More than 600,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled Rakhine state in Buddhist-majority Myanmar, mostly to neighboring Bangladesh, since security forces responded to Rohingya militants  attacks on Aug. 25 by launching a crackdown. The United Nations has already denounced it as a classic example of ethnic cleansing. Three U.S. officials testifying at a Senate hearing on Tuesday declined to say whether the treatment of the Rohingya  was ethnic cleansing, but listed new measures including targeted sanctions that Washington is considering. Those steps, however, stopped short of the most drastic tools at Washington s disposal such as reimposing broader economic sanctions suspended under the Obama administration.  I m not in a position ... to characterize it today, but to me this very closely resembles some of the worst kind of atrocities that I ve seen during a long career,  Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Mark Storella said when pressed to say whether he viewed the situation as ethnic cleansing. Senator Ben Cardin, the ranking Democrat on the Foreign Affairs Committee, said he considered the treatment of the Rohingya  genocide  and is working on bipartisan legislation that could spell out whether additional sanctions are needed. Myanmar, also known as Burma, insists that action was needed to combat  terrorists.  The recommendation to Tillerson - first reported by the Associated Press - is not expected to include a determination on whether  crimes against humanity  have been committed, as this would require further legal deliberations, one U.S. official said.  The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Some U.S. lawmakers criticized Aung San Suu Kyi, head of Myanmar s civilian-led government and a Nobel peace laureate once hugely popular in Washington, for failing to do more. Senator Bob Corker, Republican chairman of the committee, chided Suu Kyi for what he called  dismissiveness  toward the plight of the Rohingya and said it might be time for a  policy adjustment  toward Myanmar. At the hearing, Patrick Murphy, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian And Pacific Affairs, said additional  sanctions were being considered, but cautioned that doing so could lessen Washington s ability to influence Myanmar. \"],[\"(Reuters) - Donald Trump raised $1.7 million from donors and loaned his White House campaign $7.5 million in April as he moved closer to becoming the Republican nominee for president, according to documents filed with the U.S. Federal Election Commission (FEC) on Friday. The New York businessman had loaned his campaign a total of $43.5 million as of the end of April, the filings showed. More recently, he has made moves to build up his fundraising operation with an eye toward the Nov. 8 general election. Trump became the Republican Party’s presumptive nominee in early May, when both of his rivals dropped out of the race. Trump self-funded much of his primary run, but he has said he will not rely as heavily on his own money for the general election, when he will face the Democratic nominee. Both people seeking the Democratic nomination have raised more than Trump. Hillary Clinton, the party’s front-runner, brought in $26.4 million in April, including funds from a joint fundraising effort with the Democratic Party.  An outside Super PAC supporting her campaign raised $8.6 million. A Super PAC is a fund-raising group that must operate separate from political campaigns but can raise unlimited sums. U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, Clinton’s rival for the Democratic nomination, raised $26.9 million in April. He has disavowed Super PACs. Trump has criticized them too, though a long-time Republican operative in May joined one Super PAC backing the real estate mogul. In May, Trump hired investor Steven Mnuchin as his national finance chairman and entered a joint fundraising deal with the Republican National Committee that will allow donors to write much bigger checks. Friday’s FEC filings do not reflect these moves, but they show that Trump’s fundraising dipped in April, after he brought in about $3 million and loaned himself $11.5 million in March.  He also spent less in April, $9.4 million compared with $13.8 million a month earlier, when more states held nominating contests. Trump spent $2.6 million on advertising in April, less than half the $6.3 million he spent in March. By comparison, Sanders spent $17.3 million and Clinton spent $9.3 million on advertising in April.     Trump’s consulting and payroll spending also dropped about 30 percent to a total $1.7 million in April, even as he added experienced political staff. At the end of March, he hired veteran Republican strategist Paul Manafort.      Trump ended April with $2.4 million on hand, after starting the month with $2.1 million at the ready. \"],[\"BERLIN (Reuters) - A regional parliament has lifted the immunity of the best known politician in the anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, opening the way for prosecutors to pursue possible perjury charges against her. Frauke Petry, who is the AfD s co-chairwoman, has been dogged by allegations that she lied under oath to a committee of the Saxony parliament about how the party s campaign for the 2014 election in the state was financed. The ending of her immunity from prosecution adds to the right-wing party s problems less than four weeks before a national election. Weakened by infighting, it has bled support over the last year as voters  concerns about immigration have eased. Prosecutors have pursued the case against Petry, who denies the allegations, for more than a year. Her immunity as a member of the Saxony s parliament ended at midnight, a spokesman for the assembly said. A spokesman for prosecutors in the state capital Dresden said they would await written confirmation of that from the parliament s president before any further proceedings could be agreed upon. The AfD is polling between 7 and 10 percent in opinion surveys - well down from a high of 15.5 percent at the end of 2016 but still clearing the 5-percent threshold needed to enter the federal parliament in the Sept. 24 national election. Petry cuts an increasingly isolated figure in the AfD, which she transformed from an anti-euro party at its founding in 2013 into a group that taps into voters  concerns about migration. The party soared in the polls after Chancellor Angela Merkel s decision in 2015 to open Germany s borders to migrants fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East and beyond, of whom more than a million have since arrived. At a party conference in April, Petry suffered a humiliating defeat when delegates refused to discuss her plan to shift the party towards the mainstream. \"],[\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump’s eponymous business seminar program created a class to teach students how to cash in on U.S. mortgage foreclosures during the housing crisis. Trump University promised in 2009 that its “Fast Track to Foreclosure Investing” would teach students how to take advantage of the crisis, according to university documents unsealed last week in a lawsuit against the now-defunct program.     The release will likely stoke criticism from the campaign of Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton, who last week accused her likely rival in the Nov. 8 presidential election of having cheered on the 2008 housing crash as an investment opportunity. A spokeswoman for Trump’s campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment, although Trump reacted to Clinton’s criticism last week, saying: “What am I going to do? I’m in business.” A Trump University advertisement released in the case said one of its free investor workshops would explain how to “Cash in on one of the greatest property liquidations in history!” Trump University instructors were to teach students how to “capitalize without harm” and find ways for “sellers to move on without shame,” according to a December 2008 summary of the seminar. An earlier 2007 memo to enrollment counselors stated that about 1.5 million U.S. homeowners would face foreclosure that year and laid out how they should advise students to seize the “tremendous opportunity” to purchase properties at “major discounts” in “hot markets” such as Arizona, Florida and Texas. The roughly 400 pages of documents included “playbooks” on how to recruit students, directions for how instructors should deal with the media and other details about Trump’s seminar program. They were unsealed on Friday by U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel, whom Trump called “hostile” and “a hater,” adding he believed the judge was Mexican. New York’s attorney general slammed Trump on Tuesday for his comment on the judge’s ethnicity. Curiel is an American who was born in East Chicago, Indiana, and graduated from the Indiana University School of Law. Clinton’s attack on Trump last week was prompted by recently released audio that Trump recorded in 2006 for Trump University. In remarks on a possible “bubble burst,” Trump said in the recording: “I sort of hope that happens because then people like me would go in and buy” to “make a lot of money.” \"],[\"WASHINGTON\\u002fNEW YORK (Reuters) - One immediate consequence of Donald Trump’s stunning victory in the U.S. presidential race is that the identity crisis that convulsed the Republican Party during his tumultuous candidacy has been resolved. It’s Trump’s party now, for better or worse. Although having never before held public office, the businessman and former reality TV star vanquished 16 other Republican candidates to win the nomination and go on to defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton, but established Republicans challenged his commitment to party tenets and organized against him. Trump’s political ascent encountered fierce opposition from some in the party’s establishment wing that includes former Florida Governor Jeb Bush and Ohio Governor John Kasich and from others in its social-conservative faction, such as U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. All of them criticized Trump at times for straying from orthodox Republican positions on such issues as trade, his temperament or his lack of governing experience. But on Wednesday, all of that seemed forgotten and forgiven, at least for the moment, as Trump, the surprise winner in a 17-month-long election campaign, prepared to take power with the backing of Republican majorities in both chambers of Congress and the promise of an aggressive conservative agenda.  “The American people have spoken and it’s time to come together,” Kasich tweeted on Wednesday after he scrapped plans for a speech in Washington later this week that was intended to pave a new direction for the party after an expected Trump loss.  Bush said he would “pray” for Trump. Cruz termed Trump’s win “an amazing victory for the American worker.” Paul Ryan, speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives who had drawn the ire of Trump supporters by refusing to campaign for him, praised Trump on Wednesday and said that voters had delivered Trump a “mandate” to pursue his agenda, having won the electoral vote that counts while Clinton likely won the popular vote.  Had Trump lost, both Ryan and Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee, were expected to face challenges to their jobs. Now, having protected his House majority, Ryan will be Trump’s top legislative ally.  If, as many expect, Priebus is tapped by Trump to join his administration, Trump will be able to replace him with a hand-picked successor, thus cementing his grip on the party’s apparatus.  Republican donors who did not support Trump, too, were coming around.  “Nothing unifies like these decisive wins, and nothing unifies like the power of having the House, the Senate and the White House,” said an adviser to a leading donor. Representative Chris Collins, who was an early Trump supporter, said without the opposition of President Barack Obama, a Democrat, many divisions within the Republican Party would dissipate.  “The big difference is we now have complete Republican control,” Collins told Reuters. “We’re all on the same page give or take 10 percent, which is nuances more than anything.” Trump adopted much of the “Better Way” domestic policy agenda Ryan has painstakingly put together in over the last few years, notably revising his tax plan to bring it roughly in line with House Republicans’ proposal after initially floating much more drastic reform. Trump this year proposed cutting the top individual income tax rate to 33 percent from its current 39.6 percent. He had initially said he would drop that rate down to 25 percent but revised his proposal after tax experts said it would balloon government deficits. While Trump has offered a bare-bones outline of his replacement plan for Obama’s signature national healthcare law known as Obamacare, advisers told Reuters he would draw heavily on the House version. At a news conference on Wednesday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell vowed that Congress under Trump would move quickly to repeal Obamacare. It remains to be seen whether House Republicans view Trump’s mandate as extending to other, prominent campaign promises. Trump staked much of his candidacy on opposing major trade deals, while Republicans have generally favored free trade. Trump promised repeatedly not to touch Medicare and Social Security federal retirement benefits, asserting that Clinton would slash those programs even though she had not proposed to do so. Most mainstream Republicans believe revamping Medicare and Social Security is critical to curbing federal spending. Trump vowed to repeal the Dodd-Frank financial reform law. During the campaign he met with House Financial Services Chairman Jeb Hensarling but never endorsed Hensarling’s proposed bank regulation legislation and instead called for a return to the 1930s Glass-Steagall law separating commercial and investment banking.  Representative Warren Davidson, a member of the ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus in the House, said he thought Congress could get some early wins on areas of agreement with Trump that included replacing Obamacare and finding a way to repatriate corporate profits held overseas and using the money to pay for infrastructure repairs.  Richard Hunt, head of the Consumer Bankers Association, which lobbies for some of the biggest U.S. banks, said Republicans must act swiftly to show that as change agents they can actually govern. “They have to show the American people that Republicans are able and capable of governing. Obviously there was a clear mandate last night that says Washington is not working and people want Washington to work,” he said. “Part of me says you need to have a clean slate, okay, that was the campaign, now this is governing.” \"],[\"(Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson said he intends to continue campaigning through the Republican National Convention in July after a report on Thursday said he planned a major downsizing of his flagging campaign. The Washington Post reported that Carson planned to eliminate 50 staff positions, or nearly one-half his staff. Carson, in an appearance on the Fox News Channel, said the cuts have been months in the making after an examination found “inefficiencies” in his campaign.       “It’s the same kind of thing I would do as president,” the retired neurosurgeon said. “There is a lot of money being wasted, a lot of inefficiency in government and just because you have the funds to continue that inefficiency doesn’t mean that you should do it.” The bulk of the cuts will come from his field offices and headquarters in Virginia, the Washington Post said, citing an internal memo and campaign officials. Carson will also reduce salaries for campaign workers, it said. Carson finished fourth among Republican presidential hopefuls in the Iowa caucuses on Monday with less than 10 percent of the vote.  The newspaper said other cost-saving measures included possibly using commercial flights instead of private planes and limiting Carson’s travel team to a select few advisers. “We will be able to continue the campaign right until Cleveland,” Carson said, referring to the convention. “But obviously you always make appropriate adjustments to make sure you can accomplish your goal.” His most senior staffers will remain on the campaign team, according to the Post.

As a result of their dour outlook on the U.S. economy, many Americans now believe that their children will not live as prosperously as they themselves do, the 85-year-old Buffett said. “That view is dead wrong: The babies being born in America today are the luckiest crop in history,” Buffett said. Buffett did not single out any presidential candidates by name. The billionaire in December officially threw his backing behind Hillary Clinton, a Democrat. “During presidential elections where no incumbent is running, both sides who are running for president always say they are the ones to solve the nation’s problems and point out what those problems are,” said Bill Smead, who invests $2.1 billion at Smead Capital Management in Seattle. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, who won New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie’s endorsement on Friday, has offered  a bleak assessment of the U.S. economy, repeatedly saying it is in a “bubble” that he hopes will pop before he takes office. “I don’t want to inherit all this stuff,” he has said. In his letter, Buffett said “some commentators bemoan our current 2 percent per year growth” in real gross domestic product, “and, yes, we would all like to see a higher rate.” But he said America’s population is growing about 0.8 percent per year, and that 2 percent GDP growth equates to a 1.2 percent per capita growth rate. “That may not sound impressive,” Buffett said. “But in a single generation of, say, 25 years, that rate of growth leads to a gain of 34.4 percent in real GDP per capita.” Buffett, whose home in Omaha, Nebraska sits on less than an acre, said society has advanced significantly since he grew up during and after the Great Depression. “All families in my upper middle-class neighborhood regularly enjoy a living standard better than that achieved by John D. Rockefeller Sr. at the time of my birth,” he said. “His unparalleled fortune couldn’t buy what we now take for granted, whether the field is – to name just a few – transportation, entertainment, communication or medical services. Rockefeller certainly had power and fame; he could not, however, live as well as my neighbors now do.” All told, Buffett said it is not a good idea to listen to these presidential candidates’ negative outlooks.  “For 240 years it’s been a terrible mistake to bet against America, and now is no time to start,” he said. “America’s golden goose of commerce and innovation will continue to lay more and larger eggs. America’s social security promises will be honored and perhaps made more generous. And, yes, America’s kids will live far better than their parents did.”  (Reporting By Jennifer Ablan and Jonathan Stempel; Editing by Nick Zieminski) This article was funded in part by SAP.

The Shermans were found hanging by belts around their necks from a railing beside a pool in the basement of their Toronto mansion, a friend of the family told Reuters.  Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau attended the memorial service in Toronto, as did hundreds of Apotex Inc employees wearing blue, the official color of Barry Sherman s company.  The Sherman s son Jonathon began an emotional eulogy by saying the family was frustrated with the way Toronto police have handled the case, referencing Canadian media reports that said investigators were working on the theory that Barry Sherman, 75, had killed his 70-year-old wife and then himself.  We ve had to navigate through a terrifying maze of non-information and unfounded speculation,  Jonathon Sherman said.  I kept expecting my parents to walk through the front door and say,  Everything will be fine. We ve taken control of the situation.  Police have confirmed that the Shermans died of ligature strangulation and that there were no signs of forced entry to the couple s home.  Homicide detectives are leading the investigation, but the deaths have not been declared a homicide. Police have not detained any suspects and have not said if they are looking for any. Family, friends, colleagues and political leaders remembered Barry Sherman as a brilliant man. They described the graduate of the prestigious Massachusetts Institute of Technology as an accomplished executive who worked around the clock to build Apotex into one of the world s biggest generic drugmakers.  Several speakers mentioned his penchant for chiding people over grammatical mistakes.   He pretty well thought he was smarter than anyone else,  said Jack Kaye, an Apotex executive who worked alongside Sherman for decades.  And he wasn t wrong about that.  Honey Sherman was described as vivacious and dedicated, a philanthropist who worked hard to keep her extended family close.   She was my best friend and my other half,  said her sister Mary Schechtman.  We completed each other s sentences and never went anywhere without each other.  \"],[\"ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Ousted Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif appeared before an anti-corruption court on Tuesday, kicking off trial proceedings that he says are biased and which threaten to dent his party s chances at the next general election due in mid-2018. Sharif briefly appeared before a National Accountability Bureau (NAB) court in Islamabad on three corruption charges. He did not enter a plea. Local TV channels reported that Sharif is scheduled to be formally indicted on Oct. 2, about two months after his disqualification by the Supreme Court for not declaring a small source of income that he denied receiving.  A Supreme Court panel has also alleged Sharif family s wealth far exceeds their legal income.  He has appeared before the court and by appearing he has proved to be a lion,  said Marvi Memom, a lawmaker for Sharif s ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N)party. Sharif, who returned from London on Monday after about a month in Britain, told the court his wife was being treated for cancer in London and needs his care. He did not speak to the media after his court appearance but is due to hold a televised press conference at 3pm (6.00 a.m. ET). Sharif has portrayed the corruption claims against him as politically motivated, while his allies, including daughter and heir-apparent Maryam, have hinted Pakistan s powerful military had a hand in his toppling. The military denies any such action.  It s a good thing that finally NAB and such institutions are holding rich and powerful to the count,  said Shafqat Mahmood, a senior members of the opposition Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party. PTI, led by cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan who doggedly pushed the Supreme Court into launching a corruption probe into Sharif, has called for an early election but it is unlikely the government will agree to that. Sharif s returned to Pakistan quashed growing speculation that his long absence was the start of another period in exile for the veteran leader whose three stints as prime minister were all cut short, including one by a military coup in 1999.  What kind of justice is this, what kind of accountability is this?  Sharif told reporters outside his upscale London apartment in London before departing for Islamabad on Sunday. Two of Sharif s sons are also due to appear before a NAB court, as well as Finance Minister Ishaq Dar, a long-time ally who is married into the Sharif family. Analysts say Sharif s return to Pakistan was in large part due to fears of defections within the PML-N, a common occurrence in a nation where politicians switch allegiances ahead of polls depending on which way the political winds are blowing. Sharif kept control of PML-N after his ouster and installed loyalist Shahid Khaqan Abbasi as prime minister. The Supreme Court has told the NAB courts that the trials into the Sharifs must be over within six months, with opponents betting that a flow of negative news from the trials will hurt PML-N s popularity ahead at the next election. \"],[\"MANCHESTER, England (Reuters) - British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson quipped on Tuesday that Libya can become a new Dubai if it can clear the dead bodies away, the latest gaffe by Britain s top diplomat. Johnson, who has offended some allies with flippant remarks, told Conservative Party members that the Libyan city of Sirte could be turned into the next Dubai by British investors if they could clear the bodies.  They ve got a brilliant vision to turn Sirte, with the help of the municipality of Sirte, to turn it into the next Dubai,  Johnson said.  The only thing they ve got to do is clear the dead bodies away and then we will be there.  Some activists from Prime Minister Theresa May s party laughed at the joke before the chair of the event changed the subject, saying:  Next question.  Britain and France took a leading role in the attacks that helped rebels overthrow Muammar Gaddafi in 2011. The country has since descended into chaos, with thousands of casualties. The Islamic State militant group took over Sirte in early 2015, turning it into their most important base outside the Middle East and attracting large numbers of foreign fighters into the city. It was later cleared of the militants. In a series of late night posts on Twitter, Johnson said he was referring to the clearing of booby trapped bodies of Islamic State militant fighters.  Shame people with no knowledge or understanding of Libya want to play politics with the appallingly dangerous reality in Sirte,  Johnson said.  The reality there is that the clearing of corpses of Daesh fighters has been made much more difficult by IEDs and booby traps.  When asked about Johnson s comments, PM May s deputy, Damian Green, said all ministers need to be careful with their language when dealing with sensitive issues but refrained from criticizing the foreign minister. The opposition Labour Party s spokeswoman for foreign affairs, Emily Thornberry, said Johnson s joke was shameful and questioned whether May would take any action to reprimand him. May s appointment of Johnson, who in the run-up to Britain s referendum on EU membership compared the goals of the European Union to those of Adolf Hitler and Napoleon, caused consternation in some European capitals. Britain s ambassador to Myanmar was forced to interrupt Johnson earlier this year as he tried to recite a nostalgic colonial poem by Rudyard Kipling in public during a visit to the country s most famous Buddhist site. \"],[\"GENEVA (Reuters) - The U.N. refugee agency on Wednesday welcomed a decision by Libya to open a transit center for unaccompanied children and other vulnerable refugees from among hundreds of thousands of migrants, and called on EU countries and others to accept them. Reports this month of white Libyan slave traders selling black African migrants at markets in Libya - a grim echo of the trans-Saharan slave trade in centuries past - have drawn worldwide horror and condemnation. Hundreds of thousands of migrants have been crossing the Sahara and the Mediterranean to reach Europe through Libya in each of the past several years. Thousands die during crossing the desert and at sea. Many are now being held in camps in Libya in conditions rights groups describe as inhumane. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) has flown 13,000 migrants from Libya back to their countries of origin this year under a voluntary repatriation program. But thousands of others who face war or persecution at home cannot be sent back safely. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has been seeking to open a refugee transit center in Tripoli to resettle or evacuate as many as 5,000 of the most vulnerable out of Libya each year.  UNHCR...welcomes the decision by the Libyan authorities to set up a  transit and departure facility  in Tripoli for people in need of international protection,  the Geneva-based agency said in a statement on Wednesday. With support from the Italian government, the initiative will facilitate the transfer of thousands of vulnerable refugees to third countries, it said.  But we now need EU member states and others to step up with offers of resettlement places and other solutions, including family reunification slots,  said Roberto Mignone, UNHCR Representative to Libya. The goal is to speed up the process of securing places in third countries, particularly for unaccompanied and separated children and women at risk, it said. William Lacy Swing, head of the IOM, told the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday that it was working with partners  to try to empty the detention centers  in Libya of around 15,000 migrants. Nigeria s president said on Wednesday the government had started bringing stranded citizens home from Libya after the global outcry over reports that migrants there were being sold into slavery. \"],[\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House said on Wednesday it has issued updated guidance on President Donald Trump’s executive order on immigration clarifying that legal permanent residents, or green card holders, do not require a waiver to enter the United States. “They no longer need a waiver because if they are a legal permanent resident they won’t need it anymore,” White House spokesman Sean Spicer said at a news briefing. The restriction on green card holders was among the most confusing element in the executive order signed on Friday. Initially, administration officials said such permanent legal residents were barred from entry under the executive order, although they could apply for a waiver and be rescreened. After the ensuing outcry — including legal challenges — over legal residents being detained, the Homeland Security Department said on Sunday green card holders would be allowed on planes to the United States and would be assessed upon arrival. “We expect swift entry for these individuals,” DHS said. Spicer said the White House counsel issued an update on Wednesday to clarify that those legal permanent residents no longer need a waiver. “Initially, as the program was lifting off, the idea was that they would go through be granted a waiver, of which everyone was,” Spicer told the news briefing. “In the sake of efficiency, we have interpreted the guidance to all of these agencies ... that that does not apply, they no longer need a waiver.” \"],[\"NEW YORK\\u002fSAN JUAN (Reuters) - The U.S. House Natural Resources Committee early on Thursday released long-delayed revised legislation to address Puerto Rico’s fiscal crisis, which is threatening to become a full-blown humanitarian disaster. The bill, also known as the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA), has two major aims: setting out a framework for restructuring the island’s $70 billion in debt and putting the island’s financial operations under the control of a federal oversight board. Severe economic decline, an accumulation of operating deficits, lack of financial transparency and management inefficiencies, combined with excessive borrowing, “created a fiscal emergency in Puerto Rico,” the legislation states. Puerto Rico’s next debt payment of $1.9 billion, which its governor has said it cannot pay, is due on July 1. A vote in the House is expected the first week of June. * A Financial Oversight and Management Board, consisting of seven members appointed by the president of the United States from recommendations provided by the leaders of the U.S. House and Senate. One member is appointed at the sole discretion of the president. Appointments are due by Sept. 30, 2016. * The board has the authority to enforce balanced budgets and government reform if the Puerto Rican government fails to do so, including the sale of government assets, the consolidation of agencies and reduction of workforce.  * The board’s aims are to generate management plans that achieve fiscal responsibility, maintain access to capital markets and ensure funding for public services and pensions; and to help facilitate consensual debt restructuring talks between Puerto Rico and its bondholders. * The board will have subpoena power to seek testimony and information. Board members will not be paid a salary. * A fiscal plan should be no less than five years. It can be developed either by the governor, the Oversight Board or both in collaboration. * Neither the governor of Puerto Rico nor the island’s  legislature can exercise control over the board or pass laws that would inhibit its functioning. * The oversight board will dissolve once Puerto Rico has attained adequate and reasonable access to credit markets and achieves four consecutive fiscal years of budgetary compliance without spending more than it earned. * The bill adopts certain provisions of U.S. bankruptcy law, including giving Puerto Rico access to a court-sanctioned debt restructuring law, under which it could, in certain circumstances, impose debt cuts without creditors’ consent, so-called cram-downs.      * The bill also empowers the oversight board to hold consensual debt restructuring talks, in hopes of reaching  “collective action compromises” that do not require cram-down. For a restructuring to be approved under the bill’s collective action clause, two-thirds of the outstanding principal amount of the bonds in each pool of debt must vote in favor of it.      * PROMESA does not directly put Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory, under the bankruptcy laws enjoyed by U.S. states. This addresses concerns that actions taken in the commonwealth could bleed over and affect long-standing municipal bankruptcy laws.      * Any prior voluntary debt restructuring agreements will be left intact. This essentially leaves in place the current voluntary restructuring agreement between creditors and PREPA (Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority)     * Certifying a restructuring of debt requires approval by five out of seven members of the oversight board.     * The U.S. government will not pledge its full faith and credit for repaying Puerto Rico’s debt. This provision addresses concerns the bill would amount to a financial bailout by Washington. \"],[\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump’s surprise victory in the U.S. presidential election has set off a round of resume-polishing across Washington, as the nation’s federal civil servants prepare for a leader who has promised to freeze hiring and reverse many of the policies they have spent the past eight years putting in place.  While anti-Washington rhetoric is a staple of U.S. politics, more than two dozen federal workers interviewed by Reuters said Trump’s divisive presidential campaign pointed to bigger potential problems than those that would normally come with a routine switch from a Democratic to a Republican administration.     The New York businessman’s lack of political experience and contentious rhetoric have prompted some to assess whether they should leave government before he takes office on Jan. 20.     As the Republican presidential candidate, Trump encouraged his supporters to harass journalists and attack protesters. He vowed to sue news outlets and women who accused him of sexual assault and said he would jail his opponent, Democrat Hillary Clinton. Trump’s conduct has caused some undercover agents to worry that their identities could be made public if they step out of line, said Susan Hennessey, a former attorney at the National Security Agency who has been urging people in government to keep working in Trump’s administration to help resist potential abuses of power. “I can’t and don’t blame anyone who feels they can’t stay,” she said. Other federal workers worry their integrity could be compromised if they work on cases that affect Trump’s vast business interests. Trump’s taxes are being audited by the Internal Revenue Service and the National Labor Relations Board is involved in a labor dispute at his Las Vegas hotel. Changes to tax laws or pollution rules could potentially impact some of his property holdings. “Do I get out or is it all the more important that I stay in to push back on the problematic things?” said one federal worker, who, like others interviewed for this story, asked not to be identified for fear of retaliation at work. A transfer of power always convulses Washington to some degree, particularly when it comes to the departure and arrival of political appointees in more than 4,000 posts. Those top officials oversee 2.7 million civilian workers, from park rangers to tax lawyers, who are expected to enact the president’s agenda and enforce laws passed by Congress regardless of their personal political views. But several workers told Reuters they’d rather leave government service than carry out orders they don’t agree with, pointing specifically at Trump’s vow to undo President Barack Obama’s policies on trade, immigration, health care and environmental protection.  National security officials have printed out their resignation letters, ready to hand them in if Trump tries to revive policies such as waterboarding or mass surveillance of Americans they oppose on legal or moral grounds, according to  more than 20 military, intelligence and Foreign Service officers, who all spoke on condition of anonymity. Regulators at the Environmental Protection Agency privately say they are looking for new jobs ahead of expected cutbacks at their agency, whose climate-change rules were criticized by Trump on the campaign trail.  One manager is urging employees to stay on the job. “Sometimes democracy surprises you.  And while the election results will no doubt bring many changes over the coming months, our job remains the same,” Sarah Dunham, director of the Environmental Protection Agency’s Office of Atmospheric Programs, wrote to colleagues two days after the election. Misgivings apparently extend into the nation’s 1.5 million military service members as well. A survey released by the Military Times on Friday found that one in five service members said they will not re-enlist with Trump as Commander-in-chief. During his campaign, Trump promised to rescind two regulations for every new one his administration issues and freeze hiring at agencies that don’t cover public safety, public health or national defense. Republicans in Congress have pushed to erode job protections and scale back benefits. That would be a further blow for federal workers who have weathered furloughs, salary freezes and a three-week government shutdown in recent years. The civilian work force has shrunk by 4 percent since Obama’s first year in office, according to White House figures, and it could shrink further. More than one-third of federal workers will be eligible for retirement next year, according to a 2014 Government Accountability Office report. “This isn’t the worst thing that’s happened to us,” said a scientist who manages a fisheries laboratory in the Pacific Northwest of the expected changes. “It’s kind of continual.” There may be a silver lining for those who are trying to get a job working for Uncle Sam. Trump has promised to increase the number of border-security agents and immigration-enforcement officers as part of a crackdown on illegal immigration. And several managers said they were rushing to fill vacancies on their teams before Trump’s promised hiring ban takes effect.  “Everybody seems to be scrambling to fill the positions they have open now,” one said. \"],[\"VIENTIANE (Reuters) - Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte on Thursday defended his country’s human rights record at a regional summit in Laos, urging East Asian leaders and the United States to help Manila eradicate the scourge of illicit drugs. Duterte swept to power in May on promises to wipe out crime and corruption within six months, pledging to wage a war on drug dealers and crush widespread addiction in a country of 100 million. The toll in his government’s two-month war on drugs reached 2,400 last week, with police saying about 900 people died in police operations, and the rest were “deaths under investigation”, a term human rights activists call a euphemism for vigilante and extrajudicial killings. Setting aside a prepared speech, Duterte spoke for more than five minutes about human rights and his campaign against drugs during the East Asian Summit in the Laotian capital of Vientiane, according to one Indonesian diplomat at the meeting. “Let me tell you about human rights,” the diplomat quoted Duterte as saying while displaying a picture of Filipinos killed by American soldiers about a century ago. “This is my ancestors being killed, so why now we are talking about human rights? We have to talk of the full spectrum of human rights.” Duterte spoke after Obama had delivered a speech that referred to human rights.    Duterte’s drive has won popular support at home but the killings have drawn expressions of concern from the United States, a close Philippine ally, and the United Nations. In a tirade before the Laos summit, Duterte insulted U.S. President Barack Obama and the White House responded by cancelling a two-way meeting.

The Obama administration will agree to let Iran bypass questions about its past nuclear military work under any final deal signed in the coming weeks, according to reports.Western officials were quoted as telling the Associated Press on Friday that the United States has given up a major concession to Iran on the military front.While senior U.S. officials, including Secretary of State John Kerry, have long insisted that Iran will immediately have to submit to wide-ranging inspections and disclosures regarding its past nuclear work, the new reports indicate that this demand has been cast aside as world powers work to strike a final deal with the Islamic Republic by the end of June.According to the AP report:After a November 2013 interim accord, the Obama administration said a comprehensive solution  would include resolution of questions concerning the possible military dimension of Iran s nuclear program.  But those questions won t be answered by the June 30 deadline for a final deal, officials said, echoing an assessment by the U.N. nuclear agency s top official earlier this week. Nevertheless, the officials said an accord remains possible. One senior Western official on Thursday described diplomats as  more likely to get a deal than not  over the next three weeks.Via: WFB\"],[\"\\\"THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A PRO-GROWTH PRESIDENT TAKES THE REINS: Boeing announces $300M employee-related and charitable investment as a result of TaxReform legislation to support our heroes, our homes and our future:#Boeing announces $300M employee-related and charitable investment as a result of #TaxReform legislation to support our heroes, our homes and our future. pic.twitter.com\\u002fZNawbAW7AY  The Boeing Company (@Boeing) December 20, 2017At&T Announces:.@POTUS announces that \\\"\\\"AT&T plans to increase US capital spending $1B and provide $1\"],[\" \"],[\"Facts are funny things Ever wonder why the Left is so opposed to using them in an argument?CNN law enforcement analyst Art Rodericktold explained to CNN host Brian Stelter, armed protesters in Oregon who took over a federal building to protest a tyrannical federal government, were not being surrounded by federal agents because:  They re not destroying property, they re not looting. \"],[\"This teen has a pretty good impression of Donald Trump:Jack Aiello, the Chicago-area teen who impersonated the presidential candidates during his 8th Grade graduation speech, appeared on  The Tonight Show  starring Jimmy Fallon Wednesday night as a little Donald Trump.Fallon impersonated Trump and stated,  The only person good enough to be my vice president is me.

It s clearly a rhetorical question and one that every voter in America should be asking themselves before risking the security of our nation under the leadership of a self-serving sociopathic liar SOCIOPATHIC LIAR: Most people have lied in their life. Whether it was to protect feelings, avoid trouble, impress, or to simply get what they want, not many people can say they have never told a lie.However, there is one extreme type of liar that you should beware of; the sociopathic liar.On first impressions, you may find you actually like or are drawn to the sociopath. It s not surprising as more often than not they are indeed charming and likable. Watch out, these type of liars can cause untold damage and mayhem once they lead you into their web of lies and deceit.Sociopaths lie the most because they are incapable of feelings and do not want to understand the impact of their lies. They may even get a thrill out of lying at your expense. Once they tell an initial lie they go on to tell many more lies in an attempt to cover up the lies they started, or just for the  fun  of it.A sociopath rarely reveals his or her feelings or emotions. You won t often hear them laugh, cry, or get angry. These kinds of liars tend to live in their own little world and always find ways to justify their dishonest deeds. They do not respect others and place their own needs first and foremost.If someone questions the sociopath s lies they can be incredibly devious in the way they cover things up. This can include placing the blame at someone else s door or by inventing complex stories to cover up their untruths.Sociopaths can be so good at lying that they are able to pass lie detector tests. This means they often escape jail or don t even get prosecuted for the crimes they permit.

In her memoir The White House Doctor: My Patients Were Presidents, she takes two pages to explain how she told the First Lady:  I m worried about your leg. You ve been out on the campaign trail for some months now, sitting in cars for hours at a time. Within an hour Mariano was examining Clinton s right calf which was  swollen .Marian s initial examination caused her enough worry to insist Clinton go to Bethesda Naval Hospital for an ultrasound. Once they were there and the diagnosis confirmed Mrs Clinton  balked  at the idea of being kept into hospital so they agreed to treat her as an outpatient with blood thinning drugs.The book says:  Hillary was back on the campaign trail within days very few people knew of Hillary s blood clot at the time; she wrote about it after she left the White House.

Twenty people died and two remain missing from the early-morning deluge, the worst casualty toll from flooding since 1977 when more than 30 people died.

The appointment of the 36-year old Franco-Moroccan writer as emissary for Francophone affairs follows Macron s decision to name a TV presenter and well-known ecologist as environment minister and an Olympic fencer as sports minister, opening up government to civil society.  Slimani was propelled into the limelight when she won the prestigious Prix Goncourt last year for her novel  Chanson Douce , which translates as lullaby. This year, she published a book about sexuality in Morocco.   The Francophone affairs brief has in the past been a ministerial post or a junior minister position, and had often been occupied by career politicians.  Macron, whose upstart centrist party trounced France s traditional political forces in an election earlier this year, has named a series of newcomers to his government.  Nicolas Hulot was appointed energy and environment minister, while Laura Flessel-Colovic, an Olympic gold medalist, is minister for sports.  \"],[\"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Puerto Rico’s long-awaited audited 2014 fiscal statements are close to release and should be ready by the end of January or the beginning of February, an official said on Wednesday.

Dlamini-Zuma, the ex-wife of current ANC leader and South African President Jacob Zuma, does not hold a top position and could use a seat in parliament to raise her profile ahead of the party s December leadership conference.   She is going to be sworn in,  ANC Secretary General Gwede Mantashe was quoted as saying by the local EWN news network. The former health and foreign affairs minister s main opponent in the ANC leadership race is expected to be Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa, a trade unionist-turned-business tycoon whom many investors would prefer to see running a country with serious economic challenges. Dlamini-Zuma is pushing for a more radical redistribution of wealth from whites to blacks, a policy that appeals to many poor people who resent the stark racial inequality that persists 23 years after the end of apartheid. The next head of the ANC will be the party s presidential candidate in 2019 general elections. \"],[\"LONDON (Reuters) - Wolfgang Schaeuble, Germany s pro-austerity finance minister, is preparing to quit his job and become head of the lower house of parliament, the Bundestag, various sources said on Wednesday. As the following graphic shows, his time as finance chief starting in 2009 has been one of general improvement for Germany s economy, if not exactly smooth. After recovering from the 2007-2008 financial crisis, Germany has put in a series of solid growth years. Indeed, although the government s projection of 1.5 percent this year would be slower than 2016, it is widely expected to be upgraded soon. Germany s leading economic institutes are expecting 1.9 percent growth this year, the same as in 2016. With much of the focus of Schaeuble s term being on growth, inflation - very low but a German fixation nonetheless - and fiscal rectitude, one macro improvement has been fairly neglected. The unemployment rate since Schaeuble took office has plummeted. It was above 8 percent when he took the reins at the finance minister; the latest reading was 5.7 percent, by far the lowest since Germany s reunification and some time before that. GDP per capita is not such a bullish story. After taking off in the immediate post-crisis years, it has leveled off, suggesting Germans may be a bit worse off than they were. \"],[\"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid said on Thursday he believes President Barack Obama will nominate a replacement for the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia in a little over three weeks. “I think it will be a little over three weeks,” Reid said in an interview on MSNBC, adding that he spoke to Obama about the nomination on Thursday.  \"],[\"LONDON (Reuters) - London s Natural History Museum said on Saturday there had been a serious incident outside and it was working with police.

Investigators searched the offices of supervisory board chairman Hans Dieter Poetsch, finance chief Frank Witter, and human resources head Karlheinz Blessing, a Volkswagen spokesman said. Files and computers were seized. The raid was related to suspicions of overpayments for works council chief Bernd Osterloh, the spokesman said. Osterloh s office was also searched.  Neither the works council nor the prosecutor in Braunschweig were immediately available for comment.

It was revealed earlier that German prosecutors were investigating current and former executives at Volkswagen on suspicion that they paid works council chief Bernd Osterloh an excessive salary.  In Germany, wasting corporate funds is legally a breach of fiduciary duty. \"],[\"MOSCOW (Reuters) -  Muscle flexing  by U.S. armed forces in South Korea is fraught with grave consequences for the entire region, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on Wednesday.

This is a considerable reduction compared to many larger models which can output **768 or 1024 dimensions**, leading to **massive savings in storage** and faster **vector database operations** (indexing, search).\n","\n","- **High Performance-to-Size Ratio:** While smaller, it maintains a strong position on popular benchmarks like **MTEB** for various semantic tasks, establishing it as a top choice for a *\"good enough\" embedding model* that prioritizes **speed and size**.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"gNpVfmnLVizj"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["inspect_dataset(combined_df, \"label\")\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"P4459wF_WtwY","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1761631819429,"user_tz":-300,"elapsed":1438,"user":{"displayName":"Abdullah Mubeen","userId":"17886490017623663394"}},"outputId":"9fe8484d-49d3-43a9-ffd7-4fc2568fd72f"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["--- Dataset Inspection ---\n","Total Rows: 1000\n","Label Distribution:\n","  - FAKE: 500 rows (50.00%)\n","  - TRUE: 500 rows (50.00%)\n","\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["combined_df.cache()"],"metadata":{"id":"XkkquZ4_cFoY"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["DOWNLOAD_LINK = \"https://s3.amazonaws.com/auxdata.johnsnowlabs.com/public/models/minilm_l6_v2_en_5.5.1_3.0_1750674121132.zip\"\n","ZIP_PATH = \"minilm_l6_v2_openvino.zip\"\n","\n","!wget -q -O $ZIP_PATH $DOWNLOAD_LINK\n","!unzip -q $ZIP_PATH -d minilm_l6_v2_openvino\n"],"metadata":{"id":"X7XqD64lYUz_"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["documentAssembler = DocumentAssembler() \\\n","    .setInputCol(\"text\") \\\n","    .setOutputCol(\"document\")\n","\n","embeddings = MiniLMEmbeddings.load(\"minilm_l6_v2_openvino\") \\\n","    .setInputCols([\"document\"]) \\\n","    .setOutputCol(\"embeddings\")\n","\n","pipeline = Pipeline().setStages([\n","    documentAssembler,\n","    embeddings\n","]).fit(combined_df)\n"],"metadata":{"id":"-9Qyhb5ITCPM"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["%%time\n","\n","result = pipeline.transform(combined_df).count()\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"W9WxJBrsW0PY","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1761632207665,"user_tz":-300,"elapsed":349367,"user":{"displayName":"Abdullah Mubeen","userId":"17886490017623663394"}},"outputId":"b691a1ff-5214-412a-d190-50ee5a267970"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["CPU times: user 71.3 ms, sys: 17.5 ms, total: 88.8 ms\n","Wall time: 5min 49s\n"]}]}]}
