It is not bothering me and by my exam it is either the same or a little smaller.  Can I cancel the appt for 24/07 and just watch it myself?,cancel appointment
"After only one month of trying, my husband and I got pregnant in October. I had a miscarriage in at the end of October. We went through all of the blood work and the doctor told me I had a negative pregnancy test. We waited a month as my Dr. told me to do, and tried again in December. Now I feel like I have several of the same symptoms as before and got a very faint line on an early pregnancy test. I've taken two tests over a period of three days and the line is still light pink. I plan on making an appointment today to see my doctor, but I probably won't get in for at least another month. Not knowing what that means is driving me crazy. I know that the faint line is a detection of hcg, but could it just be faint traces for some other reason?",make appointment
