Hey Sam,

Congrats on the new model launch — it’s incredible to see how fast generative systems are evolving.
We’ve been prototyping a distributed GPU fabric specifically for large transformer workloads, and I think it could double your training throughput.
Let’s schedule a quick sync next week to discuss joint optimization work.

Best,
Jensen
CEO, NVIDIA
