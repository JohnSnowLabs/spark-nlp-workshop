        "**Named entities** are sub-strings in a text that can be classified into catogires. For example, in the String   \n",
        "`\"Tesla is a great stock to invest  in \"` , the sub-string `\"Tesla\"` is a named entity, it can be classified with the label `company` by an ML algorithm.  \n",
        "**Named entities** can easily be extracted by the various pre-trained Deep Learning based NER algorithms provided by NLU. \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "After extracting **named entities** an **entity resolution algorithm** can be applied to the extracted named entities. The resolution algorithm classifies each extracted entitiy into a class, which reduces dimensionality of the data and has many useful applications. \n",
        "For example : \n",
        "- \"**Tesla** is a great stock to invest in \"\n",
        "- \"**TSLA**  is a great stock to invest  in \"\n",
        "- \"**Tesla, Inc** is a great company to invest in\"    \n",
        "\n",
        "The sub-strings `Tesla` , `TSLA` and `Tesla, Inc` are all named entities, that are classified with the labeld `company` by the NER algorithm. It tells us, all these 3 sub-strings are of type `company`, but we cannot yet infer that these 3 strings are actually referring to literally the same company.    \n",
        "\n",
        "This exact problem is solved by the resolver algorithms, it would resolve all these 3 entities to a common name, like a company ID. This maps every reference of Tesla, regardless of how the string is represented, to the same ID.\n",
        "\n",
        "This example can analogusly be expanded to healthcare any any other text problems. In medical documents, the same disease can be referenced in many different ways. \n",
        "\n",
        "With NLU Healthcare you can leverage state of the art pre-trained NER models to extract **Medical Named Entities** (Diseases, Treatments, Posology, etc..) and **resolve these** to common **healthcare disease codes**.\n",
