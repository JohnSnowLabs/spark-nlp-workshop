The gene spansapproximately 7.6 kb and contains one noncoding and two coding exons separated byapproximately 2.2 and approximately 2.6 kb introns, respectively. We identified14 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), including one that predicts aVal366Ala substitution, and an 8 base-pair (bp) insertion/deletion. Ourexpression studies revealed the presence of the transcript in various humantissues including pancreas, and two major insulin-responsive tissues: fat andskeletal muscle.

The characterization of the KCNJ9 gene should facilitate furtherstudies on the function of the KCNJ9 protein and allow evaluation of thepotential role of the locus in Type II diabetes.', output_level='chunk')"],"execution_count":12,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["ner_cancer_genetics download started this may take some time.\n","Approximate size to download 13.9 MB\n","[OK!]\n","embeddings_clinical download started this may take some time.\n","Approximate size to download 1.6 GB\n","[OK!]\n"]},{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                                            document  \\\n","0  The human KCNJ9 (Kir 3.3, GIRK3) is a member o...   \n","0  The human KCNJ9 (Kir 3.3, GIRK3) is a member o...   \n","0  The human KCNJ9 (Kir 3.3, GIRK3) is a member o...   \n","0  The human KCNJ9 (Kir 3.3, GIRK3) is a member o...   \n","0  The human KCNJ9 (Kir 3.3, GIRK3) is a member o...   \n","0  The human KCNJ9 (Kir 3.3, GIRK3) is a member o...   \n","0  The human KCNJ9 (Kir 3.3, GIRK3) is a member o...   \n","0  The human KCNJ9 (Kir 3.3, GIRK3) is a member o...   \n","0  The human KCNJ9 (Kir 3.3, GIRK3) is a member o...   \n","0  The human KCNJ9 (Kir 3.3, GIRK3) is a member o...   \n","0  The human KCNJ9 (Kir 3.3, GIRK3) is a member o...   \n","0  The human KCNJ9 (Kir 3.3, GIRK3) is a member o...   \n","0  The human KCNJ9 (Kir 3.3, GIRK3) is a member o...   \n","\n","                                     entities_cancer entities_cancer_class  \\\n","0                                        human KCNJ9                   DNA   \n","0                                            Kir 3.3               protein   \n","0                                              GIRK3                   DNA   \n","0  G-protein-activated inwardly rectifying potass...               protein   \n","0                                        KCNJ9 locus                   DNA   \n","0                                 chromosome 1q21-23                   DNA   \n","0                                     candidate gene                   DNA   \n","0                                       coding exons                   DNA   \n","0                                     2.6 kb introns                   DNA   \n","0                           nucleotide polymorphisms                   DNA   \n","0                                             SNPs),                   DNA   \n","0                                         KCNJ9 gene                   DNA   \n","0                                      KCNJ9 protein               protein   \n","\n","  entities_cancer_confidence  \\\n","0                    0.53245   \n","0                     0.8061   \n","0                      0.901   \n","0                 0.56428885   \n","0                     0.9951   \n","0                     0.9154   \n","0                 0.89024997   \n","0                 0.76269996   \n","0                 0.84596664   \n","0                     0.9948   \n","0                    0.90755   \n","0                    0.99785   \n","0                      0.972   \n","\n","                                word_embedding_glove  \n","0  [[-0.0823686420917511, -0.3178570866584778, 0....  \n","0  [[-0.0823686420917511, -0.3178570866584778, 0....  \n","0  [[-0.0823686420917511, -0.3178570866584778, 0....  \n","0  [[-0.0823686420917511, -0.3178570866584778, 0....  \n","0  [[-0.0823686420917511, -0.3178570866584778, 0....  \n","0  [[-0.0823686420917511, -0.3178570866584778, 0....  \n","0  [[-0.0823686420917511, -0.3178570866584778, 0....  \n","0  [[-0.0823686420917511, -0.3178570866584778, 0....  \n","0  [[-0.0823686420917511, -0.3178570866584778, 0....  \n","0  [[-0.0823686420917511, -0.3178570866584778, 0....  \n","0  [[-0.0823686420917511, -0.3178570866584778, 0....  \n","0  [[-0.0823686420917511, -0.3178570866584778, 0....  \n","0  [[-0.0823686420917511, -0.3178570866584778, 0....

Genetic characterization of transactivation of the human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 promoter: Binding of Tax to Tax-responsive element 1 is mediated by the cyclic AMP-responsive members of the CREB/ATF family of transcription factors. To achieve a better understanding of the mechanism of transactivation by Tax of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 Tax-responsive element 1 (TRE-1), we developed a genetic approach with Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We constructed a yeast reporter strain containing the lacZ gene under the control of the CYC1 promoter associated with three copies of TRE-1. Expression of either the cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB) or CREB fused to the GAL4 activation domain (GAD) in this strain did not modify the expression of the reporter gene. Tax alone was also inactive.', output_level='chunk')"],"execution_count":13,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["ner_cellular download started this may take some time.\n","Approximate size to download 13.9 MB\n","[OK!]\n","embeddings_clinical download started this may take some time.\n","Approximate size to download 1.6 GB\n","[OK!]\n"]},{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                                            document  \\\n","0  Detection of various other intracellular signa...   \n","0  Detection of various other intracellular signa...   \n","0  Detection of various other intracellular signa...   \n","0  Detection of various other intracellular signa...   \n","0  Detection of various other intracellular signa...   \n","0  Detection of various other intracellular signa...   \n","0  Detection of various other intracellular signa...   \n","0  Detection of various other intracellular signa...   \n","0  Detection of various other intracellular signa...   \n","0  Detection of various other intracellular signa...   \n","0  Detection of various other intracellular signa...   \n","0  Detection of various other intracellular signa...   \n","0  Detection of various other intracellular signa...   \n","0  Detection of various other intracellular signa...   \n","0  Detection of various other intracellular signa...   \n","0  Detection of various other intracellular signa...   \n","0  Detection of various other intracellular signa...   \n","0  Detection of various other intracellular signa...   \n","0  Detection of various other intracellular signa...   \n","0  Detection of various other intracellular signa...   \n","0  Detection of various other intracellular signa...   \n","\n","                                   entities_cellular entities_cellular_class  \\\n","0                   intracellular signaling proteins                 protein   \n","0        human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 promoter                     DNA   \n","0                                                Tax                 protein   \n","0                           Tax-responsive element 1                     DNA   \n","0                      cyclic AMP-responsive members                     DNA   \n","0                                    CREB/ATF family                 protein   \n","0                              transcription factors                 protein   \n","0                                                Tax                 protein   \n","0  human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 Tax-respons...

Genetic characterization of transactivation of the human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 promoter: Binding of Tax to Tax-responsive element 1 is mediated by the cyclic AMP-responsive members of the CREB/ATF family of transcription factors. To achieve a better understanding of the mechanism of transactivation by Tax of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 Tax-responsive element 1 (TRE-1), we developed a genetic approach with Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We constructed a yeast reporter strain containing the lacZ gene under the control of the CYC1 promoter associated with three copies of TRE-1. Expression of either the cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB) or CREB fused to the GAL4 activation domain (GAD) in this strain did not modify the expression of the reporter gene.

Genetic characterization of transactivation of the human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 promoter: Binding of Tax to Tax-responsive element 1 is mediated by the cyclic AMP-responsive members of the CREB/ATF family of transcription factors. To achieve a better understanding of the mechanism of transactivation by Tax of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 Tax-responsive element 1 (TRE-1), we developed a genetic approach with Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We constructed a yeast reporter strain containing the lacZ gene under the control of the CYC1 promoter associated with three copies of TRE-1. Expression of either the cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB) or CREB fused to the GAL4 activation domain (GAD) in this strain did not modify the expression of the reporter gene.

Genetic characterization of transactivation of the human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 promoter: Binding of Tax to Tax-responsive element 1 is mediated by the cyclic AMP-responsive members of the CREB/ATF family of transcription factors. To achieve a better understanding of the mechanism of transactivation by Tax of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 Tax-responsive element 1 (TRE-1), we developed a genetic approach with Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We constructed a yeast reporter strain containing the lacZ gene under the control of the CYC1 promoter associated with three copies of TRE-1. Expression of either the cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB) or CREB fused to the GAL4 activation domain (GAD) in this strain did not modify the expression of the reporter gene. Tax alone was also inactive. \", output_level='chunk')"],"execution_count":20,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["ner_diseases download started this may take some time.\n","Approximate size to download 13.8 MB\n","[OK!]\n","embeddings_clinical download started this may take some time.\n","Approximate size to download 1.6 GB\n","[OK!]\n"]},{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                                            document entities_diseases  \\\n","0  Detection of various other intracellular signa...

Genetic characterization of transactivation of the human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 promoter: Binding of Tax to Tax-responsive element 1 is mediated by the cyclic AMP-responsive members of the CREB/ATF family of transcription factors. To achieve a better understanding of the mechanism of transactivation by Tax of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 Tax-responsive element 1 (TRE-1), we developed a genetic approach with Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We constructed a yeast reporter strain containing the lacZ gene under the control of the CYC1 promoter associated with three copies of TRE-1. Expression of either the cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB) or CREB fused to the GAL4 activation domain (GAD) in this strain did not modify the expression of the reporter gene.

Here we describe the genomicorganization of the KCNJ9 locus on chromosome 1q21-23 as a candidate gene forType II diabetes mellitus in the Pima Indian population. The gene spansapproximately 7.6 kb and contains one noncoding and two coding exons separated byapproximately 2.2 and approximately 2.6 kb introns, respectively. We identified14 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), including one that predicts aVal366Ala substitution, and an 8 base-pair (bp) insertion/deletion. Ourexpression studies revealed the presence of the transcript in various humantissues including pancreas, and two major insulin-responsive tissues: fat andskeletal muscle. The characterization of the KCNJ9 gene should facilitate furtherstudies on the function of the KCNJ9 protein and allow evaluation of thepotential role of the locus in Type II diabetes.BACKGROUND: At present, it is one of the most important issues for the treatment of breast cancer to develop the standard therapy for patients previously treated with anthracyclines and taxanes.

Here we describe the genomicorganization of the KCNJ9 locus on chromosome 1q21-23 as a candidate gene forType II diabetes mellitus in the Pima Indian population. The gene spansapproximately 7.6 kb and contains one noncoding and two coding exons separated byapproximately 2.2 and approximately 2.6 kb introns, respectively. We identified14 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), including one that predicts aVal366Ala substitution, and an 8 base-pair (bp) insertion/deletion. Ourexpression studies revealed the presence of the transcript in various humantissues including pancreas, and two major insulin-responsive tissues: fat andskeletal muscle. The characterization of the KCNJ9 gene should facilitate furtherstudies on the function of the KCNJ9 protein and allow evaluation of thepotential role of the locus in Type II diabetes.BACKGROUND: At present, it is one of the most important issues for the treatment of breast cancer to develop the standard therapy for patients previously treated with anthracyclines and taxanes.

She did receive a course of Bactrim for 14 days for UTI. Evidently, at some point in time, the patient was noted to develop a pressure-type wound on the sole of her left foot and left great toe.
