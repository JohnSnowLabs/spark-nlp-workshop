Genetic characterization of transactivation of the human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 promoter: Binding of Tax to Tax-responsive element 1 is mediated by the cyclic AMP-responsive members of the CREB/ATF family of transcription factors. To achieve a better understanding of the mechanism of transactivation by Tax of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 Tax-responsive element 1 (TRE-1), we developed a genetic approach with Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We constructed a yeast reporter strain containing the lacZ gene under the control of the CYC1 promoter associated with three copies of TRE-1. Expression of either the cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB) or CREB fused to the GAL4 activation domain (GAD) in this strain did not modify the expression of the reporter gene.

To achieve a better understanding of the mechanism of transactivation by Tax of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 Tax-responsive element 1 (TRE-1), we developed a genetic approach with Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We constructed a yeast reporter strain containing the lacZ gene under the control of the CYC1 promoter associated with three copies of TRE-1.

Genetic characterization of transactivation of the human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 promoter: Binding of Tax to Tax-responsive element 1 is mediated by the cyclic AMP-responsive members of the CREB/ATF family of transcription factors. To achieve a better understanding of the mechanism of transactivation by Tax of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 Tax-responsive element 1 (TRE-1), we developed a genetic approach with Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We constructed a yeast reporter strain containing the lacZ gene under the control of the CYC1 promoter associated with three copies of TRE-1. Expression of either the cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB) or CREB fused to the GAL4 activation domain (GAD) in this strain did not modify the expression of the reporter gene.

Ourexpression studies revealed the presence of the transcript in various humantissues including pancreas, and two major insulin-responsive tissues: fat andskeletal muscle. The characterization of the KCNJ9 gene should facilitate furtherstudies on the function of the KCNJ9 protein and allow evaluation of thepotential role of the locus in Type II diabetes.BACKGROUND: At present, it is one of the most important issues for the treatment of breast cancer to develop the standard therapy for patients previously treated with anthracyclines and taxanes. With the objective of determining the usefulnessof vinorelbine monotherapy in patients with advanced or recurrent breast cancerafter standard therapy, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of vinorelbine inpatients previously treated with anthracyclines and taxanes.. \", output_level='chunk')"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["ner_events_biobert download started this may take some time.\n","Approximate size to download 15.4 MB\n","[OK!]\n","biobert_pubmed_base_cased download started this may take some time.\n","Approximate size to download 386.4 MB\n","[OK!]\n","sentence_detector_dl download started this may take some time.\n","Approximate size to download 354.6 KB\n","[OK!]\n"],"name":"stdout"},{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>token</th>\n","      <th>origin_index</th>\n","      <th>sentence</th>\n","      <th>entities</th>\n","      <th>word_embedding_biobert</th>\n","      <th>entities_confidence</th>\n","      <th>document</th>\n","      <th>entities_class</th>\n","      <th>text</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>[The, human, KCNJ9, (, Kir, 3.3, ,, GIRK3, ), ...</td>\n","      <td>8589934592</td>\n","      <td>[The human KCNJ9 (Kir 3.3, GIRK3) is a member ...</td>\n","      <td>Kir</td>\n","      <td>[[-0.6279047727584839, -0.10282164067029953, -...</td>\n","      <td>0.4799</td>\n","      <td>The human KCNJ9 (Kir 3.3, GIRK3) is a member o...</td>\n","      <td>TEST</td>\n","      <td>The human KCNJ9 (Kir 3.3, GIRK3) is a member o...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>[The, human, KCNJ9, (, Kir, 3.3, ,, GIRK3, ), ...</td>\n","      <td>8589934592</td>\n","      <td>[The human KCNJ9 (Kir 3.3, GIRK3) is a member ...</td>\n","      <td>the G-protein-activated inwardly rectifying po...</td>\n","      <td>[[-0.6279047727584839, -0.10282164067029953, -...</td>\n","      <td>0.39257997</td>\n","      <td>The human KCNJ9 (Kir 3.3, GIRK3) is a member o...</td>\n","      <td>TREATMENT</td>\n","      <td>The human KCNJ9 (Kir 3.3, GIRK3) is a member o...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>[The, human, KCNJ9, (, Kir, 3.3, ,, GIRK3, ), ...</td>\n","      <td>8589934592</td>\n","      <td>[The human KCNJ9 (Kir 3.3, GIRK3) is a member ...</td>\n","      <td>diabetes mellitus</td>\n","      <td>[[-0.6279047727584839, -0.10282164067029953, -...</td>\n","      <td>0.5717</td>\n","      <td>The human KCNJ9 (Kir 3.3, GIRK3) is a member o...</td>\n","      <td>PROBLEM</td>\n","      <td>The human KCNJ9 (Kir 3.3, GIRK3) is a member o...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>"],"text/plain":["                                               token  ...                                               text\n","0  [The, human, KCNJ9, (, Kir, 3.3, ,, GIRK3, ), ...  ...

One day ago, mom also noticed a tactile temperature and gave the patient Tylenol. Baby also has had some decreased p.o. intake. His normal breast-feeding is down from 20 minutes q.2h. to 5 to 10 minutes secondary to his respiratory congestion. He sleeps well, but has been more tired and has been fussy over the past 2 days. The parents noticed no improvement with albuterol treatments given in the ER. His urine output has also decreased; normally he has 8 to 10 wet and 5 dirty diapers per 24 hours, now he has down to 4 wet diapers per 24 hours. Mom denies any diarrhea.
