Increased O 2 concentration in the lungs helps to displace carbon monoxide from the heme group of hemoglobin.\n"," Oxygen gas is poisonous to the anaerobic bacteria that cause gas gangrene, so increasing its partial pressure helps kill them. Decompression sickness occurs in divers who decompress too quickly after a dive, resulting in bubbles of inert gas, mostly nitrogen and helium, forming in their blood.

It has two major branches, differential calculus and integral calculus; the former concerns instantaneous rates of change, and the slopes of curves, while integral calculus concerns accumulation of quantities, and areas under or between curves. These two branches are related to each other by the fundamental theorem of calculus, and they make use of the fundamental notions of convergence of infinite sequences and infinite series to a well-defined limit.[1] Infinitesimal calculus was developed independently in the late 17th century by Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz.[2][3] Today, calculus has widespread uses in science, engineering, and economics.[4] In mathematics education, calculus denotes courses of elementary mathematical analysis, which are mainly devoted to the study of functions and limits. The word calculus (plural calculi) is a Latin word, meaning originally \"small pebble\" (this meaning is kept in medicine – see Calculus (medicine)). Because such pebbles were used for calculation, the meaning of the word has evolved and today usually means a method of computation. It is therefore used for naming specific methods of calculation and related theories, such as propositional calculus, Ricci calculus, calculus of variations, lambda calculus, and process calculus.'''\n","             ]\n","\n","\n","#Predict on text data with T5"],"execution_count":11,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":81},"id":"UH7PqsbPfLem","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1650025501121,"user_tz":-300,"elapsed":19563,"user":{"displayName":"ahmed lone","userId":"02458088882398909889"}},"outputId":"63bb4d8e-9624-458c-a43b-8ed3935672e4"},"source":["text = \"\"\"(Reuters) - Mastercard Inc said on Wednesday it was planning to offer support for some cryptocurrencies on its network this year, joining a string of big-ticket firms that have pledged similar support.\n","\n","The credit-card giant’s announcement comes days after Elon Musk’s Tesla Inc revealed it had purchased $1.5 billion of bitcoin and would soon accept it as a form of payment.\n","\n","Asset manager BlackRock Inc and payments companies Square and PayPal have also recently backed cryptocurrencies.\n","\n","Mastercard already offers customers cards that allow people to transact using their cryptocurrencies, although without going through its network.\n","\n","\"Doing this work will create a lot more possibilities for shoppers and merchants, allowing them to transact in an entirely new form of payment.
