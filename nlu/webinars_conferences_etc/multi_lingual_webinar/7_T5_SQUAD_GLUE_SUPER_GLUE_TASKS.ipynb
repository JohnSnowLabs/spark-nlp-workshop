It has two major branches, differential calculus and integral calculus; the former concerns instantaneous rates of change, and the slopes of curves, while integral calculus concerns accumulation of quantities, and areas under or between curves. These two branches are related to each other by the fundamental theorem of calculus, and they make use of the fundamental notions of convergence of infinite sequences and infinite series to a well-defined limit.[1] Infinitesimal calculus was developed independently in the late 17th century by Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz.[2][3] Today, calculus has widespread uses in science, engineering, and economics.[4] In mathematics education, calculus denotes courses of elementary mathematical analysis, which are mainly devoted to the study of functions and limits. The word calculus (plural calculi) is a Latin word, meaning originally \"small pebble\" (this meaning is kept in medicine – see Calculus (medicine)). Because such pebbles were used for calculation, the meaning of the word has evolved and today usually means a method of computation. It is therefore used for naming specific methods of calculation and related theories, such as propositional calculus, Ricci calculus, calculus of variations, lambda calculus, and process calculus.'''\n","             ]\n","\n","\n","#Predict on text data with T5\n","t5.predict(data)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>T5</th>\n","      <th>document</th>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>origin_index</th>\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th></th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>manchester united face newcastle in the premie...</td>\n","      <td>The belgian duo took to the dance floor on mon...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>calculus, originally called infinitesimal calc...</td>\n","      <td>Calculus, originally called infinitesimal calc...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>"],"text/plain":["                                                             T5                                           document\n","origin_index                                                                                                      \n","0             manchester united face newcastle in the premie...
