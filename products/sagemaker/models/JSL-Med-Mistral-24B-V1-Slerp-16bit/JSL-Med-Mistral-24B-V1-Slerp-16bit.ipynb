    "    \"\"\"INTRODUCTION: Infection with the new coronavirus responsible for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) continues to spread worldwide. In Brazil, there are already more than 230 thousand dead, many of these older adults. OBJECTIVE: To present the clinical characteristics of older Brazilian adults infected by COVID-19, in the epidemiological weeks (EW) 34-52, and to verify factors responsible for the increased risk of death. METHODS: Retrospective and observational study conducted with secondary publicly available data, provided by the Brazilian Ministry of Health. 1,544 confirmed cases of registered COVID-19 infection were included between August 16 and December 26, 2020, aged 60 or older. OUTCOMES: Demographic data, comorbidity, symptoms for disease, clinical information: days of hospitalization, chest X-ray, type of RT-PCR. RESULTS: 48% of patients admitted to the ICU with evidence for SARS-CoV-2 died. Symptoms and comorbidities related to increased chance of death (OR) were immunodeficiency (188%), kidney disease (166%), neurological disease (103%), dyspnea (86%), pneumopathy (55%), O2 saturation <95% (53%), respiratory discomfort (49%), age (36%), sore throat (31%), and sex (0.5%). There was a 5% increase in the chance of death for each year of life. CONCLUSION: Heart disease and Diabetes mellitus were the most frequent comorbidities, but did not indicate an increased risk of death from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Age, sex, sore throat, dyspnea, respiratory discomfort, O2 saturation <95%, neurological disease, pneumopathy, immunodeficiency, and kidney disease were significantly associated with risk of death from COVID-19.\"\"\",\n",
    "    \"\"\"OBJECTIVE: To compare maternal and perinatal outcomes between randomized trials and observational studies in which conservative management was performed for more than 48 h in patients with early-onset severe preeclampsia. METHODOLOGY: We searched PubMed, LILACS, Cochrane and Google Scholar. The studies were divided in two groups: randomized and observational studies, from 1990 to 2018 that included patients with severe preeclampsia before 34 weeks of gestation with pregnancy prolongation &#8805;48 h but that did not include fetal growth restriction or HELLP syndrome at the beginning. The main variables recorded were maternal and perinatal complications. MAIN RESULTS: Forty-four studies met the inclusion criteria, and 5 of these were randomized. The average pregnancy prolongation was 9 days, with no difference between groups. Maternal complications were significantly more common in observational studies, RR = 0.71, 95% CI (0.54-0.93), p = .009. Perinatal complications were also significantly more common in observational studies (RR = 0.89, 95% CI (0.80-0.98), p = .01) at the expense of stillbirth and neonatal deaths. The percentages of cesarean sections were significantly higher in randomized studies, RR = 1.54, 95% CI (1.46-1.64). There were 2 maternal deaths, both in observational studies. CONCLUSION: Observational studies in which conservative management of early-onset preeclampsia is performed and do not include patients with fetal growth restriction or patients with HELLP syndrome and where at least 2 days of pregnancy prolongation is achieved are associated with significantly more maternal and perinatal complications.\"\"\",\n",
    "    \"\"\"Background:In recent years, an integrated programme of vector control, screening and treatment of gambiense human African trypanosomiasis (gHAT) infections has led to a rapid decline in cases in the Mandoul disease focus of Chad. In this study, we assess whether elimination of transmission has already been achieved in the region despite low-level case reporting, quantify the role of intensified interventions in transmission reduction, and predict the trajectory of gHAT in Mandoul for the next decade under a range of control scenarios. Method: We utilise human case data (2000-2019) to update a previous model of transmission of gHAT in Mandoul. We also test the updated model, which now has refined assumptions on diagnostic specificity of the current algorithm and an improved fitting method, via a data censoring approach.Results:We conclude that passive detection rates have increased due to improvements in diagnostic availability in fixed health facilities since 2015, by 2.1-fold for stage 1 detection, and by 1.5-fold for stage 2. We find that whilst the diagnostic algorithm for active screening is estimated to be highly specific (99.93%, 95% CI: 99.91-99.95%), the high screening level and limited remaining infection means that some recently reported cases might be false positives, especially the ones that were not parasitologically confirmed. We also find that the focus-wide tsetse vector reduction estimated through model fitting (99.1%, 95% CI: 96.1-99.6%) is comparable to the very high reduction previously measured by the decline in catches of tsetse from monitoring traps. In line with previous results, the model suggests that transmission was likely interrupted in 2015 as a result of intensified interventions. Conclusions: We recommend that additional confirmatory testing is performed in Mandoul in order that the endgame can be carefully monitored now that infection levels are so low. More specific measurement of cases would better inform when it is safe to stop active screening and vector control.\"\"\",\n",
    "    \"\"\"Microanatomy of the vast majority of human organs at birth is characterized by marked differences as compared to adult organs, regarding their architecture and the cell types detectable at histology. In preterm neonates, these differences are even more evident, due to the lower level of organ maturation and to ongoing cell differentiation. One of the most remarkable finding in preterm tissues is the presence of huge amounts of stem/progenitor cells in multiple organs, including kidney, brain, heart, adrenals, and lungs. In other organs, such as liver, the completely different burden of cell types in preterm infants is mainly related to the different function of the liver during gestation, mainly focused on hematopoiesis, a function that is taken by bone marrow after birth. Our preliminary studies showed that the antigens expressed by stem/progenitors differ significantly from one organ to the next. Moreover, within each developing human tissue, reactivity for different stem cell markers also changes during gestation, according with the multiple differentiation steps encountered by each progenitor during development. A better knowledge of stem/progenitor cells of preterms will allow neonatologists to boost preterm organ maturation, favoring the differentiation of the multiple cells types that characterize each organ in at term neonates.\"\"\",\n",

Key findings include:\\n\\n- **Study Population**: 1,544 individuals aged 60 or older with confirmed COVID-19.\\n\\n- **Outcomes**:\\n  - 48% mortality rate in ICU-admitted patients.\\n  - Significant predictors of increased mortality risk:\\n    - Immunodeficiency (188%)\\n    - Kidney disease (166%)\\n    - Neurological disease (103%)\\n    - Dyspnea (86%)\\n    - Pneumopathy (55%)\\n    - Oxygen saturation <95% (53%)\\n    - Respiratory discomfort (49%)\\n    - Increasing age (5% per additional year)\\n    - Sore throat (31%)\\n    - Male gender (higher risk compared to female)\\n\\n- **Common Comorbidities**: Heart disease and diabetes mellitus were prevalent but did not correlate with higher mortality rates.\\n\\nIn summary, certain conditions like immunodeficiency, kidney disease, and neurological issues, along with symptoms such as dyspnea and low oxygen levels, significantly elevated the risk of death due to COVID-19 in this population.\n",
       "1  The study aimed to compare maternal and perinatal outcomes between randomized trials and observational studies involving conservative management of early-onset severe preeclampsia lasting over 48 hours, excluding cases with fetal growth restriction or HELLP syndrome.\\n\\n### Methodology:\\n- **Search Databases**: PubMed, LILACS, Cochrane, and Google Scholar.\\n- **Study Period**: From 1990 to 2018.\\n- **Inclusion Criteria**:\\n  - Patients with severe preeclampsia before 34 weeks of gestation.\\n  - Pregnancy prolonged ≥48 hours without initial fetal growth restriction or HELLP syndrome.\\n- **Variables Recorded**: Maternal and perinatal complications.\\n\\n### Main Results:\\n- **Total Studies Included**: 44 (5 randomized).\\n- **Average Prolongation**: 9 days, similar across groups.\\n- **Maternal Complications**: Significantly higher in observational studies (Relative Risk [RR] = 0.71, 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 0.54–0.93, p = 0.009).\\n- **Perinatal Complications**: Also higher in observational studies (RR = 0.89, 95% CI: 0.80–0.98, p = 0.01), primarily due to increased stillbirths and neonatal deaths.\\n- **Cesarean Sections**: Higher rates in randomized studies (RR = 1.54, 95% CI: 1.46–1.64).\\n\\n### Conclusion:\\nObservational studies on conservative management of early-onset preeclampsia, when extended beyond 48 hours and excluding specific conditions like fetal growth restriction or HELLP syndrome, showed significantly greater maternal and perinatal complications compared to randomized trials.\n",

Key findings include:\\n\\n1. **Improved Detection Rates**: Passive detection rates for both early-stage (stage 1) and late-stage (stage 2) gHAT have significantly increased since 2015 due to enhanced diagnostic capabilities.\\n\\n2. **Diagnostic Specificity**: The diagnostic algorithm used for active screening shows high specificity but may still produce occasional false positives given the low prevalence of the disease.\\n\\n3. **Vector Reduction**: Model estimates indicate a substantial reduction in the tsetse fly population, aligning with field observations showing decreased trap captures.\\n\\n4. **Transmission Interruption**: Intensified interventions appear to have successfully interrupted transmission around 2015.\\n\\n**Recommendations**:\\n- Additional confirmatory tests should be conducted to accurately monitor the endgame phase where infection levels are extremely low.\\n- Enhanced precision in measuring cases will help determine when active screening and vector control measures can safely cease.\\n\\nOverall, while significant strides have been made toward eliminating gHAT in Mandoul, continued vigilance and precise diagnostics remain crucial.\n",

Preterm neonates have less matured organs with higher numbers of stem/progenitor cells across various organs like kidneys, brain, heart, adrenal glands, and lungs. The liver's cell composition differs because it primarily functions in blood formation before birth, which shifts to the bone marrow post-birth.\\n\\nPreliminary research indicates varying antigen expression among stem/progenitor cells depending on the organ and gestational stage. Understanding these cells could help neonatal specialists enhance organ maturity in preterm babies by promoting the differentiation into specific cell types found in full-term neonates."

Key points include:\\n\\n**Background:**\\n- An integrated program involving vector control, screening, and treatment has significantly reduced gHAT cases in Mandoul over recent years.\\n\\n**Methodology:**\\n- The study updates a prior transmission model using human case data from 2000 to 2019.\\n- Improvements include enhanced diagnostic algorithms and more accurate fitting methods.\\n\\n**Findings:**\\n- Passive detection rates for both early-stage (stage 1) and late-stage (stage 2) gHAT have increased substantially post-2015.\\n- The diagnostic algorithm for active screening shows high specificity but may yield false positives given the low prevalence of true infections.\\n- Model estimates indicate a significant reduction (99.1%) in the tsetse vector population, aligning with observed declines in trap catches.\\n- Transmission interruption is believed to have occurred around 2015 due to intensified interventions.\\n\\n**Conclusions:**\\n- Additional confirmatory tests are recommended to accurately monitor progress toward elimination.\\n- Enhanced case measurement will help determine the appropriate timing to cease active screening and vector control measures.\\n\\nOverall, while significant progress has been made towards eliminating gHAT in Mandoul, ongoing vigilance and precise diagnostics remain crucial for achieving sustained success.\n",

Key points include:\\n\\n1. **Organ Maturation**: Preterm neonatal organs have less mature structures and ongoing cellular differentiation compared to full-term or adult organs.\\n\\n2. **Stem/Progenitor Cells**: Premature infant tissues contain significant numbers of stem/progenitor cells across various organs like kidneys, brains, hearts, adrenal glands, and lungs.\\n\\n3. **Liver Function**: The liver in preterm infants primarily functions in hematopoiesis (blood formation), which shifts to the bone marrow post-birth.\\n\\n4. **Marker Differences**: Stem/progenitor cells express different antigens depending on the specific organ and stage of gestation, reflecting varied differentiation processes.\\n\\n5. **Clinical Potential**: Understanding these differences could help neonatologists promote organ maturity in preterm infants by guiding the differentiation of necessary cell types.\\n\\nIn summary, studying the unique characteristics of stem/progenitor cells in preterm infants may offer insights into enhancing organ development in these vulnerable patients."
