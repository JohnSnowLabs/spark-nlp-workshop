    "The best treatment option for a pregnant woman presenting with symptoms suggestive of urinary tract infection (UTI) such as burning upon urination would be **Nitrofurantoin**.\n\nHereâ€™s why:\n\n- **Nitrofurantoin** is generally considered safe during pregnancy and is commonly used to treat UTIs in pregnant women.\n- **Cephalosporins like Ceftriaxone**, while effective against many bacteria causing UTIs, should typically not be given intravenously unless there's evidence of pyelonephritis or sepsis due to concerns about fetal exposure when given IV.\n- **Ciprofloxacin** belongs to the fluoroquinolone class, which is contraindicated in pregnancy because of potential adverse effects on cartilage development in the fetus.\n- **Doxycycline** is also contraindicated in pregnancy, particularly after the first trimester, due to its potential teratogenic effects.\n- **Ampicillin** can be used but may have higher resistance rates compared to nitrofurantoin and cephalosporins, making them less preferred options depending on local antibiotic susceptibility patterns.\n\nGiven these considerations, **nitrofurantoin** is the most appropriate choice for treating a suspected uncomplicated UTI in this setting.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is E: **Nitrofurantoin**."
