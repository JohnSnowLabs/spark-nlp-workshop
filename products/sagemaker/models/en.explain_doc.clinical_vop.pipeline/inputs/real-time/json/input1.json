{"text": "I had been feeling really tired all the time and was losing weight without even trying. My doctor checked my sugar levels and they came out to be high. So, I have type 2 diabetes. He put me on two medications - I take metformin 500 mg twice a day, and glipizide 5 mg before breakfast and dinner. I also have to watch what I eat and try to exercise more. Now, I also have chronic acid reflux disease or GERD. Now I take daily omeprazole 20 mg to control the heartburn symptoms."}
