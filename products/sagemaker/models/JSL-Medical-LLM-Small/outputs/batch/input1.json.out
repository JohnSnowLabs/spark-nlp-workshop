However, some people may experience:\n\n## Common Symptoms (when blood pressure is severely elevated)\n- Severe headaches\n- Nosebleeds\n- Shortness of breath\n- Chest pain\n- Visual changes\n- Fatigue\n- Dizziness\n- Confusion\n- Tinnitus (ringing in the ears)\n\n## Important Notes\n- Most people with high blood pressure don't experience any symptoms\n- These symptoms typically appear when blood pressure reaches dangerously high levels (stage 2 or 3 hypertension)\n- Regular blood pressure monitoring is essential, as you may not know you have high blood pressure without measurement\n- If you experience sudden, severe symptoms, seek medical attention immediately\n\n## Silent Nature of High Blood Pressure\nThis condition often progresses without noticeable symptoms, which is why regular blood pressure checks are recommended for adults, especially those with risk factors like family history, obesity, or kidney disease.",
