{"text": "Five-year-old boy presenting with perianal erythema accompanied by anal pain on defecation, afebrile. An anal and pharyngeal swab was taken and a rapid streptococcus test was performed, which was positive in the anal swab, with GABHS growing in the rectal culture. Treatment was started with oral penicillin. Twenty days later she returned because, despite initially improving, the erythema reappeared with less intensity, accompanied by constipation and fissures on examination. Topical mupirocin was prescribed with partial improvement of the symptoms after four days, and topical clotrimazole was added due to suspicion of fungal superinfection, with final resolution of the symptoms."}
