{"text": "42-year-old woman with end-stage chronic kidney disease, secondary to lupus nephropathy, and on peritoneal dialysis. History of four episodes of bacterial peritonitis and change of Tenckhoff catheter six months prior to admission due to catheter dysfunction. Three peritoneal fluid samples during her hospitalisation tested positive for Fusarium spp. The patient responded favourably and continued outpatient treatment with voriconazole (4mg/kg every 12 hours orally). All three isolates were identified as species of the Fusarium solani complex. In vitro susceptibility to itraconazole, voriconazole and posaconazole, according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute - CLSI (M38-A) methodology, showed a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) in all three isolates and for all three antifungals of >16 \u03bcg/mL."}
{"text": "A nine-month-old boy consulted for severe perianal erythema. A first rectal smear was performed with a negative result of the rapid streptococcal antigen detection test after 24 hours, so treatment was started with clotrimazole. As the patient did not progress well, it was decided to repeat the rectal and pharyngotonsillar smear, finding a positive result for rapid detection of streptococcal antigen in the rectal sample and negative in the pharyngotonsillar sample. Culture of the rectal specimen was negative for fungi and showed growth of GABHS. Treatment with oral penicillin was started for 10 days, with resolution of the picture."}
