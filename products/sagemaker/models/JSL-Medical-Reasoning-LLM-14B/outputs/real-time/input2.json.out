            "text": " <think>\nXeroderma pigmentosum is a rare genetic disorder characterized by an inability to repair damage to DNA caused by ultraviolet (UV) light. This condition results in an increased sensitivity to sunlight and a high risk of skin cancer.\n\nTo understand the underlying cause, let's review the DNA repair mechanisms involved in protecting cells from UV-induced damage. The primary defense against UV radiation involves the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway, which is essential for removing damaged DNA bases caused by exposure to UV light.\n\nIn the NER pathway, there are several key enzymes and proteins that work together to recognize and repair DNA damage. One critical component of this pathway is the endonuclease that makes a cut in the DNA strand near the damaged site, allowing for the removal and subsequent replacement of the damaged nucleotides.\n\nAmong the options provided:\n\nA. An enzyme essential to repair mismatched bases: This likely refers to the mismatch repair (MMR) pathway, which is responsible for correcting errors that occur during DNA replication. While important, MMR is not directly involved in repairing UV-induced damage.\n\nB. UV specific endonuclease: This is a key enzyme in the NER pathway that recognizes and cuts the DNA strand at sites of UV-induced damage, facilitating the removal and repair of the damaged nucleotides. In patients with xeroderma pigmentosum, there is a deficiency in the ability to repair DNA damage, specifically a lack of the UV-specific endonuclease activity.\n\nC. DNA polymerase I: This enzyme is involved in DNA repair but primarily in filling in gaps left by the removal of nucleotides during the repair process. It is not the primary enzyme responsible for recognizing and cutting UV-damaged DNA.\n\nD. DNA polymerase III: This enzyme is involved in the synthesis of DNA during replication, not in the repair of UV-induced damage.\n\nE. Glycosylase that removes uracil bases from DNA: This enzyme is part of the base excision repair (BER) pathway and is responsible for removing incorrect or damaged bases, such as uracil, but it is not specifically involved in repairing UV-induced damage.\n\nTherefore, the deficiency in xeroderma pigmentosum that leads to an increased risk of skin cancer upon exposure to sunlight is a deficiency in the UV-specific endonuclease, which is essential for initiating the repair of UV-induced DNA damage.\n</think>\n\n**Final Answer**: [B. UV specific endonuclease.]",
