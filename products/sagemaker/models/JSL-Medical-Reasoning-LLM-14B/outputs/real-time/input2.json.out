            "text": " <think> The recommended screening tests for adults over 50 with a family history of colorectal cancer include: 1. **Colonoscopy**: This is the most thorough test, allowing direct visualization of the colon and rectum for any abnormal growths or polyps. It's typically performed every 5 years if the first test is normal, but may need to be done more frequently based on family history. 2. **Fecal Occult Blood Test (FOBT)** or **Fecal Immunochemical Test (FIT)**: These tests check for hidden blood in the stool, which can be an early sign of cancer. They are often used in combination with a colonoscopy or as a follow-up test. 3. **Computed Tomography Colonography (CTC)** or **Virtual Colonoscopy**: This involves taking detailed X-ray images of the colon and rectum. It's another option for detecting polyps or cancer, especially if a traditional colonoscopy is not possible. 4. **Flexible Sigmoidoscopy**: This test examines the lower part of the colon and rectum. It's usually recommended every 5 years in conjunction with an annual FOBT/FIT. 5. **Double-Contrast Barium Enema**: This involves taking X-rays of the colon after it's been filled with a barium solution, but it's less commonly used now. Given the increased risk due to family history, it's important to start screening earlier and possibly follow a more intensive surveillance schedule recommended by a healthcare provider. </think> **Final Answer**: Colonoscopy, fecal occult blood test (FOBT), flexible sigmoidoscopy, fecal immunochemical test (FIT), and computed tomography colonography (CTC).",
