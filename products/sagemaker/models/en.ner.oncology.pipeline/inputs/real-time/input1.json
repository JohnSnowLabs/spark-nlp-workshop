{"text": "In the bone- marrow (BM) aspiration, blasts accounted for 88.1% of ANCs, which were positive for CD9, CD10, CD13, CD19, CD20, CD34, CD38, CD58, CD66c, CD123, HLA-DR, cCD79a, and TdT on flow cytometry.\n\nMeasurements of serum tumor markers showed elevated level of cytokeratin 19 fragment (Cyfra21-1: 4.77 ng/mL), neuron-specific enolase (NSE: 19.60 ng/mL), and squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCCA: 2.58 ng/mL). The results were negative for serum carbohydrate antigen 125 (CA125), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Immunohistochemical staining showed positive staining for CK5/6, P40 and PD-L1 (+ 80% tumor cells), and negative staining for TTF-1, PD-1 and weakly positive staining for ALK. Molecular analysis indicated no EGFR mutation or ROS1 fusion."}
