Recently, she noted a palpable right breast mass, 15 cm in size which nearly occupied the whole right breast in 2 months. Core needle biopsy revealed metaplastic carcinoma. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy with the regimens of Taxotere (75 mg/m2), Epirubicin (75 mg/m2), and Cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2) was given for 6 cycles with poor response, followed by a modified radical mastectomy (MRM) with dissection of axillary lymph nodes and skin grafting. Postoperatively, radiotherapy was done with 5000 cGy in 25 fractions. The histopathologic examination revealed a metaplastic carcinoma with squamous differentiation associated with adenomyoepithelioma. Immunohistochemistry study showed that the tumor cells are positive for epithelial markers-cytokeratin (AE1/AE3) stain, and myoepithelial markers, including cytokeratin 5/6 (CK 5/6), p63, and S100 stains. Expressions of hormone receptors, including ER, PR, and Her-2/Neu, were all negative. The dissected axillary lymph nodes showed metastastic carcinoma with negative hormone receptors in 3 nodes.
