Patient's medical compliance was poor and failed to complete her chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2, carboplatin 300 mg/m2). Recently, she noted a palpable right breast mass, 15 cm in size which nearly occupied the whole right breast in 2 months. Core needle biopsy revealed metaplastic carcinoma. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy with the regimens of Taxotere (75 mg/m2), Epirubicin (75 mg/m2), and Cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2) was given for 6 cycles with poor response, followed by a modified radical mastectomy (MRM) with dissection of axillary lymph nodes and skin grafting. Postoperatively, radiotherapy was done with 5000 cGy in 25 fractions. The histopathologic examination revealed a metaplastic carcinoma with squamous differentiation associated with adenomyoepithelioma. Immunohistochemistry study showed that the tumor cells are positive for epithelial markers-cytokeratin (AE1/AE3) stain, and myoepithelial markers, including cytokeratin 5/6 (CK 5/6), p63, and S100 stains. Expressions of hormone receptors, including ER, PR, and Her-2/Neu, were all negative. The dissected axillary lymph nodes showed metastastic carcinoma with negative hormone receptors in 3 nodes.

Patient's medical compliance was poor and failed to complete her chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2, carboplatin 300 mg/m2). Recently, she noted a palpable right breast mass, 15 cm in size which nearly occupied the whole right breast in 2 months. Core needle biopsy revealed metaplastic carcinoma. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy with the regimens of Taxotere (75 mg/m2), Epirubicin (75 mg/m2), and Cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2) was given for 6 cycles with poor response, followed by a modified radical mastectomy (MRM) with dissection of axillary lymph nodes and skin grafting. Postoperatively, radiotherapy was done with 5000 cGy in 25 fractions. The histopathologic examination revealed a metaplastic carcinoma with squamous differentiation associated with adenomyoepithelioma. Immunohistochemistry study showed that the tumor cells are positive for epithelial markers-cytokeratin (AE1/AE3) stain, and myoepithelial markers, including cytokeratin 5/6 (CK 5/6), p63, and S100 stains. Expressions of hormone receptors, including ER, PR, and Her-2/Neu, were all negative. The dissected axillary lymph nodes showed metastastic carcinoma with negative hormone receptors in 3 nodes. The patient was staged as pT3N1aM0, with histologic tumor grade III.</td>\n",

Patient's medical compliance was poor and failed to complete her chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2, carboplatin 300 mg/m2). Recently, she noted a palpable right breast mass, 15 cm in size which nearly occupied the whole right breast in 2 months. Core needle biopsy revealed metaplastic carcinoma. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy with the regimens of Taxotere (75 mg/m2), Epirubicin (75 mg/m2), and Cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2) was given for 6 cycles with poor response, followed by a modified radical mastectomy (MRM) with dissection of axillary lymph nodes and skin grafting. Postoperatively, radiotherapy was done with 5000 cGy in 25 fractions. The histopathologic examination revealed a metaplastic carcinoma with squamous differentiation associated with adenomyoepithelioma. Immunohistochemistry study showed that the tumor cells are positive for epithelial markers-cytokeratin (AE1/AE3) stain, and myoepithelial markers, including cytokeratin 5/6 (CK 5/6), p63, and S100 stains. Expressions of hormone receptors, including ER, PR, and Her-2/Neu, were all negative. The dissected axillary lymph nodes showed metastastic carcinoma with negative hormone receptors in 3 nodes.

Postoperatively, radiotherapy was done with 5000 cGy in 25 fractions. The histopathologic examination revealed a metaplastic carcinoma with squamous differentiation associated with adenomyoepithelioma. Immunohistochemistry study showed that the tumor cells are positive for epithelial markers-cytokeratin (AE1/AE3) stain, and myoepithelial markers, including cytokeratin 5/6 (CK 5/6), p63, and S100 stains. Expressions of hormone receptors, including ER, PR, and Her-2/Neu, were all negative. The dissected axillary lymph nodes showed metastastic carcinoma with negative hormone receptors in 3 nodes.

Postoperatively, radiotherapy was done with 5000 cGy in 25 fractions. The histopathologic examination revealed a metaplastic carcinoma with squamous differentiation associated with adenomyoepithelioma.

Patient's medical compliance was poor and failed to complete her chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2, carboplatin 300 mg/m2). Recently, she noted a palpable right breast mass, 15 cm in size which nearly occupied the whole right breast in 2 months. Core needle biopsy revealed metaplastic carcinoma. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy with the regimens of Taxotere (75 mg/m2), Epirubicin (75 mg/m2), and Cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2) was given for 6 cycles with poor response, followed by a modified radical mastectomy (MRM) with dissection of axillary lymph nodes and skin grafting. Postoperatively, radiotherapy was done with 5000 cGy in 25 fractions. The histopathologic examination revealed a metaplastic carcinoma with squamous differentiation associated with adenomyoepithelioma. Immunohistochemistry study showed that the tumor cells are positive for epithelial markers-cytokeratin (AE1/AE3) stain, and myoepithelial markers, including cytokeratin 5/6 (CK 5/6), p63, and S100 stains. Expressions of hormone receptors, including ER, PR, and Her-2/Neu, were all negative. The dissected axillary lymph nodes showed metastastic carcinoma with negative hormone receptors in 3 nodes.

Patient's medical compliance was poor and failed to complete her chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2, carboplatin 300 mg/m2). Recently, she noted a palpable right breast mass, 15 cm in size which nearly occupied the whole right breast in 2 months. Core needle biopsy revealed metaplastic carcinoma. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy with the regimens of Taxotere (75 mg/m2), Epirubicin (75 mg/m2), and Cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2) was given for 6 cycles with poor response, followed by a modified radical mastectomy (MRM) with dissection of axillary lymph nodes and skin grafting. Postoperatively, radiotherapy was done with 5000 cGy in 25 fractions. The histopathologic examination revealed a metaplastic carcinoma with squamous differentiation associated with adenomyoepithelioma. Immunohistochemistry study showed that the tumor cells are positive for epithelial markers-cytokeratin (AE1/AE3) stain, and myoepithelial markers, including cytokeratin 5/6 (CK 5/6), p63, and S100 stains. Expressions of hormone receptors, including ER, PR, and Her-2/Neu, were all negative. The dissected axillary lymph nodes showed metastastic carcinoma with negative hormone receptors in 3 nodes. The patient was staged as pT3N1aM0, with histologic tumor grade III.</td>\n",

       "0  A 65-year-old woman had a history of debulking surgery, bilateral oophorectomy with omentectomy, total anterior hysterectomy with radical pelvic lymph nodes dissection due to ovarian carcinoma (mucinous-type carcinoma, stage Ic) 1 year ago. Patient's medical compliance was poor and failed to complete her chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2, carboplatin 300 mg/m2). Recently, she noted a palpable right breast mass, 15 cm in size which nearly occupied the whole right breast in 2 months. Core needle biopsy revealed metaplastic carcinoma. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy with the regimens of Taxotere (75 mg/m2), Epirubicin (75 mg/m2), and Cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2) was given for 6 cycles with poor response, followed by a modified radical mastectomy (MRM) with dissection of axillary lymph nodes and skin grafting. Postoperatively, radiotherapy was done with 5000 cGy in 25 fractions. The histopathologic examination revealed a metaplastic carcinoma with squamous differentiation associated with adenomyoepithelioma. Immunohistochemistry study showed that the tumor cells are positive for epithelial markers-cytokeratin (AE1/AE3) stain, and myoepithelial markers, including cytokeratin 5/6 (CK 5/6), p63, and S100 stains. Expressions of hormone receptors, including ER, PR, and Her-2/Neu, were all negative. The dissected axillary lymph nodes showed metastastic carcinoma with negative hormone receptors in 3 nodes. The patient was staged as pT3N1aM0, with histologic tumor grade III.   \n",

A Pap smear performed one month later was positive for atypical glandular cells suspicious for adenocarcinoma. The pathologic specimen showed extension of the tumor throughout the fallopian tubes, appendix, omentum, and 5 out of 5 enlarged lymph nodes. The final pathologic diagnosis of the tumor was stage IIIC papillary serous ovarian adenocarcinoma. Two months later, the patient was diagnosed with lung metastases.   \n",

Patient's medical compliance was poor and failed to complete her chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2, carboplatin 300 mg/m2). Recently, she noted a palpable right breast mass, 15 cm in size which nearly occupied the whole right breast in 2 months. Core needle biopsy revealed metaplastic carcinoma. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy with the regimens of Taxotere (75 mg/m2), Epirubicin (75 mg/m2), and Cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2) was given for 6 cycles with poor response, followed by a modified radical mastectomy (MRM) with dissection of axillary lymph nodes and skin grafting. Postoperatively, radiotherapy was done with 5000 cGy in 25 fractions. The histopathologic examination revealed a metaplastic carcinoma with squamous differentiation associated with adenomyoepithelioma. Immunohistochemistry study showed that the tumor cells are positive for epithelial markers-cytokeratin (AE1/AE3) stain, and myoepithelial markers, including cytokeratin 5/6 (CK 5/6), p63, and S100 stains. Expressions of hormone receptors, including ER, PR, and Her-2/Neu, were all negative. The dissected axillary lymph nodes showed metastastic carcinoma with negative hormone receptors in 3 nodes.

Postoperatively, radiotherapy was done with 5000 cGy in 25 fractions. The histopathologic examination revealed a metaplastic carcinoma with squamous differentiation associated with adenomyoepithelioma. Immunohistochemistry study showed that the tumor cells are positive for epithelial markers-cytokeratin (AE1/AE3) stain, and myoepithelial markers, including cytokeratin 5/6 (CK 5/6), p63, and S100 stains. Expressions of hormone receptors, including ER, PR, and Her-2/Neu, were all negative. The dissected axillary lymph nodes showed metastastic carcinoma with negative hormone receptors in 3 nodes.

Patient's medical compliance was poor and failed to complete her chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2, carboplatin 300 mg/m2). Recently, she noted a palpable right breast mass, 15 cm in size which nearly occupied the whole right breast in 2 months. Core needle biopsy revealed metaplastic carcinoma. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy with the regimens of Taxotere (75 mg/m2), Epirubicin (75 mg/m2), and Cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2) was given for 6 cycles with poor response, followed by a modified radical mastectomy (MRM) with dissection of axillary lymph nodes and skin grafting. Postoperatively, radiotherapy was done with 5000 cGy in 25 fractions. The histopathologic examination revealed a metaplastic carcinoma with squamous differentiation associated with adenomyoepithelioma. Immunohistochemistry study showed that the tumor cells are positive for epithelial markers-cytokeratin (AE1/AE3) stain, and myoepithelial markers, including cytokeratin 5/6 (CK 5/6), p63, and S100 stains. Expressions of hormone receptors, including ER, PR, and Her-2/Neu, were all negative. The dissected axillary lymph nodes showed metastastic carcinoma with negative hormone receptors in 3 nodes.

       "      <td>A 65-year-old woman had a history of debulking surgery, bilateral oophorectomy with omentectomy, total anterior hysterectomy with radical pelvic lymph nodes dissection due to ovarian carcinoma (mucinous-type carcinoma, stage Ic) 1 year ago. Patient's medical compliance was poor and failed to complete her chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2, carboplatin 300 mg/m2). Recently, she noted a palpable right breast mass, 15 cm in size which nearly occupied the whole right breast in 2 months. Core needle biopsy revealed metaplastic carcinoma. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy with the regimens of Taxotere (75 mg/m2), Epirubicin (75 mg/m2), and Cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2) was given for 6 cycles with poor response, followed by a modified radical mastectomy (MRM) with dissection of axillary lymph nodes and skin grafting. Postoperatively, radiotherapy was done with 5000 cGy in 25 fractions. The histopathologic examination revealed a metaplastic carcinoma with squamous differentiation associated with adenomyoepithelioma. Immunohistochemistry study showed that the tumor cells are positive for epithelial markers-cytokeratin (AE1/AE3) stain, and myoepithelial markers, including cytokeratin 5/6 (CK 5/6), p63, and S100 stains. Expressions of hormone receptors, including ER, PR, and Her-2/Neu, were all negative. The dissected axillary lymph nodes showed metastastic carcinoma with negative hormone receptors in 3 nodes. The patient was staged as pT3N1aM0, with histologic tumor grade III.</td>\n",

Recently, she noted a palpable right breast mass, 15 cm in size which nearly occupied the whole right breast in 2 months. Core needle biopsy revealed metaplastic carcinoma. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy with the regimens of Taxotere (75 mg/m2), Epirubicin (75 mg/m2), and Cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2) was given for 6 cycles with poor response, followed by a modified radical mastectomy (MRM) with dissection of axillary lymph nodes and skin grafting. Postoperatively, radiotherapy was done with 5000 cGy in 25 fractions. The histopathologic examination revealed a metaplastic carcinoma with squamous differentiation associated with adenomyoepithelioma. Immunohistochemistry study showed that the tumor cells are positive for epithelial markers-cytokeratin (AE1/AE3) stain, and myoepithelial markers, including cytokeratin 5/6 (CK 5/6), p63, and S100 stains. Expressions of hormone receptors, including ER, PR, and Her-2/Neu, were all negative. The dissected axillary lymph nodes showed metastastic carcinoma with negative hormone receptors in 3 nodes.

Patient's medical compliance was poor and failed to complete her chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2, carboplatin 300 mg/m2). Recently, she noted a palpable right breast mass, 15 cm in size which nearly occupied the whole right breast in 2 months. Core needle biopsy revealed metaplastic carcinoma. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy with the regimens of Taxotere (75 mg/m2), Epirubicin (75 mg/m2), and Cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2) was given for 6 cycles with poor response, followed by a modified radical mastectomy (MRM) with dissection of axillary lymph nodes and skin grafting. Postoperatively, radiotherapy was done with 5000 cGy in 25 fractions. The histopathologic examination revealed a metaplastic carcinoma with squamous differentiation associated with adenomyoepithelioma. Immunohistochemistry study showed that the tumor cells are positive for epithelial markers-cytokeratin (AE1/AE3) stain, and myoepithelial markers, including cytokeratin 5/6 (CK 5/6), p63, and S100 stains. Expressions of hormone receptors, including ER, PR, and Her-2/Neu, were all negative. The dissected axillary lymph nodes showed metastastic carcinoma with negative hormone receptors in 3 nodes. The patient was staged as pT3N1aM0, with histologic tumor grade III.</td>\n",

       "0  A 65-year-old woman had a history of debulking surgery, bilateral oophorectomy with omentectomy, total anterior hysterectomy with radical pelvic lymph nodes dissection due to ovarian carcinoma (mucinous-type carcinoma, stage Ic) 1 year ago. Patient's medical compliance was poor and failed to complete her chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2, carboplatin 300 mg/m2). Recently, she noted a palpable right breast mass, 15 cm in size which nearly occupied the whole right breast in 2 months. Core needle biopsy revealed metaplastic carcinoma. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy with the regimens of Taxotere (75 mg/m2), Epirubicin (75 mg/m2), and Cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2) was given for 6 cycles with poor response, followed by a modified radical mastectomy (MRM) with dissection of axillary lymph nodes and skin grafting. Postoperatively, radiotherapy was done with 5000 cGy in 25 fractions. The histopathologic examination revealed a metaplastic carcinoma with squamous differentiation associated with adenomyoepithelioma. Immunohistochemistry study showed that the tumor cells are positive for epithelial markers-cytokeratin (AE1/AE3) stain, and myoepithelial markers, including cytokeratin 5/6 (CK 5/6), p63, and S100 stains. Expressions of hormone receptors, including ER, PR, and Her-2/Neu, were all negative. The dissected axillary lymph nodes showed metastastic carcinoma with negative hormone receptors in 3 nodes. The patient was staged as pT3N1aM0, with histologic tumor grade III.   \n",

A Pap smear performed one month later was positive for atypical glandular cells suspicious for adenocarcinoma. The pathologic specimen showed extension of the tumor throughout the fallopian tubes, appendix, omentum, and 5 out of 5 enlarged lymph nodes. The final pathologic diagnosis of the tumor was stage IIIC papillary serous ovarian adenocarcinoma. Two months later, the patient was diagnosed with lung metastases.   \n",
