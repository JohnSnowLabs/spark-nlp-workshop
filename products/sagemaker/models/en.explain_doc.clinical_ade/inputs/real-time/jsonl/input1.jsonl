{"text": "Always tired, and possible blood clots. I was on Voltaren for about 4 years and all of the sudden had a minor stroke and had blood clots that traveled to my eye. I had every test in the book done at the hospital, and they couldn't find anything. I was completley healthy! I am thinking it was from the voltaren. I have been off of the drug for 8 months now, and have never felt better. I started eating healthy and working out and that has help alot. I can now sleep all thru the night. I wont take this again. If I have the pain, I will pop a tylonol instead."}
