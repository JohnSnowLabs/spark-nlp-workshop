## Output Format

The model generates output in the following format:

```json
{
    "predictions": [
        "Output text document 1",
        "Output text document 2",
        ...
    ]
}

```
The "predictions" field contains an array where each element represents the output text corresponding to the input documents provided. Each output text is generated by the model based on the input text documents and any specified parameters.
