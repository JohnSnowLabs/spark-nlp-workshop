{"text": ["The patient is a 22-year-old female with a history of obesity. She has a Body mass index (BMI) of 33.5 kg/m2, aspartate aminotransferase 64, and alanine aminotransferase 126.", "Final diagnosis:  : DNA was extracted from the peripheral blood specimen and a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assay performed that is designed to detect the presence of two separate mutations in the FLT3 gene: (1) within a susceptible region that includes coding sequence for the intracellular juxtamembrane domain and (2)   Negative. Neither expansion of the region susceptible to nor changes consistent with mutation of the codon for ASP835 were identified."]}
