{"text": "I'm a 28-year-old male recently diagnosed with high cholesterol. I've been prescribed statins, but I've heard a lot about their side effects and I'm worried. I'm experiencing muscle aches and I'm not sure if it's due to the medication. Has anyone else experienced this? Any advice would be appreciated."}
