        " A retrospective study analyzed 1,544 COVID-19 cases in Brazilian adults aged 60+ (EW 34-52). ICU admission was associated with a 48% mortality rate. Factors increasing death risk included immunodeficiency, kidney disease, neurological disease, dyspnea, pneumopathy, low O2 saturation, respiratory discomfort, age, sore throat, and sex. However, heart disease and diabetes mellitus did not increase death risk.",
        " Observational studies with conservative management for early-onset preeclampsia without fetal growth restriction or HELLP syndrome, with at least 2 days of pregnancy prolongation, are associated with significantly more maternal and perinatal complications compared to randomized trials.",
        " Despite low-level case reporting, this study suggests that transmission of gambiense human African trypanosomiasis (gHAT) may have been interrupted in Mandoul, Chad, in 2015 due to intensified interventions. However, due to low infection levels and potential false positives, additional confirmatory testing is recommended to carefully monitor the endgame.",
        " Preterm neonates exhibit distinct organ architecture and cell types compared to adults, due to ongoing cell differentiation and lower organ maturation. Notably, preterm tissues contain abundant stem/progenitor cells in various organs. The liver's unique cell composition in preterm infants reflects its gestational function of hematopoiesis, which shifts to bone marrow post-birth. Preliminary studies reveal significant differences in stem/progenitor cell antigens across organs and changing reactivity for stem cell markers during gestation. Understanding preterm stem/progenitor cells can enhance neonatal organ maturation and differentiation."
