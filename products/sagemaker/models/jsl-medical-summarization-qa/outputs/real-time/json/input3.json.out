        " This study analyzed data from 1,544 older adults (aged 60+) in Brazil infected with COVID-19 between August and December 2020. It found that 48% of patients admitted to the ICU died, with several factors increasing the risk of death. These included immunodeficiency, kidney disease, neurological disease, dyspnea, pneumopathy, low oxygen saturation, respiratory discomfort, age, sore throat, and sex. However, heart disease and diabetes mellitus did not significantly increase the risk of death.",
        " Observational studies in which conservative management of early-onset preeclampsia is performed and do not include patients with fetal growth restriction or patients with HELLP syndrome and where at least 2 days of pregnancy prolongation is achieved are associated with significantly more maternal and perinatal complications.",
        " The study concludes that gHAT transmission in Mandoul, Chad, was likely interrupted in 2015 due to intensified interventions. Despite low-level case reporting, passive detection rates have increased due to improved diagnostic availability. However, some reported cases might be false positives. The study recommends additional confirmatory testing to monitor the endgame and determine when it's safe to stop active screening and vector control.",
        " Preterm organs exhibit distinct differences in architecture and cell types compared to adult organs, due to lower maturation and ongoing cell differentiation. Notably, preterm tissues contain abundant stem/progenitor cells across various organs. In the liver, the unique cell types in preterm infants reflect its gestational function of hematopoiesis, a role assumed by bone marrow post-birth. Preliminary studies reveal significant differences in stem/progenitor cell antigens across organs. Additionally, stem cell marker reactivity varies during gestation, aligning with the multiple differentiation steps encountered by each progenitor during development. Understanding preterm stem/progenitor cells can aid neonatologists in enhancing preterm organ maturation and promoting the differentiation of multiple cell types characteristic of term neonates."
