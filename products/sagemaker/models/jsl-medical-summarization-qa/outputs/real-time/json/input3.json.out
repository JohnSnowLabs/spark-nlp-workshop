        " The study aimed to present the clinical characteristics of older Brazilian adults infected by COVID-19 and identify factors responsible for the increased risk of death. The study included 1,544 confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection aged 60 or older. The study found that 48% of patients admitted to the ICU with evidence for SARS-CoV-2 died. Symptoms and comorbidities related to increased chance of death were identified, including immunodeficiency, kidney disease, neurological disease, dyspnea, pneumopathy, O2 saturation <95%, respiratory discomfort, age, sore throat, and sex.",
        " The study aimed to compare maternal and perinatal outcomes between randomized trials and observational studies in patients with early-onset severe preeclampsia. The study included 44 studies, with 5 randomized and 39 observational. The average pregnancy prolongation was 9 days, with no significant difference between groups. Maternal complications were significantly more common in observational studies, while perinatal complications were also more common in observational studies. The percentages of cesarean sections were significantly higher in randomized studies. The study concluded that observational studies in which conservative management of early-onset preeclampsia is performed and do not include patients with fetal growth restriction or patients with HELLP syndrome and where at least 2 days of pregnancy prolongation is achieved are associated with significantly more maternal and perinatal complications.",
        " The study assesses the elimination of transmission of gambiense human African trypanosomiasis (gHAT) in the Mandoul disease focus of Chad. The study utilizes human case data to update a previous model of transmission and tests the updated model.\n\nThe study concludes that passive detection rates have increased due to improvements in diagnostic availability in fixed health facilities since 2015. The study also finds that the diagnostic algorithm for active screening is highly specific, but some recently reported cases might be false positives.\n\nThe study also finds that the focus-wide tsetse vector reduction estimated through model fitting is comparable to the very high reduction previously measured by the decline in catches of tsetse from monitoring traps. The study suggests that transmission was likely interrupted in 2015 as a result of intensified interventions.\n\nThe study recommends that additional confirmatory testing is performed in Mandoul in order that the endgame can be carefully monitored now that infection levels are so low. More specific measurement of cases would better inform when it is safe to stop active screening and vector control.",
        " The document discusses the microanatomy of human organs at birth, highlighting the differences between preterm and term neonates. It emphasizes the presence of large amounts of stem/progenitor cells in various organs, such as the kidney, brain, heart, adrenals, and lungs. The document also mentions the different burden of cell types in preterm infants, particularly in the liver, due to its role in hematopoiesis during gestation. The document concludes by suggesting that a better understanding of stem/progenitor cells in preterm infants could help neonatologists improve organ maturation and differentiation in at-term neonates."
