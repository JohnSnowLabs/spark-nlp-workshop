        " The study aimed to present the clinical characteristics of older Brazilian adults infected by COVID-19 and identify factors responsible for the increased risk of death. The study included 1,544 confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection aged 60 or older. The study found that 48% of patients admitted to the ICU with evidence for SARS-CoV-2 died. Symptoms and comorbidities related to increased chance of death were identified, including immunodeficiency, kidney disease, neurological disease, dyspnea, pneumopathy, O2 saturation <95%, respiratory discomfort, age, sore throat, and sex.",
        " The study aimed to compare maternal and perinatal outcomes between randomized trials and observational studies in patients with early-onset severe preeclampsia. The study included 44 studies, with 5 randomized and 39 observational. The average pregnancy prolongation was 9 days, with no significant difference between groups. Maternal complications were significantly more common in observational studies, while perinatal complications were also more common in observational studies. The percentages of cesarean sections were significantly higher in randomized studies. The study concluded that observational studies in which conservative management of early-onset preeclampsia is performed and do not include patients with fetal growth restriction or patients with HELLP syndrome and where at least 2 days of pregnancy prolongation is achieved are associated with significantly more maternal and perinatal complications.",
        " The study assesses the elimination of transmission of gHAT in Mandoul, Chad, despite low-level case reporting. The study utilizes human case data to update a previous model of transmission and tests the updated model using a data censoring approach. The study concludes that passive detection rates have increased due to improvements in diagnostic availability. The study also finds that the diagnostic algorithm for active screening is highly specific, but some recently reported cases might be false positives. The study suggests that transmission was likely interrupted in 2015 as a result of intensified interventions. The study recommends additional confirmatory testing in Mandoul to monitor the endgame and determine when it is safe to stop active screening and vector control.",
        " The document discusses the microanatomy of human organs at birth, highlighting the differences between preterm and adult organs. Preterm organs exhibit a higher presence of stem/progenitor cells in various organs, such as the kidney, brain, heart, adrenals, and lungs. The liver, on the other hand, shows a different distribution of cell types due to its role in hematopoiesis during gestation. The document also mentions that the antigens expressed by stem/progenitors differ among organs and that the reactivity for different stem cell markers changes during gestation."
