        " This study analyzed data from 1,544 COVID-19 patients aged 60+ in Brazil (EW 34-52), revealing 48% ICU deaths. Factors increasing death risk included immunodeficiency, kidney disease, neurological disease, dyspnea, pneumopathy, low O2 saturation, respiratory discomfort, age, sore throat, and sex. Notably, heart disease and diabetes didn't increase death risk.",
        " Observational studies in which conservative management of early-onset preeclampsia is performed and do not include patients with fetal growth restriction or patients with HELLP syndrome and where at least 2 days of pregnancy prolongation is achieved are associated with significantly more maternal and perinatal complications.",
        " The study concludes that transmission of gambiense human African trypanosomiasis (gHAT) in Mandoul, Chad, was likely interrupted in 2015 due to intensified interventions. Passive detection rates increased due to improved diagnostic availability. However, some reported cases might be false positives. The study recommends additional confirmatory testing to monitor the endgame as infection levels are low.",
        " Preterm organs exhibit distinct differences in architecture and cell types compared to adult organs, with marked differences in preterm neonates due to lower organ maturation and ongoing cell differentiation. Notably, preterm tissues contain large amounts of stem/progenitor cells in various organs. Differences in cell types in preterm infants are related to the liver's function during gestation. Preliminary studies indicate significant differences in antigens expressed by stem/progenitors across organs. Additionally, reactivity for different stem cell markers changes during gestation, reflecting the multiple differentiation steps encountered by each progenitor during development. Understanding stem/progenitor cells in preterms can aid neonatologists in enhancing preterm organ maturation and promoting the differentiation of multiple cell types characteristic of each organ in term neonates."
