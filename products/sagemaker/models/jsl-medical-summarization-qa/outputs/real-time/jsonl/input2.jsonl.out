{"response": " In Brazil, over 230,000 people have died from COVID-19, many of whom were older adults. This study aimed to understand the clinical characteristics of older Brazilian adults infected with COVID-19 and identify factors contributing to increased mortality. The study found that 48% of patients admitted to the ICU with COVID-19 died. Several symptoms and comorbidities, including immunodeficiency, kidney disease, neurological disease, dyspnea, pneumopathy, low oxygen saturation, respiratory discomfort, age, sore throat, and sex, were associated with an increased risk of death from COVID-19. However, heart disease and diabetes mellitus did not indicate an increased risk of death."}
{"response": " Observational studies with conservative management for early-onset preeclampsia without fetal growth restriction or HELLP syndrome, and at least 2 days of pregnancy prolongation, are linked to higher maternal and perinatal complications compared to randomized trials."}
{"response": " The study concludes that transmission of gambiense human African trypanosomiasis (gHAT) in Mandoul, Chad, was likely interrupted in 2015 due to intensified interventions. However, due to low infection levels and potential false positives, additional confirmatory testing is recommended to carefully monitor the endgame. The study also suggests that more specific measurement of cases would better inform when it is safe to stop active screening and vector control."}
{"response": " Preterm organs exhibit distinct differences in architecture and cell types compared to adult organs, with preterm neonates showing even more pronounced differences due to ongoing cell differentiation and lower organ maturation. Notably, preterm tissues contain abundant stem/progenitor cells across various organs. In the liver, the different cell types in preterm infants reflect its gestational function of hematopoiesis, which is later taken over by bone marrow post-birth. Preliminary studies reveal significant differences in stem/progenitor cell antigens across organs, and within each tissue, stem cell marker reactivity changes during gestation. Understanding preterm stem/progenitor cells can help neonatologists enhance preterm organ maturation and promote the differentiation of cells characteristic of term neonates."}
