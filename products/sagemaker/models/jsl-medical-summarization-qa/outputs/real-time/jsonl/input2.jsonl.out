{"response": " A retrospective study analyzed 1,544 COVID-19 cases in Brazilian adults aged 60+, revealing that 48% of ICU admissions resulted in death. Factors increasing mortality risk included immunodeficiency, kidney disease, neurological disorders, dyspnea, pneumopathy, low O2 saturation, respiratory discomfort, age, sore throat, and sex. Notably, heart disease and diabetes mellitus did not significantly increase the risk of death."}
{"response": " Observational studies with conservative management for early-onset preeclampsia without fetal growth restriction or HELLP syndrome, with at least 2 days of pregnancy prolongation, are associated with significantly more maternal and perinatal complications compared to randomized trials."}
{"response": " The study concludes that passive detection rates have increased due to improved diagnostic availability in fixed health facilities since 2015. The diagnostic algorithm for active screening is highly specific, but some recently reported cases might be false positives. The focus-wide tsetse vector reduction estimated through model fitting is comparable to the very high reduction previously measured by the decline in catches of tsetse from monitoring traps. The model suggests that transmission was likely interrupted in 2015 as a result of intensified interventions. Additional confirmatory testing is recommended in Mandoul to carefully monitor the endgame now that infection levels are so low."}
{"response": " In preterm neonates, organ microanatomy differs significantly from adults due to immaturity and ongoing cell differentiation. Notably, preterm tissues contain abundant stem/progenitor cells across multiple organs. In the liver, preterm cell types reflect its gestational function of hematopoiesis, later replaced by bone marrow post-birth. Preliminary studies reveal organ-specific stem/progenitor antigens and changing stem cell marker reactivity during gestation. Understanding preterm stem/progenitor cells could enhance neonatal organ maturation and differentiation."}
