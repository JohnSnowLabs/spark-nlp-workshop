{"response": " The study aimed to present the clinical characteristics of older Brazilian adults infected by COVID-19 and identify factors responsible for the increased risk of death. The study included 1,544 confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection aged 60 or older. The study found that 48% of patients admitted to the ICU with evidence for SARS-CoV-2 died. Symptoms and comorbidities related to increased chance of death were identified, including immunodeficiency, kidney disease, neurological disease, dyspnea, pneumopathy, O2 saturation <95%, respiratory discomfort, age, sore throat, and sex."}
{"response": " This study aimed to compare maternal and perinatal outcomes between randomized trials and observational studies in patients with early-onset severe preeclampsia. The study included 44 studies, with 5 being randomized. The average pregnancy prolongation was 9 days, with no significant difference between groups. However, maternal complications were significantly more common in observational studies, while perinatal complications were also more common in observational studies. Additionally, cesarean sections were significantly higher in randomized studies. The study concluded that observational studies with conservative management of early-onset preeclampsia are associated with significantly more maternal and perinatal complications."}
{"response": " The study assesses the elimination of transmission of gambiense human African trypanosomiasis (gHAT) in the Mandoul disease focus of Chad. The study utilizes human case data from 2000-2019 to update a previous model of transmission. The study finds that passive detection rates have increased due to improvements in diagnostic availability in fixed health facilities since 2015. The study also finds that the focus-wide tsetse vector reduction estimated through model fitting is comparable to the very high reduction previously measured by the decline in catches of tsetse from monitoring traps. The study concludes that transmission was likely interrupted in 2015 as a result of intensified interventions. The study recommends additional confirmatory testing in Mandoul to monitor the endgame and determine when it is safe to stop active screening and vector control."}
{"response": " The document discusses the microanatomy of human organs at birth and in preterm neonates. It highlights the differences in architecture and cell types between preterm and term neonates. The document also emphasizes the presence of large amounts of stem/progenitor cells in various organs of preterm infants. Additionally, it discusses the different burden of cell types in preterm infants, mainly related to the liver's function during gestation. The document concludes by stating that a better understanding of stem/progenitor cells in preterm infants can help neonatologists improve organ maturation and differentiation in term neonates."}
