{"response": " A retrospective study analyzed 1,544 COVID-19 cases in Brazilian adults aged 60+ (EW 34-52). 48% ICU patients died, with factors like immunodeficiency, kidney disease, neurological disorders, dyspnea, pneumopathy, low O2 saturation, respiratory discomfort, age, sore throat, and sex increasing death risk. Heart disease and diabetes, despite being common comorbidities, did not significantly increase death risk."}
{"response": " Observational studies with conservative management for early-onset preeclampsia without fetal growth restriction or HELLP syndrome, and at least 2 days of pregnancy prolongation, are associated with more maternal and perinatal complications compared to randomized trials."}
{"response": " The study concludes that transmission of gambiense human African trypanosomiasis (gHAT) in Mandoul, Chad, was likely interrupted in 2015 due to intensified interventions. Despite low-level case reporting, passive detection rates have increased due to improved diagnostic availability. However, some reported cases might be false positives. The study recommends additional confirmatory testing to monitor the endgame and determine when it is safe to stop active screening and vector control."}
{"response": " Preterm organs exhibit distinct differences in architecture and cell types compared to adult organs, due to lower maturation levels and ongoing cell differentiation. Notably, preterm tissues contain abundant stem/progenitor cells across multiple organs. In the liver, the diverse cell types in preterm infants reflect the organ's gestational function of hematopoiesis, which shifts to bone marrow post-birth. Preliminary studies reveal significant differences in stem/progenitor cell antigens across organs, and within each tissue, stem cell marker reactivity evolves during gestation. Understanding preterm stem/progenitor cells can enhance neonatal organ maturation and differentiation, akin to term neonates."}
