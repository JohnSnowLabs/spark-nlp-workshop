        " In Brazil, over 230,000 people died from COVID-19, primarily older adults. This study analyzed 1,544 COVID-19 patients aged 60+ in Brazil (EW 34-52) to identify factors linked to increased mortality. Results showed 48% ICU patients died, with immunodeficiency, kidney disease, and neurological disease significantly increasing death risk. Age, sex, sore throat, dyspnea, respiratory discomfort, O2 saturation <95%, neurological disease, pneumopathy, immunodeficiency, and kidney disease were significantly associated with increased COVID-19 mortality risk.",
        " Observational studies in which conservative management of early-onset preeclampsia is performed and do not include patients with fetal growth restriction or patients with HELLP syndrome and where at least 2 days of pregnancy prolongation is achieved are associated with significantly more maternal and perinatal complications.",
        " The study concludes that the decline in gambiense human African trypanosomiasis (gHAT) cases in Mandoul, Chad, is likely due to intensified interventions, with transmission likely interrupted in 2015. However, low-level case reporting and potential false positives necessitate additional confirmatory testing to monitor the endgame and determine when it is safe to cease active screening and vector control.",
        " Preterm organs exhibit distinct differences in architecture and cell types compared to adult organs, with stem/progenitor cells abundant in multiple organs. These cells express unique antigens per organ, and their reactivity changes during gestation. Understanding these cells can aid in enhancing preterm organ maturation."
