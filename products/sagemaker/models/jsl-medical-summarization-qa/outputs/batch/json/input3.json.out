        " This study analyzed 1,544 confirmed COVID-19 cases in Brazilian adults aged 60+, revealing that 48% of ICU patients died. Factors increasing the risk of death included immunodeficiency, kidney disease, neurological disease, dyspnea, pneumopathy, low O2 saturation, respiratory discomfort, age, sore throat, and sex. However, heart disease and diabetes mellitus did not increase the risk of death.",
        " Observational studies with conservative management for early-onset preeclampsia without fetal growth restriction or HELLP syndrome, and at least 2 days of pregnancy prolongation, are associated with more maternal and perinatal complications compared to randomized trials.",
        " The study concludes that passive detection rates have increased due to improvements in diagnostic availability in fixed health facilities since 2015. The diagnostic algorithm for active screening is estimated to be highly specific. However, the high screening level and limited remaining infection mean that some recently reported cases might be false positives. The focus-wide tsetse vector reduction estimated through model fitting is comparable to the very high reduction previously measured by the decline in catches of tsetse from monitoring traps. The model suggests that transmission was likely interrupted in 2015 as a result of intensified interventions.",
        " Preterm neonates exhibit distinct organ architecture and cell types compared to adults, due to lower organ maturation and ongoing cell differentiation. Notably, preterm tissues contain abundant stem/progenitor cells across multiple organs. In the liver, the different cell types in preterm infants reflect its gestational function of hematopoiesis, a role assumed by bone marrow post-birth. Preliminary studies reveal significant differences in stem/progenitor cell antigens across organs and changing reactivity for stem cell markers during gestation. Understanding preterm stem/progenitor cells can aid neonatologists in enhancing preterm organ maturation and differentiation, akin to that in term neonates."
