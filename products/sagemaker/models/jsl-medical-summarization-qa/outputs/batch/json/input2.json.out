        " The study aimed to present the clinical characteristics of older Brazilian adults infected by COVID-19 and identify factors responsible for the increased risk of death. The study included 1,544 confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection aged 60 or older. The study found that 48% of patients admitted to the ICU with evidence for SARS-CoV-2 died. Symptoms and comorbidities related to increased chance of death included immunodeficiency, kidney disease, neurological disease, dyspnea, pneumopathy, O2 saturation <95%, respiratory discomfort, age, sore throat, and sex.",
        " The study aimed to compare maternal and perinatal outcomes between randomized trials and observational studies in patients with early-onset severe preeclampsia. The study included 44 studies, with 5 being randomized. The average pregnancy prolongation was 9 days, with no significant difference between groups.\n\nMaternal complications were significantly more common in observational studies, with a relative risk of 0.71. Perinatal complications were also more common in observational studies, with a relative risk of 0.89. Cesarean sections were significantly higher in randomized studies, with a relative risk of 1.54.\n\nThe study concluded that observational studies in which conservative management of early-onset preeclampsia is performed and do not include patients with fetal growth restriction or patients with HELLP syndrome and where at least 2 days of pregnancy prolongation is achieved are associated with significantly more maternal and perinatal complications.",
        " The study aimed to assess whether transmission of gHAT has been eliminated in the Mandoul region of Chad, despite low-level case reporting. The researchers utilized human case data from 2000-2019 to update a previous model of transmission.\n\nThe study found that passive detection rates have increased due to improvements in diagnostic availability in fixed health facilities since 2015. The diagnostic algorithm for active screening was estimated to be highly specific, but some recently reported cases might be false positives.\n\nThe study also found that the focus-wide tsetse vector reduction estimated through model fitting was comparable to the very high reduction previously measured by the decline in catches of tsetse from monitoring traps.\n\nThe study concluded that transmission was likely interrupted in 2015 as a result of intensified interventions. The researchers recommend additional confirmatory testing in Mandoul to monitor the endgame and determine when it is safe to stop active screening and vector control.",
        " The document discusses the microanatomy of human organs at birth and how it differs from adult organs. It highlights the presence of stem/progenitor cells in multiple organs of preterm neonates. The document also discusses the differences in the burden of cell types in preterm infants, mainly related to the different function of the liver during gestation. The document concludes by stating that a better understanding of stem/progenitor cells of preterm neonates will allow neonatologists to boost preterm organ maturation."
