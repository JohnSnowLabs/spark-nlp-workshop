{"response": " The study analyzed data from 1,544 COVID-19 patients aged 60 or older in Brazil, revealing that 48% of ICU admissions resulted in death. Factors increasing the risk of death included immunodeficiency, kidney disease, neurological disease, dyspnea, pneumopathy, low O2 saturation, respiratory discomfort, age, sore throat, and sex. Notably, heart disease and diabetes mellitus did not significantly increase the risk of death."}
{"response": " Observational studies with conservative management for early-onset preeclampsia without fetal growth restriction or HELLP syndrome, and at least 2 days of pregnancy prolongation, are associated with more maternal and perinatal complications compared to randomized trials."}
{"response": " The study concludes that passive detection rates for gHAT infections have increased due to improved diagnostic availability since 2015. The diagnostic algorithm for active screening is highly specific, but some reported cases might be false positives. The focus-wide tsetse vector reduction estimated through model fitting is comparable to the very high reduction previously measured by the decline in catches of tsetse from monitoring traps. The model suggests that transmission was likely interrupted in 2015 as a result of intensified interventions. Additional confirmatory testing is recommended to monitor the endgame now that infection levels are so low."}
{"response": " Preterm neonates exhibit distinct organ architecture and cell types compared to adults, due to lower organ maturation and ongoing cell differentiation. Notably, preterm tissues contain abundant stem/progenitor cells across multiple organs. In the liver, the diverse cell types in preterm infants reflect its gestational function of hematopoiesis, a role assumed by bone marrow post-birth. Preliminary studies reveal significant differences in stem/progenitor cell antigens across organs and changing reactivity for stem cell markers during gestation. Understanding preterm stem/progenitor cells can aid neonatologists in enhancing preterm organ maturation and differentiation, characteristic of term neonates."}
