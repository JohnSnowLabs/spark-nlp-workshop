{"response": " This study analyzed the clinical characteristics of older Brazilian adults (60+ years) infected with COVID-19 (EW 34-52), aiming to identify factors associated with increased mortality. Of 1,544 cases, 48% admitted to ICU and died. Significant risk factors for death included immunodeficiency, kidney disease, neurological disease, dyspnea, pneumopathy, O2 saturation <95%, respiratory discomfort, age, sore throat, and sex. Notably, heart disease and diabetes mellitus did not increase the risk of death."}
{"response": " Observational studies in which conservative management of early-onset preeclampsia is performed and do not include patients with fetal growth restriction or patients with HELLP syndrome and where at least 2 days of pregnancy prolongation is achieved are associated with significantly more maternal and perinatal complications."}
{"response": " The study concludes that transmission of gambiense human African trypanosomiasis (gHAT) in Mandoul, Chad, was likely interrupted in 2015 due to intensified interventions. Passive detection rates increased due to improved diagnostic availability. However, some reported cases might be false positives. The study recommends additional confirmatory testing to monitor the endgame as infection levels are low."}
{"response": " Preterm organs exhibit distinct differences in architecture and cell types compared to adult organs, due to lower maturation and ongoing cell differentiation. Stem/progenitor cells are abundant in multiple organs of preterm infants. The liver's unique cell composition in preterm infants reflects its gestational function of hematopoiesis. Differences in stem/progenitor cell markers and their reactivity to stem cell markers vary across organs and change during gestation. Understanding preterm stem/progenitor cells can aid in enhancing preterm organ maturation and differentiation."}
