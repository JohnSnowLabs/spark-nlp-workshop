{"response": " In Brazil, over 230,000 people have died from COVID-19, many of whom were older adults. This study aimed to understand the clinical characteristics of older Brazilian adults infected with COVID-19 and identify factors that increase the risk of death. The study included 1,544 patients aged 60 or older, and found that 48% of patients admitted to the ICU died. Factors associated with an increased risk of death included immunodeficiency, kidney disease, neurological disease, dyspnea, pneumopathy, low oxygen saturation, respiratory discomfort, age, sore throat, and sex. However, heart disease and diabetes mellitus did not increase the risk of death."}
{"response": " Observational studies with conservative management for early-onset preeclampsia without fetal growth restriction or HELLP syndrome, and at least 2 days of pregnancy prolongation, are associated with significantly more maternal and perinatal complications compared to randomized trials."}
{"response": " The study concludes that passive detection rates have increased due to improvements in diagnostic availability. The diagnostic algorithm for active screening is highly specific. However, some recently reported cases might be false positives. The focus-wide tsetse vector reduction estimated through model fitting is comparable to the very high reduction previously measured by the decline in catches of tsetse from monitoring traps. The model suggests that transmission was likely interrupted in 2015 as a result of intensified interventions. Additional confirmatory testing is recommended in Mandoul to carefully monitor the endgame."}
{"response": " In preterm neonates, human organ microanatomy shows significant differences from adults, due to immaturity and ongoing cell differentiation. High amounts of stem/progenitor cells are found in multiple organs, including kidney, brain, heart, adrenals, and lungs. In the liver, the different cell types in preterm infants relate to its gestational function of hematopoiesis, a function taken over by bone marrow post-birth. Preliminary studies indicate that stem/progenitor cell antigens vary across organs, and their stem cell marker reactivity changes during gestation, reflecting the differentiation steps encountered by each progenitor during development. Understanding preterm stem/progenitor cells can help neonatologists enhance preterm organ maturation and promote the differentiation of multiple cell types characteristic of each organ in term neonates."}
