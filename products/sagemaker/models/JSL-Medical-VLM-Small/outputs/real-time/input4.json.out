The image shows a magnified view of a tissue sample, likely from the uterus, as indicated by the context provided in the question.\n\n#### Key Observations:\n- **AM**: This label likely refers to \"Adenomyosis,\" a condition where endometrial tissue grows into the myometrium (the muscular layer of the uterus). The presence of this tissue is highlighted in the image.\n- **EM**: This label likely stands for \"Endometrium,\" which is the inner lining of the uterus that thickens during the menstrual cycle and sheds during menstruation.\n- **Microcystic Glands**: The image shows structures that resemble microcysts or small cysts within the tissue, which could be indicative of various conditions such as endometriosis or adenomyosis.\n\n#### Conclusion:\nBased on the labels and the appearance of the tissue, Image D most likely shows the microcystic glands of the uterus, particularly in the context of a pathological condition like adenomyosis. Therefore, the correct answer to what Image D shows is:\n\n**C: The microcystic glands of the uterus**.",
