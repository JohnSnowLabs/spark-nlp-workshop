    "text": "During today's consultation, we reviewed the results of the comprehensive genetic analysis performed on the patient. This analysis uncovered complex interactions between several genes: DUX4, DUX4L20, FBXO48, MYOD1, and PAX7. These findings are significant as they provide new understanding of the molecular pathways that are involved in muscle differentiation and may play a role in the development and progression of muscular dystrophies in this patient."
