{"text": "Olivia Smith was seen in my office for evaluation for elective surgical weight loss on October 6, 2008. Olivia Smith is a 34-year-old female with a BMI of 43. She is 5'6\" tall and weighs 267 pounds. She is motivated to attempt surgical weight loss because she has been overweight for over 20 years and wants to have more energy and improve her self-image. She is not only affected physically, but also socially by her weight. When she loses weight she always regains it and she always gains back more weight than she has lost. At one time, she lost 100 pounds and gained the weight back within a year. She has tried numerous commercial weight loss programs including Weight Watcher's for four months in 1992 with 15-pound weight loss, RS for two months in 1990 with six-pound weight loss, Slim Fast for six weeks in 2004 with eight-pound weight loss, an exercise program for two months in 2007 with a five-pound weight loss, Atkin's Diet for three months in 2008 with a ten-pound weight loss, and Dexatrim for one month in 2005 with a five-pound weight loss.
