        "This is a clinical note about a 34-year-old woman who is interested in having weight loss surgery. She has been overweight for over 20 years and wants to have more energy and improve her self-image. She has tried many diets and weight loss programs, but has not been successful in keeping the weight off. She has a history of hypertension and shortness of breath, but is not allergic to any medications. She will have an upper endoscopy and will be contacted by a nutritionist and social worker. The plan is to have her weight loss surgery through the gastric bypass, rather than Lap-Band."
