    "    \"\"\"INTRODUCTION: Infection with the new coronavirus responsible for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) continues to spread worldwide. In Brazil, there are already more than 230 thousand dead, many of these older adults. OBJECTIVE: To present the clinical characteristics of older Brazilian adults infected by COVID-19, in the epidemiological weeks (EW) 34-52, and to verify factors responsible for the increased risk of death. METHODS: Retrospective and observational study conducted with secondary publicly available data, provided by the Brazilian Ministry of Health. 1,544 confirmed cases of registered COVID-19 infection were included between August 16 and December 26, 2020, aged 60 or older. OUTCOMES: Demographic data, comorbidity, symptoms for disease, clinical information: days of hospitalization, chest X-ray, type of RT-PCR. RESULTS: 48% of patients admitted to the ICU with evidence for SARS-CoV-2 died. Symptoms and comorbidities related to increased chance of death (OR) were immunodeficiency (188%), kidney disease (166%), neurological disease (103%), dyspnea (86%), pneumopathy (55%), O2 saturation <95% (53%), respiratory discomfort (49%), age (36%), sore throat (31%), and sex (0.5%). There was a 5% increase in the chance of death for each year of life. CONCLUSION: Heart disease and Diabetes mellitus were the most frequent comorbidities, but did not indicate an increased risk of death from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Age, sex, sore throat, dyspnea, respiratory discomfort, O2 saturation <95%, neurological disease, pneumopathy, immunodeficiency, and kidney disease were significantly associated with risk of death from COVID-19.\"\"\",\n",
    "    \"\"\"OBJECTIVE: To compare maternal and perinatal outcomes between randomized trials and observational studies in which conservative management was performed for more than 48 h in patients with early-onset severe preeclampsia. METHODOLOGY: We searched PubMed, LILACS, Cochrane and Google Scholar. The studies were divided in two groups: randomized and observational studies, from 1990 to 2018 that included patients with severe preeclampsia before 34 weeks of gestation with pregnancy prolongation &#8805;48 h but that did not include fetal growth restriction or HELLP syndrome at the beginning. The main variables recorded were maternal and perinatal complications. MAIN RESULTS: Forty-four studies met the inclusion criteria, and 5 of these were randomized. The average pregnancy prolongation was 9 days, with no difference between groups. Maternal complications were significantly more common in observational studies, RR = 0.71, 95% CI (0.54-0.93), p = .009. Perinatal complications were also significantly more common in observational studies (RR = 0.89, 95% CI (0.80-0.98), p = .01) at the expense of stillbirth and neonatal deaths. The percentages of cesarean sections were significantly higher in randomized studies, RR = 1.54, 95% CI (1.46-1.64). There were 2 maternal deaths, both in observational studies. CONCLUSION: Observational studies in which conservative management of early-onset preeclampsia is performed and do not include patients with fetal growth restriction or patients with HELLP syndrome and where at least 2 days of pregnancy prolongation is achieved are associated with significantly more maternal and perinatal complications.\"\"\",\n",
    "    \"\"\"Background:In recent years, an integrated programme of vector control, screening and treatment of gambiense human African trypanosomiasis (gHAT) infections has led to a rapid decline in cases in the Mandoul disease focus of Chad. In this study, we assess whether elimination of transmission has already been achieved in the region despite low-level case reporting, quantify the role of intensified interventions in transmission reduction, and predict the trajectory of gHAT in Mandoul for the next decade under a range of control scenarios. Method: We utilise human case data (2000-2019) to update a previous model of transmission of gHAT in Mandoul. We also test the updated model, which now has refined assumptions on diagnostic specificity of the current algorithm and an improved fitting method, via a data censoring approach.Results:We conclude that passive detection rates have increased due to improvements in diagnostic availability in fixed health facilities since 2015, by 2.1-fold for stage 1 detection, and by 1.5-fold for stage 2. We find that whilst the diagnostic algorithm for active screening is estimated to be highly specific (99.93%, 95% CI: 99.91-99.95%), the high screening level and limited remaining infection means that some recently reported cases might be false positives, especially the ones that were not parasitologically confirmed. We also find that the focus-wide tsetse vector reduction estimated through model fitting (99.1%, 95% CI: 96.1-99.6%) is comparable to the very high reduction previously measured by the decline in catches of tsetse from monitoring traps. In line with previous results, the model suggests that transmission was likely interrupted in 2015 as a result of intensified interventions. Conclusions: We recommend that additional confirmatory testing is performed in Mandoul in order that the endgame can be carefully monitored now that infection levels are so low. More specific measurement of cases would better inform when it is safe to stop active screening and vector control.\"\"\",\n",
    "    \"\"\"Microanatomy of the vast majority of human organs at birth is characterized by marked differences as compared to adult organs, regarding their architecture and the cell types detectable at histology. In preterm neonates, these differences are even more evident, due to the lower level of organ maturation and to ongoing cell differentiation. One of the most remarkable finding in preterm tissues is the presence of huge amounts of stem/progenitor cells in multiple organs, including kidney, brain, heart, adrenals, and lungs. In other organs, such as liver, the completely different burden of cell types in preterm infants is mainly related to the different function of the liver during gestation, mainly focused on hematopoiesis, a function that is taken by bone marrow after birth. Our preliminary studies showed that the antigens expressed by stem/progenitors differ significantly from one organ to the next. Moreover, within each developing human tissue, reactivity for different stem cell markers also changes during gestation, according with the multiple differentiation steps encountered by each progenitor during development. A better knowledge of stem/progenitor cells of preterms will allow neonatologists to boost preterm organ maturation, favoring the differentiation of the multiple cells types that characterize each organ in at term neonates.\"\"\",\n",

The study updates a previous transmission model using human case data from 2000-2019 and refines assumptions on diagnostic specificity and fitting methods. Results indicate increased passive detection rates since 2015 due to improved diagnostics in fixed health facilities. The diagnostic algorithm for active screening is found to be highly specific, but some recent cases might be false positives. The model suggests that transmission was likely interrupted in 2015 due to intensified interventions. The authors recommend additional confirmatory testing in Mandoul to monitor the endgame and suggest more specific measurement of cases to determine when it's safe to stop active screening and vector control.</td>\n",

Preterm organs show more pronounced differences due to reduced maturation and active cell differentiation. Notably, preterm tissues contain abundant stem/progenitor cells in various organs, including the kidney, brain, heart, adrenals, and lungs. In contrast, the liver has a distinct cellular composition in preterm infants because it primarily performs hematopoiesis during gestation, a role that shifts to the bone marrow after birth. Preliminary research indicates that the antigens expressed by these stem/progenitor cells vary between organs and change throughout gestation, reflecting their diverse differentiation pathways. Gaining a deeper understanding of these cells could help neonatologists enhance preterm organ maturation, encouraging the development of cell types typical of mature organs.</td>\n",

The study updates a previous transmission model using human case data from 2000-2019 and refines assumptions on diagnostic specificity and fitting methods. Results indicate increased passive detection rates since 2015 due to improved diagnostics in fixed health facilities. The diagnostic algorithm for active screening is found to be highly specific, but some recent cases might be false positives. The model suggests that transmission was likely interrupted in 2015 due to intensified interventions. The authors recommend additional confirmatory testing in Mandoul to monitor the endgame and suggest more specific measurement of cases to determine when it's safe to stop active screening and vector control.\n",

Preterm organs show more pronounced differences due to reduced maturation and active cell differentiation. Notably, preterm tissues contain abundant stem/progenitor cells in various organs, including the kidney, brain, heart, adrenals, and lungs. In contrast, the liver has a distinct cellular composition in preterm infants because it primarily performs hematopoiesis during gestation, a role that shifts to the bone marrow after birth. Preliminary research indicates that the antigens expressed by these stem/progenitor cells vary between organs and change throughout gestation, reflecting their diverse differentiation pathways. Gaining a deeper understanding of these cells could help neonatologists enhance preterm organ maturation, encouraging the development of cell types typical of mature organs."
