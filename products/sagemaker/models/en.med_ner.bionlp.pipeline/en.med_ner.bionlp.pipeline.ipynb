MRI of the brain shows large inhomogeneous infiltrating right frontotemporal neoplasm surrounding the right middle cerebral artery. There is inhomogeneous uptake consistent with potential necrosis. He also has had a SPECT image of his brain, consistent with neoplasm, suggesting relatively high-grade neoplasm. The patient was diagnosed with a brain tumor in 1999.

The gene spansapproximately 7.6 kb and contains one noncoding and two coding exons separated byapproximately 2.2 and approximately 2.6 kb introns, respectively. We identified14 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), including one that predicts aVal366Ala substitution, and an 8 base-pair (bp) insertion/deletion. Ourexpression studies revealed the presence of the transcript in various humantissues including pancreas, and two major insulin-responsive tissues: fat andskeletal muscle.

       "      <td>The patient was admitted for symptoms that sounded like postictal state. He was initially taken to Hospital. CT showed edema and slight midline shift, and therefore he was transferred here. He has been seen by Hospitalists Service. He has not had a recurrent seizure. Electroencephalogram shows slowing. MRI of the brain shows large inhomogeneous infiltrating right frontotemporal neoplasm surrounding the right middle cerebral artery. There is inhomogeneous uptake consistent with potential necrosis. He also has had a SPECT image of his brain, consistent with neoplasm, suggesting relatively high-grade neoplasm. The patient was diagnosed with a brain tumor in 1999. All details are still not available to us. He underwent a biopsy by Dr. Y. One of the notes suggested that this was a glioma, likely an oligodendroglioma, pending a second opinion at Clinic. That is not available on the chart as I dictate.</td>\n",

MRI of the brain shows large inhomogeneous infiltrating right frontotemporal neoplasm surrounding the right middle cerebral artery. There is inhomogeneous uptake consistent with potential necrosis. He also has had a SPECT image of his brain, consistent with neoplasm, suggesting relatively high-grade neoplasm. The patient was diagnosed with a brain tumor in 1999.
