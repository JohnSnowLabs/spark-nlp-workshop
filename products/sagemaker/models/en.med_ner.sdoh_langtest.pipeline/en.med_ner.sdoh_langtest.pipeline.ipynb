    "- **Model Description**: It is designed to detect and label social determinants of health (SDOH) entities within text data. Social determinants of health are crucial factors that influence individuals’ health outcomes, encompassing various social, economic, and environmental element. It has been trained using advanced machine learning techniques on a diverse range of text sources. It can accurately recognize and classify a wide range of SDOH entities, including but not limited to factors such as socioeconomic status, education level, housing conditions, access to healthcare services, employment status, cultural and ethnic background, neighborhood characteristics, and environmental factors. The model’s accuracy and precision have been carefully validated against expert-labeled data to ensure reliable and consistent results.\n"
