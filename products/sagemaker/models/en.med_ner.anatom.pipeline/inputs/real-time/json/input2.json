{"text": ["Incision was about 2.5 cm long between the cephalic veinand the distal part of the forearm and the radial artery Incision was deepened down through the subcutaneous fascia. The vein was identified, dissected for a good length, and then the artery was identified and dissected. Heparin 5000 units was given. The artery clamped proximally and distally, opened up in the middle. It was found to have monckeberg's arteriosclerosis of a moderate intensity. The vein was of good caliber and size.\n    The vein was clipped distally, fashioned to size and shape, and arteriotomy created in the distal radial artery and end-to-side anastomosis was performed using 7-0 Prolene and bled prior to tying it down. Thrill was immediately felt and heard.", "This is a 49-year-old white male who sustained a traumatic injury to his left posterior thigh this past year while in ABCD.
