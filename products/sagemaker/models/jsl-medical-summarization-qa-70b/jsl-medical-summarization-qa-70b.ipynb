    "    \"\"\"INTRODUCTION: Infection with the new coronavirus responsible for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) continues to spread worldwide. In Brazil, there are already more than 230 thousand dead, many of these older adults. OBJECTIVE: To present the clinical characteristics of older Brazilian adults infected by COVID-19, in the epidemiological weeks (EW) 34-52, and to verify factors responsible for the increased risk of death. METHODS: Retrospective and observational study conducted with secondary publicly available data, provided by the Brazilian Ministry of Health. 1,544 confirmed cases of registered COVID-19 infection were included between August 16 and December 26, 2020, aged 60 or older. OUTCOMES: Demographic data, comorbidity, symptoms for disease, clinical information: days of hospitalization, chest X-ray, type of RT-PCR. RESULTS: 48% of patients admitted to the ICU with evidence for SARS-CoV-2 died. Symptoms and comorbidities related to increased chance of death (OR) were immunodeficiency (188%), kidney disease (166%), neurological disease (103%), dyspnea (86%), pneumopathy (55%), O2 saturation <95% (53%), respiratory discomfort (49%), age (36%), sore throat (31%), and sex (0.5%). There was a 5% increase in the chance of death for each year of life. CONCLUSION: Heart disease and Diabetes mellitus were the most frequent comorbidities, but did not indicate an increased risk of death from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Age, sex, sore throat, dyspnea, respiratory discomfort, O2 saturation <95%, neurological disease, pneumopathy, immunodeficiency, and kidney disease were significantly associated with risk of death from COVID-19.\"\"\",\n",
    "    \"\"\"OBJECTIVE: To compare maternal and perinatal outcomes between randomized trials and observational studies in which conservative management was performed for more than 48 h in patients with early-onset severe preeclampsia. METHODOLOGY: We searched PubMed, LILACS, Cochrane and Google Scholar. The studies were divided in two groups: randomized and observational studies, from 1990 to 2018 that included patients with severe preeclampsia before 34 weeks of gestation with pregnancy prolongation &#8805;48 h but that did not include fetal growth restriction or HELLP syndrome at the beginning. The main variables recorded were maternal and perinatal complications. MAIN RESULTS: Forty-four studies met the inclusion criteria, and 5 of these were randomized. The average pregnancy prolongation was 9 days, with no difference between groups. Maternal complications were significantly more common in observational studies, RR = 0.71, 95% CI (0.54-0.93), p = .009. Perinatal complications were also significantly more common in observational studies (RR = 0.89, 95% CI (0.80-0.98), p = .01) at the expense of stillbirth and neonatal deaths. The percentages of cesarean sections were significantly higher in randomized studies, RR = 1.54, 95% CI (1.46-1.64). There were 2 maternal deaths, both in observational studies. CONCLUSION: Observational studies in which conservative management of early-onset preeclampsia is performed and do not include patients with fetal growth restriction or patients with HELLP syndrome and where at least 2 days of pregnancy prolongation is achieved are associated with significantly more maternal and perinatal complications.\"\"\",\n",
    "    \"\"\"Background:In recent years, an integrated programme of vector control, screening and treatment of gambiense human African trypanosomiasis (gHAT) infections has led to a rapid decline in cases in the Mandoul disease focus of Chad. In this study, we assess whether elimination of transmission has already been achieved in the region despite low-level case reporting, quantify the role of intensified interventions in transmission reduction, and predict the trajectory of gHAT in Mandoul for the next decade under a range of control scenarios. Method: We utilise human case data (2000-2019) to update a previous model of transmission of gHAT in Mandoul. We also test the updated model, which now has refined assumptions on diagnostic specificity of the current algorithm and an improved fitting method, via a data censoring approach.Results:We conclude that passive detection rates have increased due to improvements in diagnostic availability in fixed health facilities since 2015, by 2.1-fold for stage 1 detection, and by 1.5-fold for stage 2. We find that whilst the diagnostic algorithm for active screening is estimated to be highly specific (99.93%, 95% CI: 99.91-99.95%), the high screening level and limited remaining infection means that some recently reported cases might be false positives, especially the ones that were not parasitologically confirmed. We also find that the focus-wide tsetse vector reduction estimated through model fitting (99.1%, 95% CI: 96.1-99.6%) is comparable to the very high reduction previously measured by the decline in catches of tsetse from monitoring traps. In line with previous results, the model suggests that transmission was likely interrupted in 2015 as a result of intensified interventions. Conclusions: We recommend that additional confirmatory testing is performed in Mandoul in order that the endgame can be carefully monitored now that infection levels are so low. More specific measurement of cases would better inform when it is safe to stop active screening and vector control.\"\"\",\n",
    "    \"\"\"Microanatomy of the vast majority of human organs at birth is characterized by marked differences as compared to adult organs, regarding their architecture and the cell types detectable at histology. In preterm neonates, these differences are even more evident, due to the lower level of organ maturation and to ongoing cell differentiation. One of the most remarkable finding in preterm tissues is the presence of huge amounts of stem/progenitor cells in multiple organs, including kidney, brain, heart, adrenals, and lungs. In other organs, such as liver, the completely different burden of cell types in preterm infants is mainly related to the different function of the liver during gestation, mainly focused on hematopoiesis, a function that is taken by bone marrow after birth. Our preliminary studies showed that the antigens expressed by stem/progenitors differ significantly from one organ to the next. Moreover, within each developing human tissue, reactivity for different stem cell markers also changes during gestation, according with the multiple differentiation steps encountered by each progenitor during development. A better knowledge of stem/progenitor cells of preterms will allow neonatologists to boost preterm organ maturation, favoring the differentiation of the multiple cells types that characterize each organ in at term neonates.\"\"\",\n",

The results showed that:\\n\\n*   Maternal complications were more common in observational studies.\\n*   Perinatal complications (stillbirth and neonatal deaths) were also more common in observational studies.\\n*   Cesarean sections were more common in randomized trials.\\n*   There were 2 maternal deaths, both in observational studies.\\n\\nOverall, the study found that observational studies had more maternal and perinatal complications compared to randomized trials when conservative management was used for early-onset severe preeclampsia.\n",

The study used data from 2000 to 2019 to update a model of gHAT transmission in the region. The results suggest that:\\n\\n1. Passive detection rates have increased due to improved diagnostic availability in fixed health facilities since 2015.\\n2. The diagnostic algorithm for active screening is highly specific (99.93%), but some recently reported cases may be false positives due to the high screening level and limited remaining infection.\\n3. The focus-wide tsetse vector reduction is estimated to be 99.1%, which is comparable to the reduction measured by the decline in catches of tsetse from monitoring traps.\\n4. Transmission was likely interrupted in 2015 due to intensified interventions.\\n\\nThe study concludes that additional confirmatory testing is needed to carefully monitor the endgame and determine when it is safe to stop active screening and vector control.\n",
       "3  The document discusses the differences in the microanatomy of human organs at birth compared to adult organs, particularly in preterm neonates. Key points include:\\n\\n1.  **Organ Architecture and Cell Types**: The architecture and cell types of human organs at birth differ significantly from those in adult organs. These differences are more pronounced in preterm neonates due to lower organ maturation and ongoing cell differentiation.\\n\\n2.  **Presence of Stem/Progenitor Cells**: Preterm tissues contain large amounts of stem/progenitor cells in various organs, including the kidney, brain, heart, adrenals, and lungs. These cells play a crucial role in organ development and maturation.\\n\\n3.  **Organ-Specific Stem Cell Markers**: The antigens expressed by stem/progenitor cells vary significantly between organs. Within each developing tissue, the reactivity for different stem cell markers changes during gestation, reflecting the multiple differentiation steps encountered by each progenitor during development.\\n\\n4.  **Implications for Neonatology**: Understanding stem/progenitor cells in preterm neonates can help neonatologists promote organ maturation and favor the differentiation of cell types characteristic of each organ in full-term neonates."

       "      <td>The document discusses the differences in the microanatomy of human organs at birth compared to adult organs. It highlights that preterm neonates have even more pronounced differences due to lower organ maturation and ongoing cell differentiation. The presence of a large number of stem/progenitor cells in various organs, such as the kidney, brain, heart, adrenals, and lungs, is a notable finding in preterm tissues. The liver, however, has a different cell composition in preterm infants due to its primary function of hematopoiesis during gestation, which is later taken over by the bone marrow after birth. The document also mentions that the antigens expressed by stem/progenitor cells vary significantly between organs and change during gestation as the cells undergo differentiation. Understanding stem/progenitor cells in preterm infants can help neonatologists promote organ maturation and differentiation, ultimately leading to healthier outcomes.</td>\n",
