    "    \"\"\"INTRODUCTION: Infection with the new coronavirus responsible for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) continues to spread worldwide. In Brazil, there are already more than 230 thousand dead, many of these older adults. OBJECTIVE: To present the clinical characteristics of older Brazilian adults infected by COVID-19, in the epidemiological weeks (EW) 34-52, and to verify factors responsible for the increased risk of death. METHODS: Retrospective and observational study conducted with secondary publicly available data, provided by the Brazilian Ministry of Health. 1,544 confirmed cases of registered COVID-19 infection were included between August 16 and December 26, 2020, aged 60 or older. OUTCOMES: Demographic data, comorbidity, symptoms for disease, clinical information: days of hospitalization, chest X-ray, type of RT-PCR. RESULTS: 48% of patients admitted to the ICU with evidence for SARS-CoV-2 died. Symptoms and comorbidities related to increased chance of death (OR) were immunodeficiency (188%), kidney disease (166%), neurological disease (103%), dyspnea (86%), pneumopathy (55%), O2 saturation <95% (53%), respiratory discomfort (49%), age (36%), sore throat (31%), and sex (0.5%). There was a 5% increase in the chance of death for each year of life. CONCLUSION: Heart disease and Diabetes mellitus were the most frequent comorbidities, but did not indicate an increased risk of death from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Age, sex, sore throat, dyspnea, respiratory discomfort, O2 saturation <95%, neurological disease, pneumopathy, immunodeficiency, and kidney disease were significantly associated with risk of death from COVID-19.\"\"\",\n",
    "    \"\"\"OBJECTIVE: To compare maternal and perinatal outcomes between randomized trials and observational studies in which conservative management was performed for more than 48 h in patients with early-onset severe preeclampsia. METHODOLOGY: We searched PubMed, LILACS, Cochrane and Google Scholar. The studies were divided in two groups: randomized and observational studies, from 1990 to 2018 that included patients with severe preeclampsia before 34 weeks of gestation with pregnancy prolongation &#8805;48 h but that did not include fetal growth restriction or HELLP syndrome at the beginning. The main variables recorded were maternal and perinatal complications. MAIN RESULTS: Forty-four studies met the inclusion criteria, and 5 of these were randomized. The average pregnancy prolongation was 9 days, with no difference between groups. Maternal complications were significantly more common in observational studies, RR = 0.71, 95% CI (0.54-0.93), p = .009. Perinatal complications were also significantly more common in observational studies (RR = 0.89, 95% CI (0.80-0.98), p = .01) at the expense of stillbirth and neonatal deaths. The percentages of cesarean sections were significantly higher in randomized studies, RR = 1.54, 95% CI (1.46-1.64). There were 2 maternal deaths, both in observational studies. CONCLUSION: Observational studies in which conservative management of early-onset preeclampsia is performed and do not include patients with fetal growth restriction or patients with HELLP syndrome and where at least 2 days of pregnancy prolongation is achieved are associated with significantly more maternal and perinatal complications.\"\"\",\n",
    "    \"\"\"Background:In recent years, an integrated programme of vector control, screening and treatment of gambiense human African trypanosomiasis (gHAT) infections has led to a rapid decline in cases in the Mandoul disease focus of Chad. In this study, we assess whether elimination of transmission has already been achieved in the region despite low-level case reporting, quantify the role of intensified interventions in transmission reduction, and predict the trajectory of gHAT in Mandoul for the next decade under a range of control scenarios. Method: We utilise human case data (2000-2019) to update a previous model of transmission of gHAT in Mandoul. We also test the updated model, which now has refined assumptions on diagnostic specificity of the current algorithm and an improved fitting method, via a data censoring approach.Results:We conclude that passive detection rates have increased due to improvements in diagnostic availability in fixed health facilities since 2015, by 2.1-fold for stage 1 detection, and by 1.5-fold for stage 2. We find that whilst the diagnostic algorithm for active screening is estimated to be highly specific (99.93%, 95% CI: 99.91-99.95%), the high screening level and limited remaining infection means that some recently reported cases might be false positives, especially the ones that were not parasitologically confirmed. We also find that the focus-wide tsetse vector reduction estimated through model fitting (99.1%, 95% CI: 96.1-99.6%) is comparable to the very high reduction previously measured by the decline in catches of tsetse from monitoring traps. In line with previous results, the model suggests that transmission was likely interrupted in 2015 as a result of intensified interventions. Conclusions: We recommend that additional confirmatory testing is performed in Mandoul in order that the endgame can be carefully monitored now that infection levels are so low. More specific measurement of cases would better inform when it is safe to stop active screening and vector control.\"\"\",\n",
    "    \"\"\"Microanatomy of the vast majority of human organs at birth is characterized by marked differences as compared to adult organs, regarding their architecture and the cell types detectable at histology. In preterm neonates, these differences are even more evident, due to the lower level of organ maturation and to ongoing cell differentiation. One of the most remarkable finding in preterm tissues is the presence of huge amounts of stem/progenitor cells in multiple organs, including kidney, brain, heart, adrenals, and lungs. In other organs, such as liver, the completely different burden of cell types in preterm infants is mainly related to the different function of the liver during gestation, mainly focused on hematopoiesis, a function that is taken by bone marrow after birth. Our preliminary studies showed that the antigens expressed by stem/progenitors differ significantly from one organ to the next. Moreover, within each developing human tissue, reactivity for different stem cell markers also changes during gestation, according with the multiple differentiation steps encountered by each progenitor during development. A better knowledge of stem/progenitor cells of preterms will allow neonatologists to boost preterm organ maturation, favoring the differentiation of the multiple cells types that characterize each organ in at term neonates.\"\"\",\n",

The authors used mathematical modeling based on historical case data from 2000 to 2019 to evaluate progress made in controlling the spread of the disease. They found significant improvement in diagnosis at healthcare facilities leading to higher detection rates. Additionally, they determined that the diagnostic algorithm for active screening had high specificity but suggested performing further confirmation tests due to potential false positives among recently reported cases. The study concluded that intensive intervention measures resulted in interrupting transmission around 2015. It recommended continued surveillance and more accurate case measurements before stopping active screening and vector control activities. Overall, the findings indicate substantial progress toward gHAT elimination in the Mandoul area.\n",

Preterm tissues contain large numbers of stem/progenitor cells across various organs like kidneys, brains, hearts, adrenal glands, and lungs. The expression of antigens by these stem/progenitor cells varies among organs and changes throughout gestation based on developmental stages. Understanding these cells can help improve preterm organ maturation and promote proper cell type differentiation."

It analyzed data from over 1500 confirmed cases of COVID-19 among people aged 60 years old or above. The findings indicated that almost half of those who required intensive care unit admission due to severe illness caused by the virus succumbed to it. Various factors such as advanced age, certain pre-existing health conditions like kidney disease, neurological disorders, low oxygen levels, breathing difficulties, and even having a sore throat contributed to higher mortality rates. Interestingly, common co-morbidities such as heart diseases and diabetes were prevalent but did not directly lead to increased chances of dying from COVID-19. Overall, understanding these risk factors can help healthcare professionals provide better support and interventions tailored specifically towards vulnerable populations affected by this pandemic.</td>\n",

Results showed that while there was no significant difference in pregnancy prolongation duration between the two types of studies, observational studies had a higher incidence of maternal and perinatal complications compared to RCTs. Additionally, RCTs reported a higher rate of cesarean deliveries.

Using historical case data from 2000 to 2019, along with updates to their mathematical model including improved diagnostic specificity and new fitting methods, the researchers determined that while transmission interruption may have occurred around 2015 due to intensive interventions, ongoing efforts should include more accurate confirmation testing.

      "{\"response\": \"The research paper aimed to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on elderly individuals in Brazil during specific time periods in 2020. It analyzed data from over 1500 confirmed cases of COVID-19 among people aged 60 years old or above. The findings indicated that almost half of those who required intensive care unit admission due to severe illness caused by the virus succumbed to it. Various factors such as advanced age, certain pre-existing health conditions like kidney disease, neurological disorders, low oxygen levels, breathing difficulties, and even having a sore throat contributed to higher mortality rates. Interestingly, common co-morbidities such as heart diseases and diabetes were prevalent but did not directly lead to increased chances of dying from COVID-19. Overall, understanding these risk factors can help healthcare professionals provide better support and interventions tailored specifically towards vulnerable populations affected by this pandemic.\"}\n",
      "{\"response\": \"This study aimed to compare the outcomes of expectant management in cases of early-onset severe preeclampsia between randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies. A total of 44 studies published from 1990 to 2018 were analyzed, including five RCTs. Results showed that while there was no significant difference in pregnancy prolongation duration between the two types of studies, observational studies had a higher incidence of maternal and perinatal complications compared to RCTs. Additionally, RCTs reported a higher rate of cesarean deliveries. Overall, it can be concluded that observational studies on expectant management of early-onset preeclampsia without fetal growth restriction or HELLP syndrome have poorer maternal and perinatal outcomes.\"}\n",
      "{\"response\": \"The research paper discusses the progress made towards eliminating gambiense human African trypanosomiasis (gHAT), commonly known as sleeping sickness, in the Mandoul disease focus of Chad. The implementation of an integrated program combining vector control, screening, and treatment has significantly reduced the number of reported cases over the years. Using historical case data from 2000 to 2019, along with updates to their mathematical model including improved diagnostic specificity and new fitting methods, the researchers determined that while transmission interruption may have occurred around 2015 due to intensive interventions, ongoing efforts should include more accurate confirmation testing. This will ensure careful monitoring during the final stages of eradication efforts and provide clearer guidance on when active screening and vector control measures can safely cease. Additionally, they found evidence suggesting that recent reported cases could potentially be false positives given the extremely low prevalence of actual infections. Overall, continued vigilance and precise surveillance strategies remain crucial to achieving complete elimination goals.\"}\n",
      "{\"response\": \"The microanatomy of most human organs differs between newborns and adults, particularly in preterm babies where there's less maturity and ongoing cell differentiation. Preterm tissues have high numbers of stem/progenitor cells across various organs like kidneys, brains, hearts, adrenal glands, and lungs. Organs like livers show different cell types primarily involved in producing blood before switching this role post-birth to the bone marrow. Stem/progenitor cells express varying antigens based on the specific organ they're found in, which change throughout fetal development. Understanding these cells can help improve preterm organ growth and promote proper differentiation into mature cell types seen in full-term babies. This information could aid neonatologists in boosting preterm organ maturation through targeted interventions.\"}\n"
