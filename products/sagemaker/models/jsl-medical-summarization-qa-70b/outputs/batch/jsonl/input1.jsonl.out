{"response": "After experiencing a sharp pain in his lower back while lifting boxes during work, the patient also reported having radiating symptoms down his right buttock extending to the lateral side of his leg below the knee, which worsened over time. These symptoms suggest possible lumbar radiculopathy or sciatica due to nerve compression associated with disc herniation or other spinal pathology. It would be important to further evaluate these complaints through physical examination and potentially imaging studies such as MRI if necessary."}
