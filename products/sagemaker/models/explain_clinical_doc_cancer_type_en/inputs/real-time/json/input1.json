{"text": "A 56-year-old man presented with a 2-month history of whole-body weakness, double vision, difficulty swallowing, and a 45 mm anterior mediastinal mass detected via chest CT. Neurological examination and electromyography confirmed a diagnosis of Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome (LEMS), associated with anti-P/Q-type VGCC antibodies. The patient was treated with\ncisplatin 75 mg/m\u00b2 on day 1, combined with etoposide 100 mg/m\u00b2 on days 1-3, repeated every 3 weeks for four cycles. A video-assisted thoracic surgery revealed histopathological features consistent\nwith small cell lung cancer (SCLC) with lymph node metastases. The immunohistochemical analysis showed positive markers for AE1/AE3, TTF-1, chromogranin A, and synaptophysin. Notably,\na pulmonary nodule in the left upper lobe disappeared, and FDG-PET/CT post-surgery revealed no primary lesions or metastases."}
