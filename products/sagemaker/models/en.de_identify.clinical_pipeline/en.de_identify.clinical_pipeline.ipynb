    "# Deidentification in Healthcare with Spark NLP\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Deidentification plays a vital role in utilizing structured or unstructured clinical text for research and other purposes while safeguarding patient privacy and confidentiality. The John Snow Labs team has dedicated significant efforts to developing methods and corpora for the deidentification of clinical texts, PDFs, images, DICOM files, etc., containing Protected Health Information (PHI). PHI encompasses a wide range of data, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Individualâ€™s past, present, or future physical or mental health or condition.\n",
    "- Provision of health care to the individual.\n",
    "- Past, present, or future payment for the health care.\n",
    "\n",
    "This information includes many common identifiers (e.g., name, address, birth date, Social Security Number) when they can be associated with health information.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Spark NLP for Healthcare's Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Spark NLP for Healthcare offers several techniques and strategies for deidentification, including the following model:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Model**: `en.de_identify.clinical_pipeline`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Model Description**: Capable of deidentifying PHI information from medical texts by masking and obfuscating sensitive data. The pipeline can effectively handle entities such as AGE, CONTACT, DATE, ID, LOCATION, NAME, PROFESSION, CITY, COUNTRY, DOCTOR, HOSPITAL, IDNUM, MEDICALRECORD, ORGANIZATION, PATIENT, PHONE, STREET, USERNAME, ZIP, ACCOUNT, LICENSE, VIN, SSN, DLN, PLATE, IPADDR, EMAIL, and more, providing masked or obfuscated output."
