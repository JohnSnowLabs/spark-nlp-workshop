## Input Format

To use the pipeline model, you need to provide input in one of the following supported formats:

### Format 1: Array of Text Documents

Use an array containing multiple text documents. Each element represents a separate text document.

```json
{
    "text": [
        "Text document 1",
        "Text document 2",
        ...
    ]
}
```

### Format 2: Single Text Document

Provide a single text document as a string.

```json
{
    "text": "Single text document"
}
```

### Important Parameters

- **masking_policy**: `str`

    Users can select a masking policy to determine how sensitive entities are handled:

    - **masked**: Default policy that masks entities with their type.

      Example: "My name is Mike. I was admitted to the hospital yesterday."  
      -> "My name is `<PATIENT>`. I was admitted to the hospital yesterday."

    - **obfuscated**: Replaces sensitive entities with random values of the same type.

      Example: "My name is Mike. I was admitted to the hospital yesterday."  
      -> "My name is `Barbaraann Share`. I was admitted to the hospital yesterday."

    - **masked_fixed_length_chars**: Masks entities with a fixed length of asterisks (*).

      Example: "Name: Hendrickson, Ora, Record date: 2093-01-13, # 719435. Dr. John Green, E-MAIL: green@gmail.com."  
      -> "Name: `****`, Record date: `****`, # `****`. Dr. `****`, E-MAIL: `****`."

    - **masked_with_chars**: Masks entities with asterisks (*).

      Example: "Name: Hendrickson, Ora, Record date: 2093-01-13, # 719435. Dr. John Green, E-MAIL: green@gmail.com."  
      -> "Name: `[**************]`, Record date: `[********]`, # `[****]`. Dr. `[********]`, E-MAIL: `[*************]`."

- **sep**: `str`

    Separator used to join subparts within each prediction.

    By default, the separator is set to a single space (" "), but users can specify any other separator as needed. Necessary because the model outputs predictions as separate subparts, and the chosen separator is used to join them into coherent text.

    The separator must be one of the following characters: space (' '), newline ('\n'), comma (','), tab ('\t'), or colon (':').
    
You can specify these parameters in the input as follows:

```json
{
    "text": [
        "Text document 1",
        "Text document 2",
        ...
    ],
    "masking_policy": "masked",
    "sep": " ",
}
```
