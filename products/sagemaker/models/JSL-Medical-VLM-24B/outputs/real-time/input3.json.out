ASL is a non-invasive MRI technique used to measure brain perfusion.\n- **Panel C**: Labeled \"Admission 3-DWI,\" this panel shows diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) taken at the time of admission. DWI is used to detect acute ischemic stroke by measuring the diffusion of water molecules in the brain.\n- **Panel D**: This panel is labeled \"8-week follow-up\" and shows an MRI image taken eight weeks after the initial admission.\n\n#### Interpretation of Panel D\n\n- **Infarct Core (Option A)**: The infarct core refers to the central area of dead tissue resulting from an ischemic stroke. This is typically shown in acute stages using DWI (Panel C). An 8-week follow-up would show the chronic stage of the infarct, which is usually visible on FLAIR (Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery) images as a hyperintense (bright) area.\n- **Penumbra Zone (Option B)**: The penumbra zone is the area of brain tissue surrounding the infarct core that is at risk of infarction but potentially salvageable. This is usually assessed in the acute phase and not typically visible in follow-up images.\n- **Arterial Spin Labeling Lesion (Option C)**: ASL lesions are seen in the acute phase (Panel B) and are used to assess perfusion deficits. They are not typically used for follow-up imaging.\n- **ASL Perfusion Restriction (Option D)**: This is also an acute phase finding and not typically used for follow-up imaging.\n\nGiven that Panel D is an 8-week follow-up image, it is most consistent with showing the chronic infarct core, which appears as a hyperintense area on FLAIR images.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nPanel D illustrates **A: The infarct core**.",
