Needle marks are usually seen in gross pathology and not in histological slides.\n- **C: The microcystic glands of the uterus** - Microcystic glands are small, cyst-like structures within the uterine tissue. The glands in Image D are outlined and labeled, suggesting they are of interest, which aligns with this option.\n- **D: The endometrium** - The endometrium is the inner lining of the uterus and contains glandular structures. However, the specific labeling of \"AM\" and \"EM\" suggests a more specific condition or focus on certain glandular structures.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBased on the visual characteristics and the comparison with the given options, Image D most likely shows **C: The microcystic glands of the uterus**. The outlined and labeled glands suggest a focus on these specific structures, which is consistent with microcystic glands.",
