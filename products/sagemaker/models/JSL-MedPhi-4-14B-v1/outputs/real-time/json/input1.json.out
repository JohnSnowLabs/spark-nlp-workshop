        "The symptoms described in the scenario suggest that the patient may have cystitis or another form of urinary tract infection (UTI). Given that she is pregnant, medication choice must take into account both efficacy against common uropathogens and safety during pregnancy.\n\nAmong the options provided:\n\n- **Ampicillin** can be used to treat UTIs but might not cover all typical pathogens.\n  \n- **Ceftriaxone** is typically reserved for more severe infections like pyelonephritis and requires intravenous administration; thus, it's less ideal as initial outpatient therapy unless there\u2019s evidence of systemic involvement.\n  \n- **Ciprofloxacin** should generally be avoided during pregnancy due to potential risks associated with fetal development.\n  \n- **Doxycycline** also poses significant risk during pregnancy because of its effects on bone growth and teeth discoloration in fetuses.\n  \n- **Nitrofurantoin**, however, is considered safe throughout most of pregnancy except near term (usually after 37 weeks) when there is a risk of neonatal hemolysis if administered close to delivery time.\n\nTherefore, given these considerations, **Option E: Nitrofurantoin** would be the preferred first-line agent for treating uncomplicated urinary tract infections in pregnant women outside the late third trimester. It effectively treats many causative bacteria while having a good safety profile for use during pregnancy. Always ensure antibiotic choices align with local antibiogram data where possible. \n\nAs always, clinical judgment based on individual circumstances and consultation with relevant guidelines from obstetricians or infectious disease specialists should guide final management decisions."
