        "The best treatment option for this patient would be E: Nitrofurantoin. Since she has symptoms suggestive of a urinary tract infection (UTI) such as burning during urination and increased frequency or urgency, and given that her physical examination does not reveal any other significant findings like costovertebral angle tenderness or fever, the most appropriate antibiotic to treat UTIs in pregnancy is Nitrofurantoin. It is safe for use in pregnancy and has minimal risk of adverse effects compared to other antibiotics like cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, or tetracyclines."
