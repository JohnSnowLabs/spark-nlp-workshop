The absence of fever, costovertebral angle tenderness, and systemic signs suggests **uncomplicated cystitis** rather than pyelonephritis. She is otherwise well, with no signs of sepsis or upper tract involvement.\n\nIn pregnancy, **UTI management must prioritize safety for both mother and fetus**. The goal is to treat the infection effectively while minimizing risk to the developing baby.\n\n---\n\n### Why Nitrofurantoin?\n\n- **Nitrofurantoin** is **first-line for uncomplicated cystitis in pregnancy** (especially in the second and third trimesters) because:\n  - It is **effective against common uropathogens** (e.g., *E. coli*).\n  - It has **minimal placental transfer** and **low risk of fetal harm** when used appropriately.\n  - It is **not associated with teratogenicity** when used in the second and third trimesters (though contraindicated in the first trimester and near term due to risk of hemolytic anemia in newborns).\n  - **Dosing**: 50 mg every 6 hours for 7 days (or 100 mg every 12 hours for 7 days).\n\n---\n\n### Why Not the Other Options?\n\n- **A: Ampicillin** \u2013 While safe in pregnancy, it is **less commonly used for UTIs** due to **lower efficacy** against *E. coli* compared to nitrofurantoin or cephalexin. It is more often reserved for mixed infections or penicillin-allergic patients.\n\n- **B: Ceftriaxone** \u2013 A **third-generation cephalosporin**. Safe in pregnancy, but **overkill** for uncomplicated cystitis and **not first-line**. Reserved for complicated UTIs or pyelonephritis.\n\n- **C: Ciprofloxacin** \u2013 **Contraindicated in pregnancy** due to potential for **cartilage damage in the fetus** (FDA category C). Avoid in all trimesters.\n\n- **D: Doxycycline** \u2013 **Contraindicated in pregnancy** due to risk of **tooth discoloration and bone development issues** in the fetus (FDA category D).\n\n---\n\n### Important Note:\n\n- **Cranberry extract** does not treat UTIs \u2014 it may help prevent them, but not cure an active infection.\n- **Hydration** is supportive, but not curative.\n- **Urinalysis and culture** are ideal to confirm diagnosis and guide therapy \u2014 but in this clinical scenario, empiric treatment with nitrofurantoin is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n**Nitrofurantoin (E)** is the best and safest first-line treatment for uncomplicated cystitis in a pregnant woman at 22 weeks gestation.\n\n---\n\n\u2705 **Answer: E: Nitrofurantoin**",
