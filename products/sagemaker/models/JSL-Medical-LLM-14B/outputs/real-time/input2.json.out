Here's a structured approach:\n\n## Initial Self-Care\n\n- **Rest**: Allow your body time to recover by getting plenty of sleep and avoiding strenuous activities\n- **Hydration**: Drink plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration\n- **Cooling measures**: Use cool compresses or take lukewarm baths to help reduce fever\n- **Over-the-counter medications**: Consider acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) for fever and pain relief, following package instructions\n\n## When to Seek Medical Attention\n\n- **High fever**: If your temperature reaches 103\u00b0F (39.4\u00b0C) or higher\n- **Persistent symptoms**: If symptoms last more than 3-4 days or worsen over time\n- **Severe symptoms**: Difficulty breathing, chest pain, severe headache, confusion, or severe dehydration\n- **Underlying conditions**: If you have a chronic illness, weakened immune system, or are pregnant\n- **Vulnerable populations**: If you are very young, elderly, or have other health conditions\n\n## Additional Considerations\n\n- **Monitor your temperature**: Use a thermometer regularly to track your fever\n- **Avoid alcohol and caffeine**: These can worsen symptoms and dehydration\n- **Practice good hygiene**: Wash hands frequently to prevent spreading illness to others\n\nIf your symptoms are severe or concerning, contact your healthcare provider for advice. In some cases, particularly with high fever or severe symptoms, it's important to seek medical attention promptly.",
