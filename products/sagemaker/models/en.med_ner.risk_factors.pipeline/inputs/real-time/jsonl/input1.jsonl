{"text": "In short, the patient is a 55-year-old gentleman with long-standing morbid obesity, resistant to nonsurgical methods of weight loss, with a BMI of 69.7. He has comorbidities including hypertension, atrial fibrillation, hyperlipidemia, possible sleep apnea, and osteoarthritis of the lower extremities. He is an ex-smoker, but he is currently smoking. He is planning to quit, and at least he should do this six to eight days before surgery for multiple reasons, including decreasing the DVT and PE rates and minimizing marginal ulcer problems after surgery, which will be discussed later on."}
