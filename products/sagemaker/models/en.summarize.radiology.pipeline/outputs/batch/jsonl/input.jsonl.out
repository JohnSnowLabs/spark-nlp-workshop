{"summary": "The radiology report indicates that there is no significant pericardial effusion, and the aortic root dimensions, four cardiac chambers dimensions, and regional wall motion abnormalities are within normal limits. The left ventricular systolic function is preserved with an estimated ejection fraction of 60%, and the left ventricular wall thickness is within normal limits. The aortic valve is trileaflet with adequate excursion of the leaflets, and the mitral valve and tricuspid valve motion is unremarkable. The report also notes mild mitral regurgitation and mild tricuspid regurgitation with an RV systolic pressure calculated to be 28 mmHg. The impression is preserved left ventricular systolic function, mild mitral regurgitation, and mild tricuspid regurgitation."}
{"summary": "The patient underwent a CT abdomen without contrast and CT pelvis without contrast to evaluate for retroperitoneal hematoma. The findings showed no evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma, but there were two left-sided cystic lesions within the kidney, which were slightly larger than the prior exam. The kidneys were small in size bilaterally, and there were bibasilar pleural effusions. The bladder was limited due to the presence of a Foley catheter, and further characterization with an ultrasound is advised."}
