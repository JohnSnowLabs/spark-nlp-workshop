This is consistent with the **infarct core**, which is the area of irreversibly damaged brain tissue.\n\n- **Panel A** shows a schematic of a stroke with the infarct core and penumbra.\n- **Panel B** shows **arterial spin labeling (ASL)** sequences at admission, which assess cerebral blood flow.\n- **Panel C** shows **3-D diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI)** at admission, highlighting the acute infarct core.\n- **Panel D** shows the **follow-up** image, where the lesion has evolved into a chronic cavity, indicating the **infarct core**.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**A: The infarct core.**",
