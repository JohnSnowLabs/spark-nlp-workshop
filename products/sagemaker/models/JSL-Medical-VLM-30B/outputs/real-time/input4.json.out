The key features visible in this image include:\n\n- **Microcystic glands**: These are small, cyst-like structures lined by epithelial cells, which are highlighted in the image with red outlines.\n- **Stroma (EM)**: The surrounding connective tissue, labeled as \"EM\" (likely referring to endometrial stroma).\n- **AM**: This likely refers to \"adenomyotic tissue\" or \"adenomyosis,\" indicating the presence of endometrial glands and stroma within the myometrium.\n\nThe presence of microcystic glands within the myometrium is characteristic of **adenomyosis**, a condition where endometrial tissue grows into the muscular wall of the uterus.\n\nGiven the options:\n\n- **A: Normal uterus tissue** \u2013 Incorrect, as normal tissue would not show glands in the myometrium.\n- **B: The needle-marked zone of the uterus** \u2013 Incorrect; there is no indication of needle marks.\n- **C: The microcystic glands of the uterus** \u2013 **Correct**; the image clearly shows microcystic glands, which are a hallmark of adenomyosis.\n- **D: The endometrium** \u2013 Incorrect; the endometrium is the inner lining, but the glands here are located in the myometrium.\n\n**Answer: C: The microcystic glands of the uterus** \u2705",
