{"text": "I was diagnosed with WPW when I was five years old, I took medication for about 4 years until I had anablation surgery in 2001. After my first surgery I no longer had any problems, but just three days ago I started feeling palpitations again and they have not stopped since then. I am worried that my WPW has returned. I have gone to the ER and all they told me was that I was having palpitations but they could not tell me why and scheduled me a visit to a cardiologist. I guess my question is: Is it possible for my WPW to return after it was corrected with surgery (13 years ago)?"}
