{"text": "Hi,A few days ago my sister had a very bad tummy ache and was crying. After she ate, she ate the usual rice and chicken, she vomited and with her vomit something very unusual and horrible came out. We took it to the doctor, the doctor could not tell what it is, she said she's never seen anything like it before. She aqueezed it and lots of water came out of it. My mum was very worried and wanted to know what it is and what caused it. We thought it's a slug but a slug wouldn't contain water?? Please help."}
{"text": "hi everyone.i have been taking sertraline for the past 10 years after been diagnosed with harm OCD and General anxiety disorder. Sadly i have just been left to cope over the years and developed a very all consuming ocd which controls my life on a daily basis. Recently i have had a severe mental breakdown which has included suicidal ideation. I have been under a crisis team for 5 weeks and the psychiatrist changed me from 200mg sertraline to fluoxetine (i was for two weeks taking diazepam). For 5 days the sertraline was reduced to 100mg then on day 6 i began 20mg fluoxetine. I had a week of feeling absolutely amazing with a new lease of life! the dosage has been upped to 40mg on the 16/11  and i am now suffering with severe anxiety i cant eat having palpatations whole body going hot im just wondering if this is a side effect or if im just suffering more so with my anxiety. i have no desire to do anything or even move off my sofa and just feel its not worth living.thank you!"}
