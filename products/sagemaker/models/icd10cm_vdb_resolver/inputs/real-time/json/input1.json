    "text": "A 28-year-old female with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus diagnosed eight years prior to presentation and subsequent type two diabetes mellitus, associated with an acute hepatitis, and obesity with a body mass index (BMI) of 33.5 kg/m2, presented with a one-week history of polyuria, polydipsia, poor appetite, and vomiting. Two weeks prior to presentation, she was treated with a five-day course of amoxicillin for a respiratory tract infection. She had been on dapagliflozin for six months at the time of presentation. Physical examination on presentation was significant for dry oral mucosa; significantly, her abdominal examination was benign with no tenderness or guarding. Pertinent laboratory findings on admission were: serum glucose 111 mg/dl, bicarbonate 18 mmol/l, anion gap 20, creatinine 0.4 mg/dL, triglycerides 508 mg/dL, total cholesterol 122 mg/dL, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) 10%, and venous pH 7.27. Serum lipase was normal at 43 U/L. Serum acetone levels could not be assessed as blood samples kept hemolyzing due to significant lipemia. The patient was initially admitted for starvation ketosis, as she reported poor oral intake for three days prior to admission."
