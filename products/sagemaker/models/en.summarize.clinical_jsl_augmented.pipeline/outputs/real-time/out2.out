        "The study evaluated the effect of aggressive surgical resection on ovarian cancer patient survival. The study showed residual disease after surgery, frequency of radical surgical resection, and 5-year disease-specific survival. The need for radical procedures to achieve optimal cytoreduction was not associated with a decrease in survival. Disease-specific survival was improved for patients with carcinomatosis operated on by surgeons who most frequently used radical procedures compared to those least likely to use radical procedures. Overall, residual disease was the only independent predictor of survival."
