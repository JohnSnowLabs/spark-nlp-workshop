(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\n\n\nSUBJECTIVE: This 23-year-old white female presents with complaint of allergies. She used to have allergies when she lived in Seattle but she thinks they are worse here. In the past, she has tried Claritin, and Zyrtec. Both worked for short time but then seemed to lose effectiveness. She has used Allegra also. She used that last summer and she began using it again two weeks ago. It does not appear to be working very well. She has used over-the-counter sprays but no prescription nasal sprays. She does have asthma but doest not require daily medication for this and does not think it is flaring up.\n\n\nMEDICATIONS: Her only medication currently is Ortho Tri-Cyclen and the Allegra.\n\n\nALLERGIES: She has no known medicine allergies.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE: Vitals: Weight was 130 pounds and blood pressure 124/78. HEENT: Her throat was mildly erythematous without exudate. Nasal mucosa was erythematous and swollen. Only clear drainage was seen. TMs were clear. Neck: Supple without adenopathy. Lungs: Clear.\n\n\nASSESSMENT: Allergic rhinitis.\n\n\nPLAN:\n\n\n1- She will try Zyrtec instead of Allegra again. Another option will be to use loratadine. She does not think she has prescription coverage so that might be cheaper.\n\n\n2- Samples of Nasonex two sprays in each nostril given for three weeks. A prescription was written as well.", "Medical Specialty: Pediatrics - Neonatal, Sample Name: Chest Closure\nDescription: Delayed primary chest closure. Open chest status post modified stage 1 Norwood operation. The patient is a newborn with diagnosis of hypoplastic left heart syndrome who 48 hours prior to the current procedure has undergone a modified stage 1 Norwood operation. (Medical Transcription Sample Report)\n\n\nPROCEDURE: Delayed primary chest closure.\n\n\nINDICATIONS: The patient is a newborn with diagnosis of hypoplastic left heart syndrome who 48 hours prior to the current procedure has undergone a modified stage 1 Norwood operation. Given the magnitude of the operation and the size of the patient (2.5 kg), we have elected to leave the chest open to facilitate postoperative management. He is now taken back to the operative room for delayed primary chest closure.\n\n\nPREOP DX: Open chest status post modified stage 1 Norwood operation.\n\n\nPOSTOP DX: Open chest status post modified stage 1 Norwood operation.\n\n\nANESTHESIA: General endotracheal.\n\n\nCOMPLICATIONS: None.\n\n\nFINDINGS: No evidence of intramediastinal purulence or hematoma. He tolerated the procedure well.\n\n\nDETAILS OF PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table in the supine position. Following general endotracheal anesthesia, the chest was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. The previously placed AlloDerm membrane was removed. Mediastinal cultures were obtained, and the mediastinum was then profusely irrigated and suctioned. Both cavities were also irrigated and suctioned. The drains were flushed and repositioned. Approximately 30 cubic centimeters of blood were drawn slowly from the right atrial line. The sternum was then smeared with a vancomycin paste. The proximal aspect of the 5 mm RV-PA conduit was marked with a small titanium clip at its inferior most aspect and with an additional one on its rightward inferior side. The sternum was then closed with stainless steel wires followed by closure of subcutaneous tissues with interrupted monofilament stitches. The skin was closed with interrupted nylon sutures and a sterile dressing was placed. The peritoneal dialysis catheter, atrial and ventricular pacing wires were removed. The patient was transferred to the pediatric intensive unit shortly thereafter in very stable condition. I was the surgical attending present in the operating room and in charge of the surgical procedure throughout the entire length of the case."]}
