However, the extent of surgical resection required to achieve optimal cytoreduction is controversial. Our goal was to estimate the effect of aggressive surgical resection on ovarian cancer patient survival.\\n A retrospective cohort study of consecutive patients with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage IIIC ovarian cancer undergoing primary surgery was conducted between January 1, 1994, and December 31, 1998. The main outcome measures were residual disease after cytoreduction, frequency of radical surgical resection, and 5-year disease-specific survival.\\n The study comprised 194 patients, including 144 with carcinomatosis. The mean patient age and follow-up time were 64.4 and 3.5 years, respectively. After surgery, 131 (67.5%) of the 194 patients had less than 1 cm of residual disease (definition of optimal cytoreduction). Considering all patients, residual disease was the only independent predictor of survival; the need to perform radical procedures to achieve optimal cytoreduction was not associated with a decrease in survival. For the subgroup of patients with carcinomatosis, residual disease and the performance of radical surgical procedures were the only independent predictors. Disease-specific survival was markedly improved for patients with carcinomatosis operated on by surgeons who most frequently used radical procedures compared with those least likely to use radical procedures (44% versus 17%, P < .001).\\n Overall, residual disease was the only independent predictor of survival. Minimizing residual disease through aggressive surgical resection was beneficial, especially in patients with carcinomatosis.\"}\n",

    "'''Olivia Smith was seen in my office for evaluation for elective surgical weight loss on October 6, 2008. Olivia Smith is a 34-year-old female with a BMI of 43. She is 5'6\" tall and weighs 267 pounds. She is motivated to attempt surgical weight loss because she has been overweight for over 20 years and wants to have more energy and improve her self-image. She is not only affected physically, but also socially by her weight. When she loses weight she always regains it and she always gains back more weight than she has lost. At one time, she lost 100 pounds and gained the weight back within a year. She has tried numerous commercial weight loss programs including Weight Watcher's for four months in 1992 with 15-pound weight loss, RS for two months in 1990 with six-pound weight loss, Slim Fast for six weeks in 2004 with eight-pound weight loss, an exercise program for two months in 2007 with a five-pound weight loss, Atkin's Diet for three months in 2008 with a ten-pound weight loss, and Dexatrim for one month in 2005 with a five-pound weight loss. She has also tried numerous fat reduction or fad diets. She was on Redux for nine months with a 100-pound weight loss.\n",

    "FAMILY HISTORY: Pertinent for obesity and hypertension.\n",
    "MEDICATIONS: Include Topamax 100 mg twice daily, Zoloft 100 mg twice daily, Abilify 5 mg daily, Motrin 800 mg daily, and a multivitamin.\n",
    "ALLERGIES: She has no known drug allergies.\n",
    "REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Negative.\n",
    "PHYSICAL EXAM: This is a pleasant female in no acute distress. Alert and oriented x 3. HEENT: Normocephalic, atraumatic. Extraocular muscles intact, nonicteric sclerae. Chest is clear to auscultation bilaterally. Cardiovascular is normal sinus rhythm. Abdomen is obese, soft, nontender and nondistended. Extremities show no edema, clubbing or cyanosis.\n",
    "ASSESSMENT/PLAN: This is a 34-year-old female with a BMI of 43 who is interested in surgical weight via the gastric bypass as opposed to Lap-Band. Olivia Smith will be asking for a letter of medical necessity from Dr. Andrew Johnson. She will also see my nutritionist and social worker and have an upper endoscopy.
