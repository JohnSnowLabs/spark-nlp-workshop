    "\n",

    "- **`input_text`**: The input text(s) provided to the model.\n",
    "  - **Type**: `Union[str, dict, List[str], List[dict]]`\n",
    "  - **Constraints**: Provide a string for a single text or a list of strings for multiple inputs. Additionally, you can also provide a dictionary or a list containing multiple dictionaries with keys `context` and `question`. If you select the `open_book_qa` template, the model will format the input accordingly. If no template is selected, the `context` and `question` strings will be concatenated with a newline.\n",

    "  - **Type**: `int`\n",
    "  - **Default**: `1024`\n",
    "  - **Constraints**: Must be a positive integer greater than 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`temperature`**: The temperature parameter controlling the randomness of token generation. (*Can be passed as an environment variable when initializing the SageMaker Transformer object for batch inference.*)\n",
    "  - **Type**: `float`\n",
    "  - **Default**: `0.2`\n",
    "  - **Constraints**: Must be a float between 0.0 and 1.0.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`repetition_penalty`**: The repetition penalty parameter that penalizes new tokens based on whether they appear in the prompt and the generated text so far. Values > 1 encourage the model to use new tokens, while values < 1 encourage the model to repeat tokens. (*Can be passed as an environment variable when initializing the SageMaker Transformer object for batch inference.*)\n",
    "  - **Type**: `float`\n",
    "  - **Default**: `1.1`\n",

    "    \"\"\"Summarize the following document in less than 30 words:\\n## Document Start ##\\nBackground:In recent years, an integrated programme of vector control, screening and treatment of gambiense human African trypanosomiasis (gHAT) infections has led to a rapid decline in cases in the Mandoul disease focus of Chad. In this study, we assess whether elimination of transmission has already been achieved in the region despite low-level case reporting, quantify the role of intensified interventions in transmission reduction, and predict the trajectory of gHAT in Mandoul for the next decade under a range of control scenarios. Method: We utilise human case data (2000-2019) to update a previous model of transmission of gHAT in Mandoul. We also test the updated model, which now has refined assumptions on diagnostic specificity of the current algorithm and an improved fitting method, via a data censoring approach.Results:We conclude that passive detection rates have increased due to improvements in diagnostic availability in fixed health facilities since 2015, by 2.1-fold for stage 1 detection, and by 1.5-fold for stage 2. We find that whilst the diagnostic algorithm for active screening is estimated to be highly specific (99.93%, 95% CI: 99.91-99.95%), the high screening level and limited remaining infection means that some recently reported cases might be false positives, especially the ones that were not parasitologically confirmed. We also find that the focus-wide tsetse vector reduction estimated through model fitting (99.1%, 95% CI: 96.1-99.6%) is comparable to the very high reduction previously measured by the decline in catches of tsetse from monitoring traps. In line with previous results, the model suggests that transmission was likely interrupted in 2015 as a result of intensified interventions. Conclusions: We recommend that additional confirmatory testing is performed in Mandoul in order that the endgame can be carefully monitored now that infection levels are so low. More specific measurement of cases would better inform when it is safe to stop active screening and vector control.\\n## Document End ##\"\"\",\n",
    "    \"\"\"Summarize the following document in less than 10 words:\\n## Document Start ##\\nMicroanatomy of the vast majority of human organs at birth is characterized by marked differences as compared to adult organs, regarding their architecture and the cell types detectable at histology. In preterm neonates, these differences are even more evident, due to the lower level of organ maturation and to ongoing cell differentiation. One of the most remarkable finding in preterm tissues is the presence of huge amounts of stem/progenitor cells in multiple organs, including kidney, brain, heart, adrenals, and lungs. In other organs, such as liver, the completely different burden of cell types in preterm infants is mainly related to the different function of the liver during gestation, mainly focused on hematopoiesis, a function that is taken by bone marrow after birth. Our preliminary studies showed that the antigens expressed by stem/progenitors differ significantly from one organ to the next. Moreover, within each developing human tissue, reactivity for different stem cell markers also changes during gestation, according with the multiple differentiation steps encountered by each progenitor during development. A better knowledge of stem/progenitor cells of preterms will allow neonatologists to boost preterm organ maturation, favoring the differentiation of the multiple cells types that characterize each organ in at term neonates.\\n## Document End ##\"\"\",                \n",
