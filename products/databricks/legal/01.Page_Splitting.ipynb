Background\n","Text classification is the NLP task in charge of retrieving a `category` based on a piece of text you send to the model. A good example of it it's `Clause identification` in legal contracts.\n","\n","There are several ways we can carry out Text Classification:\n","\n","- `At a whole-text level (no splitting)`: That's not feasible for most legal documents. As we already know, we have token restrictions (512 for most BERT-based thansformers). We can use Longformers (4096), but in most cases, documents as Legal Agreements have much more than that, what will go for sure beyond any limitation.\n","\n","- `Retrieving first page`: In most cases, the relevant information of a document is in the first page. Just by splitting by pages and retrieving the first one, you can do text classification. \n","\n","- `Using Legal NLP TextSplitter`: `TextSplitter` is an NLP annotator that it's meant to split documents into sentences, but is pretty customisable to retrieve **paragraphs or setions** as well.\n","\n","- `At paragraph, section or sentence level using NER` for detecting headers and `ChunkSentenceSplitter`\n","\n","The way you split may totally change the results you are getting.
