He now\nis sought as lecturer and expert\nwitness in occult trials across the\ncountry.\n\nLast month, prosecutors in\nJonesboro, Ark., called Griffis as\nan expert witness in a triple-mur-\nder trial that police and prosecu-\ntors believe will redefine the\ncourtroom treatment of occultism.\nGriffis spent seven hours on the\nwitness stand testifying that the\n1993 slaying of three 8-year-old\nboys — whose bodies were found\nnaked, hogtied and battered —\nwere rituals of human sacrifice,\n\nDeputy prosecutor John Fogle-\nman called on Griffis to testify that\nDamien Wayne Echols, 18, and\nCurtis Jason Baldwin, 16, killed\nthe second-graders while enacting\noccult ideology. After leaving\nJonesboro under armed guard,\nGriffis returned home to watch the\nverdicts on television, Echols was\nsentenced to death by injection.\nBaldwin was sentenced to life in\nprison without parole.\n\nIt is frightening, Griffis said, to\nrealize that those who kill under\nthe guise of Satanic ideology do so\nfor greater power and glory in hell.\n\n“In their bizarre belief package,\n\nthey are carrying these things out\nfor their deity,” he said.\n\nRecently, Griffis held up two\npictures in his home. One shows a\nboy on an autopsy table. The other\nshows his four young grandsons.\n\n“I do it for the kids,” he said\nwith a pained expression.\n\nThe 57-year-old father of two\ngrown daughters and a grown son\nlives in Tiffin with his wife, Anne,\nalthough his new career requires\nhim to travel extensively.\n\nEven before retiring in 1986\nafter 26 years on the Tiffin police\nforce, he researched occult crime.\n\n“T went looking in the major\ncities, trying to understand why\nkids get so caught up in all of\nthis,” he said. “It was scary, but\nnow I know.”\n\nSgt. Dave Spaulding, in charge\nof training sheriffs deputies in\nMontgomery County, Ohio, credits\nGriffis with “bringing credibility to\nthe investigation of occult crime.”\n\n“He started doing his homework\nin the late 1970s, when the rest of\npeople in law enforcement were\npooh-poohing any connection at\nall,” Spaulding said.\n\nPhil Carlo, a researcher who\nhad just spent three weeks behind\nbars with “Night Stalker” Richard\nRamirez — a Texas drifter con-\nvicted of murdering 13 people in\nthe Los Angeles area in the\nmid-1980s —- called Griffis “the\nforemost authority on the phenom-\nenon of occultism, a walking\nencyclopedia.”\n\nProfessor Carl Reschke of the\nUniversity of Denver’s theology\ndepartment said Griffis helped set\na key precedent in the Arkansas\ntrial.\n\n“Every effort was made to\ndiscredit him,” Reschke said. “But\nhere at long last is proof positive\nthat satanic crime, occult-moti-\nvated crime, has an ideological\nbonding connection.”\n\n \n\n \n",

Most in\nthe industry don’t quarrel with\nthat kind of reform. Most states al-\nready have instituted these\nchanges.\n\nWhat the industry argues most\nforcefully against is more sweep-\ning reform.

Where there is greenwood, it con-\nsists mostly of dense stands of Mediterra-\nnean pine, imported and planted by the\ngovernment after World War I as a timber\ncash crop.\n\nBut while Sherwood Forest is only a thin\nwisp of its medieval past, its scattered\nremnants are at the heart of national de-\nbate over the future of Britain’s public\nforest lands.\n\nPrime Minister John Major’s Conserva-\ntive government is contemplating whether\nto turn over to private investors control of\n4,355 square miles of woodland and heath,\nnearly 5 percent of the nation’s land area.\nThe land is now managed by the Forestry\nCommission, Britain’s largest landowner.\n\nProponents of free-market economics in\nthe Tory government argue that privatiza-\ntion of Britain’s forests, like the earlier\nprivatization of airlines and utilities,\nwould draw fresh investment and help re-\nnew the moribund timber industry.\n\nTHE STORIES IT COULD TELL: The Major Oak in\nSherwood Forest, estimated by some to be 800 years old,\n\nthusiasts has mounted a loud campaign,\nwarning that selling these lands would\nsharply reduce public access to them.\n\n“Now that the coal industry has col-\nlapsed, we view our forests as the heart of\nour county and the key to our future,” said\nGareth Broome, the forestry officer for\nNottinghamshire. ‘We obviously don’t\nwant to see them fall into the hands of pri-\nvate owners more interested in profit than\npublic access.”\n\nFew groups are as organized and vocal\nas Britain’s vast army of hill walkers. hik-\n\ncountryside.

It also specified that\napplicants should be 18 to 25, 5 foot 7\nand have long hair. “There will be a\ncontest,” it said.\n\nThe advertisement was just one of\nscores placed every day that list\nyouth and sex appeal as job require-\nments. It was also among the more\ncourtly. Some Russian employers\ninclude another prerequisite in their\nadvertisements: bez kompleksov, or\n“without inhibitions.” Everyone in\nRussia knows what that means.\n\nIn Moscow’s bustling new business\ncommunity, it is usually not frowned\nupon to grope the secretary, to re-\n\n,quire that the new office manager be\nsingle, Jong-legged and blond, or to\noffer to discuss a filing clerk’s raise\nafter work in a hotel room — and\ndismiss her if she refuses.\n\nSexual harassment in the work-\n\n: place is rampant in today’s Russia,\n\nand the sexism that thrived under\n\n’ the Communists is growing worse,\n\naggravated, feminists say, by the\n\nnew lawlessness that rules the busi-\nness world.\n\nThe new Russia is known for its\nviolence. There is also a heady sense\nof permissiveness fed by porno-\ngraphic videos, sexy advertising,\nnightclubs, casinos, beauty contests,\nnude pinups and open prostitution.\n\nThis has helped spawn a work-\n_ place climate of sexual swaggering\nand bullying that is no longer imag-\ninable in the United States after\n: figures like Anita Hill and Robert\n. Packwood made the term “sexual\nharassment” part of the national\nlexicon.\n\n“Women view their bodies as a\nway of furthering their careers —\nthat's just the way it is,” said Igor\nBunin, the author of a study on the\n“new Russian businessmen” pub-\n\n-‘lished this month. “Sexual harass-\nment is absolutely not a real prob-\n‘lem in Russia.\n\n~ “T assure you,” he added, “there is\nno opposition on the part of women\nto this.”\n\nMany women do not see it his way.\n‘Trina, 23, a graphic designer who did\n\nwitnesses, the city’s health care ad-\nministrators ignored her. Russian\nnewspapers did not cover the case.\nMost in her community told her she\nwas crazy.\n\n“Unfortunately,” Smyshlayeva\nsaid, “around here even husbands\nthink this kind of behavior is nor-\nmal.” But her husband supported\nher, as did the district prosecutor,\nwho opened an investigation in Janu-\nary.\n\nThe case against the doctor was\ndropped before trial, however, under\nthe general amnesty last February\nthat freed Alexander Rutskoi, a\nleader of the October insurrection\nagainst President Boris Yeltsin.\n\nSmyshlayeva remains employed\nby the clinic, as does her former\nsupervisor, although he was sus-\npended from his position as chief.\n\nThe feminist movement in Russia\nremains small, and if anything, it is\nin decline; its few active members\ncomplain that the status of women\nhas only deteriorated since the de-\nmise of Communism.\n\nOn average, women in 1991 earned\n75 percent as much as men, accord-\ning to the Center for Gender Studies\nin Moscow, but now that figure has\ndropped to 40 percent. Unemploy-\nment is three times higher among\nwomen than among men. Though\nthere are no reliable statistics, wom-\nen’s groups say domestic violence is\nsoaring. The first registered rape\nrecovery center and a crisis hot line\nfor abused women recently opened\nin Moscow.\n\nMost Russian men dismiss the\nissue of sexual harassment as yet\nanother silly Western hang-up. Most\nwomen say the problem exists, but\nshrug it off as just another unpleas-\nant fact of life.\n\nThe demeaning jokes and sala-\ncious remarks that are increasingly\nconsidered a form of harassment in\nthe United States are so common-\nplace in Russia that they do not\nregister as harassment.\n\nValentina Konstantinova, a re-\nsearcher at the Center for Gender\nStudies, noted that while in Commu-\nnist times, bosses preyed on employ-\nees with impunity, democracy has\nmainly freed the male libido.\n\n“Before the view of Russian men\nwere as creatures without willpower\nwho drink too much. Now they have\n\nceived many formal complaints.\n“The pay at Western companies is so\nmuch higher,” he said, “that most\nwomen just smile and bear it.”\n\nThere are no feminist newspapers,\nand only one women’s magazine, the\nmonthly, distinctly unglossy Female\nWorker. But a Russian edition of\nCosmopolitan, a magazine known\nmore for advising women on the arts\nof seduction than on how to fight off\nan amorous boss, is scheduled to hit\nthe stands in Russia at the end of the\nmonth.\n\nIts publisher, Derk Sauer, who also\nowns The Moscow Times, described\nhis project as a service to newly\nprosperous Russian women. “The\nmagazine will not just be about\nfashion,” he said. “It’s about relation-\nships and careers and sex.”\n\nAnd sexual mores have changed.\nThere are more and more women,\nfeminists say, who freely trade sex-\nual favors for salary and perks,\nbecause good jobs are scarce and\nemployers can more easily replace\nrecalcitrant or older employees than\nthey could under Communism.\n\nJob seekers who do not wish to\nsleep with their employers attach a\npostscript to their advertisements,\nintim nye predlagat, “no intimate\nrelations.”\n\nThe current hedonism repels Dmi-\ntri Babich, a young reporter for the\ndaily Komsomolskaya Pravda. He\nwas SO appalled by a recent teievi-\nsion advertisement for office equip-\nment that depicted a secretary lean-\ning over her leering boss, her breasts\nexposed, that he put his phone num-\nber in an article and asked women\nwho had experienced sexual harass-\nment to call.\n\n“A fourth of the calis were from\nmen thinking it was an ad for phone\nsex,” he said.\n\nHis editors were equally confused\nabout the article he planned. “They\nscheduled it for an erotic supple-\nment,” he said.\n\nHe eventually dissuaded them.

A new “domino theory”\nseems to be valid for the conti-\nnent.\n\nEarlier, fear was widespread in\nthe West that African states could\nfall one after another into the\narms of communists like toppling\ndominoes. Now, according to the\nnew version of the theory, one\nland after another faces the threat\nof falling into anarchy and chaos.\n\nAngola, Liberia, Somalia, south-\nern Sudan and Zaire have long\nago ceased to function as modern\nstates. Now it seems only a ques-\ntion of time before the distur-\nbances spread from Rwanda to\nneighboring Burundi. Sierra Leone\nhas long been suffering from the\noffshoots of the Liberian civil war.\n\nIn other countries, governments\nand armies have lost control over\nlarge areas, such as in the Tuareg\nnomadic regions of Mali and Niger,\nthe rebel areas of Chad or north-\neastern Kenya bordering Somalia.\n\nIn countries like Cameroon,\nCongo, Gabon, Guinea or Togo,\ndemocratic reforms have led to the\ncrumbling of the old stable order.\nThe multiparty political system\nhas opened up old tribal rivalries\ninstead of bringing peace and free-\n\nANALYSIS\n\nreason for entire nations being\ngripped by chaos and anarchy.\nThe real causes are poverty, hun-\nger and the catastrophic economic\nsituations that prevent these\nstates from attaining real democ-\nracy.\n\nWhile other parts of the world\nmarched towards progress, it has\nbeen a downhill race for the Afri-\ncan economy for years. Ghana\nand Nigeria were richer than\n\n_ South Korea, Thailand or Indone-\n\nsia in 1965.\n\nNow Far Eastern nations are\ncatching up quickly with Japan\nand Europe, while parts of Africa\nare relapsing into a simple barter\neconomy. With its current eco-\nnomic strategies, Africa hopefully\nwill be able to reach the position it\nhad in the 1970s — in another 40\nyears, according to the World\nBank.\n\nThis lack of perspective has\nbrought forth a generation of re-\nbels in many countries who take\nwhat they need to live at gunpoint.\n\nUnlike the ‘70s, African guerril-\nlas are no longer fighting for free-\ndom or a just society. They’re\npredatory warriors interested only\nin booty and concerned solely\nabout the interests of their fam-\nilies or clans.\n\nThe cry for a new colonialism in\nAfrica has become louder with the\ncollapse of entire states. But\nwhat’s happening is just the oppo-\nsite.\n\nHordes of whites are turning\ntheir backs on Africa. Foreign ad-\nvisers are leaving, and aid is being\nreduced. The case for Africa is\nincreasingly becoming hopeless,\nand the continent is losing its\nstrategic importance.\n\nEven the World Bank and the\nInternational Monetary Fund,\nwhich set the conditions on eco-\nnomic policies for providing aid to\nAfrican nations, appear at close\nquarters more like bankruptcy ad-\nministrators than like colonial\n\n",

         " \n\nAlien sex? Harvard prof believes it\n\nExperiences with extraterrestrial real, he says\n\nBy ANNE THOMPSON\nAssociated Press\n\nCAMBRIDGE, Mass. — Dr. John\nMack, a Harvard psychiatrist, has\nnever had sex with a space alien, nor\ndoes he care to. It could compromise\nhis objectivity.\n\nMack, a Pulitzer Prize winner,\nfirmly believes those people who say\nthey had extremely close encounters\nwith beings from other worlds.\n\nAnd in his new book, “Abduc-\ntion,” he relates his findings after\nspending four years studying 120\n“experiencers” — people who say\nthey had sexual or reproductive ex-\nperiences with aliens who abducted\nthem and took them aboard space-\nships.\n\nThe 13 case studies in his book\ninclude Ed, who remembers an alien\nwoman taking a sperm sample from\nhim when he was in high school;\nJerry, who says she gave birth to a\nhuman-alien hybrid; and Peter, who\ntells Mack he had an “alien wife” ina\n“parallel universe.”\n\n“There is a consistent reproduc-\ntive theme,” Mack said. “Now, do I\nmean by that literally there are mil-\nlions of babies being made? I don’t\nknow. I can’t claim that this is occur-\n\nring literally in our physical dimen-\nsion of reality.”\n\nWhat Mack does claim is that\nexperiencers are not mentally ill and\nare not working out the effects of\nrape, incest or other abuse. Their\nemotional and psychological state\nresembles trauma, he said, and trau-\nma is the response to something\noutside the body, not inside the mind.\n\n“They don’t want to believe it any\nmore than we do,” he said. “They\nwant me to find them crazy.”\n\nDescriptions of abductions are\nconsistent from patient to patient,\nMack said. So he believes the exper-\niencers, even if he can’t explain\nexactly what they experienced.\n\nOne of Mack’s patients, a 37-year-\nold undercover debunker, told Time\nmagazine that Mack gave her UFO\nliterature to read before he hypno-\ntized her.\n\n“John made it obvious what he\nwanted to hear,” the patient, Donna\nBassett, said. “I provided the an-\nswers.””\n\nMack could not be located to\nrespond to Bassett’s allegations. He\ndeclined to comment to the magazine\nabout her case.\n\nHis accomplishments include\n\nfounding the psychiatry department\nat the Harvard-affiliated Cambridge\nHospital and winning a 1977 Pulitzer\nfor his psychoanalytic biography of\nT.E. Lawrence (Lawrence of Arabia).\n\nSince then, Mack has developed\nan interest in Eastern philosophy and\nreligion, and believes it helped liber-\nate his thinking.\n\n“We don’t have room in our cul-\nture for this. It’s the elite people, my\ncolleagues, who decide what we're\nsupposed to believe,” he said, “and to\nthem this isn’t supposed to be.”\n\nEven Mack’s fellow researchers\ninto the otherworldly think “‘Abduc-\ntion” is a little, well, out there.\n\nDr. William McCall, a physician in\nAnaheim, Calif., said that for 10 years\nhe used hypnosis to evaluate exper-\niencers. His theory: They’re actually\nremembering being born. People’s\nmemories of going aboard spacecraft\nmatch their hypnosis-evoked memo-\nries of passing through the birth\ncanal, he said.\n\nBudd Hopkins, a pioneer in UFO\nabduction research, said that while\nhe agrees with Mack that these\npeople had sexual encounters with\naliens, he has reservations about\nMack’s counseling of people to see\n\n \n\n \n\nSUSAN WALSH / ASSOCIATED PRESS\nDr. John Mack, a Harvard psychi-\natrist, says sexual experiences\nwith extraterrestrials are real.\n\nthe experience as somehow enrich-\ning. Hopkins said he sees such ex-\nperiences as neither good nor bad.\n“T think John is putting a quasi-\nreligious spin on the material that\nmakes the book more vulnerable to\ncriticism,” said Hopkins, a New York\nartist who has researched and writ-\nten about experiencers for 19 years.\n",

Henry Waxman, D-Calif., put that\nfrightful statistic another way:\n\n“Imagine our nation’s outrage if two fully\nloaded jumbo jets crashed each day, killing all\naboard. That’s the same number of Americans\nthat cigarettes kill every 24 hours.”\n\nThe CEOs were not impressed.\n\n“We have looked at the data... . It does\nnot convince me that smoking causes death,”\nsaid Andrew Tisch of the Lorillard Tobacco\nCo.\n\n \n\n \n\nSTEVE WILSON\n\nRepublic Columnist\nee\n\nHe and the others played dumb for the\nentire six hours, but it really didn’t matter.\n\nThe game is nearly over, and the tobacco\nexecutives know it.\n\nThe hearing marked a turning point in the\nnation’s growing aversion to cigarettes. No\nlonger hamstrung by tobacco-state seniority\nand the deep-pocketed tokacco lobby,\nCongress is taking aim at cigarette makers.\n\n \n\nThe tobacco industry would like to promote\nthe specter of prohibition.\n\n“If cigarettes are too dangerous to be sold,\nthen ban them. Some smokers will obey the\nlaw, but many will not. People will be selling\ncigarettes out of the trunks of cars, cigarettes\nmade by who knows who, made of who knows’\nwhat,” said James Johnston of R.J. Reynolds.\n\nIt’s a ruse. He knows cigarettes are not\ngoing to be banned, at least not in his lifetime.\nWhat he really fears are new taxes, stronger\nanti-smoking campaigns, further smoking\nrestrictions, limits on secondhand smoke and\nlimits on tar and nicotine.\n\nCollectively, these steps can accelerate the\ncurrent 5 percent annual decline in cigarette\nuse and turn the tobacco business from highly\nprofitable to depressed.\n\nJohnson’s comment about cigarettes “made\nof who knows what” was comical.\n\nThe day before the hearing, the tobacco\ncompanies released a long-secret list of 599\nadditives used in cigarettes. The companies\nsaid all are certified by an “independent\n\n \n\npancl” of toxicologists as “not hazardous\nunder the conditions they are used.”\n\nPeople not paid by the tobacco companies\naren't so sure. The list includes several\nsubstances the government does not allow in\nfoods or classifies as potentially toxic. They\ninclude ammonia, a pesticide called\nmethoprene, and ethyl furoate, which has\n\n| caused liver damage in rats.\n\nThe list “begs a number of important\n\n| questions about the safety of these additives,”\n\nsaid a joint statement from the American\nLung, Cancer and Heart associations. The\nstatement added that substances safe to eat\naren't necessarily safe to inhale.\n\nThe 50-page list can be obtained free by\n\ncalling 1-800-852-8749.\n\nHere are just the 44 ingredients that start\nwith the letter “A”:\n\nAcetanisole, acetic acid, acetoin,\nacetophenone, 6-acetoxydihydrotheaspirane,\n2-acetyl-3-ethylpyrazine, 2-acetyl-5-\nmethylfuran, acetylpyrazine, 2-acetylpyridine,\n3-acetylpyridine, 2-acetylthiazole, aconitic\n\n \n",

Nor will all its prisoners, of-\nten referred to as ‘‘the worst of the worst,”\nbe required to eat in their cells. And they\nwon't all be prohibited from attending re-\nligious services or other group activities.\n\nIndividual cells in Supermax’s “control\nunit” will house 64 inmates 23 hours a day,\nas will a separate 72-cell segregation unit,\nwhich Story calls “a jail within a jail.” In-\nmates held in this rigid system of confine-\nment will be permitted one hour a day out-\nside their cells to exercise.\n\nThe other inmates will have access to\ngroup activities and be permitted out of\ntheir cells for anywhere from three to 12\nhours a day.\n\nSupermax also will have four VIP cells\nshould it receive an inmate with extraor-\n\nabout the plight of American Indians staged a peaceful vigil\n\nUnlike Marion, where the worst prison-\ners are held in basement cells, all cells at\nSupermax have windows.

         "Occult-crime\nexpert shines\nlight on Satanism\n\nThe Toledo Blade\n\nTIFFIN, Ohio — Dale Griffis,\nwho has emerged as one of the\nnation’s leading experts on occult\ncrime, returned home from the\nmost historic case of his career\nwishing there were no need for his\nservices.\n\n“I personally would like to be\nput out of business,” said the\nformer Tiffin police captain, whose\nwork, experts say, has changed the\ncomplexion of occult-related activ-\nity in both the court and class-\nroom.\n\n“Yd like to have this whole\nbizarre topic just go away.”\n\nGriffis, who has a degree in\ncriminal justice, appeared on\nABC-TV’s 20/20 in 1985. He now\nis sought as lecturer and expert\nwitness in occult trials across the\ncountry.\n\nLast month, prosecutors in\nJonesboro, Ark., called Griffis as\nan expert witness in a triple-mur-\nder trial that police and prosecu-\ntors believe will redefine the\ncourtroom treatment of occultism.\nGriffis spent seven hours on the\nwitness stand testifying that the\n1993 slaying of three 8-year-old\nboys — whose bodies were found\nnaked, hogtied and battered —\nwere rituals of human sacrifice.\n\nDeputy prosecutor John Fogle-\nman called on Griffis to testify that\nDamien Wayne Echols, 18, and\nCurtis Jason Baldwin, 16, killed\nthe second-graders while enacting\noccult ideology. After leaving\nJonesboro under armed guard,\nGriffis returned home to watch the\nverdicts on television, Echols was\nsentenced to death by injection.\nBaldwin was sentenced to life in\nprison without parole.\n\nIt is frightening, Griffis said, to\nrealize that those who kill under\nthe guise of Satanic ideology do so\nfor greater power and glory in hell.\n\n“In their bizarre belief package,\n\n \n\nthey are carrying these things out\nfor their deity,” he said.\n\nRecently, Griffis held up two\npictures in his home. One shows a\nboy on an autopsy table. The other\nshows his four young grandsons.\n\n“IT do it for the kids,” he said\nwith a pained expression.\n\nThe 57-year-old father of two\ngrown daughters and a grown son\nlives in Tiffin with his wife, Anne,\nalthough his new career requires\nhim to travel extensively.\n\nEven before retiring in 1986\nafter 26 years on the Tiffin police\nforce, he researched occult crime.\n\n“IT went looking in the major\ncities, trying to understand why\nkids get so caught up in all of\nthis,” he said. “It was scary, but\nnow I know.”\n\nSgt. Dave Spaulding, in charge\nof training sheriffs deputies in\nMontgomery County, Ohio, credits\nGriffis with “bringing credibility to\nthe investigation of occult crime.”\n\n“He started doing his homework\nin the late 1970s, when the rest of\npeople in law enforcement were\npooh-poohing any connection at\nall,” Spaulding said.\n\nPhil Carlo, a researcher who\nhad just spent three weeks behind\nbars with “Night Stalker” Richard\nRamirez — a Texas drifter con-\nvicted of murdering 13 people in\nthe Los Angeles area in the\nmid-1980s —- called Griffis “the\nforemost authority on the phenom-\nenon of occultism, a walking\nencyclopedia.”\n\nProfessor Carl Reschke of the\nUniversity of Denver’s theology\ndepartment said Griffis helped set\na key precedent in the Arkansas\ntrial.\n\n“Every effort was made to\ndiscredit him,” Reschke said. “But\nhere at long last is proof positive\nthat satanic crime, occult-moti-\nvated crime, has an ideological\nbonding connection.”\n",

         " \n\n \n\nHealth-insurance firms under fire\n\nThere’s no love lost between Americans and carriers, opinion polls show\n\nBy Anne Reifenberg\nDallas Morning News\n\nWASHINGTON — U.S. insur-\nance companies have fed tens of\nmillions of dollars into lobbying\nand advertising campaigns, but\nthey still are being cast as leading\nculprits for the nation’s heaith-\ncare problems, their foes and al-\nlies agree.\n\nOpinion polls show there is no\nlove lost between Americans and\nthe carriers they fear might on\nany day drop them or increase\ntheir rates.\n\nHillary Rodham Clinton has ac-\ncused the industry of creating\n“probably the stupidest financing\nsystem in the world” and using it\n\n \n\nto demand sky-high premiums of\nthose with costly diseases.\n\ndndustry leaders complain that\nthey are getting a bum rap, and\nsome analysts say the attacks of-\nten are exaggerated or wrong-\nheaded. .\n\n“Deservedly or not, the industry\nhas an image problem,” said Har-\nvey Raymond, an executive with\nthe Health Insurance Association\nof America, which represents 270\ncommercial carriers. “We're visi-\nble. We’re easy marks.”\n\nIn the court of public opinion, in-\nsurance companies stand convict-\ned; New York Times-CBS and Wall\nStreet Journal-NBC polls taken in\nMarch rated insurers at the bot-\n\ntom of those the public considers\ntrustworthy in the reform battle.\n\nAnd this trend, according to\n\n“ many inside and outside the indus-\n\ntry, is affecting the reform process\nin Washington.\n\n“They cooked their own goose.\nSome of them have engaged in\npractices like dumping bad risks\nand competing for the healthy and\ncharging the sick more, and it has\nreally ticked people off,” said Lin-\nda Lipsen, legislative director for\nConsumers Union, the nonprofit\ngroup that publishes Consumers\nReports. ‘“‘There’s a lot of blame to\nbe thrown around on health care,\nbut the insurance industry sticks\nout like a sore thumb.”\n\nEvery reform plan being consid-\nered by Congress would make ille-\ngal the most criticized techniques\nthat can price some Americans out\nof the insurance market. Most in\nthe industry don’t quarrel with\nthat kind of reform. Most states al-\nready have instituted these\nchanges.\n\nWhat the industry argues most\nforcefully against is more sweep-\ning reform.

Where there is greenwood, it con-\nsists mostly of dense stands of Mediterra-\nnean pine, imported and planted by the\ngovernment after World War I as a timber\ncash crop.\n\nBut while Sherwood Forest is only a thin\nwisp of its medieval past, its scattered\nremnants are at the heart of national de-\nbate over the future of Britain’s public\nforest lands.\n\nPrime Minister John Major’s Conserva-\ntive government is contemplating whether\nto turn over to private investors control of\n4,355 square miles of woodland and heath,\nnearly 5 percent of the nation’s land area.\nThe land is now managed by the Forestry\nCommission, Britain’s largest landowner.\n\nProponents of free-market economics in\nthe Tory government argue that privatiza-\ntion of Britain’s forests, like the earlier\nprivatization of airlines and utilities,\nwould draw fresh investment and help re-\nnew the moribund timber industry.\n\nTHE STORIES IT COULD TELL: The Major Oak in\nSherwood Forest, estimated by some to be 800 years old,\n\nthusiasts has mounted a loud campaign,\nwarning that selling these lands would\nsharply reduce public access to them.\n\n“Now that the coal industry has col-\nlapsed, we view our forests as the heart of\nour county and the key to our future,” said\nGareth Broome, the forestry officer for\nNottinghamshire. ‘“‘We obviously don’t\nwant to see them fall into the hands of pri-\nvate owners more interested in profit than\npublic access.”\n\nFew groups are as organized and vocal\nas Britain’s vast army of hill walkers. hik-\n\ncountryside.

It was also among the more\ncourtly. Some Russian employers\ninclude another prerequisite in their\nadvertisements: bez kompleksov, or\n“without inhibitions.” Everyone in\nRussia knows what that means.\n\nIn Moscow’s bustling new business\ncommunity, it is usually not frowned\nupon to grope the secretary, to re-\n\n, quire that the new office manager be\nsingle, jong-legged and blond, or to\noffer to discuss a filing clerk’s raise\nafter work in a hotel room — and\ndismiss her if she refuses.\n\nSexual harassment in the work-\n‘ place is rampant in today’s Russia,\n- and the sexism that thrived under\n' the Communists is growing worse,\n- aggravated, feminists say, by the\nnew lawlessness that rules the busi-\n\n_ ness world.\n\n-. The new Russia is known for its\n- violence. There is also a heady sense\nof permissiveness fed by porno-\n\ngraphic videos, sexy advertising,\n: nightclubs, casinos, beauty contests,\n- nude pinups and open prostitution.\n\nThis has helped spawn a work-\n_ place climate of sexual swaggering\nand bullying that is no longer imag-\n-inable in the United States after\n‘ figures like Anita Hill and Robert\n- Packwood made the term “sexual\nharassment” part of the national\n_ lexicon.\n\n_ “Women view their bodies as a\nway of furthering their careers ~\nthat’s just the way it is,” said Igor\n~Bunin, the author of a study on the\n‘new Russian businessmen” pub-\n\n‘lished this month. “Sexual harass-\nment is absolutely not a real prob-\n‘lem in Russia.\n\n- “T assure you,” he added, “there is\n-hO opposition on the part of women\nto this.”\n\n‘.

Unemploy-\nment is three times higher among\nwomen than among men. Though\nthere are no reliable statistics, wom-\nen’s groups say domestic violence is\nsoaring. The first registered rape\nrecovery center and a crisis hot line\nfor abused women recently opened\nin Moscow.\n\nMost Russian men dismiss the\nissue of sexual harassment as yet\nanother silly Western hang-up. Most\nwomen say the problem exists, but\nshrug it off as just another unpleas-\nant fact of life.\n\nThe demeaning jokes and sala-\ncious remarks that are increasingly\nconsidered a form of harassment in\nthe United States are so common-\nplace in Russia that they do not\nregister as harassment.\n\nValentina Konstantinova, a re-\nsearcher at the Center for Gender\nStudies, noted that while in Commu-\nnist times, bosses preyed on employ-\nees with impunity, democracy has\nmainly freed the male libido.\n\n“Before the view of Russian men\nwere as creatures without willpower\nwho drink too much. Now they have\n\nceived many formal complaints.\n“The pay at Western companies is so\nmuch higher,” he said, “that most\nwomen just smile and bear it.”\n\nThere are no feminist newspapers,\nand only one women’s magazine, the\nmonthly, distinctly unglossy Female\nWorker. But a Russian edition of\nCosmopolitan, a magazine known\nmore for advising women on the arts\nof seduction than on how to fight off\nan amorous boss, is scheduled to hit\nthe stands in Russia at the end of the\nmonth.\n\nIts publisher, Derk Sauer, who also\nowns The Moscow Times, described\nhis project as a service to newly\nprosperous Russian women. “The\nmagazine will not just be about\nfashion,” he said. “It’s about relation-\nships and careers and sex.”\n\nAnd sexual mores have changed.\nThere are more and more women,\nfeminists say, who freely trade sex-\nual favors for salary and perks,\nbecause good jobs are scarce and\nemployers can more easily replace\nrecalcitrant or older employees than\nthey could under Communism.\n\nJob seekers who do not wish to\nsleep with their employers attach a\npostscript to their advertisements,\nintim nye predlagat, “no intimate\nrelations.”\n\nThe current hedonism repels Dmi-\ntri Babich, a young reporter for the\ndaily Komsomolskaya Pravda.

         " \n\nAlien sex? Harvard prot believes it\n\nExperiences with extraterrestrials real, he says\n\nBy ANNE THOMPSON\nAssociated Press\n\nCAMBRIDGE, Mass. — Dr. John\nMack, a Harvard psychiatrist, has\nnever had sex with a space alien, nor\ndoes he care to. It could compromise\nhis objectivity.\n\nMack, a Pulitzer Prize winner,\nfirmly believes those people who say\nthey had extremely close encounters\nwith beings from other worlds.\n\nAnd in his new book, “Abduc-\ntion,” he relates his findings after\nspending four years studying 120\n“experiencers” — people who say\nthey had sexual or reproductive ex-\nperiences with aliens who abducted\nthem and took them aboard space-\nships.\n\nThe 13 case studies in his book\ninclude Ed, who remembers an alien\nwoman taking a sperm sample from\nhim when he was in high school;\nJerry, who says she gave birth to a\nhuman-alien hybrid; and Peter, who\ntells Mack he had an “alien wife” ina\n“parallel universe.”\n\n“There is a consistent reproduc-\ntive theme,” Mack said. “Now, do I\nmean by that literally there are mil-\nlions of babies being made? I don’t\nknow. I can’t claim that this ts occur-\n\nring literally in our physical dimen-\nsion of reality.”\n\nWhat Mack does claim is that\nexpenencers are not mentally ill and\nare not working out the effects of\nrape, incest or other abuse. Their\nemotional and psychological state\nresembles trauma, he said, and trau-\nma is the response to something\noutside the body, not inside the mind.\n\n“They don’t want to believe it any\nmore than we do,” he said. “They\nwant me to find them crazy.”\n\nDescriptions of abductions are\nconsistent from patient to patient,\nMack said. So he believes the exper-\niencers, even if he can’t explain\nexactly what they experienced.\n\nOne of Mack’s patients, a 37-year-\nold undercover debunker, told Time\nmagazine that Mack gave her UFO\nliterature to read before he hypno-\ntized her.\n\n“John made it obvious what he\nwanted to hear,’’ the patient, Donna\nBassett, said. “I provided the an-\nSwers.”\n\nMack could not be located to\nrespond to Bassett’s allegations.

         "Tobacco chiefs still refuse to see the truth abou\n\neven of America’s least conscionable\nS men sat together in Washington last\n\nweek to do what they do best: blow\nsmoke at the truth about cigarettes.\n\nThe CEOs of the nation’s largest tobacco\nfirms told a congressional panel that nicotine\nis not addictive, that they are unconvinced\nthat smoking causes lung cancer or any other\nillness, and that smoking is no more harmful\nthan drinking coffee or eating Twinkies.\n\nThey said these things with straight faces.\n\nThey said them in the face of massive\nscientific evidence that smoking is responsible\nfor more than 400,000 deaths every year.\n\nRep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., put that\nfrightful statistic another way:\n\n“Imagine our nation’s outrage if two fully\nloaded jumbo jets crashed each day, killing all\naboard. That’s the same number of Americans\nthat cigarettes kill every 24 hours.”\n\nThe CEOs were not tmpressed.\n\n“We have looked at the data. ... It does\nnot convince me that smoking causes death,”\nsaid Andrew Tisch of the Lorillard Tobacco\nCo.\n\n \n\n   \n\nSTEVE WILSON\n\nRepublic Columnist\n\nHe and the others played dumb for the\nentire six hours, but it really didn’t matter.\nThe game is nearly over, and the tobacco\n\n- executives know it.\n\nThe hearing marked a turning point in the\nnation’s growing aversion to cigarettes. No\nlonger hamstrung by tobacco-state seniority\nand the deep-pocketed tokacco lobby,\nCongress is taking aim at cigarette makers.\n\n \n\nThe tobacco industry would like to promote\n\nthe specter of prohibition.\n\n“Tf cigarettes are too dangerous to be sold,\nthen ban them. Some smokers will obey the\nlaw, but many will not. People will be selling\ncigarettes out of the trunks of cars, cigarettes\nmade by who knows who, made of who knows’\nwhat,” said James Johnston of R.J. Reynolds.\n\nIt’s a ruse. He knows cigarettes are not\ngoing to be banned, at least not in his lifetime.\nWhat he really fears are new taxcs, stronger\nanti-smoking campaigns, further smoking\nrestrictions, limits on secondhand smoke and\nlimits on tar and nicotine.\n\nCollectively, these steps can accelerate the\ncurrent 5 percent annual decline in cigarette\nuse and turn the tobacco business from highly\nprofitable to depressed.\n\nJohnson’s comment about cigarettes “made\nof who knows what” was comical.\n\nThe day before the hearing, the tobacco\ncompanies released a long-secret list of 599\nadditives used in cigarettes. The companies\nsaid all are certified by an “independent\n\n \n\n \n\npanel” of toxicologists as “not hazardous\nunder the conditions they are used.”\n\nPeople not paid by the tobacco companies\naren't so sure. The list includes several\nsubstances the government does not allow in\nfoods or classifies as potentially toxic. They\ninclude ammonia, a pesticide called\nmethoprene, and ethyl] furoate, which has\ncaused liver damage in rats.\n\nThe list “begs a number of important\n\n; questions about the safety of these additives,”\n\nsaid a joint statement from the American\nLung, Cancer and Heart associations. The\nstatement added that substances safe to eat\naren't necessarily safe to inhale.\n\nThe 50-page list can be obtained free by\ncalling 1-800-852-8749.\n\nHere are just the 44 ingredicnts that start\nwith the letter “A”:\n\nAcetanisole, acetic acid, acetoin,\nacetophenone, 6-acetoxydihydrotheaspirane,\n2-acetyl-3-ethylpyrazine, 2-acetyl-5-\nmethylfuran, acetylpyrazine, 2-acetylpyridine,\n3-acetylpyridine, 2-acetylthiazole, aconitic\n\n \n",

Ann Richards, members of the\nstate racing commission and local officials\nare expected to be among a crowd of about\n15,000 when the racetrack, an $85 million\nfacility in northwest Harris County, begins\n\nracing at 1 p.m. Friday.\n\nFor Texas horse racing fans, it has been\na long time coming. From the time the\nTexas Legislature voted to repeal its\ngambling law in 1937 until Texas voters\napproved pari-mutuel wagering in 1987,\nthe state was without “the sport of kings.”\n\nFive Class Ii and HI racetracks have\nbeen in operation at one time or another\nsince late 1989, but it is only now that a\nClass I racetrack is set to begin racing.\n\nCeremonies to commemorate the open-\ning are scheduled for noon.

A new “domino theory”\nseems to be valid for the conti-\nnent,\n\nEarlier, fear was widespread in\nthe West that African states could\nfall one after another into the\narms of communists like toppling\ndominoes. Now, according to the\nnew version of the theory, one\nland after another faces the threat\nof falling into anarchy and chaos.\n\nAngola, Liberia, Somalia, south-\nern Sudan and Zaire have long\nago ceased to function as modern\nstates. Now it seems only a ques-\ntion of time before the distur-\nbances spread from Rwanda to\nneighboring Burundi. Sierra Leone\nhas long been suffering from the\noffshoots of the Liberian civil war.\n\nIn other countries, governments\nand armies have lost control over\nlarge areas, such as in the Tuareg\nnomadic regions of Mali and Niger,\nthe rebel areas of Chad or north-\neastern Kenya bordering Somalia.\n\nIn countries like Cameroon,\nCongo, Gabon, Guinea or Togo,\ndemocratic reforms have led to the\ncrumbling of the old stable order.\nThe multiparty political system\nhas opened up old tribal rivalries\ninstead of bringing peace and free-\n\nANALYSIS\n\nreason for entire nations being\ngripped by chaos and anarchy.\nThe real causes are poverty, hun-\nger and the catastrophic economic\nsituations that prevent these\nstates from attaining real democ-\nracy.\n\nWhile other parts of the world .\nmarched towards progress, it has\nbeen a downhill race for the Afri-\ncan economy for years. Ghana\nand Nigeria were richer than\n\nsia in 1965,\n\nNow Far Eastern nations are\ncatching up quickly with Japan\nand Europe, while parts of Africa\nare relapsing into a simple barter\neconomy. With its current eco-\nnomic strategies, Africa hopefully\nwill be able to reach the position it\nhad in the 1970s — in another 40\nyears, according to the World\nBank.\n\nThis lack of perspective has\nbrought forth a generation of re-\nbels in many countries who take\nwhat they need to live at gunpoint.\n\nUnlike the ‘70s, African guerril-\nlas are no longer fighting for free-\ndom or a just society. They’re\npredatory warriors interested only\nin booty and concerned solely\nabout the interests of their fam-\nilies or clans.\n\nThe cry for a new colonialism in\nAfrica has become louder with the\ncollapse of entire states. But\nwhat’s happening is just the oppo-\nsite.\n\nHordes of whites are turning\ntheir backs on Africa. Foreign ad-\nvisers are leaving, and aid is being\nreduced. The case for Africa is\nincreasingly becoming hopeless,\nand the continent is losing its\nstrategic importance.\n\nEven the World Bank and the\nInternational Monetary Fund,\nwhich set the conditions on eco-\nnomic policies for providing aid to ~\nAfrican nations, appear at close\nquarters more like bankruptcy ad-\nministrators than like colonial\n\n",

         " \n\nOccult-crime\n\nexpert shines\nlight on Satanism\n\nThe Toledo Blade\n\nTIFFIN, Ohio — Dale Griffis,\nwho has emerged as one of the\nnation’s leading experts on occult\ncrime, returned home from the\nmost historic case of his career\nwishing there were no need for his\nservices.\n\n“T personally would like to be\nput out of business,” said the\nformer Tiffin police captain, whose\nwork, experts say, has changed the\ncomplexion of occult-related activ-\nity in both the court and class-\nroom.\n\n“Td like to have this whole\nbizarre topic just go away.”\n\nGriffis, who has a degree in\ncriminal justice, appeared on\nABC-TV’s 20/20 in 1985. He now\nis sought as lecturer and expert\nwitness in occult trials across the\ncountry.\n\nLast month, prosecutors in\nJonesboro, Ark., called Griffis as\nan expert witness in a triple-mur-\nder trial that police and prosecu-\ntors believe will redefine the\ncourtroom treatment of occultism.\nGriffis spent seven hours on the\nwitness stand testifying that the\n1993 slaying of three 8-year-old\nboys — whose bodies were found\nnaked, hogtied and battered —\nwere rituals of human sacrifice.\n\nDeputy prosecutor John Fogle-\nman called on Griffis to testify that\nDamien Wayne Echols, 18, and\nCurtis Jason Baldwin, 16, killed\nthe second-graders while enacting\noccult ideology. After leaving\nJonesboro under armed guard,\nGriffis returned home to watch the\nverdicts on television. Echols was\nsentenced to death by injection.\nBaldwin was sentenced to life in\nprison without parole.\n\nIt is frightening, Griffis said, to\nrealize that those who kill under\nthe guise of Satanic ideology do so\nfor greater power and glory in hell.\n\n“In their bizarre belief package,\n\n \n\nthey are carrying these things out\nfor their deity,” he said.\n\nRecently, Griffis held up two\npictures in his home. One shows a\nboy on an autopsy table. The other\nshows his four young grandsons.\n\n“I do it for the kids,” he said\nwith a pained expression.\n\nThe 57-year-old father of two\ngrown daughters and a grown son\nlives in Tiffin with his wife, Anne,\nalthough his new career requires\nhim to travel extensively.\n\nEven before retiring in 1986\nafter 26 years on the Tiffin police\nforce, he researched occult crime.\n\n“I went looking in the major\ncities, trying to understand why\nkids get so caught up in all of\nthis,” he said. “It was scary, but\nnow I know.”\n\nSgt. Dave Spaulding, in charge\nof training sheriff's deputies in\nMontgomery County, Ohio, credits\nGriffis with “bringing credibility to\nthe investigation of occult crime.”\n\n“He started doing his homework\nin the late 1970s, when the rest of\npeople in law enforcement were\npooh-poohing any connection at\nall,” Spaulding said.\n\nPhil Carlo, a researcher who\nhad just spent three weeks behind\nbars with “Night Stalker” Richard\nRamirez — a Texas drifter con-\nvicted of murdering 13 people in\nthe Los Angeles area in the\nmid-1980s —- called Griffis “the\nforemost authority on the phenom-\nenon of occultism, a walking\nencyclopedia.”\n\nProfessor Carl Reschke of the\nUniversity of Denver’s theology\ndepartment said Griffis helped set\na key precedent in the Arkansas\ntrial\n\n“Every effort was made to\ndiscredit him,” Reschke said. “But\nhere at long last is proof positive\nthat satanic crime, occult-moti-\nvated crime, has an ideological\nbonding connection.”\n",

Where there is greenwood, it con-\nsists mostly of dense stands of Mediterra-\nnean pine, imported and planted by the\ngovernment after World War I as a timber\ncash crop.\n\nBut while Sherwood Forest is oniy a thin\nwisp of its medieval past, its scattered\nremnants are at the heart of national de-\nbate over the future of Britain’s public\nforest lands.\n\nPrime Minister John Major’s Conserva-\ntive government is contemplating whether\nto turn over to private investors control of\n4,355 square miles of woodland and heath,\nnearly 5 percent of the nation’s land area.\nThe land is now managed by the Forestry\nCommission, Britain’s largest landowner.\n\nProponents of free-market economics in\nthe Tory government argue that privatiza-\ntion of Britain’s forests, like the earlier\nprivatization of airlines and utilities,\nwould draw fresh investment and help re-\nnew the moribund timber industry.\n\n \n\n \n\nthusiasts has mounted a loud campaign,\nwarning that selling these lands would\nsharply reduce public access to them.\n\n“Now that the coal industry has col-\nlapsed, we view our forests as the heart of\nour county and the key to our future,” said\nGareth Broome, the forestry officer for\nNottinghamshire. ‘We obviously don’t\nwant to see them fall into the hands of pri-\nvate owners more interested in profit than\npublic access.”\n\nFew groups are as organized and vocal\nas Britain’s vast army of hill walkers. hik-\n\n \n\ncountryside.

         "Sex appeal requirement\nfor employment in Russia\n\nBy ALESSANDRA STANLEY\nNew York Times\n\nMOSCOW — The advertisement\nfor a secretary in a Moscow newspa-\n\nr listed computer skills, typing,\n\nnglish and German as necessary\nqualifications. It also specified that\napplicants should be 18 to 25, 5 foot 7\nand have long hair. “There will be a\ncontest,” it said.\n\nThe advertisement was just one of\nscores placed every day that list\nyouth and sex appeal as job require-\nments. It was also among the more\ncourtly. Some Russian employers\ninclude another prerequisite in their\nadvertisements: bez kompleksov, or\n“without inhibitions.” Everyone in\nRussia knows what that means.\n\nIn Moscow’s bustling new business\ncommunity, it is usually not frowned\nupon to grope the secretary, to re-\n\n, quire that the new office manager be\nsingle, Jong-legged and blond, or to\noffer to discuss a filing clerk’s raise\nafter work in a hotel room — and\ndismiss her if she refuses.\n\nSexual harassment in the work-\n‘ place is rampant in today’s Russia,\n- and the sexism that thrived under\n\" the Communists is growing worse,\n- aggravated, feminists say, by the\nnew lawlessness that rules the busi-\n\n_ ness world.\n\n-. The new Russia is known for its\n- ‘violence. There is also a heady sense\n-.of permissiveness fed by porno-\n\ngraphic videos, sexy advertising,\n* nightclubs, casinos, beauty contests,\n- nude pinups and open prostitution.\n\nThis has helped spawn a work-\n‘ place climate of sexual swaggering\nand bullying that is no longer imag-\n‘inable in the United States after\n: figures like Anita Hill and Robert\n. Packwood made the term “sexual\nharassment” part of the national\n_ lexicon.\n\n“Women view their bodies as a\nway of furthering their careers ~\nthat’s just the way it is,” said Igor\n~Bunin, the author of a study on the\n‘new Russian businessmen” pub-\n\n- ‘lished this month. “Sexual harass-\nment is absolutely not a real prob-\n‘lem in Russia.\n\n- “T assure you,” he added, “there is\nho opposition on the part of women\nto this.”\n\n‘. Many women do not see it his way.\nTrina, 23, a graphic designer who did\n\nwitnesses, the city’s health care ad-\nministrators ignored her. Russian\nnewspapers did not cover the case.\nMost in her community told her she\nwas crazy.\n\n“Unfortunately,” Smyshlayeva\nsaid, “around here even husbands\nthink this kind of behavior is nor-\nmal.” But her husband supported\nher, as did the district prosecutor,\nwho opened an investigation in Janu-\nary.\n\nThe case against the doctor was\ndropped before trial, however, under\nthe general amnesty last February\nthat freed Alexander Rutskoi, a\nleader of the October insurrection\nagainst President Boris Yeltsin.\n\nSmyshlayeva remains employed\nby the clinic, as does her former\nsupervisor, although he was sus-\npended from his position as chief.\n\nThe feminist movement in Russia\nremains small, and if anything, it is\nin decline; its few active members\ncomplain that the status of women\nhas only deteriorated since the de-\nmise of Communism.\n\nOn average, women in 1991 earned\n75 percent as much as men, accord-\ning to the Center for Gender Studies\nin Moscow, but now that figure has\ndropped to 40 percent. Unemploy-\nment is three times higher among\nwomen than among men. Though\nthere are no reliable statistics, wom-\nen’s groups say domestic violence is\nsoaring. The first registered rape\nrecovery center and a crisis hot line\nfor abused women recently opened\nin Moscow.\n\nMost Russian men dismiss the\nissue of sexual harassment as yet\nanother silly Western hang-up. Most\nwomen say the problem exists, but\nshrug it off as just another unpleas-\nant fact of life.\n\nThe demeaning jokes and sala-\ncious remarks that are increasingly\nconsidered a form of harassment in\nthe United States are so common-\nplace in Russia that they do not\nregister as harassment.\n\nValentina Konstantinova, a re-\nsearcher at the Center for Gender\nStudies, noted that while in Commu-\nnist times, bosses preyed on employ-\nees with impunity, democracy has\nmainly freed the male libido.\n\n“Before the view of Russian men\nwere as creatures without willpower\nwho drink too much. Now they have\n\nceived many formal complaints.\n“The pay at Western companies is so\nmuch higher,” he said, “that most\nwomen just smile and bear it.”\n\nThere are no feminist newspapers,\nand only one women’s magazine, the\nmonthly, distinctly unglossy Female\nWorker. But a Russian edition of\nCosmopolitan, a magazine known\nmore for advising women on the arts\nof seduction than on how to fight off\nan amorous boss, is scheduled to hit\nthe stands in Russia at the end of the\nmonth.\n\nIts publisher, Derk Sauer, who also\nowns The Moscow Times, described\nhis project as a service to newly\nprosperous Russian women. “The\nmagazine will not just be about\nfashion,” he said. “It’s about relation-\nships and careers and sex.”\n\nAnd sexual mores have changed.\nThere are more and more women,\nfeminists say, who freely trade sex-\nual favors for salary and perks,\nbecause good jobs are scarce and\nemployers can more easily replace\nrecalcitrant or older employees than\nthey could under Communism.\n\nJob seekers who do not wish to\nsleep with their employers attach a\npostscript to their advertisements,\nintim nye prediagat, “no intimate\nrelations.”\n\nThe current hedonism repels Dmi-\ntri Babich, a young reporter for the\ndaily Komsomolskaya Pravda. He\nwas so appalled by a recent televi-\nsion advertisement for office equip-\nment that depicted a secretary lean-\ning over her leering boss, her breasts\nexposed, that he put his phone num-\nber in an article and asked women\nwho had experienced sexual harass-\nment to call.\n\n“A fourth of the calls were from\nmen thinking it was an ad for phone\nsex,” he said.\n\nHis editors were equally confused\nabout the article he planned. “They\nscheduled it for an erotic supple-\nment,” he said.\n\nHe eventually dissuaded them. His\narticle ran last week under the head-\ning, “School of Survival.”\n\nSuch articles are extremely rare\nin the Russian press.\n\n“When I first heard Americans\nusing the expression ‘sexual harass-\nment’ J was utterly baffled — I\nthought it was some kind of custom,\n",

         " \n\nAlien sex? Harvard prot believes it\nExperiences with extraterrestrials real, he says\n\nBy ANNE THOMPSON\nAssociated Press\n\nCAMBRIDGE, Mass. — Dr. John\nMack, a Harvard psychiatrist, has\nnever had sex with a space alien, nor\ndoes he care to. It could compromise\nhis objectivity.\n\nMack, a Pulitzer Prize winner,\nfirmly believes those people who say\nthey had extremely close encounters\nwith beings from other worlds.\n\nAnd in his new book, “Abduc-\ntion,” he relates his findings after\nspending four years studying 120\n“experiencers” — people who say\nthey had sexual or reproductive ex-\nperiences with aliens who abducted\nthem and took them aboard space-\nships.\n\nThe 13 case studies in his book\ninclude Ed, who remembers an alien\nwoman taking a sperm sample from\nhim when he was in high school;\nJerry, who says she gave birth to a\nhuman-alien hybrid; and Peter, who\ntells Mack he had an “alien wife” ina\n“parallel universe.”\n\n“There is a consistent reproduc-\ntive theme,” Mack said. “Now, do I\nmean by that literally there are mil-\nlions of babies being made? I don’t\nknow. I can’t claim that this is occur-\n\nring literally in our physical dimen-\nsion of reality.”\n\nWhat Mack does claim is that\nexperiencers are not mentally ill and\nare not working out the effects of\nrape, incest or other abuse. Their\nemotional and psychological state\nresembles trauma, he said, and trau-\nma is the response to something\noutside the body, not inside the mind.\n\n“They don’t want to believe it any\nmore than we do,” he said. “They\nwant me to find them crazy.”\n\nDescriptions of abductions are\nconsistent from patient to patient,\nMack said. So he believes the exper-\niencers, even if he can’t explain\nexactly what they experienced.\n\nOne of Mack’s patients, a 37-year-\nold undercover debunker, told Time\nmagazine that Mack gave her UFO\nliterature to read before he hypno-\ntized her.\n\n“John made it obvious what he\nwanted to hear,” the patient, Donna\nBassett, said. “I provided the an-\nswers.”\n\nMack could not be located to\nrespond to Bassett’s allegations. He\ndeclined to comment to the magazine\nabout her case.\n\nHis accomplishments include\n\nfounding the psychiatry department\nat the Harvard-affiliated Cambridge\nHospital and winning a 1977 Pulitzer\nfor his psychoanalytic biography of\nT.E. Lawrence (Lawrence of Arabia).\n\nSince then, Mack has developed\nan interest in Eastern philosophy and\nreligion, and believes it helped liber-\nate his thinking.\n\n“We don’t have room in our cul-\nture for this. It’s the elite people, my\ncolleagues, who decide what we're\nsupposed to believe,” he said, “and to\nthem this isn’t supposed to be.”\n\nEven Mack’s fellow researchers\ninto the otherworldly think ‘‘Abduc-\ntion” is a little, well, out there.\n\nDr. William McCall, a physician in\nAnaheim, Calif., said that for 10 years\nhe used hypnosis to evaluate exper-\niencers. His theory: They’re actually\nremembering being born. People’s\nmemories of going aboard spacecraft\nmatch their hypnosis-evoked memo-\nnes of passing through the birth\ncanal, he said.\n\nBudd Hopkins, a pioneer in UFO\nabduction research, said that while\nhe agrees with Mack that these\npeople had sexual encounters with\naliens, he has reservations about\nMack’s counseling of people to see\n\n \n\nDr. John Mack, a Harvard psychi-\natrist, says sexual experiences\nwith extraterrestrials are real.\n\nthe experience as somehow enrich-\ning.

         "‘Countdown to post time\n\nUnbridled enthusiasm to greet opening of Sam Houston Race Park\n\nBy RICH BURK\nHouston Chronicle\n\nFifty-seven years after the closing of\nHouston’s last major horse track and\nseven years after Texas voters approved\n\npari-mutuel wagering, the grand old sport .\n\nof horse racing returns to Houston this\nweek when Sam Houston Race Park opens\nits doors for a 45-day thoroughbred racing\nmeet.\n\nGov. Ann Richards, members of the\nstate racing commission and local officials\nare expected to be among a crowd of about\n15,000 when the racetrack, an $85 million\nfacility in northwest Harris County, begins\n\nracing at 1 p.m. Friday.\n\nFor Texas horse racing fans, it has been\na long time coming. From the time the\nTexas Legislature voted to repeal its\ngambling law in 1937 until Texas voters\napproved pari-mutuel wagering in 1987,\nthe state was without “the sport of kings.”\n\nFive Class If and HI racetracks have\nbeen in operation at one time or another\nsince late 1989, but it is only now that a\nClass I racetrack is set to begin racing.\n\nCeremonies to commemorate the open-\ning are scheduled for noon. Chris Lincoln\nof ESPN’s Racehorse Digest will be the\n\nemcee.\nThere wil! be three stakes races on the\ncard, including the $100,000 Governor's\n\nDay Handicap at a mile and 70 yards. Two\nsix-furlong races, the $25,000-added Mes-\nquite Handicap for Texas-bred colts and\n\neldings, and the $25,000-added Pecan\nHandicap for Texas-bred fillies and mares\nalso will be run on the 10-race card.\n\nRaces will be run at 1 p.m. on both\nSaturday and Sunday before the track\nsettles into its regular schedule next week.\nThe post times then will be 7 p.m. for races\non Tuesday, Thursday and Friday, 3 p.m.\non Wednesday and 1 p.m. on Saturday and\nSunday through the end of the meeting on\nJune 19.\n\nThe track will reopen for a 73-day\nquarter horse race meet on July 1. The\nquarter horse meet ends Sept. 18.\n\nSam Houston Park will not be the city’s\nfirst major horse racetrack. Epsom:\nDowns, on what is now Jensen Drive in\nnortheast Houston, opened on Thanksgiv-\ning Day in 1933 and drew a crowd of more\nthan 25,000. It ran its final race on March\n27, 1937, and never reopened after the state\nLegislature voted to repeal the pari-mu-\ntue] bill it passed in 1933.\n\nEpsom Downs and three other Texas\ntracks of the period -- Arlington Downs in\nArlington, Alamo Downs in San Antonio\nand Fair Park in Dallas — all enjoyed\nsuccess in the short time they were open.\n\n“By 1935 Texas tracks were No. 4 in the\n\nSee TRACK on Page 18A.\n\n \n\nHorse racing,\nback in a big\n\nPark opens it\ntoday is a spe\nrace watchers\n",

         "FCC’s new weapon against radio piracy: ‘computer cars’\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nWASHINGTON -— The radio po-\nlice have a new weapon to fight\npirates of the airways.\n\nThe Federal Communications\nCommission showed off a car\nequipped with two computers, a color\nprinter and a satellite receiver in the\ntrunk. Driven through cities and\nneighborhoods, it can detect unli-\ncensed radio signals and signals that\nmay cause interference.\n\nBy June the FCC will have 10\nsuch cars, each installed with\n$75,000 worth of equipment. The\ncommission would not say which of\nits 35 field offices will be the first to\nreceive the cars.\n\nThe goal is to eventually give\neach field office at least two cars.\nHow soon that happens, Hundt said,\ndepends on Congress.\n\nThe FCC finds about two or three\npirated radio signals a month, ranging\nfrom people trying to operate low-\npower FM radio stations to taxi\ndispatchers. Businesses and boat op-\nerators, however, are the biggest\nculprits, said Steve Svab, a commis-\nsion spokesman.\n\nInside each car is a control station\nbetween the driver and passenger\n\nseats. It features a mobile phone, a\ncomputer keyboard and two small\nscreens: one for computer com-\nmands and the other for display maps\nand other information.\n\nWith the equipment, an FCC\nagent can pick up a radio signal, delve\ninto a data base to find out if it is\nauthorized and pinpoint the location\nof the transmitter.\n\nData can be transmitted from the\ncar to a central location or from one\ncar to another.\n",
