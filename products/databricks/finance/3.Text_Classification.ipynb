The city has been on the hook for $18 million in back-up utility charges since the spill and is trying a new energy delivery strategy: pay for the cost of the backup. In an internal report obtained by WXYZ-TV on Thursday, Energy Management officials were troubled by a decision to leave a gas pipeline running under a bus stop in Midlothian and instead deliver gas to a company called Energy Solutions. There are more than 8,000 residents who depend on this pipeline. On Wednesday, U.S. Sen. David Perdue, R-Ga., called on the EPA to conduct an investigation into why the company chose not to test the gas pipeline under the bus stop, a decision the company says was made solely to keep the company working. The EPA said Thursday that Energy Management is not responsible for the safety of the workers and equipment who were forced to live with the dangers of fuel.

After a brief pause, several major banks began to respond, and these banks appear to be making progress in addressing some of the concerns. As I continue to explore various potential responses to the report, I have found that some of them are making significant efforts toward addressing the data security concerns mentioned in this article. While these improvements are promising, it is also important to understand just how important these initiatives are for maintaining the company's financial security. The following steps represent changes already being taken by the companies concerned, and they are designed to provide more assurance as a matter of public policy.1. Update the Privacy Policy to state that data is encrypted, regardless of where the encryption system is set up2. Make sure there is no direct connection between data that is gathered and a user's identity, and provide for a link to the person at whose expense it is collected, so that this does not lead someone with malicious intent to access information the law requires to protect the integrity of an account.3.
