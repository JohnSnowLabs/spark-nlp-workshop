Background\n","Text classification is the NLP task in charge of retrieving a `category` based on a piece of text you send to the model. A good example of it it's Section or Item identification in Financial Documents.\n","\n","📚There are several ways we can carry out Text Classification:\n","\n","- `At a whole-text level (no splitting)`: That's not feasible for most financial documents. As we already know, we have a token restrictions (512 for most BERT-based thansformers). We can use Longformers (4096), but in most cases, documents as Financial Reports have much more than that, what will go for sure beyond any limitation.\n","\n","- `Retrieving first page`: In most cases, the relevant information of a document is in the first page. Just by splitting by pages and retrieving the first one, you can do text classification. \n","\n","- `At paragraph, section or sentence level using Finance NLP TextSplitter`: `TextSplitter` is an NLP annotator that it's meant to split documents into sentences, but is pretty customisable to retrieve paragraphs or setions as well. It works with `regex` or list of character splitting, among other more complex techniques.\n","\n","- `At paragraph, section or sentence level using NER` for detecting headers and `ChunkSentenceSplitter`\n","\n","The way you split may totally change the results you are getting.

We apply our underlying Intelligent System Design\\u2122 strategy to deliver computational software, hardware and IP that turn design concepts into reality. Our customers include some of the world\\u2019s most innovative companies that deliver extraordinary electronic products from chips to boards to systems for dynamic market applications. \\nWe enable our customers to develop electronic products. Our products and services are designed to give our customers a competitive edge in their development of integrated circuits (\\u201cICs\\u201d), systems-on-chip (\\u201cSoCs\\u201d), and increasingly sophisticated electronic devices and systems. Our products and services do this by optimizing performance, minimizing power consumption, shortening the time to bring our customers\\u2019 products to market, improving engineering productivity and reducing their design, development and manufacturing costs. \\nOur electronic systems customers deliver entire devices, such as smartphones, laptop computers, gaming systems, automobiles and autonomous driving systems, servers, cloud data center infrastructure, artificial intelligence (\\u201cAI\\u201d) systems, aerospace and defense, medical equipment and networking products. These systems companies internally develop, or externally purchase, the sub-components for their products, including printed circuit boards (\\u201cPCBs\\u201d), which interconnect all the hardware components, ICs, which are often referred to as computer chips, and software at various levels which runs on the hardware. Our semiconductor customers deliver ICs, which include subcategories such as processors, SoCs, AI, memory, analog and other types of chips.\\nWe offer software, hardware, services and reusable IC design blocks, which are commonly referred to as intellectual property (\\u201cIP\\u201d). Our semiconductor customers use our offerings to design, configure, analyze and verify ICs. Additionally, customers license our IP, which accelerates their product development processes by providing pre-designed and verified circuit blocks for their ICs. Systems customers use our offerings to design, simulate, and verify the electro-thermal and physical functionality of their ICs, PCBs, and systems products.\\nOur strategy, which we call Intelligent System Design, is to provide the computational software technologies necessary for our electronic system and semiconductor customers to develop products across a variety of vertical markets including consumer, hyperscale computing, mobile, 5G communications, automotive, aerospace and defense, industrial and healthcare. We address the challenges posed by the needs and trends of electronic systems companies as well as semiconductor companies delivering greater portions of these systems. \\nThe development of electronic products, or their sub-components, is complex and requires many engineers using our solutions with specialized knowledge and skill. The rate of technical innovation in electronics is swift, long driven by a concept known as Moore\\u2019s Law, which more than 50 years ago predicted that the complexity of ICs would double approximately every 24 months. In order to make our customers successful, our products must handle this exponential growth rate in complexity, without requiring a corresponding increase in our customers\\u2019 costs. Historically, the industry that provided the tools used by IC engineers was referred to as Electronic Design Automation (\\u201cEDA\\u201d). Today, our offerings include and extend beyond EDA to enable computational software for Intelligent System Design across three layers as illustrated below\\u2014starting with IC and SoC design excellence, followed by system innovation, and then pervasive intelligence.\\n1\\nTable of Contents\\nThe IC and SoC design excellence requires technologies for custom IC, digital IC design and signoff, and functional verification, and leverages pre-built semiconductor IP. These tools, IP and associated services are specifically designed to meet the growing requirements of engineers designing increasingly complex chips across analog, digital and mixed-signal domains, and perform the associated verification tasks, including validation of low-level software running on the silicon model, thereby enabling design teams to manage complexity and verification throughput without commensurately increasing the team size or extending the project schedule, while reducing technical risks.\\nThe second layer of our strategy centers around system innovation. It includes tools and services used for system design of the packages that encapsulate the ICs and the PCBs, system simulation which includes electromagnetic, electro-thermal and other multi-physics analysis necessary as part of optimizing the full system\\u2019s performance, radio frequency (\\u201cRF\\u201d) and microwave systems, and embedded software.\\nThe third layer of our strategy addresses pervasive intelligence in new electronics. It starts with providing solutions and services to develop AI-enhanced systems and includes machine learning and deep learning capabilities being added to the Cadence\\n\\u00ae\\n technology portfolio to make IP and tools more automated and to produce optimized results faster.\\nOur software and emulation products also support cloud access to address the growing computational needs of our customers.\\nRecent Acquisitions\\nDuring fiscal 2021, we continued to execute our Intelligent System Design strategy and expanded our product offerings and solutions into computational fluid dynamics (\\u201cCFD\\u201d) with our acquisitions of Belgium-based NUMECA International, a leader in CFD technology, and Pointwise, Inc, a leading provider of CFD meshing technology. The addition of these technologies and talent broadens our System Design and Analysis portfolio and expertise. \\nChief Executive Officer Transition\\nOn December 15, 2021, Anirudh Devgan assumed the role of President and Chief Executive Officer of Cadence, replacing Lip-Bu Tan. Prior to his role as Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Devgan served as President of Cadence. Concurrently, Mr. Tan transitioned to the role of Executive Chair.\\n2\\nTable of Contents\\nBusiness Drivers\\nOur products and services enable our customers to design complex and innovative electronic products that are accelerated by the growing digital transformation. Demand for our technology and expertise is driven by increasing complexity and our customers\\u2019 investment in new designs and products. The most promising new opportunities for us involve enabling the design of electronic systems for consumers, including augmented reality (\\u201cAR\\u201d), virtual reality (\\u201cVR\\u201d), and industrial internet of things (\\u201cIIoT\\u201d), hyperscale computing (including data center infrastructure), AI, edge computing, mobile, communications (including 5G networks), automotive, aerospace and defense, and industrial and healthcare subsystems. Large and existing electronics categories, such as data center infrastructure, mobile, smartphones and networking products continue to provide business opportunities for us as customers initiate new design projects.\\nUnderlying the requirements within any particular vertical market sector is the availability of rapidly improving IC manufacturing technology. In order for our customers to take advantage of such advancements, some of our products need to first incorporate new capabilities such that they can exploit new manufacturing capabilities. This dependency means that we must invest significantly in product research and development (\\u201cR&amp;D\\u201d) to keep pace with the latest manufacturing technology. The demand for new IC manufacturing technology directly impacts the demand for our newest products.\\nAnother driver for our business is the differentiation, capabilities and benefits provided to our customers by our products. With the rapid pace of innovation comes the opportunity for our products to address growing key challenges associated with electronic product creation, such as power consumption, performance, chip area and cost. Our products and services have unique attributes that our customers value. In general, these attributes can be grouped into broader categories such as quality of results (\\u201cQoR\\u201d) (in terms of power consumption, performance and chip area), engineering productivity, tool performance, manufacturing, reliability, and faster time to market. Many of these attributes contribute to the sustainability of our planet by enabling our customers to create innovative products that optimize power, space and energy needs. We are applying machine learning or computational software techniques within our products to enhance QoR, productivity, performance, manufacturing, reliability and methodology.\\nProducts and Product Strategy\\nOur Intelligent System Design strategy enables our customers to address a broad range of challenges that arise as they develop electronic products. Our solutions are categorized according to the role they play in the electronic product design process. We group our products into categories related to major design activities, including Custom IC Design and Simulation, Digital IC Design and Signoff, Functional Verification, IP, and System Design and Analysis.\\nCustom IC Design and Simulation\\nOur custom IC design and simulation offerings are used by our customers to create schematic and physical representations of circuits down to the transistor level for analog, mixed-signal, custom digital, memory and RF designs. These representations are verified using simulation tools optimized for each type of design, including the design capture environment, simulation and IC layout within the Virtuoso\\n\\u00ae\\n custom IC design platform. Other tools in the custom IC portfolio are used to prepare the designs for manufacturing.\\nThe Virtuoso Advanced-Node Platform adds functionality to the base Virtuoso package to enable the use of three-dimensional transistors (\\u201cFinFETs\\u201d), multi-patterning and other technologies required for advanced designs. The Virtuoso RF Solution addresses the challenges of RF design across chip, package and board. The Spectre\\n\\u00ae\\n Simulation Platform provides large-scale verification simulation. The Virtuoso System Design Platform enables engineers to design and verify concurrently across the chip, package and board. \\nDigital IC Design and Signoff\\nOur digital IC design and signoff solutions are used to create logical representations of a digital circuit or an IC that can be verified for correctness prior to implementation (please refer to the discussion under \\u201cFunctional Verification\\u201d below). Once the logic is verified, the design representation is implemented, or converted to a format ready for silicon manufacturing, using additional software tools within this category. The manufacturing representation is also analyzed and verified. Our digital IC design and signoff technology suite provides a full flow to achieve power, performance and area (\\u201cPPA\\u201d) design targets, and includes three major categories: logic design, physical implementation and signoff.\\nOur logic design offering is comprised of logic synthesis, test and equivalence checking capabilities and is typically used by customers to create and verify designs in conjunction with our functional verification capabilities. The offering includes the Genus\\n\\u2122\\n Synthesis Solution, a logic synthesis offering that provides fast throughput while also offering high quality results, and the Joules\\n\\u2122\\n RTL Power Solution, which delivers fast power analysis while preserving near-signoff accuracy. We also offer the Modus software solution, which reduces SoC design-for-test time.\\nOur physical implementation offering comprises tools used near the end of the design process, including place and route, optimization and multi-patterning preparation. The Innovus\\n\\u2122\\n Implementation System is a physical implementation offering that delivers fast design turnaround time while also delivering improved PPA characteristics. This offering enables customers to address the technology challenges of the latest semiconductor advanced-process nodes, create a physical representation of logic models and prepare a design for signoff.\\n3\\nTable of Contents\\nOur signoff offering is comprised of tools used to sign off the design as ready for manufacture by a semiconductor foundry, which provides certification for this step. This offering includes the Tempus\\n\\u2122\\n Timing Signoff Solution, Voltus\\n\\u2122\\n Power Integrity Solution, Quantus\\n\\u2122\\n Extraction Solution and Pegasus\\n\\u2122\\n Physical Verification System. Our design-for-manufacturing products are also included in our signoff offering and are used by customers to address manufacturing and yield issues as early in the product development process as possible.\\nFunctional Verification\\nFunctional verification products are used by our customers to effectively and efficiently verify that the circuitry or the software they have designed is consistent with the functional specification. Verification is largely done throughout the design process, with the objective of identifying as many potential functional problems as possible before manufacturing the circuitry, thereby significantly reducing the risk of discovering a costly error in the completed product. \\nOur Verification Suite\\n\\u2122\\n includes four primary verification engines, starting with the JasperGold\\n\\u00ae\\n Formal Verification Platform and Xcelium\\n\\u2122\\n Parallel Logic Simulation Platform, which are used in the early stages of design verification, often at the IP and subsystem level. Once the design is more mature, with early formal and simulation verification tasks performed, verification engineers deploy our Palladium\\n\\u00ae\\n Enterprise Emulation Platform and Protium\\n\\u2122\\n FPGA-Based Prototyping Platforms for more comprehensive chip verification, often running low-level embedded software on top of a model of the chip, to provide for proper functionality before silicon manufacturing.\\nThese engines are used for early bug detection, verification of block-level functionality, verification acceleration and emulation of system-level functionality, system-level power exploration, analysis and optimization, and system-level prototyping for hardware/software co-verification. Our Palladium platform provides high throughput, capacity, data center reliability and workgroup productivity to enable global design teams to develop advanced hardware-software systems. The Protium platform leverages a common front end with the Palladium environment to move designs rapidly from emulation to the prototyping stage, allowing for software development to start weeks to months earlier than otherwise possible.\\nThese engines are also supported by other verification tools that provide an environment that allows for effective verification throughput and management, including verification planning and metric tracking, testbench automation, debugging and software-driven tests, enabling our customers to coordinate verification activities across multiple verification engines, teams and locations for effective verification closure.\\nIP\\nOur IP offerings consist of pre-verified, customizable functional blocks, which customers integrate into their ICs to accelerate the development process and to reduce the risk of errors in the design process. We offer many types of IP, including Tensilica\\n\\u00ae\\n configurable digital signal processors (\\u201cDSPs\\u201d), vertically targeted subsystems for AI, audio/voice, baseband and vision/imaging applications, controllers and physical interfaces for standard protocols and analog IP. Our design IP portfolio also includes solutions for high speed SerDes, PCI, USB and many other standards.\\nWe also offer a broad range of Verification IP (\\u201cVIP\\u201d) with memory models, which model the expected behavior of many industry standard protocols when used with verification solutions and are complementary to our design IP offerings. Our VIP and accelerated VIP are used with our full suite of functional verification engines to emulate and model the expected behavior and interaction of standard industry system interface protocols including DDR, USB, and PCI Express\\n\\u00ae\\n in silicon. Our customers also use our System VIP offerings to perform full system-level chip verification.\\nSystem Design and Analysis\\nOur system design and analysis offerings are used by our customers to develop PCBs and advanced IC packages and to analyze electromagnetic, electro-thermal and other multi-physics effects.\\nThe capabilities in the Allegro\\n\\u00ae\\n System Design Platform include PCB authoring and implementation, IC package and system-in-package design, signal and power integrity analysis, and PCB library design management and collaboration. The need for compact, high-performance mobile, consumer and automotive design with advanced serial interconnect is driving the technology evolution for our PCB offerings. For mainstream PCB customers, where individual or small team productivity is a focus, we provide the OrCAD\\n\\u00ae\\n family of offerings that is primarily marketed worldwide through a network of resellers.\\nThe speed and close proximity of signals on silicon, through packages to boards, and through connectors and cables, exposes these communications to various kinds of interference, generates heat and emits electromagnetic radiation. Careful analysis is required for these systems to work as designed under a wide range of operating conditions and within compliance of standards and laws. The complexity of these devices and signal transmissions requires analysis and simulation throughout the product lifecycle to meet these objectives. Our Clarity\\n\\u2122\\n 3D Solver for electromagnetic and power electronics analysis and simulation, as well as our Celsius\\n\\u2122\\n Thermal Solver, provide the foundation for multi-physics analysis technology, with complete electrical-thermal co-simulation for electronic systems from ICs to physical enclosures. \\nThe addition of our CFD solution expands our ability to meet the growing design challenges of electronic and systems companies. Our CFD solution enables our customers to extend their multi-physics analysis workflows to address simulation and analysis challenges for applications such as aerodynamics, hydrodynamics, propulsion, heat transfer, and combustion.\\n4\\nTable of Contents\\nProduct Arrangements\\nWe primarily license our software using time-based licenses. Our time-based license arrangements offer customers the right to access and use all of the products delivered at the outset of an arrangement and updates throughout the entire term of the arrangement, which is generally two to three years, with no rights to return. Our updates provide for continued access to our evolving technology as our customers\\u2019 designs migrate to more advanced nodes. In addition, certain time-based license arrangements include the right for the customer to remix among the products delivered at the outset of the arrangement and use unspecified additional products that become commercially available during the term of the arrangement.\\nA small portion of our software is licensed under perpetual licenses, which does not include the right to use new technology. Payment terms for time-based licenses generally provide for payments to be made over the license period, and payment terms for perpetual licenses generally are net 30 days.\\nThe Cadence Cloud portfolio, consisting of Cadence-managed and customer-managed environments for electronic product developers using the scalability of the cloud, continues to expand, with additional cloud-ready products added or under development in fiscal 2021. Contractual arrangements with customers for both environments are time-based, similar to the on-premises software license arrangements described above, and may also include usage-based terms. \\nOur emulation and prototyping hardware products are either sold or leased to our customers. Our emulation hardware can also be accessed remotely via a Cadence-managed cloud arrangement.\\nWe generally license our design IP under nonexclusive license agreements that provide usage rights for specific designs. Some customers enter into a non-cancellable IP Access Agreement (\\u201cIPAA\\u201d), whereby the customer commits to a fixed dollar amount over a specified period of time that can be used to purchase from a list of IP products or services. In addition, for certain IP license agreements, we collect royalties as our customers ship their product that includes our IP to their customers.\\nFor a further description of our license agreements, our emulation and prototyping hardware sale or lease agreements, revenue recognition policies and results of operations, please refer to the discussion under \\u201cCritical Accounting Estimates\\u201d under Part II, Item 7, \\u201cManagement\\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\\u201d\\nTechnical Support and Maintenance\\nCustomer service and support is critical to the adoption and successful use of our products. We provide our customers with technical support and maintenance to facilitate their use of our software, hardware and IP solutions.\\nOur education services offerings can be customized and include training programs that are delivered online, app-based, or in a classroom setting. The content of these offerings ranges from the latest design techniques to methodologies for using the most recent features of our products. The primary focus of education services is to accelerate our customers\\u2019 path to productivity in the use of our products.\\nOur Learning and Support System gives customers easy access to extensive online training and webinar offerings to support the increase in the number of our customers\\u2019 employees working from home.\\nServices\\nWe offer a number of services, including services related to methodology, education and hosted design solutions. These services may be sold separately or sold and performed in conjunction with the license, sale or lease of our products. As necessary, specialized design services engineers are assigned to internal R&amp;D projects associated with our design IP business. \\nAs part of our services offerings, we design advanced ICs, develop custom IP and help customers address design challenges. This enables us to target and accelerate the development of new software technology and products to satisfy current and future design requirements. \\nWe offer engineering services to collaborate with our customers in the design of complex ICs and the implementation of key design capabilities, including low power design, IC packaging and board design, functional verification, digital implementation, analog/mixed-signal design and system-level design. The customers for these services primarily consist of semiconductor and systems companies developing products for the consumer, hyperscale computing, 5G communications, mobile automotive, aerospace and defense, industrial and healthcare verticals. These ICs range from digital SoCs and analog and RF designs to complex mixed-signal ICs. \\nIn delivering methodology services, we leverage our experience and knowledge of design techniques, our products, leading practices and different design environments to improve the productivity of our customers\\u2019 engineering teams. Depending on the customers\\u2019 projects and needs, we work with customers using outsourced, consultative and collaborative offerings.\\nThird-Party Programs and Initiatives\\nIn addition to our products, many customers use design tools that are provided by other companies, as well as design IP available from alternative suppliers. We support the use of third-party design products and design IP through our Cadence Connections\\n\\u00ae\\n program and through our participation in industry groups such as the Silicon Integration Initiative and Accellera System Initiative. We actively contribute to the development and deployment of industry standards.\\n5\\nTable of Contents\\nWe also have a strategic partnership with Green Hills Software, an industry leader in embedded safety and security software solutions.\\nProduct and Maintenance and Services Revenue\\nRevenue, and revenue as a percentage of total revenue, from our product and maintenance and services offerings for the last three fiscal years were as follows:\\n2021\\n2020\\n2019\\n(In millions, except percentages)\\nProduct and maintenance\\n$\\n2,813 \\n94 \\n%\\n$\\n2,537 \\n95 \\n%\\n$\\n2,204 \\n94 \\n%\\nServices\\n175 \\n6 \\n%\\n146 \\n5 \\n%\\n132 \\n6 \\n%\\nTotal revenue\\n$\\n2,988 \\n$\\n2,683 \\n$\\n2,336 \\nIn any fiscal year, we expect between 85% and 90% of our annual revenue to be characterized as recurring revenue. Revenue characterized as recurring includes revenue recognized over time from our software arrangements, services, royalties, maintenance on IP licenses and hardware, operating leases of hardware and revenue recognized at varying points in time over the term of our IP Access Agreements that include non-cancellable commitments from customers. \\nThe remainder of our revenue is recognized at a point in time and is characterized as up-front revenue. Up-front revenue is primarily generated by our sales of emulation and prototyping hardware and individual IP licenses. The percentage of our recurring and up-front revenue and fluctuations in revenue within our geographies are impacted by delivery of hardware and IP products to our customers in any single fiscal period.\\nFor additional information and analysis on our revenue, including revenue by geography, see the discussion under \\u201cResults of Operations\\u201d under Part II, Item 7, \\u201cManagement\\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\\u201d For our fiscal 2021 results of operations and our financial position as of January 1, 2022, see Part IV, Item 15, \\u201cExhibits and Financial Statement Schedules.\\u201d\\nRemaining Performance Obligations\\nRevenue allocated to remaining performance obligations represents the transaction price allocated to the performance obligations that are unsatisfied, or partially unsatisfied, which includes unearned revenue and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods. We have elected to exclude the potential future royalty receipts from the remaining performance obligations. Contracted but unsatisfied performance obligations were approximately $4.4 billion as of January 1, 2022, which included $119.5 million of non-cancellable IPAA commitments from customers where actual product selection and quantities of specific products or services are to be determined by customers at a later date. As of January 1, 2022, we expected to recognize approximately 55% of the contracted but unsatisfied performance obligations, excluding non-cancellable IPAA commitments, as revenue over the next 12 months and the remainder thereafter.\\nMarketing and Sales\\nWe generally market our products and provide services to existing and prospective customers through a direct sales force consisting of sales people and applications engineers. Applications engineers provide technical pre-sales and post-sales support for our products. Due to the complexity of many of our products and the system design process, the sales cycle is generally long, requiring three to six months or more. During the sales cycle, our direct sales force generally provides technical presentations, product demonstrations and support for on-site customer evaluation of our solutions. We also promote our products and services through advertising, marketing automation, trade shows, public relations and the internet. We selectively utilize value-added resellers to broaden our reach and reduce cost of sales. Our OrCAD products and certain Allegro products are primarily marketed through these channels. With respect to international sales, we generally market and support our products and services through our subsidiaries. We also use a third-party distributor to license our products and services to certain customers in Japan.\\nResearch and Development    \\nOur future performance depends on our ability to innovate, commercialize newly developed solutions and enhance and maintain our current products. The primary areas of our R&amp;D align with our product categories discussed above. We must continuously adapt our products to solve new or increased physics challenges that arise with each successive process node and address the increase in complexity that is introduced by the resulting much larger designs. We must also keep pace with our customers\\u2019 technical developments, satisfy industry standards and meet our customers\\u2019 increasingly demanding performance, productivity, quality and predictability requirements. Therefore, we expect to continue to invest in R&amp;D.\\nHardware Manufacturing and Software Distribution\\nOur emulation and prototyping hardware, including all individual PCBs, custom ICs and FPGA-based prototyping components, is manufactured, assembled and tested by subcontractors before delivery to our customers. Software and documentation are primarily distributed to customers by secure electronic delivery. \\n6\\nTable of Contents\\nProprietary Technology\\nOur success depends, in part, upon our proprietary technology. We generally rely on patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secret laws, licenses and restrictive agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights in technology and products. Many of our products include software or other IP licensed from third parties. We may have to seek new licenses or renew existing licenses for third-party software and other IP in the future. As part of performing engineering services for customers, our engineering services business uses certain software and other IP licensed from third parties, including that of our competitors.\\nGovernmental Regulations\\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to our business and operations. These include, but are not limited to, laws and regulations related to import and export controls, anti-corruption, competition, data privacy, and employment. For example, we are subject to the regulations of the United States and certain other jurisdictions in selling or shipping our products and technology outside the United States and to foreign nationals, including tariffs, trade protection measures, import or export licensing requirements, sanctions and other trade regulations, such as the U.S. Export Administration Regulations including \\u201cEntity List\\u201d restrictions imposed by the Bureau of Industry and Security (\\u201cBIS\\u201d) of the U.S. Department of Commerce (\\u201cDOC\\u201d). Import/export regulations limiting or banning sales into certain countries or to certain companies have impacted our ability to transact business in certain countries and with certain customers. Future export regulations may also impact our ability to transact business with certain customers and in certain countries and may restrict certain non-U.S. person employees from performing their duties at Cadence without first obtaining appropriate authorization if their duties involve an export, reexport, or transfer of export-controlled technology. In addition, as a result of our international operations, we are subject to laws and regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and other local laws, prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, as well as anti-competition regulations. We are also subject to laws and regulations governing data privacy in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (\\u201cGDPR\\u201d) in the European Union.\\nThese laws and regulations are complex and may change or develop over time, sometimes with limited notice. We may incur significant expenditures in future periods related to compliance, which could restrict our business operations. For more information on risks related to these regulations, see the relevant discussions throughout Item 1A, \\&#34;Risk Factors.\\&#34;\\nCompetition\\nWe compete most frequently with Synopsys, Inc., Siemens EDA, and ANSYS, Inc., and also with numerous other tools providers, electronics device manufacturers with their own EDA capabilities, technical or computational software companies, electronics design and consulting companies, and other IP companies. These include U.S. based companies such as Keysight Technologies, Inc. and CEVA, Inc., and foreign companies such as Altium Limited (Australia), Zuken Ltd. (Japan), and emerging competitors in China like Huada Empyrean, Xpeedic, X-EPIC, Primarius Technologies and Giga-DA.\\nCertain competitive factors in the engineering services business differ from those of the products businesses. While we compete with other computational software companies in the engineering services business, our principal competitors include independent engineering service businesses. Many of these companies are also customers, and therefore use our product offerings in the delivery of their services or products.\\nFor more information on risks related to competitive factors affecting our business, see the relevant discussions throughout Item 1A, \\u201cRisk Factors.\\u201d\\nHuman Capital Resource Management\\nOur future success is inextricably linked to our ability to attract, retain and develop exceptional talent globally. To facilitate talent attraction and retention, we invest in key initiatives including, but not limited to, furthering diversity, equity and inclusion, physical and mental health, and talent development. To measure engagement and collect feedback from our employees, we administer regular employee engagement surveys. Our cultural tenet is \\u201cOne Team \\u2013 One Cadence.\\u201d This culture-first message underpins our belief that a diverse, highly supported and engaged workforce is critical to the foundation of our business success.\\nEmployees\\nOur employees represent the best and brightest in our industry, and the talent we select to be a part of our team defines our culture and success. As of January 1, 2022, we had approximately 9,300 employees. Our global workforce is highly educated, technical and specialized, with a substantial majority of employees working in technical roles.\\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion \\nWe believe that workforce diversity, equity and inclusion advance high performance and innovation. We recognize that gender and racial disparities remain a challenge in the technology field, and with a high proportion of technical employees, we are deeply committed to addressing this issue and have appointed executive sponsors to drive this commitment throughout our company. Some of our key programs and initiatives aimed at addressing this issue include:\\n\\u2022\\nRegular monitoring of the diversity of our current workforce and candidate pool, with an aim to identify and address areas where we can improve.\\n7\\nTable of Contents\\n\\u2022\\nPartnerships with organizations such as National Society of Black Engineers, Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers, Out in Tech, National GEM Consortium, and Society of Women Engineers to advance our inclusion efforts. These partnerships allow us to do more targeted recruiting, outreach and engagement with these communities. \\n\\u2022\\nAn Advanced Leadership Program for top women, Black and Latinx talent, which provides specialized coaching, workshops and career opportunities.\\n\\u2022\\nAn IMPACT mentorship program which gives women, U.S. Black and Latinx employees an opportunity to choose a meaningful mentor.\\n\\u2022\\nUnconscious bias and inclusive leadership training and resources for managers. \\n\\u2022\\nInclusion groups for Black, Latinx, LGBTQ+, Veterans and women employees and allies which host networking events to foster dialogue and promote awareness. \\nHealth, Safety and Wellness\\nWe strive to create a safe and rewarding environment to enable our employees to develop the innovations necessary for our sustained success. \\nTo provide for both the physical and mental health of our employees, we offer a variety of benefits that go beyond traditional health insurance. Our U.S. health and well-being benefits include fertility benefits, coverage for transgender employees undergoing medical treatment, expanded new parent leave, adoption and surrogacy benefits, financial planning and coaching services, and legal services. We also provide training and tools for stress management, time management, conflict resolution and emotional well-being.\\nThe vast majority of our employees continued to work from home during fiscal 2021. To promote health and well-being during the challenges brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, we provided employees with additional time off to focus on themselves and their families and provided global employee assistance programs to connect employees and their families with resources, information and counseling to address the challenges caused by the pandemic, such as increased anxiety or stress. \\nCompensation and Benefits\\nTo inspire and recognize our employees, we offer competitive compensation and benefits programs. Our compensation programs link employee compensation to our business and individual performance. We also offer a semi-annual bonus program, 401(k) match, Employee Stock Purchase Plan and equity compensation. In addition, our employees are eligible to receive monetary awards from their colleagues through our peer-to-peer recognition program.\\nTalent Development\\nTo help employees succeed in their current roles, pursue their passions and develop the skills necessary for advancement, we provide formal training programs and curriculums in addition to on-the-job training. Our High-Performance Culture portal provides our employees with valuable resources such as a comprehensive online Learning Management program with training and development tools on a broad range of topics and skills. We also offer tuition reimbursement opportunities to employees continuing in fields relevant to their job. \\nCommunity Outreach\\nWe believe it is important that we create meaningful opportunities for employees to connect and contribute to their community. We provide opportunities for paid volunteer time off annually, charitable contribution matching, company-wide volunteer campaigns and international service immersion projects.\\nDuring fiscal 2021, we formed the Cadence Giving Foundation with the goal of giving back to the communities where we live and work. This stand-alone, non-profit foundation will partner with other charitable initiatives to support critical needs in areas such as diversity, equity and inclusion, environmental sustainability and science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (\\u201cSTEM\\u201d) education.\\nCorporate Responsibility\\nWe believe that, in general, the best and brightest talent is inclined to build a career with a responsible organization that positively impacts society. Among our efforts to be that type of organization, we recognize that climate change is one of the greatest challenges of our time, and we are committed to doing our part to contribute to the health of the planet by actively investing in initiatives to reduce our environmental footprint. Through these initiatives, we plan to reduce our scope 1 and scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions 25% by 2025, over our 2019 baseline. We encourage you to review our 2020 Sustainability Report (located at www.cadence.com), and our 2021 Sustainability Report when released, for more information on all of our Environmental, Social and Governance (\\u201cESG\\u201d) initiatives.\\n8\\nTable of Contents\\nCorporate Information\\nOur headquarters is located at 2655 Seely Avenue, San Jose, California 95134.

Fiscal 2021 was a 52-week fiscal year, compared to 2020, which was a 53-week fiscal year.\\n9\\nTable of Contents\\nINFORMATION ABOUT OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS \\nThe following table provides information regarding our executive officers as of February 22, 2022:\\nName\\nAge\\nPositions and Offices\\nAnirudh Devgan\\n52\\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\\nJohn M. Wall\\n51\\nSenior Vice President and Chief Financia\n*** WARNING: skipped 636908 bytes of output ***\n\n        &#34;The fair value for acquired agreements and relationships was determined by using the multi-period excess earnings method. This method reflects the present value of the projected cash flows that are expected to be generated from existing customers, less charges representing the contribution of other assets to those cash flows. Projected income from existing customer relationships considered customer retention rates ranging between 85% and 95%. The present value of operating cash flows from existing customers was determined using discount rates 10% and 11.5%.\\nCadence also assumed obligations related to deferred revenue of $6.9 million during fiscal 2020 with its acquisition of AWR. The fair value of these obligations was estimated using the cost build-up approach. The cost build-up approach determines fair value using estimates of the costs required to fulfill the contracted obligations plus an assumed profit margin, which approximates the amount that AWR would be required to pay a third party to assume the obligation.\\nCadence believes that its estimates and assumptions related to the fair value of its acquired intangible assets and assumed liabilities are reasonable, but significant judgment is involved.\\nNOTE 16. RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER CHARGES\\nCadence has initiated restructuring plans, most recently in fiscal 2020, in an effort to better align its resources with its business strategy. The charges associated with these restructuring plans have primarily been comprised of severance payments and termination benefits related to headcount reductions and charges related to impacted facilities and are included in restructuring and other charges on Cadence\\u2019s consolidated income statements.\\nThe following table presents activity for Cadence\\u2019s restructuring plans during fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019:\\nSeverance\\nand\\nBenefits\\nExcess\\nFacilities\\nTotal\\n(In thousands)\\nBalance, December 29, 2018\\n$\\n11,176 \\n$\\n848 \\n$\\n12,024 \\nRestructuring\\n8,649 \\n(28)\\n8,621 \\nCash payments\\n(10,714)\\n(420)\\n(11,134)\\nEffect of foreign currency translation\\n118 \\n9 \\n127 \\nBalance, December 28, 2019\\n$\\n9,229 \\n$\\n409 \\n$\\n9,638 \\nRestructuring \\n7,476 \\n1,739 \\n9,215 \\nCash payments\\n(9,424)\\n(773)\\n(10,197)\\nEffect of foreign currency translation\\n40 \\n(3)\\n37 \\nBalance, January 2, 2021\\n$\\n7,321 \\n$\\n1,372 \\n$\\n8,693 \\nRestructuring \\n(1,480)\\n432 \\n(1,048)\\nCash payments\\n(5,774)\\n(1,761)\\n(7,535)\\nEffect of foreign currency translation\\n(67)\\n\\u2014 \\n(67)\\nBalance, January 1, 2022\\n$\\n\\u2014 \\n$\\n43 \\n$\\n43 \\nAll remaining liabilities for Cadence\\u2019s restructuring plans represent liabilities from vacated facilities and are included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities on Cadence\\u2019s consolidated balance sheet as of January 1, 2022. Restructuring liabilities included in other long-term liabilities represent liabilities from vacated facilities, and Cadence expects to make cash payments to settle these liabilities through fiscal 2022.\\nOther Termination Benefits\\nDuring the second quarter of fiscal 2021, Cadence offered a voluntary retirement program to eligible employees in the United States. This program resulted in a one-time charge of $26.8 million for voluntary termination and post-employment benefits. These charges are included in each category of costs and expenses on Cadence\\u2019s consolidated income statements. As of January 1, 2022, liabilities related to the voluntary retirement program were $17.5 million and were included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities on Cadence\\u2019s consolidated balance sheet. Cadence expects to make cash payments to settle these liabilities through fiscal 2023, including $17.0 million that is expected to be paid within the next twelve months.\\n79&#34;,\n        &#34;NOTE 17. OTHER INCOME, NET\\nCadence\\u2019s other income, net, for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019 was as follows:\\n \\n2021\\n2020\\n2019\\n \\n(In thousands)\\nInterest income\\n$\\n2,634 \\n$\\n3,817 \\n$\\n9,509 \\nGains (losses) on marketable equity investments\\n1,504 \\n(148)\\n713 \\nLosses on non-marketable equity investments\\n(924)\\n(4,806)\\n(4,802)\\nGains on securities in NQDC trust\\n6,163 \\n4,881 \\n5,402 \\nGains (losses) on foreign exchange\\n(2,789)\\n4,429 \\n(4,111)\\nOther expense, net\\n(262)\\n(228)\\n(710)\\nTotal other income, net\\n$\\n6,326 \\n$\\n7,945 \\n$\\n6,001 \\nNOTE 18. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\\nPurchase Obligations\\nCadence had purchase obligations of $62.4 million as of January 1, 2022 that were associated with agreements or commitments for purchases of goods or services. Cadence expects to settle $50.9 million of these obligations within the next 12 months.\\nLegal Proceedings\\nFrom time to time, Cadence is involved in various disputes and litigation that arise in the ordinary course of business. These include disputes and legal proceedings related to intellectual property, indemnification obligations, mergers and acquisitions, licensing, contracts, customers, products, distribution and other commercial arrangements and employee relations matters. At least quarterly, Cadence reviews the status of each significant matter and assesses its potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount or the range of loss can be estimated, Cadence accrues a liability for the estimated loss. Legal proceedings are subject to uncertainties, and the outcomes are difficult to predict. Because of such uncertainties, accruals are based on Cadence\\u2019s judgments using the best information available at the time. As additional information becomes available, Cadence reassesses the potential liability related to pending claims and litigation matters and may revise estimates.\\n \\nOther Contingencies\\nCadence provides its customers with a warranty on sales of hardware products, generally for a 90-day period. Cadence did not incur any significant costs related to warranty obligations during fiscal 2021, 2020 or 2019.\\nCadence\\u2019s product license and services agreements typically include a limited indemnification provision for claims from third parties relating to Cadence\\u2019s intellectual property. If the potential loss from any indemnification claim is considered probable and the amount or the range of loss can be estimated, Cadence accrues a liability for the estimated loss. The indemnification is generally limited to the amount paid by the customer. Cadence did not incur any significant losses from indemnification claims during fiscal 2021, 2020 or 2019.\\nNOTE 19. EMPLOYEE AND DIRECTOR BENEFIT PLANS\\nCadence maintains various defined contribution plans for its eligible U.S. and non-U.S. employees. For employees in the United States, Cadence maintains a 401(k) savings plan to provide retirement benefits through tax-deferred salary deductions and may make discretionary contributions, as determined by the Board of Directors, which cannot exceed a specified percentage of the annual aggregate salaries of those employees eligible to participate. Cadence\\u2019s total contributions made to these plans during fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019 were as follows:\\n2021\\n2020\\n2019\\n(In thousands)\\nContributions to defined contribution plans\\n$\\n33,029 \\n$\\n27,152 \\n$\\n25,269 \\nExecutive Officers and Directors may also elect to defer compensation payable to them under Cadence\\u2019s NQDC. Deferred compensation payments are held in investment accounts and the values of the accounts are adjusted each quarter based on the fair value of the investments held in the NQDC. These investments are classified in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets and gains and losses are recognized as other income, net in the consolidated income statements.\\n80&#34;,\n        &#34;Certain of Cadence\\u2019s international subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit retirement plans. The unfunded projected benefit obligation for Cadence\\u2019s defined benefit retirement plans is recorded in other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\\nNOTE 20. ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS\\nCadence\\u2019s accumulated other comprehensive loss is comprised of the aggregate impact of foreign currency translation gains and losses and changes in defined benefit plan liabilities and is presented in Cadence\\u2019s consolidated statements of comprehensive income.\\nAccumulated other comprehensive loss was comprised of the following as of January 1, 2022, and January 2, 2021:\\nAs of\\nJanuary 1,2022\\nJanuary 2,2021\\n \\n(In thousands)\\nForeign currency translation loss\\n$\\n(26,553)\\n$\\n(11,130)\\nChanges in defined benefit plan liabilities\\n(6,758)\\n(6,295)\\nTotal accumulated other comprehensive loss\\n$\\n(33,311)\\n$\\n(17,425)\\nFor fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, there were no significant amounts related to foreign currency translation loss or changes in defined benefit plan liabilities reclassified to net income from accumulated other comprehensive loss. \\nNOTE 21. SEGMENT REPORTING\\nSegment reporting is based on the \\u201cmanagement approach,\\u201d following the method that management organizes the company\\u2019s reportable segments for which separate financial information is made available to, and evaluated regularly by, the chief operating decision maker in allocating resources and in assessing performance. Cadence\\u2019s chief operating decision maker is its CEO, who reviews Cadence\\u2019s consolidated results as one operating segment. In making operating decisions, the CEO primarily considers consolidated financial information, accompanied by disaggregated information about revenues by geographic region.\\nOutside the United States, Cadence markets and supports its products and services primarily through its subsidiaries. Revenue is attributed to geography based upon the country in which the product is used, or services are delivered. Property, plant and equipment is attributed to geography based on the country where the assets are located.\\nThe following table presents a summary of revenue by geography for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019:\\n \\n2021\\n2020\\n2019\\n \\n(In thousands)\\nAmericas:\\nUnited States\\n$\\n1,292,980 \\n$\\n1,096,263 \\n$\\n982,380 \\nOther Americas\\n42,141 \\n43,652 \\n43,473 \\nTotal

We apply our underlying Intelligent System Design\\u2122 strategy to deliver computational software, hardware and IP that turn design concepts into reality. Our customers include some of the world\\u2019s most innovative companies that deliver extraordinary electronic products from chips to boards to systems for dynamic market applications. \\nWe enable our customers to develop electronic products. Our products and services are designed to give our customers a competitive edge in their development of integrated circuits (\\u201cICs\\u201d), systems-on-chip (\\u201cSoCs\\u201d), and increasingly sophisticated electronic devices and systems. Our products and services do this by optimizing performance, minimizing power consumption, shortening the time to bring our customers\\u2019 products to market, improving engineering productivity and reducing their design, development and manufacturing costs. \\nOur electronic systems customers deliver entire devices, such as smartphones, laptop computers, gaming systems, automobiles and autonomous driving systems, servers, cloud data center infrastructure, artificial intelligence (\\u201cAI\\u201d) systems, aerospace and defense, medical equipment and networking products. These systems companies internally develop, or externally purchase, the sub-components for their products, including printed circuit boards (\\u201cPCBs\\u201d), which interconnect all the hardware components, ICs, which are often referred to as computer chips, and software at various levels which runs on the hardware. Our semiconductor customers deliver ICs, which include subcategories such as processors, SoCs, AI, memory, analog and other types of chips.\\nWe offer software, hardware, services and reusable IC design blocks, which are commonly referred to as intellectual property (\\u201cIP\\u201d). Our semiconductor customers use our offerings to design, configure, analyze and verify ICs. Additionally, customers license our IP, which accelerates their product development processes by providing pre-designed and verified circuit blocks for their ICs. Systems customers use our offerings to design, simulate, and verify the electro-thermal and physical functionality of their ICs, PCBs, and systems products.\\nOur strategy, which we call Intelligent System Design, is to provide the computational software technologies necessary for our electronic system and semiconductor customers to develop products across a variety of vertical markets including consumer, hyperscale computing, mobile, 5G communications, automotive, aerospace and defense, industrial and healthcare. We address the challenges posed by the needs and trends of electronic systems companies as well as semiconductor companies delivering greater portions of these systems. \\nThe development of electronic products, or their sub-components, is complex and requires many engineers using our solutions with specialized knowledge and skill. The rate of technical innovation in electronics is swift, long driven by a concept known as Moore\\u2019s Law, which more than 50 years ago predicted that the complexity of ICs would double approximately every 24 months. In order to make our customers successful, our products must handle this exponential growth rate in complexity, without requiring a corresponding increase in our customers\\u2019 costs. Historically, the industry that provided the tools used by IC engineers was referred to as Electronic Design Automation (\\u201cEDA\\u201d). Today, our offerings include and extend beyond EDA to enable computational software for Intelligent System Design across three layers as illustrated below\\u2014starting with IC and SoC design excellence, followed by system innovation, and then pervasive intelligence.\\n1\\nTable of Contents\\nThe IC and SoC design excellence requires technologies for custom IC, digital IC design and signoff, and functional verification, and leverages pre-built semiconductor IP. These tools, IP and associated services are specifically designed to meet the growing requirements of engineers designing increasingly complex chips across analog, digital and mixed-signal domains, and perform the associated verification tasks, including validation of low-level software running on the silicon model, thereby enabling design teams to manage complexity and verification throughput without commensurately increasing the team size or extending the project schedule, while reducing technical risks.\\nThe second layer of our strategy centers around system innovation. It includes tools and services used for system design of the packages that encapsulate the ICs and the PCBs, system simulation which includes electromagnetic, electro-thermal and other multi-physics analysis necessary as part of optimizing the full system\\u2019s performance, radio frequency (\\u201cRF\\u201d) and microwave systems, and embedded software.\\nThe third layer of our strategy addresses pervasive intelligence in new electronics. It starts with providing solutions and services to develop AI-enhanced systems and includes machine learning and deep learning capabilities being added to the Cadence\\n\\u00ae\\n technology portfolio to make IP and tools more automated and to produce optimized results faster.\\nOur software and emulation products also support cloud access to address the growing computational needs of our customers.\\nRecent Acquisitions\\nDuring fiscal 2021, we continued to execute our Intelligent System Design strategy and expanded our product offerings and solutions into computational fluid dynamics (\\u201cCFD\\u201d) with our acquisitions of Belgium-based NUMECA International, a leader in CFD technology, and Pointwise, Inc, a leading provider of CFD meshing technology. The addition of these technologies and talent broadens our System Design and Analysis portfolio and expertise. \\nChief Executive Officer Transition\\nOn December 15, 2021, Anirudh Devgan assumed the role of President and Chief Executive Officer of Cadence, replacing Lip-Bu Tan. Prior to his role as Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Devgan served as President of Cadence. Concurrently, Mr. Tan transitioned to the role of Executive Chair.\\n2\\nTable of Contents\\nBusiness Drivers\\nOur products and services enable our customers to design complex and innovative electronic products that are accelerated by the growing digital transformation. Demand for our technology and expertise is driven by increasing complexity and our customers\\u2019 investment in new designs and products. The most promising new opportunities for us involve enabling the design of electronic systems for consumers, including augmented reality (\\u201cAR\\u201d), virtual reality (\\u201cVR\\u201d), and industrial internet of things (\\u201cIIoT\\u201d), hyperscale computing (including data center infrastructure), AI, edge computing, mobile, communications (including 5G networks), automotive, aerospace and defense, and industrial and healthcare subsystems. Large and existing electronics categories, such as data center infrastructure, mobile, smartphones and networking products continue to provide business opportunities for us as customers initiate new design projects.\\nUnderlying the requirements within any particular vertical market sector is the availability of rapidly improving IC manufacturing technology. In order for our customers to take advantage of such advancements, some of our products need to first incorporate new capabilities such that they can exploit new manufacturing capabilities. This dependency means that we must invest significantly in product research and development (\\u201cR&amp;D\\u201d) to keep pace with the latest manufacturing technology. The demand for new IC manufacturing technology directly impacts the demand for our newest products.\\nAnother driver for our business is the differentiation, capabilities and benefits provided to our customers by our products. With the rapid pace of innovation comes the opportunity for our products to address growing key challenges associated with electronic product creation, such as power consumption, performance, chip area and cost. Our products and services have unique attributes that our customers value. In general, these attributes can be grouped into broader categories such as quality of results (\\u201cQoR\\u201d) (in terms of power consumption, performance and chip area), engineering productivity, tool performance, manufacturing, reliability, and faster time to market. Many of these attributes contribute to the sustainability of our planet by enabling our customers to create innovative products that optimize power, space and energy needs. We are applying machine learning or computational software techniques within our products to enhance QoR, productivity, performance, manufacturing, reliability and methodology.\\nProducts and Product Strategy\\nOur Intelligent System Design strategy enables our customers to address a broad range of challenges that arise as they develop electronic products. Our solutions are categorized according to the role they play in the electronic product design process. We group our products into categories related to major design activities, including Custom IC Design and Simulation, Digital IC Design and Signoff, Functional Verification, IP, and System Design and Analysis.\\nCustom IC Design and Simulation\\nOur custom IC design and simulation offerings are used by our customers to create schematic and physical representations of circuits down to the transistor level for analog, mixed-signal, custom digital, memory and RF designs. These representations are verified using simulation tools optimized for each type of design, including the design capture environment, simulation and IC layout within the Virtuoso\\n\\u00ae\\n custom IC design platform. Other tools in the custom IC portfolio are used to prepare the designs for manufacturing.\\nThe Virtuoso Advanced-Node Platform adds functionality to the base Virtuoso package to enable the use of three-dimensional transistors (\\u201cFinFETs\\u201d), multi-patterning and other technologies required for advanced designs. The Virtuoso RF Solution addresses the challenges of RF design across chip, package and board. The Spectre\\n\\u00ae\\n Simulation Platform provides large-scale verification simulation. The Virtuoso System Design Platform enables engineers to design and verify concurrently across the chip, package and board. \\nDigital IC Design and Signoff\\nOur digital IC design and signoff solutions are used to create logical representations of a digital circuit or an IC that can be verified for correctness prior to implementation (please refer to the discussion under \\u201cFunctional Verification\\u201d below). Once the logic is verified, the design representation is implemented, or converted to a format ready for silicon manufacturing, using additional software tools within this category. The manufacturing representation is also analyzed and verified. Our digital IC design and signoff technology suite provides a full flow to achieve power, performance and area (\\u201cPPA\\u201d) design targets, and includes three major categories: logic design, physical implementation and signoff.\\nOur logic design offering is comprised of logic synthesis, test and equivalence checking capabilities and is typically used by customers to create and verify designs in conjunction with our functional verification capabilities. The offering includes the Genus\\n\\u2122\\n Synthesis Solution, a logic synthesis offering that provides fast throughput while also offering high quality results, and the Joules\\n\\u2122\\n RTL Power Solution, which delivers fast power analysis while preserving near-signoff accuracy. We also offer the Modus software solution, which reduces SoC design-for-test time.\\nOur physical implementation offering comprises tools used near the end of the design process, including place and route, optimization and multi-patterning preparation. The Innovus\\n\\u2122\\n Implementation System is a physical implementation offering that delivers fast design turnaround time while also delivering improved PPA characteristics. This offering enables customers to address the technology challenges of the latest semiconductor advanced-process nodes, create a physical representation of logic models and prepare a design for signoff.\\n3\\nTable of Contents\\nOur signoff offering is comprised of tools used to sign off the design as ready for manufacture by a semiconductor foundry, which provides certification for this step. This offering includes the Tempus\\n\\u2122\\n Timing Signoff Solution, Voltus\\n\\u2122\\n Power Integrity Solution, Quantus\\n\\u2122\\n Extraction Solution and Pegasus\\n\\u2122\\n Physical Verification System. Our design-for-manufacturing products are also included in our signoff offering and are used by customers to address manufacturing and yield issues as early in the product development process as possible.\\nFunctional Verification\\nFunctional verification products are used by our customers to effectively and efficiently verify that the circuitry or the software they have designed is consistent with the functional specification. Verification is largely done throughout the design process, with the objective of identifying as many potential functional problems as possible before manufacturing the circuitry, thereby significantly reducing the risk of discovering a costly error in the completed product. \\nOur Verification Suite\\n\\u2122\\n includes four primary verification engines, starting with the JasperGold\\n\\u00ae\\n Formal Verification Platform and Xcelium\\n\\u2122\\n Parallel Logic Simulation Platform, which are used in the early stages of design verification, often at the IP and subsystem level. Once the design is more mature, with early formal and simulation verification tasks performed, verification engineers deploy our Palladium\\n\\u00ae\\n Enterprise Emulation Platform and Protium\\n\\u2122\\n FPGA-Based Prototyping Platforms for more comprehensive chip verification, often running low-level embedded software on top of a model of the chip, to provide for proper functionality before silicon manufacturing.\\nThese engines are used for early bug detection, verification of block-level functionality, verification acceleration and emulation of system-level functionality, system-level power exploration, analysis and optimization, and system-level prototyping for hardware/software co-verification. Our Palladium platform provides high throughput, capacity, data center reliability and workgroup productivity to enable global design teams to develop advanced hardware-software systems. The Protium platform leverages a common front end with the Palladium environment to move designs rapidly from emulation to the prototyping stage, allowing for software development to start weeks to months earlier than otherwise possible.\\nThese engines are also supported by other verification tools that provide an environment that allows for effective verification throughput and management, including verification planning and metric tracking, testbench automation, debugging and software-driven tests, enabling our customers to coordinate verification activities across multiple verification engines, teams and locations for effective verification closure.\\nIP\\nOur IP offerings consist of pre-verified, customizable functional blocks, which customers integrate into their ICs to accelerate the development process and to reduce the risk of errors in the design process. We offer many types of IP, including Tensilica\\n\\u00ae\\n configurable digital signal processors (\\u201cDSPs\\u201d), vertically targeted subsystems for AI, audio/voice, baseband and vision/imaging applications, controllers and physical interfaces for standard protocols and analog IP. Our design IP portfolio also includes solutions for high speed SerDes, PCI, USB and many other standards.\\nWe also offer a broad range of Verification IP (\\u201cVIP\\u201d) with memory models, which model the expected behavior of many industry standard protocols when used with verification solutions and are complementary to our design IP offerings. Our VIP and accelerated VIP are used with our full suite of functional verification engines to emulate and model the expected behavior and interaction of standard industry system interface protocols including DDR, USB, and PCI Express\\n\\u00ae\\n in silicon. Our customers also use our System VIP offerings to perform full system-level chip verification.\\nSystem Design and Analysis\\nOur system design and analysis offerings are used by our customers to develop PCBs and advanced IC packages and to analyze electromagnetic, electro-thermal and other multi-physics effects.\\nThe capabilities in the Allegro\\n\\u00ae\\n System Design Platform include PCB authoring and implementation, IC package and system-in-package design, signal and power integrity analysis, and PCB library design management and collaboration. The need for compact, high-performance mobile, consumer and automotive design with advanced serial interconnect is driving the technology evolution for our PCB offerings. For mainstream PCB customers, where individual or small team productivity is a focus, we provide the OrCAD\\n\\u00ae\\n family of offerings that is primarily marketed worldwide through a network of resellers.\\nThe speed and close proximity of signals on silicon, through packages to boards, and through connectors and cables, exposes these communications to various kinds of interference, generates heat and emits electromagnetic radiation. Careful analysis is required for these systems to work as designed under a wide range of operating conditions and within compliance of standards and laws. The complexity of these devices and signal transmissions requires analysis and simulation throughout the product lifecycle to meet these objectives. Our Clarity\\n\\u2122\\n 3D Solver for electromagnetic and power electronics analysis and simulation, as well as our Celsius\\n\\u2122\\n Thermal Solver, provide the foundation for multi-physics analysis technology, with complete electrical-thermal co-simulation for electronic systems from ICs to physical enclosures. \\nThe addition of our CFD solution expands our ability to meet the growing design challenges of electronic and systems companies. Our CFD solution enables our customers to extend their multi-physics analysis workflows to address simulation and analysis challenges for applications such as aerodynamics, hydrodynamics, propulsion, heat transfer, and combustion.\\n4\\nTable of Contents\\nProduct Arrangements\\nWe primarily license our software using time-based licenses. Our time-based license arrangements offer customers the right to access and use all of the products delivered at the outset of an arrangement and updates throughout the entire term of the arrangement, which is generally two to three years, with no rights to return. Our updates provide for continued access to our evolving technology as our customers\\u2019 designs migrate to more advanced nodes. In addition, certain time-based license arrangements include the right for the customer to remix among the products delivered at the outset of the arrangement and use unspecified additional products that become commercially available during the term of the arrangement.\\nA small portion of our software is licensed under perpetual licenses, which does not include the right to use new technology. Payment terms for time-based licenses generally provide for payments to be made over the license period, and payment terms for perpetual licenses generally are net 30 days.\\nThe Cadence Cloud portfolio, consisting of Cadence-managed and customer-managed environments for electronic product developers using the scalability of the cloud, continues to expand, with additional cloud-ready products added or under development in fiscal 2021. Contractual arrangements with customers for both environments are time-based, similar to the on-premises software license arrangements described above, and may also include usage-based terms. \\nOur emulation and prototyping hardware products are either sold or leased to our customers. Our emulation hardware can also be accessed remotely via a Cadence-managed cloud arrangement.\\nWe generally license our design IP under nonexclusive license agreements that provide usage rights for specific designs. Some customers enter into a non-cancellable IP Access Agreement (\\u201cIPAA\\u201d), whereby the customer commits to a fixed dollar amount over a specified period of time that can be used to purchase from a list of IP products or services. In addition, for certain IP license agreements, we collect royalties as our customers ship their product that includes our IP to their customers.\\nFor a further description of our license agreements, our emulation and prototyping hardware sale or lease agreements, revenue recognition policies and results of operations, please refer to the discussion under \\u201cCritical Accounting Estimates\\u201d under Part II, Item 7, \\u201cManagement\\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\\u201d\\nTechnical Support and Maintenance\\nCustomer service and support is critical to the adoption and successful use of our products.

Depending on the customers\\u2019 projects and needs, we work with customers using outsourced, consultative and collaborative offerings.\\nThird-Party Programs and Initiatives\\nIn addition to our products, many customers use design tools that are provided by other companies, as well as design IP available from alternative suppliers. We support the use of third-party design products and design IP through our Cadence Connections\\n\\u00ae\\n program and through our participation in industry groups such as the Silicon Integration Initiative and Accellera System Initiative. We actively contribute to the development and deployment of industry standards.\\n5\\nTable of Contents\\nWe also have a strategic partnership with Green Hills Software, an industry leader in embedded safety and security software solutions.\\nProduct and Maintenance and Services Revenue\\nRevenue, and revenue as a percentage of total revenue, from our product and maintenance and services offerings for the last three fiscal years were as follows:\\n2021\\n2020\\n2019\\n(In millions, except percentages)\\nProduct and maintenance\\n$\\n2,813 \\n94 \\n%\\n$\\n2,537 \\n95 \\n%\\n$\\n2,204 \\n94 \\n%\\nServices\\n175 \\n6 \\n%\\n146 \\n5 \\n%\\n132 \\n6 \\n%\\nTotal revenue\\n$\\n2,988 \\n$\\n2,683 \\n$\\n2,336 \\nIn any fiscal year, we expect between 85% and 90% of our annual revenue to be characterized as recurring revenue. Revenue characterized as recurring includes revenue recognized over time from our software arrangements, services, royalties, maintenance on IP licenses and hardware, operating leases of hardware and revenue recognized at varying points in time over the term of our IP Access Agreements that include non-cancellable commitments from customers. \\nThe remainder of our revenue is recognized at a point in time and is characterized as up-front revenue. Up-front revenue is primarily generated by our sales of emulation and prototyping hardware and individual IP licenses. The percentage of our recurring and up-front revenue and fluctuations in revenue within our geographies are impacted by delivery of hardware and IP products to our customers in any single fiscal period.\\nFor additional information and analysis on our revenue, including revenue by geography, see the discussion under \\u201cResults of Operations\\u201d under Part II, Item 7, \\u201cManagement\\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\\u201d For our fiscal 2021 results of operations and our financial position as of January 1, 2022, see Part IV, Item 15, \\u201cExhibits and Financial Statement Schedules.\\u201d\\nRemaining Performance Obligations\\nRevenue allocated to remaining performance obligations represents the transaction price allocated to the performance obligations that are unsatisfied, or partially unsatisfied, which includes unearned revenue and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods. We have elected to exclude the potential future royalty receipts from the remaining performance obligations. Contracted but unsatisfied performance obligations were approximately $4.4 billion as of January 1, 2022, which included $119.5 million of non-cancellable IPAA commitments from customers where actual product selection and quantities of specific products or services are to be determined by customers at a later date. As of January 1, 2022, we expected to recognize approximately 55% of the contracted but unsatisfied performance obligations, excluding non-cancellable IPAA commitments, as revenue over the next 12 months and the remainder thereafter.\\nMarketing and Sales\\nWe generally market our products and provide services to existing and prospective customers through a direct sales force consisting of sales people and applications engineers. Applications engineers provide technical pre-sales and post-sales support for our products. Due to the complexity of many of our products and the system design process, the sales cycle is generally long, requiring three to six months or more. During the sales cycle, our direct sales force generally provides technical presentations, product demonstrations and support for on-site customer evaluation of our solutions. We also promote our products and services through advertising, marketing automation, trade shows, public relations and the internet. We selectively utilize value-added resellers to broaden our reach and reduce cost of sales. Our OrCAD products and certain Allegro products are primarily marketed through these channels. With respect to international sales, we generally market and support our products and services through our subsidiaries. We also use a third-party distributor to license our products and services to certain customers in Japan.\\nResearch and Development    \\nOur future performance depends on our ability to innovate, commercialize newly developed solutions and enhance and maintain our current products. The primary areas of our R&amp;D align with our product categories discussed above. We must continuously adapt our products to solve new or increased physics challenges that arise with each successive process node and address the increase in complexity that is introduced by the resulting much larger designs. We must also keep pace with our customers\\u2019 technical developments, satisfy industry standards and meet our customers\\u2019 increasingly demanding performance, productivity, quality and predictability requirements. Therefore, we expect to continue to invest in R&amp;D.\\nHardware Manufacturing and Software Distribution\\nOur emulation and prototyping hardware, including all individual PCBs, custom ICs and FPGA-based prototyping components, is manufactured, assembled and tested by subcontractors before delivery to our customers. Software and documentation are primarily distributed to customers by secure electronic delivery. \\n6\\nTable of Contents\\nProprietary Technology\\nOur success depends, in part, upon our proprietary technology. We generally rely on patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secret laws, licenses and restrictive agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights in technology and products. Many of our products include software or other IP licensed from third parties. We may have to seek new licenses or renew existing licenses for third-party software and other IP in the future. As part of performing engineering services for customers, our engineering services business uses certain software and other IP licensed from third parties, including that of our competitors.\\nGovernmental Regulations\\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to our business and operations.

We encourage you to review our 2020 Sustainability Report (located at www.cadence.com), and our 2021 Sustainability Report when released, for more information on all of our Environmental, Social and Governance (\\u201cESG\\u201d) initiatives.\\n8\\nTable of Contents\\nCorporate Information\\nOur headquarters is located at 2655 Seely Avenue, San Jose, California 95134. Our telephone number is (408) 943-1234. We use our website at www.cadence.com to communicate important information about our company, including news releases and financial information. Our website permits investors to subscribe to email notification alerts when we post new material information on our website. We also make available on our investor relations webpage, free of charge, copies of our SEC filings and submissions, which can be found at the SEC\\u2019s website, www.sec.gov, as soon as reasonably practicable after electronically filing or furnishing such documents with the SEC. Stockholders may also request copies of these documents by writing to our Corporate Secretary at the address above. Website references are provided throughout this document for convenience only. The contents of these websites do not constitute a part of this Annual Report and shall not be deemed incorporated by reference into this Annual Report unless expressly noted.\\nFiscal Year End\\nOur fiscal years are 52- or 53-week periods ending on the Saturday closest to December 31. Fiscal 2021 was a 52-week fiscal year, compared to 2020, which was a 53-week fiscal year.\\n9\\nTable of Contents\\nINFORMATION ABOUT OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS \\nThe following table provides information regarding our executive officers as of February 22, 2022:\\nName\\nAge\\nPositions and Offices\\nAnirudh Devgan\\n52\\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\\nJohn M. Wall\\n51\\nSenior Vice President and Chief Financia\n*** WARNING: skipped 636908 bytes of output ***\n\n        &#34;The fair value for acquired agreements and relationships was determined by using the multi-period excess earnings method. This method reflects the present value of the projected cash flows that are expected to be generated from existing customers, less charges representing the contribution of other assets to those cash flows. Projected income from existing customer relationships considered customer retention rates ranging between 85% and 95%. The present value of operating cash flows from existing customers was determined using discount rates 10% and 11.5%.\\nCadence also assumed obligations related to deferred revenue of $6.9 million during fiscal 2020 with its acquisition of AWR. The fair value of these obligations was estimated using the cost build-up approach. The cost build-up approach determines fair value using estimates of the costs required to fulfill the contracted obligations plus an assumed profit margin, which approximates the amount that AWR would be required to pay a third party to assume the obligation.\\nCadence believes that its estimates and assumptions related to the fair value of its acquired intangible assets and assumed liabilities are reasonable, but significant judgment is involved.\\nNOTE 16. RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER CHARGES\\nCadence has initiated restructuring plans, most recently in fiscal 2020, in an effort to better align its resources with its business strategy. The charges associated with these restructuring plans have primarily been comprised of severance payments and termination benefits related to headcount reductions and charges related to impacted facilities and are included in restructuring and other charges on Cadence\\u2019s consolidated income statements.\\nThe following table presents activity for Cadence\\u2019s restructuring plans during fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019:\\nSeverance\\nand\\nBenefits\\nExcess\\nFacilities\\nTotal\\n(In thousands)\\nBalance, December 29, 2018\\n$\\n11,176 \\n$\\n848 \\n$\\n12,024 \\nRestructuring\\n8,649 \\n(28)\\n8,621 \\nCash payments\\n(10,714)\\n(420)\\n(11,134)\\nEffect of foreign currency translation\\n118 \\n9 \\n127 \\nBalance, December 28, 2019\\n$\\n9,229 \\n$\\n409 \\n$\\n9,638 \\nRestructuring \\n7,476 \\n1,739 \\n9,215 \\nCash payments\\n(9,424)\\n(773)\\n(10,197)\\nEffect of foreign currency translation\\n40 \\n(3)\\n37 \\nBalance, January 2, 2021\\n$\\n7,321 \\n$\\n1,372 \\n$\\n8,693 \\nRestructuring \\n(1,480)\\n432 \\n(1,048)\\nCash payments\\n(5,774)\\n(1,761)\\n(7,535)\\nEffect of foreign currency translation\\n(67)\\n\\u2014 \\n(67)\\nBalance, January 1, 2022\\n$\\n\\u2014 \\n$\\n43 \\n$\\n43 \\nAll remaining liabilities for Cadence\\u2019s restructuring plans represent liabilities from vacated facilities and are included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities on Cadence\\u2019s consolidated balance sheet as of January 1, 2022. Restructuring liabilities included in other long-term liabilities represent liabilities from vacated facilities, and Cadence expects to make cash payments to settle these liabilities through fiscal 2022.\\nOther Termination Benefits\\nDuring the second quarter of fiscal 2021, Cadence offered a voluntary retirement program to eligible employees in the United States. This program resulted in a one-time charge of $26.8 million for voluntary termination and post-employment benefits. These charges are included in each category of costs and expenses on Cadence\\u2019s consolidated income statements. As of January 1, 2022, liabilities related to the voluntary retirement program were $17.5 million and were included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities on Cadence\\u2019s consolidated balance sheet. Cadence expects to make cash payments to settle these liabilities through fiscal 2023, including $17.0 million that is expected to be paid within the next twelve months.\\n79&#34;,\n        &#34;NOTE 17. OTHER INCOME, NET\\nCadence\\u2019s other income, net, for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019 was as follows:\\n \\n2021\\n2020\\n2019\\n \\n(In thousands)\\nInterest income\\n$\\n2,634 \\n$\\n3,817 \\n$\\n9,509 \\nGains (losses) on marketable equity investments\\n1,504 \\n(148)\\n713 \\nLosses on non-marketable equity investments\\n(924)\\n(4,806)\\n(4,802)\\nGains on securities in NQDC trust\\n6,163 \\n4,881 \\n5,402 \\nGains (losses) on foreign exchange\\n(2,789)\\n4,429 \\n(4,111)\\nOther expense, net\\n(262)\\n(228)\\n(710)\\nTotal other income, net\\n$\\n6,326 \\n$\\n7,945 \\n$\\n6,001 \\nNOTE 18. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\\nPurchase Obligations\\nCadence had purchase obligations of $62.4 million as of January 1, 2022 that were associated with agreements or commitments for purchases of goods or services. Cadence expects to settle $50.9 million of these obligations within the next 12 months.\\nLegal Proceedings\\nFrom time to time, Cadence is involved in various disputes and litigation that arise in the ordinary course of business. These include disputes and legal proceedings related to intellectual property, indemnification obligations, mergers and acquisitions, licensing, contracts, customers, products, distribution and other commercial arrangements and employee relations matters. At least quarterly, Cadence reviews the status of each significant matter and assesses its potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount or the range of loss can be estimated, Cadence accrues a liability for the estimated loss. Legal proceedings are subject to uncertainties, and the outcomes are difficult to predict. Because of such uncertainties, accruals are based on Cadence\\u2019s judgments using the best information available at the time. As additional information becomes available, Cadence reassesses the potential liability related to pending claims and litigation matters and may revise estimates.\\n \\nOther Contingencies\\nCadence provides its customers with a warranty on sales of hardware products, generally for a 90-day period. Cadence did not incur any significant costs related to warranty obligations during fiscal 2021, 2020 or 2019.\\nCadence\\u2019s product license and services agreements typically include a limited indemnification provision for claims from third parties relating to Cadence\\u2019s intellectual property. If the potential loss from any indemnification claim is considered probable and the amount or the range of loss can be estimated, Cadence accrues a liability for the estimated loss. The indemnification is generally limited to the amount paid by the customer. Cadence did not incur any significant losses from indemnification claims during fiscal 2021, 2020 or 2019.\\nNOTE 19. EMPLOYEE AND DIRECTOR BENEFIT PLANS\\nCadence maintains various defined contribution plans for its eligible U.S. and non-U.S. employees. For employees in the United States, Cadence maintains a 401(k) savings plan to provide retirement benefits through tax-deferred salary deductions and may make discretionary contributions, as determined by the Board of Directors, which cannot exceed a specified percentage of the annual aggregate salaries of those employees eligible to participate. Cadence\\u2019s total contributions made to these plans during fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019 were as follows:\\n2021\\n2020\\n2019\\n(In thousands)\\nContributions to defined contribution plans\\n$\\n33,029 \\n$\\n27,152 \\n$\\n25,269 \\nExecutive Officers and Directors may also elect to defer compensation payable to them under Cadence\\u2019s NQDC. Deferred compensation payments are held in investment accounts and the values of the accounts are adjusted each quarter based on the fair value of the investments held in the NQDC.

The unfunded projected benefit obligation for Cadence\\u2019s defined benefit retirement plans is recorded in other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\\nNOTE 20. ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS\\nCadence\\u2019s accumulated other comprehensive loss is comprised of the aggregate impact of foreign currency translation gains and losses and changes in defined benefit plan liabilities and is presented in Cadence\\u2019s consolidated statements of comprehensive income.\\nAccumulated other comprehensive loss was comprised of the following as of January 1, 2022, and January 2, 2021:\\nAs of\\nJanuary 1,2022\\nJanuary 2,2021\\n \\n(In thousands)\\nForeign currency translation loss\\n$\\n(26,553)\\n$\\n(11,130)\\nChanges in defined benefit plan liabilities\\n(6,758)\\n(6,295)\\nTotal accumulated other comprehensive loss\\n$\\n(33,311)\\n$\\n(17,425)\\nFor fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, there were no significant amounts related to foreign currency translation loss or changes in defined benefit plan liabilities reclassified to net income from accumulated other comprehensive loss. \\nNOTE 21. SEGMENT REPORTING\\nSegment reporting is based on the \\u201cmanagement approach,\\u201d following the method that management organizes the company\\u2019s reportable segments for which separate financial information is made available to, and evaluated regularly by, the chief operating decision maker in allocating resources and in assessing performance. Cadence\\u2019s chief operating decision maker is its CEO, who reviews Cadence\\u2019s consolidated results as one operating segment. In making operating decisions, the CEO primarily considers consolidated financial information, accompanied by disaggregated information about revenues by geographic region.\\nOutside the United States, Cadence markets and supports its products and services primarily through its subsidiaries. Revenue is attributed to geography based upon the country in which the product is used, or services are delivered. Property, plant and equipment is attributed to geography based on the country where the assets are located.\\nThe following table presents a summary of revenue by geography for fiscal 2021, 2020 and

The most promising new opportunities for us involve enabling the design of electronic systems for consumers, including augmented reality (\\u201cAR\\u201d), virtual reality (\\u201cVR\\u201d), and industrial internet of things (\\u201cIIoT\\u201d), hyperscale computing (including data center infrastructure), AI, edge computing, mobile, communications (including 5G networks), automotive, aerospace and defense, and industrial and healthcare subsystems. Large and existing electronics categories, such as data center infrastructure, mobile, smartphones and networking products continue to provide business opportunities for us as customers initiate new design projects.\\nUnderlying the requirements within any particular vertical market sector is the availability of rapidly improving IC manufacturing technology. In order for our customers to take advantage of such advancements, some of our products need to first incorporate new capabilities such that they can exploit new manufacturing capabilities.

The demand for new IC manufacturing technology directly impacts the demand for our newest products.\\nAnother driver for our business is the differentiation, capabilities and benefits provided to our customers by our products. With the rapid pace of innovation comes the opportunity for our products to address growing key challenges associated with electronic product creation, such as power consumption, performance, chip area and cost. Our products and services have unique attributes that our customers value. In general, these attributes can be grouped into broader categories such as quality of results (\\u201cQoR\\u201d) (in terms of power consumption, performance and chip area), engineering productivity, tool performance, manufacturing, reliability, and faster time to market. Many of these attributes contribute to the sustainability of our planet by enabling our customers to create innovative products that optimize power, space and energy needs. We are applying machine learning or computational software techniques within our products to enhance QoR, productivity, performance, manufacturing, reliability and methodology.\\nProducts and Product Strategy\\nOur Intelligent System Design strategy enables our customers to address a broad range of challenges that arise as they develop electronic products. Our solutions are categorized according to the role they play in the electronic product design process. We group our products into categories related to major design activities, including Custom IC Design and Simulation, Digital IC Design and Signoff, Functional Verification, IP, and System Design and Analysis.\\nCustom IC Design and Simulation\\nOur custom IC design and simulation offerings are used by our customers to create schematic and physical representations of circuits down to the transistor level for analog, mixed-signal, custom digital, memory and RF designs. These representations are verified using simulation tools optimized for each type of design, including the design capture environment, simulation and IC layout within the Virtuoso\\n\\u00ae\\n custom IC design platform. Other tools in the custom IC portfolio are used to prepare the designs for manufacturing.\\nThe Virtuoso Advanced-Node Platform adds functionality to the base Virtuoso package to enable the use of three-dimensional transistors (\\u201cFinFETs\\u201d), multi-patterning and other technologies required for advanced designs. The Virtuoso RF Solution addresses the challenges of RF design across chip, package and board. The Spectre\\n\\u00ae\\n Simulation Platform provides large-scale verification simulation. The Virtuoso System Design Platform enables engineers to design and verify concurrently across the chip, package and board. \\nDigital IC Design and Signoff\\nOur digital IC design and signoff solutions are used to create logical representations of a digital circuit or an IC that can be verified for correctness prior to implementation (please refer to the discussion under \\u201cFunctional Verification\\u201d below). Once the logic is verified, the design representation is implemented, or converted to a format ready for silicon manufacturing, using additional software tools within this category. The manufacturing representation is also analyzed and verified. Our digital IC design and signoff technology suite provides a full flow to achieve power, performance and area (\\u201cPPA\\u201d) design targets, and includes three major categories: logic design, physical implementation and signoff.\\nOur logic design offering is comprised of logic synthesis, test and equivalence checking capabilities and is typically used by customers to create and verify designs in conjunction with our functional verification capabilities. The offering includes the Genus\\n\\u2122\\n Synthesis Solution, a logic synthesis offering that provides fast throughput while also offering high quality results, and the Joules\\n\\u2122\\n RTL Power Solution, which delivers fast power analysis while preserving near-signoff accuracy. We also offer the Modus software solution, which reduces SoC design-for-test time.\\nOur physical implementation offering comprises tools used near the end of the design process, including place and route, optimization and multi-patterning preparation. The Innovus\\n\\u2122\\n Implementation System is a physical implementation offering that delivers fast design turnaround time while also delivering improved PPA characteristics. This offering enables customers to address the technology challenges of the latest semiconductor advanced-process nodes, create a physical representation of logic models and prepare a design for signoff.\\n3&#34;\n        ],\n        &#34;sentence_embeddings&#34;: [\n            &#34;Business Drivers\\nOur products and services enable our customers to design complex and innovative electronic products that are accelerated by the growing digital transformation.

Our U.S. health and well-being benefits include fertility benefits, coverage for transgender employees undergoing medical treatment, expanded new parent leave, adoption and surrogacy benefits, financial planning and coaching services, and legal services. We also provide training and tools for stress management, time management, conflict resolution and emotional well-being.\\nThe vast majority of our employees continued to work from home during fiscal 2021. To promote health and well-being during the challenges brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, we provided employees with additional time off to focus on themselves and their families and provided global employee assistance programs to connect employees and their families with resources, information and counseling to address the challenges caused by the pandemic, such as increased anxiety or stress. \\nCompensation and Benefits\\nTo inspire and recognize our employees, we offer competitive compensation and benefits programs. Our compensation programs link employee compensation to our business and individual performance. We also offer a semi-annual bonus program, 401(k) match, Employee Stock Purchase Plan and equity compensation. In addition, our employees are eligible to receive monetary awards from their colleagues through our peer-to-peer recognition program.\\nTalent Development\\nTo help employees succeed in their current roles, pursue their passions and develop the skills necessary for advancement, we provide formal training programs and curriculums in addition to on-the-job training. Our High-Performance Culture portal provides our employees with valuable resources such as a comprehensive online Learning Management program with training and development tools on a broad range of topics and skills. We also offer tuition reimbursement opportunities to employees continuing in fields relevant to their job. \\nCommunity Outreach\\nWe believe it is important that we create meaningful opportunities for employees to connect and contribute to their community. We provide opportunities for paid volunteer time off annually, charitable contribution matching, company-wide volunteer campaigns and international service immersion projects.\\nDuring fiscal 2021, we formed the Cadence Giving Foundation with the goal of giving back to the communities where we live and work. This stand-alone, non-profit foundation will partner with other charitable initiatives to support critical needs in areas such as diversity, equity and inclusion, environmental sustainability and science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (\\u201cSTEM\\u201d) education.\\nCorporate Responsibility\\nWe believe that, in general, the best and brightest talent is inclined to build a career with a responsible organization that positively impacts society. Among our efforts to be that type of organization, we recognize that climate change is one of the greatest challenges of our time, and we are committed to doing our part to contribute to the health of the planet by actively investing in initiatives to reduce our environmental footprint. Through these initiatives, we plan to reduce our scope 1 and scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions 25% by 2025, over our 2019 baseline. We encourage you to review our 2020 Sustainability Report (located at www.cadence.com), and our 2021 Sustainability Report when released, for more information on all of our Environmental, Social and Governance (\\u201cESG\\u201d) initiatives.\\n8&#34;\n\n*** WARNING: skipped 11817 bytes of output ***\n\n        ],\n        &#34;sentence_embeddings&#34;: [\n            &#34;For example, in fiscal 2019, the DOC placed certain entities who are our customers on the \\u201cEntity List,\\u201d limiting our ability to deliver products and services to these entities. When certain customers are on the Entity List or are subject to new or expanded trade restrictions, such as the expansion in scope by the DOC of the military end-user and military end-use regulations in April 2020 and the foreign-produced direct product rules in August 2020, it will have a negative effect on our ability to sell products and provide services to these customers without first obtaining a license from the BIS. In addition, new or expanded trade restrictions, such as the continued expansion of the military end-user and military end-use rule, the foreign-produced direct product rules, or any future rule that will prevent a class of technology from export to any specific country or countries without a license, will increase our costs or expenses. Entity List restrictions and other trade restrictions may also encourage customers to seek substitute products from our competitors, including a growing class of foreign competitors and open source alternatives, that are not subject to these restrictions or to develop their own solutions, thereby decreasing our long-term competitiveness. In addition, although customers are not prohibited from paying (and we are not restricted from collecting) for products we previously delivered to them, the credit risks associated with outstanding receivables from customers on the Entity List \\u2013 including receivables from anti-piracy enforcement efforts and litigation settlements \\u2013 and other trade restrictions could increase as a result of these limitations. In particular, China\\u2019s stated national policy to be a global leader in all segments of the semiconductor industry by 2030 has resulted in and may continue to cause increased competitive capability in China.\\nWe cannot predict whether or when any changes will be made that eliminate or decrease these limitations on our ability to sell products and provide services to these Entity List customers or other customers impacted by other trade restrictions. We are unable to predict the duration of the export restrictions imposed with respect to any particular customer or the long-term effects on our business or our customers\\u2019 business. Additionally, other companies may be added to the Entity List and/or be subject to new or expanded trade restrictions and restrictions may be imposed against specific countries. In addition, there may be indirect impacts to our business which we cannot reasonably quantify, including that a country-specific export control may limit or prevent our employees who are nationals of the restricted country from performing their duties unless a license can be obtained. Additionally our business may also be impacted by other trade restrictions that may be imposed by the U.S., China, or other countries. Restrictions on our ability to sell and ship our products to customers on the Entity List have had, and may continue to have, an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\\nFailure to obtain export licenses or restrictions on trade imposed by the United States or other countries could harm our business by rendering us unable to sell or ship products and transfer our technology outside of the United States or across borders. Although we have implemented policies and procedures to help us comply with all applicable trade restrictions, we and governmental authorities have had and may in the future have reason to inquire into particular sales. For example, in February 2021, we received an administrative subpoena from BIS requesting the production of records in connection with certain sales to China. We are cooperating with BIS and are in the process of responding to the subpoena as well as conducting an internal review. Such inquiries are subject to uncertainties and the outcomes of this and other proceedings that may occur are difficult to predict. The laws and policies of the United States and other countries in this area are evolving and changing, and we have experienced and may continue to experience challenges in complying with new rules as they become effective. Any failure or alleged failure to comply with these laws and policies could have negative consequences, including significant legal costs, government investigations, penalties, denial of export privileges and debarment from participation in U.S. government contracts, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations, reputation and financial condition.\\nIn addition to export control laws, our global operations are subject to numerous U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including those related to anti-corruption, tax, corporate governance, financial and other disclosures, competition, data privacy and employment. These laws and regulations are complex and may have differing or conflicting legal standards, making compliance difficult and costly, and changes to these laws may require us to make significant changes to our business operations that may adversely affect our business overall. The policies and procedures we have implemented to assist our compliance with these laws and regulations do not provide complete assurance that our employees, contractors, agents or partners will not violate such laws and regulations. Any violation individually or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on our operations, reputation and financial condition.\\nWe have acquired and expect to acquire other companies and businesses and may not realize the expected benefits of these acquisitions.\\nWe have acquired and expect to acquire other companies and businesses in order to expand our product offerings and enter into new markets. Our future revenue growth and expansion of our business is dependent on our successful integration of our acquisitions. We may incur significant costs in connection with potential transactions, including acquisitions that are not consummated. Potential and completed acquisitions involve a number of risks. If any of the following acquisition-related risks occur, our business, operating results or financial condition could be adversely impacted:\\n\\u2022\\nthe failure to complete transactions on a timely basis or at all, including as a result of governmental antitrust approval dynamics;\\n\\u2022\\nthe failure to realize, or a delay in realizing, anticipated benefits such as cost savings and revenue enhancements;\\n\\u2022\\noverlapping customers and product sets that impact our ability to maintain revenue at historical rates;\\n\\u2022\\nthe failure to understand, compete and operate effectively in markets where we have limited experience;\\n\\u2022\\nthe failure to integrate, combine or manage acquired products, infrastructure, technologies and businesses effectively;\\n\\u2022\\ndifficulties in integrating or retaining employees;\\n13&#34;\n        ],\n        &#34;label&#34;: [\n            &#34;other&#34;\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        &#34;document&#34;: [\n            &#34;To attract, retain and motivate individuals with the requisite expertise, we may be required to grant large numbers of stock options or other stock-based incentive awards, which may be dilutive to existing stockholders and increase compensation expense, and pay significant base salaries and cash bonuses, which could harm our operating results. The high cost of training new employees, not fully utilizing these employees, or losing trained employees to competing employers could also reduce our operating margins and harm our business or operating results.\\nWe rely on our proprietary technology, as well as software and other intellectual property rights licensed to us by third parties, and we cannot assure that the precautions taken to protect our rights will be adequate or that we will continue to be able to adequately secure such intellectual property rights from third parties.\\nOur success depends, in part, upon our proprietary technology. We generally rely on patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, licenses and restrictive agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights in technology and products. Despite the precautions we may take to protect our intellectual property, third parties have tried in the past, and may try in the future, to challenge, invalidate or circumvent these safeguards. Our patents and other intellectual property rights may not provide us with sufficient competitive advantages. Patents may not be issued on any of our pending applications and our issued patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. Furthermore, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights in those countries to the same extent as applicable law protects these rights in the United States, and we may encounter difficulties in our attempts to protect our intellectual property in foreign jurisdictions, including as a result of impacts from changes in international trade relationships. The protection of our intellectual property may require the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources. Moreover, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may not adequately protect our rights, or deter or prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our proprietary rights.\\nMany of our products include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties. We may have to seek new or renew existing licenses for such software and other intellectual property in the future. Our engineering services business holds licenses to certain software and other intellectual property owned by third parties, including that of our competitors. Our failure to obtain software, other intellectual property licenses or other intellectual property rights that are necessary or helpful for our business on favorable terms, or our need to engage in litigation over these licenses or rights, could seriously harm our business, operating results or financial condition.\\nWe have substantial cash requirements in the United States, but a significant portion of our cash is held and generated outside of the United States, and if our cash available in the United States is insufficient to meet our operating expenses and debt repayment obligations in the United States, then we may be required to raise cash in ways that could negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations and the market price of our common stock.\\nWe have significant operations outside the United States. As of January 1, 2022, approximately 55% of our cash and cash equivalents balance was held by subsidiaries outside the United States, with the remainder of the balance held by us or our subsidiaries in the United States. While we believe that the combination of our current U.S. cash and cash equivalents, future U.S. operating cash flows and other cash that may be accessible to us on attractive terms are sufficient to meet our ongoing U.S. operating expenses and debt repayment obligations, we cannot accurately predict the full impact that COVID-19 may have on our cash flows. In addition, although the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \\u201cTax Act\\u201d) may have reduced the tax impact of repatriation of foreign earnings, there are still administrative processes associated with repatriation of foreign earnings that could affect the timing of returning cash to the U.S. from non-U.S. jurisdictions. Accordingly, if our U.S. cash were insufficient to meet our future funding obligations in the United States, we could be required to seek funding sources on less attractive terms, which could negatively impact our results of operations, financial position and the market price of our common stock.\\nThe long sales cycle of our products and services may cause our operating results to fluctuate unexpectedly.\\nGenerally, we have a long sales cycle that can extend up to six months or longer. The complexity and expense associated with our products and services generally require a lengthy customer education, evaluation and approval process. Consequently, we may incur substantial expenses and devote significant management effort and expense to develop potential relationships that do not result in agreements or revenue and may prevent us from pursuing other opportunities. In addition, sales of our products and services have been and may in the future be delayed if customers delay approval or commencement of projects because of the timing of customers\\u2019 competitive evaluation processes or customers\\u2019 budgetary constraints and budget cycles. Long sales cycles for hardware products subject us to a number of significant risks over which we have limited control, including insufficient, excess or obsolete inventory, variations in inventory valuation and fluctuations in quarterly operating results.\\nOur restructuring plans incur substantial costs and may not result in the benefits we have anticipated, possibly having a negative effect on our future operating results. \\nIn recent fiscal years, we have initiated restructuring plans in an effort to better align our resources with our business strategy. We incur substantial costs to implement restructuring plans, and our restructuring activities may subject us to reputational risks and litigation risks and expenses. Our past restructuring plans do not provide any assurance that we will realize anticipated cost savings and other benefits or that additional restructuring plans will not be required or implemented in the future. In addition, our restructuring plans may have other consequences, such as attrition beyond our planned reduction in workforce, a negative effect on employee morale and productivity or our ability to attract highly skilled employees. Our competitors may also use our restructuring plans to seek to gain a competitive advantage over us. As a result, our restructuring plans may affect our revenue and other operating results in the future.\\n17&#34;\n        ],\n        &#34;sentence_embeddings&#34;: [\n            &#34;To attract, retain and motivate individuals with the requisite expertise, we may be required to grant large numbers of stock options or other stock-based incentive awards, which may be dilutive to existing stockholders and increase compensation expense, and pay significant base salaries and cash bonuses, which could harm our operating results. The high cost of training new employees, not fully utilizing these employees, or losing trained employees to competing employers could also reduce our operating margins and harm our business or operating results.\\nWe rely on our proprietary technology, as well as software and other intellectual property rights licensed to us by third parties, and we cannot assure that the precautions taken to protect our rights will be adequate or that we will continue to be able to adequately secure such intellectual property rights from third parties.\\nOur success depends, in part, upon our proprietary technology. We generally rely on patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, licenses and restrictive agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights in technology and products.

In general, these attributes can be grouped into broader categories such as quality of results (\\u201cQoR\\u201d) (in terms of power consumption, performance and chip area), engineering productivity, tool performance, manufacturing, reliability, and faster time to market. Many of these attributes contribute to the sustainability of our planet by enabling our customers to create innovative products that optimize power, space and energy needs. We are applying machine learning or computational software techniques within our products to enhance QoR, productivity, performance, manufacturing, reliability and methodology.\\nProducts and Product Strategy\\nOur Intelligent System Design strategy enables our customers to address a broad range of challenges that arise as they develop electronic products. Our solutions are categorized according to the role they play in the electronic product design process. We group our products into categories related to major design activities, including Custom IC Design and Simulation, Digital IC Design and Signoff, Functional Verification, IP, and System Design and Analysis.\\nCustom IC Design and Simulation\\nOur custom IC design and simulation offerings are used by our customers to create schematic and physical representations of circuits down to the transistor level for analog, mixed-signal, custom digital, memory and RF designs. These representations are verified using simulation tools optimized for each type of design, including the design capture environment, simulation and IC layout within the Virtuoso\\n\\u00ae\\n custom IC design platform. Other tools in the custom IC portfolio are used to prepare the designs for manufacturing.\\nThe Virtuoso Advanced-Node Platform adds functionality to the base Virtuoso package to enable the use of three-dimensional transistors (\\u201cFinFETs\\u201d), multi-patterning and other technologies required for advanced designs. The Virtuoso RF Solution addresses the challenges of RF design across chip, package and board. The Spectre\\n\\u00ae\\n Simulation Platform provides large-scale verification simulation. The Virtuoso System Design Platform enables engineers to design and verify concurrently across the chip, package and board. \\nDigital IC Design and Signoff\\nOur digital IC design and signoff solutions are used to create logical representations of a digital circuit or an IC that can be verified for correctness prior to implementation (please refer to the discussion under \\u201cFunctional Verification\\u201d below). Once the logic is verified, the design representation is implemented, or converted to a format ready for silicon manufacturing, using additional software tools within this category. The manufacturing representation is also analyzed and verified. Our digital IC design and signoff technology suite provides a full flow to achieve power, performance and area (\\u201cPPA\\u201d) design targets, and includes three major categories: logic design, physical implementation and signoff.\\nOur logic design offering is comprised of logic synthesis, test and equivalence checking capabilities and is typically used by customers to create and verify designs in conjunction with our functional verification capabilities. The offering includes the Genus\\n\\u2122\\n Synthesis Solution, a logic synthesis offering that provides fast throughput while also offering high quality results, and the Joules\\n\\u2122\\n RTL Power Solution, which delivers fast power analysis while preserving near-signoff accuracy. We also offer the Modus software solution, which reduces SoC design-for-test time.\\nOur physical implementation offering comprises tools used near the end of the design process, including place and route, optimization and multi-patterning preparation. The Innovus\\n\\u2122\\n Implementation System is a physical implementation offering that delivers fast design turnaround time while also delivering improved PPA characteristics.

Our U.S. health and well-being benefits include fertility benefits, coverage for transgender employees undergoing medical treatment, expanded new parent leave, adoption and surrogacy benefits, financial planning and coaching services, and legal services. We also provide training and tools for stress management, time management, conflict resolution and emotional well-being.\\nThe vast majority of our employees continued to work from home during fiscal 2021. To promote health and well-being during the challenges brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, we provided employees with additional time off to focus on themselves and their families and provided global employee assistance programs to connect employees and their families with resources, information and counseling to address the challenges caused by the pandemic, such as increased anxiety or stress. \\nCompensation and Benefits\\nTo inspire and recognize our employees, we offer competitive compensation and benefits programs. Our compensation programs link employee compensation to our business and individual performance. We also offer a semi-annual bonus program, 401(k) match, Employee Stock Purchase Plan and equity compensation. In addition, our employees are eligible to receive monetary awards from their colleagues through our peer-to-peer recognition program.\\nTalent Development\\nTo help employees succeed in their current roles, pursue their passions and develop the skills necessary for advancement, we provide formal training programs and curriculums in addition to on-the-job training. Our High-Performance Culture portal provides our employees with valuable resources such as a comprehensive online Learning Management program with training and development tools on a broad range of topics and skills. We also offer tuition reimbursement opportunities to employees continuing in fields relevant to their job. \\nCommunity Outreach\\nWe believe it is important that we create meaningful opportunities for employees to connect and contribute to their community. We provide opportunities for paid volunteer time off annually, charitable contribution matching, company-wide volunteer campaigns and international service immersion projects.\\nDuring fiscal 2021, we formed the Cadence Giving Foundation with the goal of giving back to the communities where we live and work. This stand-alone, non-profit foundation will partner with other charitable initiatives to support critical needs in areas such as diversity, equity and inclusion, environmental sustainability and science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (\\u201cSTEM\\u201d) education.\\nCorporate Responsibility\\nWe believe that, in general, the best and brightest talent is inclined to build a career with a responsible organization that positively impacts society. Among our efforts to be that type of organization, we recognize that climate change is one of the greatest challenges of our time, and we are committed to doing our part to contribute to the health of the planet by actively investing in initiatives to reduce our environmental footprint. Through these initiatives, we plan to reduce our scope 1 and scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions 25% by 2025, over our 2019 baseline. We encourage you to review our 2020 Sustainability Report (located at www.cadence.com), and our 2021 Sustainability Report when released, for more information on all of our Environmental, Social and Governance (\\u201cESG\\u201d) initiatives.\\n8&#34;\n\n*** WARNING: skipped 11817 bytes of output ***\n\n        ],\n        &#34;sentence_embeddings&#34;: [\n            &#34;For example, in fiscal 2019, the DOC placed certain entities who are our customers on the \\u201cEntity List,\\u201d limiting our ability to deliver products and services to these entities. When certain customers are on the Entity List or are subject to new or expanded trade restrictions, such as the expansion in scope by the DOC of the military end-user and military end-use regulations in April 2020 and the foreign-produced direct product rules in August 2020, it will have a negative effect on our ability to sell products and provide services to these customers without first obtaining a license from the BIS. In addition, new or expanded trade restrictions, such as the continued expansion of the military end-user and military end-use rule, the foreign-produced direct product rules, or any future rule that will prevent a class of technology from export to any specific country or countries without a license, will increase our costs or expenses. Entity List restrictions and other trade restrictions may also encourage customers to seek substitute products from our competitors, including a growing class of foreign competitors and open source alternatives, that are not subject to these restrictions or to develop their own solutions, thereby decreasing our long-term competitiveness. In addition, although customers are not prohibited from paying (and we are not restricted from collecting) for products we previously delivered to them, the credit risks associated with outstanding receivables from customers on the Entity List \\u2013 including receivables from anti-piracy enforcement efforts and litigation settlements \\u2013 and other trade restrictions could increase as a result of these limitations. In particular, China\\u2019s stated national policy to be a global leader in all segments of the semiconductor industry by 2030 has resulted in and may continue to cause increased competitive capability in China.\\nWe cannot predict whether or when any changes will be made that eliminate or decrease these limitations on our ability to sell products and provide services to these Entity List customers or other customers impacted by other trade restrictions. We are unable to predict the duration of the export restrictions imposed with respect to any particular customer or the long-term effects on our business or our customers\\u2019 business. Additionally, other companies may be added to the Entity List and/or be subject to new or expanded trade restrictions and restrictions may be imposed against specific countries. In addition, there may be indirect impacts to our business which we cannot reasonably quantify, including that a country-specific export control may limit or prevent our employees who are nationals of the restricted country from performing their duties unless a license can be obtained. Additionally our business may also be impacted by other trade restrictions that may be imposed by the U.S., China, or other countries. Restrictions on our ability to sell and ship our products to customers on the Entity List have had, and may continue to have, an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\\nFailure to obtain export licenses or restrictions on trade imposed by the United States or other countries could harm our business by rendering us unable to sell or ship products and transfer our technology outside of the United States or across borders. Although we have implemented policies and procedures to help us comply with all applicable trade restrictions, we and governmental authorities have had and may in the future have reason to inquire into particular sales. For example, in February 2021, we received an administrative subpoena from BIS requesting the production of records in connection with certain sales to China. We are cooperating with BIS and are in the process of responding to the subpoena as well as conducting an internal review. Such inquiries are subject to uncertainties and the outcomes of this and other proceedings that may occur are difficult to predict. The laws and policies of the United States and other countries in this area are evolving and changing, and we have experienced and may continue to experience challenges in complying with new rules as they become effective. Any failure or alleged failure to comply with these laws and policies could have negative consequences, including significant legal costs, government investigations, penalties, denial of export privileges and debarment from participation in U.S. government contracts, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations, reputation and financial condition.\\nIn addition to export control laws, our global operations are subject to numerous U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including those related to anti-corruption, tax, corporate governance, financial and other disclosures, competition, data privacy and employment. These laws and regulations are complex and may have differing or conflicting legal standards, making compliance difficult and costly, and changes to these laws may require us to make significant changes to our business operations that may adversely affect our business overall. The policies and procedures we have implemented to assist our compliance with these laws and regulations do not provide complete assurance that our employees, contractors, agents or partners will not violate such laws and regulations. Any violation individually or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on our operations, reputation and financial condition.\\nWe have acquired and expect to acquire other companies and businesses and may not realize the expected benefits of these acquisitions.\\nWe have acquired and expect to acquire other companies and businesses in order to expand our product offerings and enter into new markets. Our future revenue growth and expansion of our business is dependent on our successful integration of our acquisitions. We may incur significant costs in connection with potential transactions, including acquisitions that are not consummated. Potential and completed acquisitions involve a number of risks. If any of the following acquisition-related risks occur, our business, operating results or financial condition could be adversely impacted:\\n\\u2022\\nthe failure to complete transactions on a timely basis or at all, including as a result of governmental antitrust approval dynamics;\\n\\u2022\\nthe failure to realize, or a delay in realizing, anticipated benefits such as cost savings and revenue enhancements;\\n\\u2022\\noverlapping customers and product sets that impact our ability to maintain revenue at historical rates;\\n\\u2022\\nthe failure to understand, compete and operate effectively in markets where we have limited experience;\\n\\u2022\\nthe failure to integrate, combine or manage acquired products, infrastructure, technologies and businesses effectively;\\n\\u2022\\ndifficulties in integrating or retaining employees;\\n13&#34;\n        ],\n        &#34;label&#34;: [\n            &#34;other&#34;\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        &#34;document&#34;: [\n            &#34;To attract, retain and motivate individuals with the requisite expertise, we may be required to grant large numbers of stock options or other stock-based incentive awards, which may be dilutive to existing stockholders and increase compensation expense, and pay significant base salaries and cash bonuses, which could harm our operating results. The high cost of training new employees, not fully utilizing these employees, or losing trained employees to competing employers could also reduce our operating margins and harm our business or operating results.\\nWe rely on our proprietary technology, as well as software and other intellectual property rights licensed to us by third parties, and we cannot assure that the precautions taken to protect our rights will be adequate or that we will continue to be able to adequately secure such intellectual property rights from third parties.\\nOur success depends, in part, upon our proprietary technology. We generally rely on patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, licenses and restrictive agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights in technology and products. Despite the precautions we may take to protect our intellectual property, third parties have tried in the past, and may try in the future, to challenge, invalidate or circumvent these safeguards. Our patents and other intellectual property rights may not provide us with sufficient competitive advantages. Patents may not be issued on any of our pending applications and our issued patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. Furthermore, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights in those countries to the same extent as applicable law protects these rights in the United States, and we may encounter difficulties in our attempts to protect our intellectual property in foreign jurisdictions, including as a result of impacts from changes in international trade relationships. The protection of our intellectual property may require the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources. Moreover, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may not adequately protect our rights, or deter or prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our proprietary rights.\\nMany of our products include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties. We may have to seek new or renew existing licenses for such software and other intellectual property in the future. Our engineering services business holds licenses to certain software and other intellectual property owned by third parties, including that of our competitors. Our failure to obtain software, other intellectual property licenses or other intellectual property rights that are necessary or helpful for our business on favorable terms, or our need to engage in litigation over these licenses or rights, could seriously harm our business, operating results or financial condition.\\nWe have substantial cash requirements in the United States, but a significant portion of our cash is held and generated outside of the United States, and if our cash available in the United States is insufficient to meet our operating expenses and debt repayment obligations in the United States, then we may be required to raise cash in ways that could negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations and the market price of our common stock.\\nWe have significant operations outside the United States. As of January 1, 2022, approximately 55% of our cash and cash equivalents balance was held by subsidiaries outside the United States, with the remainder of the balance held by us or our subsidiaries in the United States. While we believe that the combination of our current U.S. cash and cash equivalents, future U.S. operating cash flows and other cash that may be accessible to us on attractive terms are sufficient to meet our ongoing U.S. operating expenses and debt repayment obligations, we cannot accurately predict the full impact that COVID-19 may have on our cash flows. In addition, although the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \\u201cTax Act\\u201d) may have reduced the tax impact of repatriation of foreign earnings, there are still administrative processes associated with repatriation of foreign earnings that could affect the timing of returning cash to the U.S. from non-U.S. jurisdictions. Accordingly, if our U.S. cash were insufficient to meet our future funding obligations in the United States, we could be required to seek funding sources on less attractive terms, which could negatively impact our results of operations, financial position and the market price of our common stock.\\nThe long sales cycle of our products and services may cause our operating results to fluctuate unexpectedly.\\nGenerally, we have a long sales cycle that can extend up to six months or longer. The complexity and expense associated with our products and services generally require a lengthy customer education, evaluation and approval process. Consequently, we may incur substantial expenses and devote significant management effort and expense to develop potential relationships that do not result in agreements or revenue and may prevent us from pursuing other opportunities. In addition, sales of our products and services have been and may in the future be delayed if customers delay approval or commencement of projects because of the timing of customers\\u2019 competitive evaluation processes or customers\\u2019 budgetary constraints and budget cycles. Long sales cycles for hardware products subject us to a number of significant risks over which we have limited control, including insufficient, excess or obsolete inventory, variations in inventory valuation and fluctuations in quarterly operating results.\\nOur restructuring plans incur substantial costs and may not result in the benefits we have anticipated, possibly having a negative effect on our future operating results. \\nIn recent fiscal years, we have initiated restructuring plans in an effort to better align our resources with our business strategy. We incur substantial costs to implement restructuring plans, and our restructuring activities may subject us to reputational risks and litigation risks and expenses. Our past restructuring plans do not provide any assurance that we will realize anticipated cost savings and other benefits or that additional restructuring plans will not be required or implemented in the future. In addition, our restructuring plans may have other consequences, such as attrition beyond our planned reduction in workforce, a negative effect on employee morale and productivity or our ability to attract highly skilled employees. Our competitors may also use our restructuring plans to seek to gain a competitive advantage over us. As a result, our restructuring plans may affect our revenue and other operating results in the future.\\n17&#34;\n        ],\n        &#34;sentence_embeddings&#34;: [\n            &#34;To attract, retain and motivate individuals with the requisite expertise, we may be required to grant large numbers of stock options or other stock-based incentive awards, which may be dilutive to existing stockholders and increase compensation expense, and pay significant base salaries and cash bonuses, which could harm our operating results.
