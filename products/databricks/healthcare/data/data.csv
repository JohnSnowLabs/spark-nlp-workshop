CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath, cough, and fever.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 67 -year-old
Russian speaking female with a past medical history
significant for diabetes type II, congestive heart failure of
unknown etiology, and hypertension.  The patient presents
with a three day history of progressively worsening shortness
of breath and dyspnea on exertion, wheezing, nonproductive
cough, and fever to 102 F on the day prior to admission.  Per
patient's husband, she denies any nausea or vomiting, chills
at night, night sweats, or chest pain.  She denies diarrhea.
She has been constipated.  The patient does have paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnea and two pillow orthopnea.  The patient
denies dysuria.  Fingersticks at home have been running
approximately 200 to 270's.  The patient denies any sick
contacts.

On the morning of presentation, the patient was noted to be
more lethargic by her husband.  [**Name (NI) **] report, her oxygen
saturation upon arrival of the EMS, was in the 80's.  The
patient was placed on 100% nonrebreather and arrived at [**Hospital3 **] - [**Hospital **] [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **] where she was noted to be
wheezing on examination.  She was given Albuterol and
Atrovent nebulizers with improvement of her oxygen saturation
from 90% to 94%, also on 100% nonrebreather.  She was also
administered 40 mg of IV Lasix times two with diuresis of
approximately one liter.  The patient denied any chest pain
throughout her entire presentation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Type II diabetes mellitus.
2.  Morbid obesity.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Congestive heart failure of unclear etiology with normal
[**Name (NI) 20679**] systolic function.  Question of left ventricular
hypertrophy on prior echocardiogram.
5.  Stasis dermatitis in bilateral lower extremities.
6.  No history of coronary artery disease.
7.  Restrictive lung disease, believed to be secondary to
morbid obesity.  The patient does have a home O2 requirement
of approximately 2.0 to 2.5 liters during the day time.
8.  Presumptive obstructive sleep apnea.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

ADMITTING MEDICATIONS:  1) Amaryl 2.0 mg po bid, 2)
Glucophage 1,000 mg po bid, 3) Singulair 10 mg po q day, 4)

mg po q day, 7) Avandia 8.0 mg po bid.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient denies any tobacco use.  She
lives with her husband, no alcohol use.  She is gravida II,
para II.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Negative for cancers.  Paternal grandmother
with diabetes mellitus and maternal aunt with coronary artery
disease.

PRIOR STUDIES:  Echocardiogram of 12/99 revealed mild left
axis deviation, mild mitral regurgitation, and mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension.  Exercise tolerance test MIBI
was without angina, no ischemic changes, left ventricular
ejection fraction was estimated at 64% with normal wall
motion.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature on presentation was 99.1
F, pulse is 84, blood pressure was 116/50, breathing at a
rate of 19, 96% on 100% nonrebreather.  Weight was
approximately 286 pounds.  In general, the patient was alert
and oriented times three, on 100% nonrebreather, in moderate
respiratory distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat:
pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and
accommodation bilaterally, oropharynx is clear.  Neck is
without lymphadenopathy, there is not any assessable jugular
venous pulse.  Chest examination reveals diffuse inspiratory
and expiratory wheezes and crackles with a prolonged
expiratory phase.  Cardiovascular examination is of regular
rate and rhythm without evidence of murmurs, rubs, or
gallops.

Abdomen is obese without tenderness, guarding, or distention,
there are normoactive bowel sounds.  There is no suprapubic
tenderness, no costovertebral angle tenderness.  Extremities
reveal trace bilateral upper extremity edema with 2+ to 3+
bilateral lower extremity edema, 1+ bilateral dorsalis pedis
pulses, and 2+ bilateral radial pulses with stage I stasis
dermatitis of the bilateral ankles.  Neurologic examination:
there are no focal motor deficits and the patient denies any
sensory changes.

ADMISSION LABORATORY DATA:  Include a white blood cell count
of 8.2, hematocrit of 39.6, platelets are 310,000.
Chemistries showed a sodium of 138, potassium of 5.0,
chloride 96, bicarbonate is 34, BUN is 17, creatinine 0.6,
serum glucose is 231.  Urinalysis was negative for blood,
nitrates, with 30 protein, greater than 1,000 glucose,
negative ketones, and no cells.  Troponin on admission was
1.4, CK on admission was 176 with an MB fraction of 2.0.
Second CK was 153 with an MB fraction of 3.0.  Calcium was
8.3, albumin 3.5, magnesium 4.9, phosphate 1.9.

Chest x-ray on admission showed florid congestive heart
failure with no evidence of pleural effusion, but perihilar
haziness and more confluent of opacification of the lung
bases and retrocardiac region.  Electrocardiogram showed a
left bundle branch block, stable from comparison
electrocardiogram of [**2165-10-30**], with no acute ST-T wave
changes indicative of ongoing ischemia.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted and started on a
regimen for treatment of acute pulmonary edema.  The patient
was aggressively diuresed with 80 mg of IV Lasix [**Hospital1 **] and
oxygenated with face mask O2 as needed to keep oxygen
saturations greater than 92%.  Levaquin 500 mg po q day was
also initiated for treatment of presumptive pneumonia.  The
patient remained initially stable overnight; however, on
hospital day two was noted to be increasingly somnolent.

An arterial blood gas was measured at this time which
revealed a pH of 7.2, pO2 of 42, pCO2 of 104.  The patient
was sent for a stat CT scan angiogram to rule out pulmonary
embolism.  This study, although grossly limited, did not find
any major perfusion deficits in the pulmonary vascular
system.  The patient was continued to be aggressively
diuresed.  She was also placed on BiPAP, however, the patient
did not tolerate the BiPAP apparatus.  The patient was
transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for closer
monitoring and optimization of respiratory status in the
setting of hypercarbic respiratory failure of unclear
etiology with underlying congestive heart failure and
pneumonia, both of which were being treated.

While in the Intensive Care Unit, the patient's oxygenation
was maximized with CPAP at bed time at 20 cm of water which
the patient intermittently tolerated and five liters of
oxygen via nasal cannula during the day.  Repeat arterial
blood gas prior to discharge from the Medical Intensive Care
Unit, was pH of 7.36 with CO2 of 87 and a pO2 of 61.  The
patient was transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 196**] team after her Medical
Intensive Care Unit course.

While on the floor, the patient continued to improve on CPAP
of 5.0 cm to 10 cm of water at bedtime.  She was unable to
tolerate any further increase beyond this point.  The
patient's oxygenation remained stable on four to five liters
of oxygen via nasal cannula during the day time.  The patient
continued to be aggressively diuresed.  It was noted that
intermittently throughout her hospital course, the patient
was experiencing gross hematuria through her Foley catheter.
At the time her subcutaneous heparin was discontinued.  In
addition, this was believed to be secondary to the fact that
the patient was intermittently on heparin around the time of
admission as empiric therapy for a possible pulmonary
embolus.

Upon returning to the Medical Floor, the patient was noted
also to have intermittent alarms on telemetry of paroxysmal
multi-focal atrial tachycardia and frequent runs of
supraventricular tachycardia.  The patient's Albuterol
nebulizers were believed to be contributing to this and these
were placed on a prn basis.  In addition, secondary to the
patient's persistent wheezing, her beta blocker was stopped
and she was switched to Diltiazem.  For further
characterization of the patient's congestive heart failure, a
transthoracic echocardiogram was obtained to assess the
patient's systolic function for any further causes for
possible diastolic dysfunction.

Echocardiogram windows were severely limited secondary to the
patient's body habitus; however, preliminary [**Location (un) 1131**] was of a
sustained systolic function.  Over the following day of her
hospitalization, the patient was evaluated by Physical
Therapy, was ambulating well, and was switched to po regimens
for her diuretics.  Fingerstick blood sugars throughout the
hospitalization remained well controlled and the patient was
covered with insulin sliding scale.

DISPOSITION:  The patient was discharged to a rehabilitation
facility in stable condition.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Stable to rehabilitation.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient is to follow up with
Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 19512**] in one to two weeks.  At this time she
will also be scheduled for further outpatient pulmonary
follow up for characterization of her restrictive lung
disease and for further evaluation of possible obstructive
lung disease.

Date of Birth:   [**2099-5-5**]       Sex:  F


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 68 year old
female with a history of morbid obesity, history of sleep
apnea, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, congestive heart
failure with diastolic dysfunction, restrictive lung disease,
the Emergency Department with a chief complaint of increasing
shortness of breath for four to five days.  The patient had
mild productive cough but no fevers or chills.  Prior to her
admission on [**2167-11-27**], her O2 saturation dropped from the
low-90s which is her baseline, down to 78 to 80% at home with
a heart rate in the 130s to 140s.

of 99.8 F.; blood pressure 123/70; heart rate 130 to 140;
respirations 30; 02 saturation 80% on room air, up to 95% on
four to five liters.  She was found to be atrial fibrillation
with rapid ventricular response to the 140s and started on
heparin and Diltiazem for rate control.

After admission to the Medical Floor on [**2167-11-27**], she
required more oxygen to the point of 100% face mask.
Arterial blood gas was initially 7.23, 98, 117, 100%
non-rebreather mask; 7.25, 95, 58, on 5 liters nasal cannula,
to 7.25, 99, 75, on Bi-PAP, then to 7.26, 96, 72, on C-PAP.
She was transferred to the Cardiac Care Unit on [**2167-11-28**],
for cardiac and respiratory failure.

Her issues in the Cardiac Care Unit included:
1.      Pulmonary:  Respiratory failure secondary to
hypoventilation secondary to morbid obesity in the setting of
restrictive lung disease and congestive heart failure.  The
patient did not require intubation and continued on Bi-PAP
and C-PAP.  She was started on potassium chloride and
progesterone to increase her respiratory drive.  On
[**2167-12-1**], the patient was started on nasal cannula O2
during the day with continued Bi-PAP at night.  Her O2
saturation on nasal cannula of four to five liters was as low
as 90%.
2.      Cardiovascular:  Congestive heart failure; the
patient was aggressively diuresed with intravenous Lasix, for
a total of nine liters negative while in the Cardiac Care
Unit.  Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation:  Started on
anti-coagulation on Diltiazem and digoxin.
3.      Gastrointestinal:  Constipation; aggressive bowel
regimen including Lactulose and GoLYTELY.
4.      Decreased mental status:  Believed to be secondary to
hypoxia and hypercarbia, resolved with improved oxygenation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Restrictive lung disease with PFTs, FEV of 1.38, 77%, FVC
    of 1.78, 71%, mild decrease in DLCO, on home O2 two to
    three liters at night.
2.  Morbid obesity.
3.  Presumed obstructive sleep apnea.
4.  Obesity hypoventilation syndrome.
5.  Congestive heart failure with diastolic dysfunction,
    echocardiogram in [**2166**] very limited, ejection fraction
    was 67% on stress test in [**2164**].  History of positive
    stress in 09 of [**2165**]; with reversible defects laterally
    and inferior laterally which was never worked up.
6.  Hypertension.
7.  Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
8.  Stasis dermatitis.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 98.9 F.; pulse 85 to 112;
blood pressure 93/60; respirations 23; O2 saturation 90% on
five liters nasal cannula, 95% on non-rebreather face mask.
In general, the patient alert, in no acute distress sitting
in a chair.  HEENT:  Oropharynx is clear.  Moist mucous
membranes.  Neck supple.  Unable to assess jugular venous
pressure secondary to morbid obesity.  Cardiovascular:
Irregularly irregular rhythm, normal S1 and S2.  Grade II/VI
systolic ejection murmur at right upper sternal border.
Lungs:  Rare crackles bilateral bases.  Abdomen obese, soft,
nontender, nondistended.  Positive bowel sounds.
Extremities:  Three plus non-pitting edema bilaterally to the
thighs.  Right upper extremity edema near PICC line.
Decreased range of motion of right shoulder secondary to
pain.  Erythema of bilateral calves but not warm to touch.

LABORATORY:  CBC within normal limits.  INR 2.8.  Sodium 143,
chloride 93, potassium 4.4, bicarbonate 41, BUN 12,
creatinine 0.4.

Chest x-ray unchanged from previous studies, shows congestive
heart failure and bilateral pleural effusions.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.      Pulmonary:  Hypercarbic respiratory failure secondary
to morbid obesity/hypoventilatioin and CHF.  She was continued on
nasal cannula during
the day.  Her O2 saturations improved to 93 to 97% on 2
liters via nasal cannula.  An attempt to continue Bi-PAP at
night was tried, however, the patient's O2 saturations
dropped to the high 80s on bi-PAP.  Instead, she was kept on
her nasal cannula at night.  The patient was tried on CPAP but
did not tolerate this either. 2. Cardiovascular:  Congestive
heart failure; the
patient continued to be diuresed with intravenous Lasix.
Total diuresis to date negative 12 to 15 liters.

Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter:  Cardiology
was consulted for a possible transesophageal echocardiogram
and cardioversion.  They did not recommend cardioversion now as
she cannot tolerate TEE due to need to lie flat.Plan to f/u with
cardiology as outpatient after several weeks anticoagualtion and
consider cardioversion at that time. The patient was
continued on Diltiazem and digoxin.  Her rate was still
poorly controlled.  A beta blocker was added.  There
is a questionable history of beta blocker intolerance
with wheezing reported on prior admit however pt's OMR med list
indicates that she was on atenolol at the time of admisison. She
had no wheezing while on beta blockers here ofr last 2 days of
admit.

Coronary artery disease:  The patient has a history of
positive stress tests with reversible defects.  Cardiology
was consulted for possible cardiac catheterization.  The
patient refused cardiac catheterization since she is unable
to lie flat.  The patient was continued on Statin and
aspirin.Repeat TTE was done that showed decraesd EF of 35-40%
and multiple regional wall motion abnormalities. beta blocker
and ACE-I have been added to help with CAD and CHF managament.

Aortic stenosis murmur on examination with mild AS confirmed on
echo this admit.
3. Hematology:  The patient on anti-coagulation for
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
4.      Right shoulder pain:  Right shoulder films were
normal.  The patient's pain improved spontaneously without
intervention.She appears to have right rotator cuff tendonitis
vs bursitis. [**Month (only) 116**] need PT to help increase use and could use
tylenol or low dose nsaids for increased pain.
5.      GI:  severe Constipation; the patient needs to be
maintained standing regimen of lactulose and titrate as needed to
maintain 1 BM per day
6. Diabetes mellitus: The patient was continued on home
medications, Glucophage and Avandia as well as a Regular
insulin sliding scale.Her glucotrol and amaryl were added back
the day prior to discharge.

Code Status:  The patient is ""DO NOT RESUSCITATE"",
""DO NOT INTUBATE"", however, patient is agreeable to Medical
Intensive Care Unit transfer for pressors as necessary.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Discharge patient to Rehabilitation.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:    Stable.Of note, pt says her breathing is
better than it has been in 2 years. She uses home O2.

AORTA: Normal aortic root diameter.
AORTIC VALVE: Severely thickened/deformed aortic valve leaflets.
Moderate AS.
MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. Moderate
mitral annular
calcification.
PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
Conclusions:
1. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left
ventricular
systolic function is very difficult to assess but it may be
normal (LVEF>55%).
2. The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed.
There is
moderate aortic valve stenosis.
3. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
4. Compared with the findings of the prior study (tape reviewed)
of [**2167-12-7**], LV
function may have improved.

COLONOSCOPY:
(Rectal polyp, polypectomy):
Distorted fragment of benign colonic mucosa with melanosis coli;
no
adenomatous change seen (multiple levels examined).


Brief Hospital Course:
71 yo Russian speaking female with extensive PMH presents with
weight gain and increased fatigue over the past 3-4 weeks.
1)Anemia: Pt was recently admitted in [**2170-5-31**] for anemia
work-up and found to have a bleeding gastric ectasia on EGD
which was removed.  Colonoscopy at that time revealed a benign
polyp.  Pt was found to have Hct of 18 on this admission.  Pt
was transferred to the CCU for monitoring and received 8 units
of PRBC with appropriate increase from 18 to 33.  The anemia was
thought to be subacute since she was never hemodynamically
unstable. GI was consulted.  Coumadin was held for suspected GI
bleed.  Colonoscopy was scheduled but held for persistent high
INR which was reversed with vitamin K.  Pt was a difficult prep
and required almost 4-5 days of prepping with Golytely and other
laxative.  Pt finally underwent colonoscopy which revealed no
source of bleed.  Since pt's Hct was stable 25 34-35, no further
diagnostic procedure was done.  If pt were to develop another
acute/subacute anemia, capsule study was recommended.

2) CHF: Pt has a long hx of CHF per old records. Last echo
before admission was from [**2168**] which showed EF of 35-40%.  She
got an echo on [**9-20**] which showed EF>55%.  Pt was initially
started on niseritide and lasix for diuresis for suspected CHF
exacerbation before her initial Hct of 18 came back.  Pt
received lasix between transfusions.  Lisinopril was held for
increased creatinine.  Pt's wt was stable and CHF status was
stable initially.  However, after 5 days of prep for the
colonoscopy, pt started to gain weight everyday and was net
positive daily.  Pt was refractory to standing IV Lasix and
Diuril.  She got PICC line placed under IR and Natrecor gtt was
started with still net positive daily.  Lasix gtt was added and
was titrated up to 10-15mg/hr which gave some reponse initially
but again became refractory to it.  Dopamine gtt was tried but
showed no improvement in UOP.  Pt lost PICC access.  However one
day, she started to respond extremely well with lasix gtt at
10mg/hr and IV Diuril 250 mg [**Hospital1 **] only (without Natrecor).  Pt's
admission weight was 130 kg (128 kg in a clinic note) and has
gotten up as high as 139 kg.  However, she was able to diuresis
1-2L/day and her weight came down to 130kg which is her
baseline.  The diuretics were changed to po form (Lasix po 120
mg [**Hospital1 **] and Diuril po 125 mg [**Hospital1 **]) and pt continued to diuresis
with net negative daily.  Pt's CHF was thought to be possibly
from AS.  If that is the case, valve replacement could improve
her symtoms. Review of the aortic valve orifice and
consideration of valve replacement should be discussed as
outpatient.  Pt needs to follow up with a [**Hospital 1902**] clinic within 1
week.

3) Afib: Pt with hx of atrial fibrillation but now in sinus
rhythm. Rate is bradycardic. Pt noted to have pauses on tele up
to 2 seconds. Pt was continued on amiodarone 200 mg po qd.
Coumadin was held in a setting of GI bleed and also for high INR
prior to colonoscopy.  Coumadin was restarted with goal INR of
[**1-2**].  Pt needs to be seen by her PCP to check her INR level.

4) COPD/restrictive lung dz: Pt was continued on 2 L of oxygen
which is her baseline.  Pt was getting nebulizer prn for
wheezing and SOB.  Pt is on home O2.

5) DM: Pt was initially continued on home meds of avandia and
glyburide and was cover with RISS.  However, avandia was held
while she was NPO.  She will be discharged with her home
regimen.

9) CODE: DNR/ DNI- this was re-discussed with patient and
husband to determine if pt still wants to be DNI/DNR as she has
been DNR/DNI on prior admissions.

IMPRESSION:
Compared with earlier the same day, the right IJ central line
has been retracted. The tip now overlies the SVC/RA junction.
There has been interval progression of left lower lobe collapse
and/or consolidation with interval obscuration of left
hemidiaphragm. A small left and also a small right pleural
effusion cannot be excluded. No pneumothorax is detected.

   RADIOLOGY  Final Report

CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST  [**2172-6-13**] 5:29 AM
IMPRESSION:
1. There is colonic wall thickening extending along the entire
course of the colon, with associated pericolonic inflammatory
stranding. This appearance is consistent with mild pancolitis,
of inflammatory or infectious etiologies. No pericolonic fluid
collections or free intraperitoneal air or fluid is identified.
2. Cholelithiasis without evidence of acute cholecystitis.

EKG ([**2172-6-13**])
Sinus rhythm; Borderline first degree A-V block; Left bundle
branch block
Lateral ST-T changes may be due to myocardial ischemia;
Generalized low QRS voltages
No change from previous

Echo ([**2172-6-15**])
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal study. At least moderate (may be severe)
calcific
aortic stenosis. LVH. Normal LVEF. If clincally indicated, a
repeat study with definity contrast may improve spectral doppler
fidelity to assess morte accurately the aortic valve
gradients/area. Compared to the prior report dated [**2170-9-20**], an
aortic valve area change cannot be excluded on the basis of the
current study. LVEF is probably similar.


Brief Hospital Course:
Pt is a 73 yo Ukranian female with MMP who presents with
hypotension, despite fluid resuscitation, and with diarrhea.

She initially required pressors (epinephrine).  After more
aggressive IVF use, she was able to be weaned off pressors.
During this time, she was also changed from flagyl to PO
vancomycin (for positive c. diff colitis), given her initial
lack of progress.  During this time, her SBPs were in the 90s,
often dropping to the 70s systolic.  Her initial acute on
chronic renal failure improved over the first few days.  After
this initial improvement, her course began to worsen again.  Her
blood pressures again required pressor support (despite IVF),
her WBC began to increase (with 14% bands) and her blood gas
showed a worsening acidemia.  Her urine culture grew
enterococcus.  Treatment with vanc and flagyl for c. diff and
gent/cefepine for UTI were begun.  Despite this, she required
more pressor support and her respirations became less strong.
She expired at 5:59 pm on [**2172-6-22**].

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY: Hypoxia, CHF, rule out PE.

 TECHNIQUE: Axial images of the chest after the administration of 100 cc of
 Optiray per fast bolus technique.

 Multiplanar re-formations were performed.

 Comparison with prior CT from [**1-/2166**].

 CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: There is suboptimal opacification of the
 pulmonary arteries due to suboptimal timing of the contrast bolus.  There is
 no evidence of discrete filling defects within the main branches of the
 pulmonary arteries.  Again seen is prominence of the pulmonary artery
 measuring 3.2 cm,   Again seen are several small mediastinal and hilar lymph
 nodes, some of which appear tatty replaced and others appear calcified.  They
 are stable in size and number compared to a yeare ago.  Also noted is
 mediastinal lipomatosis.  There are tiny bilateral pleural effusions.  Also
 noted is increased septal line thickening throughout both lungs, clearly
 increased compared to prior examination.  The images are slightly degraded due
 to motion, but there appears to be bilateral subtle ground glass opacity.

 The previously noted prominent bronchi are unchanged.  The upper abdominal
 structures appear unremarkable.

 IMPRESSION:
 1. Suboptimal CT pulmonary angiogram without evidence of definite filling
 defects within the main or major branches of the pulmonary artery.  The
 studcannot exclude emboli in the segmental divisons..

 2. Stable multiple mediastinal lymph nodes, unchanged compared to one year
 previously.

 The cardiac silhouette appears enlarged, there is vascular engorgement,
 perihilar haziness and more confluent areas of opacification in the lung bases

 CHEST, SINGLE VIEW, TIME 3:42: Evaluation of the study is extremely limited
 due to patient motion, body habitus, and low lung volumes.  Taking this into

 PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH dated [**2167-11-27**] is compared to [**MD Number(3) 14176**] radiograph
 dated [**2167-3-31**]. The patient has a large amount of overlying soft tissue in the
 lordotic position. This slightly limits the portion of visualized lung. There
 is a large cardiac silhouette. There is fluid in the minor fissure with
 bilateral diffuse infiltrates and upper zone redistribution. The bases of the
 lung cannot be assessed due to the patient's positioning so effusions cannot
 be excluded. Compared to the prior study, there has been interval increase in
 the bilateral diffuse infiltrates.

 IMPRESSION: Limited exam, however, fluid in the minor fissure. Large cardiac
 silhouette and diffuse infiltrates likely represent pulmonary edema. No focal
 consolidation is noted to suggest pneumonia.

 [**Hospital 3**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
  71 year old woman with CHF, needs Dopamine plus diuretics.  Could not get
  bedside PICC.
 REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
  Placement of PICC
 ______________________________________________________________________________
                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  CHF, chronic renal insufficiency, need for IV dopamine and
 diuretics.  Could not get bedside PICC.

 PROCEDURE/FINDINGS:  The procedure was performed by Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 2581**] and
 [**Name5 (PTitle) 179**], the staff radiologist who was present and supervising.  The left upper
 arm was prepped and draped in the standard sterile fashion.  Since no suitable
 superficial veins were visible, ultrasound was used for localization for a
 suitable vein.  The left basilic vein was patent and compressible.  After
 local anesthesia with 3 cc of 1% lidocaine, the basilic vein was entered under
 ultrasonographic guidance with a 21 gauge micropuncture needle.  A 0.018
 guidewire was advanced under fluoroscopy into the superior vena cava.  Based
 on the markers on the guidewire, it was determined that a length of 44 cm will
 be suitable.  The PICC line was trimmed to length and advanced over a 4 FR
 introducer sheath under fluoroscopic guidance into the superior vena cava. The
 sheath was removed.  The catheter was flushed.  A final chest x-ray was
 obtained.  The film demonstrates the tip to be in the superior vena cava just
 above the atrium.  The line is ready for use.  A Statlock was applied and the
 line heplocked.

 IMPRESSION:

 Successful placement of a 44 cm total length dual lumen PICC line with the tip
 in the superior vena cava ready for use.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 Left ankle and left foot AP, lateral and oblique.

 INDICATION:  Diabetic foot, cellulitis in left ankle with pain, swelling
 especially medial malleolus, evaluate for osteoarthritis.

 FINDINGS:  AP, oblique and lateral view of the left ankle demonstrate diffuse
 soft tissue swelling but absence of any acute skeletal trauma.  The position
 of the talus in the mortise is anatomic.  No significant degenerative changes
 can be identified, however, the soft tissue swelling surrounding the ankle
 joint makes detail assessment difficult.

 The lateral view confirms the edematous soft tissue swelling and discloses the
 presence of rather advanced arterial wall calcifications both in dorsalis
 pedis and posterior tibial artery area.  There exists a half cm planter heel
 spur and mild contour irregularities in the dorsal aspect of the foot
 consistent with some osteoarthritis.  The major joint spaces, however, appear
 preserved.  AP, oblique and lateral view of the left foot also exclude the
 presence of an acute skeletal injury.  Degenerative changes in the form of
 joint distance reduction exists in the first metatarsophalangeal joint area
 with contour irregularities of the joint surfaces and increased sclerosis in
 the adjacent skeletal structures.  No significant hallux valgus deformity is
 present.  Moderate degree of hammer toe deformities are seen in the distal
 phalanges most marked in the third, fourth and fifth toe.  The tarsophalangeal
 joint and internal tarsal joints appear quite well preserved with only minor
 degenerative changes.

 There exists no prior similar study in our records available for comparison.

 Edematous soft tissue swelling surrounding the ankle joint, but no significant
 degenerative changes and no evidence of acute skeletal trauma.

 INDICATION:  73-year-old woman with suspected C. diff, evaluate for colitis,
 obstruction, or masses.

 COMPARISON:  None.

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT-acquired contiguous axial images were obtained from the lung
 bases to the pubic symphysis.  Multiplanar reconstructions were performed.

 CONTRAST:  Oral contrast only was administered.  No intravenous contrast was
 given.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN:  No pulmonary nodules or parenchymal consolidation is seen.
 There are some calcified lymph nodes within the right inferior hilar region,
 which may represent changes from prior granulomatous disease.  There are
 calcifications within the coronary arteries noted.

 There is limited evaluation of solid organs without intravenous contrast,
 however, the liver, kidneys, spleen, and pancreas are within normal limits.
 The pancreas is slightly atrophic.  Calcification is seen within the
 gallbladder, likely reflecting gallstones, without any evidence of
 pericholecystic fluid or inflammatory stranding.  No pathologically
 retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy is seen.  The small bowel is
 normal in appearance, without any evidence of bowel wall thickening or
 dilatation.  No free air or free fluid is seen.

 There is diffuse mild colonic wall thickening, extending from the rectum to
 the cecum.  There is some associated pericolonic inflammatory stranding along
 the entire colon.  The colon is not distended.  There are no pericolonic fluid
 collections or foci of air.

 retroperitoneal lymph nodes.  The stomach and small bowel are unremarkable.

 There has been mild interval improvement in the diffuse colonic wall
 thickening which now involves portions of the ascending, descending and
 sigmoid colon.  The colon is not distended.

 CT PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  There is a Foley catheter within the bladder.
 The uterus is normal in appearance.

 The soft tissues reveal mild anasarca.

 Osseous windows demonstrate no suspicious lytic or sclerotic foci.

 Multiplanar reformatted images confirm the above findings.

 IMPRESSION:

 1.  Mild improvement in colonic wall thickening, now predominantly involving
 the ascending, descending and sigmoid colon.  The appearance is consistent
 with resolving colitis.

ALLERGIES: NKDA

TRANSFERING EVENT: Pt was initially admitted to floor [**11-26**] with 4-5 day history of increasing SOB and 10 days without bowel movement. She was in a-fib with rapid response to 140s. She R/O, has fair cardiac fuctioning, was rate controlled and diuresed. She had numerous enemas, laxatives, etc with no results, though x-ray showed massive amt stool in bowel. On [**11-27**] she became acutely short of breath with her CO2 up to 98 and pH down to 7.23. She was transfered to unit,further diuresed and placed on bi-pap. By [**11-28**] she was able to wean to 40% neb with sats in the low 90s.

PMH: NIDDM, HTN, CHF with nl EF- last admission [**1-29**]. Restrictive lung disease and probable sleep apnea. On home 02. Chronic constipation with QD enemas. Bilaterat lower extremitiy venous insufficiencey with chronic cellulitis.Morbid obesity.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
ID: Pt has been afebrile with nl white ct.
RESP: Pts sats have continued to improve on 40% shovel mask with sats up to 97%. She will quickly de-sat to the low 80s when mask is off. She continue to rales up 1/2 on R and [**12-3**] on L. Episodes of sleep apnea, with transiently low sats have been noted at night when she if off bi-pap. She is now to receive bi-pap every night. Plan is for sleep study prior to D/c.
CV: Pt remains in a-fib. Rate in 80-90s, though she did go up to 1-teens prior to her dilt 90mg. She is also on digoxin. BP has been stable in 100-140/50s. She has been started on coumadin and as INR is 2.8 today heparin was shut off and coumadin dose decreased.
RENAL: Pt continues to be aggressively diuresed with lasix 60mg IV being given tid. She is about 10 liters neg LOS and over 2 liters thus far for today. Creatinine is one and has not bumped with diuresis.
GI: Pt was finally given [**Last Name (un) **] and magcitrate and has had numerous liquid stools. She is somewhat more comfortable. Last stool [**12-2**] at 6am G-.
ENDO: Pt on glucophage and ss reg insulin. Sugars have been mostly in 150s.
MS/SOCIAL: Pt alert and oriented. She is primarily Russian speaking, but has some English. She spends most of her time in the chair as she is better able to breath there. She is able to get up and move from bed to chair with minimal assistance. She is married and her spouse is very loving and supportive.
PLAN: Resp failure: continue aggressive diuresis. Bi-pap at night or with SOB. Keep careful I & O.
      Alt in Bowel: Continue with laxatives and enemal prn.
      D/C planning: Pt need sleep test before d/c and may need bi-pap at home.

entire body. An additional two units of FFP had been ordered but
were held due to concern for transfusion reaction.

On arrival here, he was bradycardic to the 30s with a 208/79. He
was examined here off of sedation and was noted to move all
extremities symmetrically. While in [**Hospital1 18**] ED, received 50 mg
Benadryl IV (for rash), was bolused with Propofol and started on
Propofol drip, and loaded with 1 gram of IV Dilantin. For repeat
of INR 1.8, he was ordered for another 2 units FFP after getting
Solumedrol 125 mg IV and Pepcid 20 mg IV.

He was seen by Neurosurgery who felt that surgical intervention
was not warranted at this time.

Per his wife, he had had no complaints in the days leading up to
today's event.

CT without contrast [**5-2**]
TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast head CT.

FINDINGS: There is a focal rounded area of hyperattenuation
measuring 2.5 x 2.3 cm in the left frontoparietal region
consistent with intraparenchymal hemorrhage, relatively
unchanged in appearance from the outside films. There is a thin
hypodense halo consistent with surrounding edema. There is no
evidence of mass effect, shift of normally midline structures or
hydrocephalus. The [**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation is
preserved. Note is made of extensive mucosal thickening within
the visualized maxillary and ethmoid sinuses bilaterally. The
mastoid air cells are well aerated. Bone windows demonstrate no
evidence of acute fracture or osseous lesion.

IMPRESSION: 2.5 cm intraparenchymal hemorrhage within the left
frontoparietal region with associated edema. No evidence of
hydronephrosis, midline shift or mass effect. Extensive mucosal
thickening within the visualized portions of the paranasal
sinuses as described above.

CT with contrast [**5-2**]
CTA of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] with multiplanar reformatted images.

PRELIMINARY REPORT: Exam is extremely technically limited by
suboptimal contrast bolus. Within the limits of the study, the
major vessels of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] appear patent. There is a
dominant left vertebral artery. Left intraparenchymal hemorrhage
is again seen. Full [**Location (un) 1131**] to follow after post-processed
images are acquired. Wet [**Location (un) 1131**] to CCC at 9:50 p.m. on
[**2161-5-2**]. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], pager [**Numeric Identifier 21129**].

FINDINGS: Study is extremely limited by suboptimal contrast
bolus, which precludes evaluation of the intracranial
circulation. No gross abnormalities are identified. There is a
dominant left vertebral artery, with a possible posterior
inferior cerebellar artery termination of the right vertebral
artery. If clinically warranted, a repeat study could be
performed for further evaluation.

IMPRESSION: Limted study secondary to suboptimal contrast bolus.
Grossly normal circle of [**Location (un) 431**] with no large aneurysm.
The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist

[**5-2**] EKG:
Sinus bradycardia
Right bundle branch block
Lateral ST changes are nonspecific
No change from previous

[**5-2**] INITIAL CXR:
CHEST, SINGLE PORTABLE VIEW: Comparison is made to [**2159-10-25**], a CT and radiograph. The tip of the endotracheal tube lies
10 cm above the carina, above the thoracic inlet. The heart is
enlarged. The pulmonary artery is again prominent. A rounded
opacity in the right hilum most likely also represents a
pulmonary artery. There is opacity obscuring the left
hemidiaphragm, which may represent atelectasis. There is no
evidence of pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The left
cardiophrenic angle is excluded.
Old healed right rib fracture.

IMPRESSION:
1. More proximal than ideal positioning of endotracheal tube,
above the thoracic inlet. This finding was discussed with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] in the ER shortly after the study.
2. Likely left lower lobe atelectasis.
3. Cardiomegaly.

[**5-3**] MRI:
Multiplanar MRI imaging without and with gadolinium was
performed. Sequences included axial T1, T2, FLAIR, gradient-echo
images. Sagittal T1- weighted images were also obtained. After
administration of gadolinium, sagittal, axial, and coronal
T1-weighted images were obtained. MRA of the brain was also
performed. Axial 3D multiplanar time-of-flight images were
displayed.

MRI OF THE BRAIN WITHOUT AND WITH GADOLINIUM: There is again
noted a left parietal hemorrhage, which measures 2.5 x 2.2 cm
and is probably unchanged when compared to CT performed on the
prior day. There is a moderate amount of edema around the
hemorrhage. There is no evidence of shift of midline structures
or herniations. After administration of gadolinium, there is no
evidence of abnormal enhancement in the area to suggest
underlying tumor. There are no other areas of susceptibility
artifact present throughout the brain. No other obvious areas of
hemorrhage, acute or chronic hemorrhages are seen. The
ventricles are of normal size, which is unchanged when compared
to prior study. There are again noted multiple areas of
increased T2-weighted signal in the periventricular white
matter, likely representing chronic microvascular infarcts.

There is again noted moderate-to-severe opacification of the
bilateral maxillary sinuses with mucosal thickening likely a
retention cyst in the right maxillary sinus. There is also
moderate opacification of the ethmoid cells and mild mucosal
thickening of the sphenoid sinuses. There is also mild mucosal
thickening of the frontal sinuses bilaterally.

MRA of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**]: The major tributaries of the circle
of [**Location (un) 431**] are patent. There is no area of significant stenosis
or aneurysmal dilatation. Within the limits of coverage of this
study, no sign of arteriovenous malformation is apparent.

IMPRESSION:

1. Intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the left upper lobe appears to
be unchanged when compared to prior study. No evidence of
abnormal enhancement to suggest an underlying tumor. Within the
limits of coverage of the study, no sign of aneurysmal
malformations apparent.

2. Normal circle of [**Location (un) 431**] MRA.

3. Sinus disease as described above.

EEG [**5-3**]:
FINDINGS:
ABNORMALITY #1: The background is low voltage and slow in the
delta
frequency range with bursts of moderate voltage generalized
slowing
bifrontally predominant with superimposed fast activity. There
are
bursts of moderate slowing in the delta frequency range
bifrontally
predominant.
BACKGROUND: As above.
HYPERVENTILATION: Could not be performed because the patient was

intubated.
INTERMITTENT PHOTIC STIMULATION: Was not performed because this
was a
portable study.
SLEEP: Normal transitions of the sleep architecture were not
seen.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Irregular bradycardia with a rate range between
36-48
bpm.
IMPRESSION: This is an abnormal routine EEG due to the presence
of low
voltage and slow background activity in the delta frequency
range with
bursts of generalized slowing bifrontally predominant. This
finding
represents a severe encephalopathy most likely due to the
medication
effect. There were no clear epileptiform discharges recorded. An

irregular bradycardia was noted.

REPEAT HEAD CT [**5-4**]:
COMPARISON: Head CT dated [**2161-5-4**].

TECHNIQUE: MDCT-acquired images of the head were obtained
without IV contrast.

FINDINGS: Left temporal intraparenchymal hemorrhage with
surrounding hypodensity of the brain parenchyma is not
significantly changed compared to the previous study, measuring
24 x 25 mm. No definite new foci of hemorrhage are seen. The
ventricles are stable in size. There is no midline shift. Basal
cisterns appear patent. The osseous structures and sinuses are
not significantly changed.

IMPRESSION: No significant interval change compared to the study
performed eleven hours prior.

REPEAT CXR [**5-4**]:
FINDINGS: Patient is status post intubation, the ET tube is
located 5.1 cm above the carina. Otherwise, the chest radiograph
is unchanged. Dobbhoff overlies the stomach. The cardiac and
mediastinal contours are stable. Patchy areas of increased
opacification in the retrocardiac and right infrahilar region
are unchanged.

IVC FILTER PLACED:
PROCEDURE AND DETAIL: The patient was brought into the
interventional suite and placed in a supine position. After he
was adequately sedated per nursing, he was prepped and draped in
the normal sterile manner. Retrograde right common femoral
venous access was obtained using a 19-gauge single wall puncture
needle, a 0.035 starter wire, and a 4-French sheath. The tip of
the 4 French sheath was placed into the femoral vein and an
iliac venogram was obtained. Over the [**Last Name (un) 21130**] wire, the sheath
was then advanced into the iliac system after confirming there
is no evidence of thrombus and an inferior vena cavogram was
obtained.

At this time, the sheath was changed over a wire for a 6 FR
sheath which was positioned 1.5 cm distal to the origin of the
lowest renal vein. The vena cava was then measured on venogram
and found to be ___ exactly 30 mm in diameter in its infrarenal
portion. We chose the OptEase IVC filter at this time. It was
loaded into the 6 French sheath and deployed atraumatically 1.5
cm distal to the renal veins. The sheath was pulled and a static
view of the filter and its position was obtained. A venogram was
then obtained following placement of the filter. It was in
excellent position, without evidence of tilt.

At this time, all catheters, wires and sheaths were removed and
the access site was sealed with direct pressure. The patient
tolerated the procedure well and was taken to the recovery room
in stable condition. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was present and scrubbed for
the entire procedure and fluoroscopy was utilized.

VENOGRAPHIC FINDINGS: There is a widely patent right common
iliac vein. There is some reflux into the left common iliac
vein. There is brisk forward flow. There is a widely patent
inferior vena cava that is approximately 30 mm in diameter in
its infrarenal portion. There is no evidence of thrombus in the
right iliac vein or the inferior vena cava. We clearly see the
renal veins at the mid L2. We see deployment and atraumatic
placement of an OptEase recoverable IVC filter 1.5 cm distal to
the lowest renal vein at L3.

DR. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]  [**2161-5-4**]

REPEAT CXR [**5-9**]:
There has been placement of a tracheostomy tube which terminates
in the tracheal lumen at the thoracic inlet level. There is no
pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum. Cardiac and mediastinal
contours are stable. There is improving aeration at both lung
bases with residual patchy and linear atelectasis. Gastric
distention is observed in the imaged portion of the upper
abdomen.

IMPRESSION: Satisfactory tracheostomy tube positioning. No
pneumomediastinum or pneumothorax.

KUB [**5-12**]:
FINDINGS: There is evidence of dilated loops of large bowel.
There is an unusual appearance to the bowel in the right upper
quadrant, concerning for cecal bascule. Study is limited as the
entire abdomen is not imaged. Repeat films with decubitus and
upright films, including the entire abdomen would be helpful for
further evaluation.

Findings discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 21131**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 5740**] via phone on [**2161-5-12**], 2 p.m.


Brief Hospital Course:
75 year old right handed man with past medical history coronary
artery disease status post inferior MI, status post cath [**10-19**]
with mild LAD disease, history of pulmonary embolus, history of
DVT on heparin SC so on lifelong coumadin, who presented with
episode of non-sensical speech consistent with a Wernicke's type
aphasia. Outside hospital imaging shows a left temporal
hemorrhage, with etiology for hemorrhage considered either
spontaneous bleed with no underlying pathology, related to
coumadin, or amyloid angiopathy exacerbated by coumadin.  There
were no microhemorrhages suggestive of amyloid, but the location
in the cortex suggested this diagnosis.

Hospital course:
1. Neuro:
-He was inbubated for airway protection and admitted to the ICU
with q1hour neuro checks.  As his exam stabilized (when examined
off propofol), neuro checks were liberalized.
-He was reversed with FFP to achieve a goal INR<1.4; his
platelets remained > 100, and hct> 30.  Systolic blood pressure
was kept within goal of 100-150 systolic.
-Imaging was performed to look for an underlying lesion; MRA was
unrevealing of vascular anomaly, and MRI with gado showed no
enhancement at the area of the bleed.  He should have imaging
repeated in [**5-21**] weeks from the date of admission.
-EEG was performed, which revealed encephalopathy, with no
epileptiform activity.
-Although there were no clinical signs to suggest seizure, he
had been dilantin loaded and maintained on dilantin for the
location of the bleed being cortical and potentially a seizure
focus.  After approximately ten days, with no seizure activity,
this was weaned off.
-At ten days following the bleed, for both cardiac and
neuro-protection ASA 81 mg was started.
-Exam remained stable when the patient was off propofol, but
seemed to reveal some mild right hemiparesis in comparison to
the left side; without passey-muir valve, speech and language
was difficult to assess.  However, his naming of both low- and
high-frequency objects (patient mouthed words) seemed to be
intact.  Follows only midline commands

2. Heme:
-As he was no longer a coumadin candidate, an IVC filter was
placed [**2161-5-4**].  He was continued on pneumoboots for the
remainder of the hospitalization.

3. Cards:
-He ruled out for MI by enzyme, and cardiac telemetry monitoring
was considered in the ICU.
-Echo was performed [**4-30**] and revealed some LVH, mild valvular
disease, and normal EF; there was no clot seen in the heart.

4. Pulm:
-He had been intubated for airway protection initially; within
48 hours of intubation, extubation was attempted.  Hours later,
he was reintubated for hypercarbic respiratory failure off the
vent, with metabolic acidosis (pH 7.09).  He was succesful
weaned off the ventilator [**5-20**] and has remained stable on trach
collar for the past two days
-To look for underlying cause of his respiratory failure, chest
xray was performed which demonstrated pneumonia; bronchoscopy
was also performed.  BAL fluid gram stain showed:
      2+   (1-5 per 1000X FIELD):   POLYMORPHONUCLEAR
LEUKOCYTES.
      2+   (1-5 per 1000X FIELD):   GRAM POSITIVE COCCI.
                                    IN PAIRS.
      1+    (<1 per 1000X FIELD):   GRAM POSITIVE ROD(S).
Culture eventually grew coag + staph sensitive to oxacillin, and
haemophilus influenza.
-He was treated for pneumonia with vanco + levaquin and
oxacillin; before seven days of therapy, vanco was discontinued
and dicloxicillin had been started.
-He underwent tracheostomy placement [**5-8**].

5. Endo:
-RISS and QID finger stick blood glucose was continued while in
the ICU.

6. ID:
-See above for pneumonia treatment.
-For abdominal distention, c-diff was sent and was negative.

7. GI:
-NGT was initiated for meds, and tube feeds were stated when the
patient was stable.  Prevacid was also initiated.
-He had a PEG tube placed [**5-8**] along with the trach.
-He had abdominal distention around [**5-12**]; abdominal xray showed
dilated large bowel loops and the questions of a cecal bascule.

8. FEN:
-Daily lytes, I=O followed while in house.

9. Code:
-Discussion was held with the patient's wife, and the patient
was kept full code.

 INDICATION:  75-year-old male with expressive aphasia, reported
 intraparenchymal bleed at outside hospital.

 TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast head CT.

 FINDINGS:  There is a focal rounded area of hyperattenuation measuring 2.5 x
 2.3 cm in the left frontoparietal region consistent with intraparenchymal
 hemorrhage, relatively unchanged in appearance from the outside films.  There
 is a thin hypodense halo consistent with surrounding edema.  There is no
 evidence of mass effect, shift of normally midline structures or
 hydrocephalus.  The [**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter differentiation is preserved.  Note is
 made of extensive mucosal thickening within the visualized maxillary and
 ethmoid sinuses bilaterally.  The mastoid air cells are well aerated.  Bone
 windows demonstrate no evidence of acute fracture or osseous lesion.

 IMPRESSION:  2.5 cm intraparenchymal hemorrhage within the left frontoparietal
 region with associated edema.  No evidence of hydronephrosis, midline shift or
 mass effect.  Extensive mucosal thickening within the visualized portions of
 the paranasal sinuses as described above.

 These findings were discussed with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 18936**] at the time of dictation.

 PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  History of DVT and PE with a hemorrhagic CVA and
 contraindication to anticoagulation.

 POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  History of DVT and PE with a hemorrhagic CVA and
 contraindication to anticoagulation.

 PROCEDURE:  A diagnostic venogram with placement of an OptEase IVC filter,
 completion arteriogram.

 SURGEON:  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 276**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]

 ASSISTANT:  [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 2914**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 264**]

 ANESTHESIA:  Local with sedation.

 PROCEDURE AND DETAIL:  The patient was brought into the interventional suite
 and placed in a supine position.  After he was adequately sedated per nursing,
 he was prepped and draped in the normal sterile manner.  Retrograde right
 common femoral venous access was obtained using a 19-gauge single wall
 puncture needle, a 0.035 starter wire, and a 4-French sheath.  The tip of the
 4 French sheath was placed into the femoral vein and an iliac venogram was
 obtained.  Over the [**Last Name (un) 9205**] wire, the sheath was then advanced into the iliac
 system after confirming there is no evidence of thrombus and an inferior vena
 cavogram was obtained.

 At this time, the sheath was changed over a wire for a 6 FR sheath which was
 positioned 1.5 cm distal to the origin of the lowest renal vein.  The vena
 cava was then measured on venogram and found to be ___ exactly 30 mm in
 diameter in its infrarenal portion.  We chose the OptEase IVC filter at this
 time.  It was loaded into the 6 French sheath and deployed atraumatically 1.5
 cm distal to the renal veins.  The sheath was pulled and a static view of the
 filter and its position was obtained.  A venogram was then obtained following
 placement of the filter.  It was in excellent position, without evidence of
 tilt.

 (Cont)
 At this time, all catheters, wires and sheaths were removed and the access
 site was sealed with direct pressure.  The patient tolerated the procedure
 well and was taken to the recovery room in stable condition.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] was
 present and scrubbed for the entire procedure and fluoroscopy was utilized.

 VENOGRAPHIC FINDINGS:  There is a widely patent right common iliac vein.
 There is some reflux into the left common iliac vein.  There is brisk forward
 flow.  There is a widely patent inferior vena cava that is approximately 30 mm
 in diameter in its infrarenal portion.  There is no evidence of thrombus in
 the right iliac vein or the inferior vena cava.  We clearly see the renal
 veins at the mid L2.  We see deployment and atraumatic placement of an OptEase
 recoverable IVC filter 1.5 cm distal to the lowest renal vein at L3.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  75-year-old male with left temporal lobe hemorrhage.  Rule out
 underlying mass or aneurysm.

 COMPARISONS:  Comparison is made to CT scan from [**2161-5-2**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar MRI imaging without and with gadolinium was performed.
 Sequences included axial T1, T2, FLAIR, gradient-echo images.  Sagittal T1-
 weighted images were also obtained.  After administration of gadolinium,
 sagittal, axial, and coronal T1-weighted images were obtained.  MRA of the
 brain was also performed.  Axial 3D multiplanar time-of-flight images were
 displayed.

 MRI OF THE BRAIN WITHOUT AND WITH GADOLINIUM:  There is again noted a left
 parietal hemorrhage, which measures 2.5 x 2.2 cm and is probably unchanged
 when compared to CT performed on the prior day.  There is a moderate amount of
 edema around the hemorrhage.  There is no evidence of shift of midline
 structures or herniations.  After administration of gadolinium, there is no
 evidence of abnormal enhancement in the area to suggest underlying tumor.
 There are no other areas of susceptibility artifact present throughout the
 brain.  No other obvious areas of hemorrhage, acute or chronic hemorrhages are
 seen.  The ventricles are of normal size, which is unchanged when compared to
 prior study.  There are again noted multiple areas of increased T2-weighted
 signal in the periventricular white matter, likely representing chronic
 microvascular infarcts.

 There is again noted moderate-to-severe opacification of the bilateral
 maxillary sinuses with mucosal thickening likely a retention cyst in the right
 maxillary sinus.  There is also moderate opacification of the ethmoid cells
 and mild mucosal thickening of the sphenoid sinuses.  There is also mild
 mucosal thickening of the frontal sinuses bilaterally.

 MRA of the circle of [**Location (un) **]:  The major tributaries of the circle of [**Location (un) **]
 are patent.  There is no area of significant stenosis or aneurysmal
 dilatation.  Within the limits of coverage of this study, no sign of
 arteriovenous malformation is apparent.

 NONCONTRAST HEAD CT SCAN.

 FINDINGS:  Again seen is a focal rounded area of hyperattenuation, measuring
 approximately 2.6 x 2.4 cm in the left temporal region, consistent with
 parenchymal hemorrhage, unchanged from prior study.  Thin hypodense halo
 representing vasogenic edema also appears unchanged.  Mass effect from this
 hemorrhage is unchanged.  There is no shift of normally midline structures. No
 new hemorrhage is identified.  Intracranial carotid calcifications are again
 seen.  Previously described extensive chronic sinus disease also appears
 unchanged.

 IMPRESSION:  Essentially unchanged from prior study with stable appearance of
 left temporal parenchymal hemorrhage with small zone of surrounding vasogenic
 edema. No evidence of new hemorrhage.

 INDICATION:  Evaluate for cecal volvulus.

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT-acquired axial images from the lung bases to the pubic
 symphysis were acquired with intravenous contrast and displayed with 5-mm
 slice thickness.  Multiplanar reformations were performed.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  There is bibasilar atelectasis.
 The liver and gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, and adrenal glands are
 unremarkable.  The right kidney contains a cyst.  An IVC filter is seen in
 place.  The aorta and the major arterial tributaries appear patent.  There are
 atherosclerotic calcifications along the aorta and iliac vessels.  The stomach
 is fluid filled and the small bowel is decompressed.
 The entire colon is air filled and most of the loops are dilated.  There is no
 evidence for a cecal volvulus with the cecum being in its normal location.
 Fecal material is seen in the cecum.  There is no definite evidence for
 pneumatosis to suggest bowel ischemia. THe SMA and SMV are well opacifidied
 with no evidense of occlusive ischemia.
 There is copious free intraabdominal air. There is a PEG tube which was,
 according to the surgical team, recently placed and likely explain the free
 air, with the tube located at the epicenter of peritoneal air collection.  No
 free fluid is seen in the abdomen. No mesenteric or retroperitoneal
 lymphadenopathy is seen.

 CT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  There is a caliber change of the
 dilated descending colon at the transition to the sigmoid colon but no
 definite obstruction can be seen and there is fluid and air in the rectum.  No
 free pelvic fluid is seen.  No pelvic lymphadenopathy is seen.  The bladder is
 unremarkable, containing a Foley catheter.  The prostate is not clearly
 visualized.  Note is made of some high density material in some of the colonic
 loops which may represent old contrast material.

 BONE WINDOWS:  There are degenerative changes in the lumbar spine and the
 sacrum.  No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions are seen.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Dilated colon and particularly dilated cecum and ascending colon filled
 with loose fecal material (>12 cm) without evidence of cecal volvulus or
 direct evidence of ischemia.
 2.  Free intraabdominal air, likely due to the recently placed PEG tube.

 MR HEAD

 HISTORY:  76-year-old male with left temporal hemorrhage.  Please assess for
 underlying lesions.

 MRI BRAIN:

 TECHNIQUE:  Sagittal pre- and post-gadolinium T1; axial post- gadolinium T1,
 T2, FLAIR, GRE; and coronal post-gadolinium T1-weighted images were obtained.
 Axial DWI images were also obtained.

 Since [**2161-5-3**], the previously seen left temporal hemorrhage has largely
 resolved with minimal linear hemosiderin deposition predominantly in the
 subcortical white matter region.  No underlying masses, abnormal enhancement,
 or vascular malformations are seen.

 Again seen are moderate amount of periventricular and subcortical white matter
 T2 hyperintensities, which likely represent small vessel ischemic changes.

 There is also prominence of the ventricles, sulci, and basal cisterns, which
 likely represent atrophy.

 The previously seen soft tissue change of the paranasal sinuses have improved
 significantly, with some minimal residual within the right maxillary sinus and
 the posterior ethmoid air cells.

 Prosthetic lenses are seen within the globes bilaterally as before.

 No osseous abnormalities are seen.

 MRA HEAD:

 TECHNIQUE:  3D time-of-flight MRA of the head was performed with maximal
 intensity projection 3D reconstructions.

 FINDINGS:  No aneurysms, stenoses, occlusions, or vascular lesions are seen.
 Note is made of a small right vertebral artery, as before, which is a normal
 variant.

 IMPRESSION:  Since [**2161-5-3**], near complete resolution of left temporal
 hemorrhage with minimal hemosiderin remaining.  No underlying masses or

Date of Birth:  [**2193-10-1**]        Sex:  F

Service:  NB


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Baby Girl [**Known lastname **] was born to a
30 year old gravida 4, para 3 to 4 mom with prenatal
laboratories B positive, antibody screen negative, hepatitis
B surface antigen negative, RPR nonreactive, Rubella immune,
unknown Group B Streptococcus status whose pregnancy was
complicated by preterm labor with a Cerclage placed.  She was
on bedrest as well.  She received a full course of
Betamethasone.  She had early labor leading to spontaneous
vaginal delivery, rupture of membranes was one hour prior to
delivery.  There was no fever or clinical signs of
chorioamnionitis.  Her Apgars were 9 and 9 and her
birthweight was 2280 gm.  She was transferred to the Newborn
Intensive Care Unit secondary to prematurity.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her admission physical examination
revealed a very well appearing infant with an examination
consistent with 34 weeks gestation.  Her birth weight was
2280 gm, her head circumference 30 cm and her length was
33.25 cm.  Head and neck examination was normal.  Chest, she
had good breath sounds bilaterally with no crackles.  Her
cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and
rhythm, no murmurs and normal femoral pulses.  Her abdomen
was benign.  Her neurologic examination was normal.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Respiratory - She has been on room air
throughout her hospital stay.  She has had mild apnea and
bradycardia.  Her last apneic spell with mild desaturation
was on the evening of [**10-7**], at 11 PM.

Cardiovascular - She was noted to have a very mild murmur on
day of life No. 1 but had normal forelimb extremity blood
pressures, electrocardiogram and hyperoxia test as well as a
chest x-ray which did not show any cardiomegaly and clear
lung fields.  Her murmur persisted and on day of life No. 2,
Cardiology was consulted who asked that we follow the murmur
for a few more days and reconsult them once her pulmonary
pressures had dropped, if the murmur had not changed.  She
had a murmur on day of life No. 6 which revealed a small
muscular ventricular septal defect, otherwise normal anatomy.
She will be followed up by Cardiology at one months time
after discharge.  No intervention is thought to be needed
given the very small size of this muscular wall defect as
well as the likelihood that it would close on its own as she
grows.

Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition - She was about to p.o.
feed ad lib immediately after birth but was slow to take an
adequate volume, so she required gavage feeding which she is
still receiving.  She is also supplementing with
breastfeeding and is taking about one-half to three-quarters
per volume orally.  She has had normal urine output and
stools.  She had normal glucoses.  He most recent weight on
the day of interim summary was 2195 gm.

Gastrointestinal - She has had no history of feeding
intolerance, spits or abdominal distention.  She had a
bilirubin check on day of life No. 2 that was 6.8.  We
followed this up on one on day of life No. 3 which was 8.2.
Her jaundice did not worsen and we followed it clinically
thereafter.

Hematology - She had an admission hematocrit which was 43.1
percent.

Infectious disease - She had an initial blood culture sent as
well as a complete blood count which showed a white count of
10.5, hematocrit 43.1, 314,000 platelets and differential at
41 neutrophils, 3 bands and 45 lymphocytes.  No antibiotics
were started.

Sensory - She has not had a hearing screening as of this
interim summary.  She received hepatitis B vaccination on
[**10-5**].

PRIMARY CARE PEDIATRICIAN:  Her primary pediatrician is Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **], [**Location (un) **] [**State 350**].

We offer bottles every feed but do not attempt for more than 30 [**Known lastname 145**] so as not to over-tire her.  Expect her to improve her ability to take PO over the next few weeks.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient is a 52-year-old
gentleman with liver cirrhosis secondary to chronic hepatitis
C and long history of alcohol use, who presented to [**Hospital1 1444**] on [**2109-12-16**] for
living related liver transplant from his son.

The patient was preoped in the usual standard fashion.
Procedure went without any complications.  The estimated
blood loss from the procedure was around 2200 cc.  The
patient did receive a variety of intraoperative fluids
including blood products.

The patient was taken to the ICU for close monitoring
postoperatively.  A postoperative day one Duplex ultrasound
of the liver revealed a patent artery and vein.  He again
received variable blood products including red blood cells
for a hematocrit as low as 27.4 and six packs of platelets x3
for a platelet count of 85 as well as a FFP for an elevated
INR.

In the ICU, the patient was diuresed and weaned to
extubation.  He was on a variety of antihypertensives.  He
received a short course of perioperative Unasyn.  In
addition, there was a short period of time where he was on an
insulin drip as well as a hydrogen chloride drip for a bicarb
of 36.  These were eventually stopped.  Patient was extubated
on postoperative day four.

Another Duplex ultrasound was repeated, which was normal.
Arterial and venous wave forms were normal.  There was no
biliary ductal dilatation.  The liver function tests
continued to trend downward.

On postoperative day five, the patient was transferred to the
floor.  Around that period, the patient had a very brief
episode of some mild confusion.  This eventually resolved.

For immunosuppressant medication, the patient received during
the hospital course a total of two doses of Simulect.  He was
started on cyclosporin on postoperative day one.  He
additionally was on a short Solu-Medrol taper and eventually
was placed on p.o. prednisone.

His diet was slowly advanced, which he has tolerated.  A
postoperative T tube study was done on postoperative day 10,
which showed a size discrepancy, a question of a stenosis at
the common bile duct at the biliary anastomosis.  It was
thought to continue with the T tube open to gravity.  JP had
been discontinued at this point.  A future ERCP will
eventually be discussed with the patient in clinic.  It was
thought that the patient was stable for discharge on
postoperative day 12 with follow-up appointments with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] at the [**Hospital 1326**] Clinic.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Home with VNA services.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Stable.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Cyclosporin 350 mg p.o. b.i.d.
2. CellCept 1 gram p.o. b.i.d.

 TECHNIQUE:  Contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis.

 CONTRAST:  100 cc of Visipaque.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is a large subcapsular collection
 of low-attenuation fluid about the right hepatic lobe posteriorly and
 inferiorly which, given the history of recent percutaneous tube placement,
 likely represents a biloma.  The attenuation values within this collection are
 consistent with simple fluid.  There is a internal/external percutaneous
 biliary stent with its pigtail in the duodenum.  There is a T-tube seen
 traversing this collection and it exiting through the lower abdomen.  This
 large collection is having mass effect both on the sucapsular liver and on the
 adjacent kidney and duodenum.  The spleen remains enlarged.  There are
 numerous splenorenal collaterals.  There are several prominent lymph nodes in
 the gastrohepatic ligament.  There are also prominent lumbar collateral
 vessels.  The IVC also experiences mass effect from this process but is
 patent.  The colon is full of stool but the bowel is unremarkable.

 CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is no ascites or free air.  The
 distal ureters and urinary bladder are within normal limits.  There is a
 surgical clip adjacent to the ascending colon.  The bones are unrevealing.

 IMPRESSION: Large subscapular fluid collection, likely a biloma.  A T-tube
 traverses this collection.

 appropriate direction of flow and respiratory variation.  The hepatic artery
 was imaged within the liver.  There is a normal arterial waveform with rapid
 systolic upstroke and anterograde diastolic flow.

 There is mild intrahepatic biliary dilatation.  An anechoic fluid collection
 is seen along the medial surface of the transplant liver.  The patient's
 biliary drain is seen to pass through this collection.

 IMPRESSION: Patent liver vasculature.  New fluid collection along medial
 portion of the liver probably represents a biloma given the patient's clinical
 history.  Hematoma and abcess are also in the differential diagnosis.
 Additionally, there is minimal intrahepatic biliary dilatation.

                                 FINAL REPORT

 HISTORY: 52-year-old gentleman postop day 30 from liver transplant. T-tube
 cholangiogram demonstrated strictures in the common bile duct.

 PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS: The procedure was performed by Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 1812**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 27**]
 with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 27**] being present and supervising for the entire procedure. After
 general anesthesia was induced the patient's abdomen was prepped and draped in
 standard sterile fashion. Contrast was administered through the T-tube to
 opacify the biliary system. A right posterior peripheral bile duct was
 identified. After infusion of 1% lidocaine a 22 gauge needle was utilized to
 access this bile duct without difficulty. An .018 glidewire was advanced
 through the needle into the duct. The puncture needle was exchanged for a 4 Fr
 catheter. The catheter was positioned in the proximal common bile duct and
 cholangiogram was performed demonstrating a high-grade stricture at the
 ampulla. The catheter was upsized to a 6 Fr sheath. Using an .035 glidewire
 and C2 Cobra catheter the ampullary stricture was able to be bypassed and the
 wire and catheter were advanced into the small bowel. The wire was then
 exchanged for [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 2244**] wire. The Cobra catheter was removed and exchanged for
 an 8 mm balloon. Th ampullary stricture was balloon-dilated with the 8 mm
 balloon. Cholangiogram through the sheath following balloon dilatation
 revealed a good angiographic result with passage of contrast into the
 duodenum. The balloon and sheath were removed over the wire and an 8.5 Fr
 biliary catheter was attempted to be advanced over the wire. Catheter was
 unable to be advanced through the mid common bile duct around the area of T-
 tube due to possible stricture. A 4 mm balloon was advanced over the wire into
 the common bile duct and the duct was dilated with the 4 mm balloon both
 inferior and superior to the T-tube. The Cobra catheter was then reinserted
 over the wire and the wire was exchanged for an Amplatz wire. The 8.5 Fr
 biliary catheter was then successfully advanced over the Amplatz wire. The
 pigtail was formed in the duodenum. Followup cholangiogram demonstrated good
 positioning of the tube with side holes in the right hepatic and common bile
                                                             (Over)

 INDICATIONS: A 52-year-old male status post liver transplant and
 hepaticojejunostomy with L in the JP drain.  Evaluate for perihepatic
 collection.

 TECHNIQUE: Axial noncontrast CT imaging of the abdomen and pelvis.  No
 contrast was administered secondary to the patient's renal dysfunction.
 Comparison is made to a prior study from [**2110-1-28**].

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT CONTRAST: There are small bilateral pleural
 effusions which are new when compared to the prior examination.  There is a
 percutaneous biliary drain in place which terminates within the duodenum.  Two
 [**Location (un) 1732**]-[**Location (un) 1733**] drains are in place in the subhepatic region.  A small amount of
 perihepatic fluid is present.  Adjacent to the subhepatic [**Location (un) 1732**]-[**Location (un) 1733**] drain,
 there is a complex collection with air.  This finding could represent surgical
 packing material or abscess.  Correlation with the patient's surgical history
 is recommended.  The pancreas, adrenal glands and kidneys are unremarkable on
 this study limited by the lack of IV contrast.  Innumerable large perisplenic
 varices are present.  The spleen is enlarged.  There is a small amount of
 perisplenic fluid as well as fluid tracking along both pericolic gutters as
 well as the pelvis.  There is diffuse bowel wall thickening likely reflecting
 the patient's liver dysfunction.

 CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT CONTRAST: The urinary bladder, rectum, and prostate
 are unremarkable on this study limited by the lack of IV contrast.  There is a
 tiny focus of free air within the abdomen likely reflecting the patient's
 numerous recent interventions.

 Bone windows show no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions.

 IMPRESSION:

 1.  New small bilateral pleaural effusions.

 2.  Minimal non specific diffuse bowel wall thickening with a minimal amount
 of ascites.

 3.  Stable appearance of perihepatic fluid collections when compared to the
 prior exam.

 REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
  Please evaluate PTC and t-tube.
 ______________________________________________________________________________
                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY: The patient had a living related liver transplant with placement of
 an external-internal biliary drain, placement of a small catheter within a
 left-sided biliary system, and placement of a ""biloma"" tube at the right lower
 surface of the liver.

 PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed by Drs. [**First Name (STitle) 324**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 135**] with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 135**]
 being present throughout and supervising. The small surgical tube in the left-
 sided biliary system was first infused under gravity and a film was obtained
 before administration of contrast followed by several sequential films. It
 demonstrated that it was filling a left-sided ductal system and oblong space
 which did not have any extravasation into the free peritoneum. This biliary
 space connected with the main bile duct as evidenced by contrast flowing into
 the hepatic duct and into the external-internal biliary tube with rapid
 quantitative transit of contrast through the tube into the small bowel. From
 this injection site there was no extravasation to the undersurface of the
 liver. Of note also is that during this injection there was only faint filling
 of the right-sided hepatic ducts indicating that there is no further pressure
 gradient preventing emptying of the biliary system into the small bowel. Of
 note also is that while the biliary external-internal tube becomes relatively
 radio- opaque compatible with filling of its intrahepatic segment and system
 extending into the small bowel the piece of tubing that at this point extended
 externally and was not capped but draining to a bag did not fill with contrast
 indicating good  internal drainage. After a period of about 10 minutes the
 biliary system had drained there was still some residual contrast within the
 oblong left-sided superior space, but again fully contained.

 Now the external-internal biliary tube was injected since a prior
 cholangiogram from [**2110-1-20**] demonstrated a leak into the right subhepatic
 space and toward the biloma drainage tube. During today's cholangiogram
 through the external/internal drainage catheter only a very faint tract of
 contrast into this space was observed. It was also noted that injection from
 this side filled also the left-sided oblong-shaped biliary structure.

 IMPRESSION: Marked decrease in leakage from a site at the confluence of the
 intrahepatic ductal structure. Injection from the small surgical biliary tube
                                                             (Over)

 which is indwelling in a left-sided biliary radical and adjacent structure
 shows no free leakage. There is rapid drainage from that space to the bile
 duct and through the external-internal tube into the small bowel.

 Considering that filling of the external-internal stent through the external
 drainage component is still associated with some minor leakage may give rise
 to consider how the position of the external drainage bag might be modified.
 If it should be placed too low gastrointenstinal content could drain
 externally and possibly at a space. On the other hand decompression of the
 entire system is still desirable.

 The findings were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 69106**].

 HISTORY: 52-year-old gentleman status post liver transplant with recent
 operative revision for common bile duct leak. He continues to put out bile
 through the JP drains.

 PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS: The procedure was performed by Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 1812**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 7**],
 who was present and supervising. Through the patient's surgical percutaneous
 biliary tube, a tube cholangiogram was performed under gravity. The bile ducts
 were decompressed. The biliary tube crossed through the anatomosis and there
 was filling seen in the jejunum. The anastomotic area and the common bile duct
 was somewhat irregular in appearance with filling defects. There was no leak
 observed at this location. At the medial surface there was a continued leak
 through the peripheral duct as has been previously seen. This fills into a
 small collection which has also been previously observed. The patient
 tolerated the procedure well and there are no postprocedure complications.

 IMPRESSION:
 1. Surgically placed transhepatic biliary tube is in place. Tube cholangiogram
 demonstrated decompressed bile ducts. Area of hepaticojejunostomy is irregular
 with some filling defects. There is no leak seen at the anastomosis. Contrast
 is passing into the bowel.
 2. Continued leak from the peripheral medial biliary branch into  a small
 contained collection.

 biloma.

 TECHNIQUE:  Axial CT imaging of the abdomen performed without contrast as well
 as with arterial and portal venous phase of contrast administration.
 Additional delayed imaging of the abdomen and pelvis was performed after the
 intravenous administration of 100 cc of Visipaque.  Visipaque was used due to
 patient's renal dysfunction.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH CONTRAST:  The visualized portions of the
 lung bases are clear.  When compared to a prior study of [**2110-1-19**] there has
 been placement of a pigtail drainage catheter in the infrahepatic region with
 decreased size of a subhepatic fluid collection.  A percutaneous catheter
 traversing the right abdomen and terminating within the duodenum is unchanged
 when compared to the prior examination.  On the arterial phase of contrast
 enhancement, no definite intrahepatic arterial flow is identified.  Arterial
 flow is identified within the proper hepatic artery just beyond the
 gastroduodenal artery.  The proximal celiac axis and superior mesenteric
 arteries are well opacified.  There is no definite evidence of intrahepatic
 biliary ductal dilatation.  On the portal venous phase there are patchy areas
 of hypodensity within the posterior aspect of the transplant liver as well as
 the inferior aspect of the transplant liver.  These areas of patchy
 hypoattenuation are not as prominent on the noncontrast scan and on the late
 phase of contrast administration.  Large varices are identified in the region
 of the splenic hilum.  On the arterial phase of contrast administration the
 spleen enhances to a greater degree than the liver.  The pancreas, adrenal
 glands, kidneys, and visualized portions of large and small bowel are
 unremarkable.

 CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  The urinary bladder, prostate gland, and
 rectum are within normal limits.  Bone windows show no suspicious lytic or
 sclerotic lesions.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No definite intrahepatic arterial flow identified.  Arterial flow is
                                                             (Over)

 identified just beyond the gastroduodenal artery in the region of the proximal
 proper hepatic artery.  In this region there is evidence of
 stenosis/compromise of arterial flow.  Patchy areas of hypodensity along the
 inferior and posterior aspect of the transplant liver are present which are
 most evident on the portal venous phase of contrast enhancement.  These areas
 could reflect focal ischemia if the the lack of arterial flow to the
 transplant liver is verified.

 INDICATION:  Status post liver transplant.

 RADIOLOGISTS: Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7**].

 TECHNIQUE: Percutaneous transhepatic drainage catheter remains in place with
 the distal loop formed in the bowel.  This tube was injected and demonstrated
 no evidence of dilatation of intrahepatic ducts. Contrast material flows
 freely into the bowel loop.  There is leakage of contrast material into the
 contained collection at the medial aspect of the liver. It appears to leak
 from the common duct.  Small amount of air was seen in this collection prior
 to injection of the contrast material.  No free leakage of contrast material
 was seen into the subcapsular or subhepatic spaces.

 The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no immediate post
 procedure complications.

 IMPRESSION:  Persistent leak of contrast material into contained space. The
 leak likely extends from the common hepatic duct. The collection has the same
 size and appearance as on the prior examination.

 INDICATION: Postop day 17 from a liver transplant with elevation in LFTs.

 FINDINGS: Initial scout view demonstrates presence of a T-tube, right-sided
 surgical clip, and skin staples in a chevron configuration. Under fluoroscopic
 guidance, a slow-drip infusion of Conray was begun, and this resulted in
 opacification of a nondilated biliary tree. There was no evidence of
 stricture. Contrast flowed promptly into the common bile duct and then into
 the small bowel. Delayed imaging after gravity drainage of the contrast out of
 the biliary tree demonstrates a small residual amount within the common duct,
 but no contrast within the intrahepatic biliary tree.

 IMPRESSION: No evidence of ductal dilatation or stricture.

 HISTORY:  Liver transplant, liver related donor, with biliary leak.

 TECHNIQUE/FINDINGS:  As requested, this patient's biliary catheter was infused
 with conray 30 under gravity pressure only.  This demonstrated nondilated
 biliary radicles, antegrade flow but the persistence of extravasation of
 contrast along the edge of the transplant.  Due to drip infusion, the exact
 origin of the leak could not be identified however the images were suspicious
 for both a small biliary radicle as well as an element from the left and right
 biliary confluence.  Contrast was also noted within a JP drain at the level of
 the transplant hilum.

 IMPRESSION:  Persistent biliary leak as described above.

 RADIOLOGISTS:  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4148**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7**], the attending radiologist who was
 present and supervising the entire procedure.

 Details of the procedure and possible complications were explained to the
 patient and informed consent was obtained.

 Please make a note that the report of this study was dictated on the day of
 the examination, but was lost in transcription.

 TECHNIQUE AND FINDINGS:  The patient is s/p hepaticojejunostomy.  Indwelling
 internal/external drainage catheter is in place, traversing the anastomosis. A
 guidewire was advanced through the catheter and the catheter removed.  A 5
 French sheath was then placed.  Small amount of contrast material was injected
 and demonstrated extensive leak at the anastomosis.  A second guidewire was
 placed through the sheath and the sheath was then removed.  One wire was left
 for safety and the sheath was then introduced into the biliary tree over the
 second guidewire.  A microcatheter was used to cannulate a small branch of the
 common duct.  With the help of a wire a microcatheter was advanced to the very
 periphery of this small duct in the medial and superior portion of the liver.
 A small amount of contrast was injected through the microcatheter and
 demonstrated a second point of leak into the same collection, which was
 opacified from the leak at the hepaticojejunostomy anastomosis.  Gelfoam
 slurry was injected into the peripheral aspect of this duct through the
 microcatheter.  The microcatheter was then moved back and injection of
 contrast material demonstrated no evidence of a persistent leak.  A
 microcatheter was then removed.  The sheath was also then removed and biliary
 12 French internal/external drainage placed over the wire traversing the

 DATE OF PROCEDURE:  History 52 year-old gentleman status post liver transplant
 with common bile duct leak.  Has percutaneous 12-French drain but continues to
 leak out of side holes into the fluid collection.

 PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  The procedure was performed by Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 1812**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 7**]
 who was present and supervising throughout.  The patient's right abdomen was
 prepped and draped in standard sterile fashion.  1% Lidocaine was infused
 around the tube exit site.  The existing 12-French biliary tube was examined
 under fluoroscopy and found to be in good position.  Cholangiogram was
 performed which demonstrated a decompressed biliary tree with the stent leak
 at the common bile duct anastomosis.  A 12-French nephrostomy tube was
 obtained.  Three large side holes were cut at the distal [**1-18**] of the tube.  The
 existing biliary tube was cut and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 414**] wire was advanced into the bowel.
 The biliary tube was removed.  The modified 12-French nephrostomy tube was
 advanced over the wire.  The wire and innder stiffner were removed.  The
 pigtail was formed and locked.  The tube was positioned such that no side
 holes were present at the leak.  Post placement tube nephrostogram confirmed
 good positioning of the tube with proxmal side holes in the biliary tree,
 distal side holes in the bowel.  There was no extravasation of contrast at the
 leak.  The catheter was secured with an O silk suture and a flexi-track.  A
 mark was made with a permanent marker at the desired skin exit site of the
 tube to ensure that there re no side holes at the anastomotic leak.  The tube
 was then attached to bag drainage.  The patient tolerated the procedure well
 and there were no immediate post procedure complications.

 IMPRESSION:  1)  Tube cholangiogram demonstrating persistent leak at the
 common bile duct anastomosis.

 2)  Exhange of existing biliary catheter for modified 12-French nephrostomy
 tube to dicrease anastomotic leak.

 3)  Post procedure tube cholangiogram demonstrating appropriate positioning of
 the proximal side holes of the biliary tree and distal side holes in the bowel
 with no extravasation of contrast observed.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Known bile leak at hepaticojejunal anastomosis.  The patient has
 had decreased output through the internal and external biliary drain and
 increased output through the patient's surgically placed J-drain.

 CONSENT:  The risks and benefits of the proposed procedure were explained to
 the patient.  Written informed consent was obtained and placed on the
 patient's chart.

 SEDATION:  Conscious sedation was provided by the radiology nurses. Continuous
 heart rate, blood pressure, pulse oximetry monitoring was performed.  Fentanyl
 and Versed were administered in divided doses.

 PROCEDURE:  The patient was brought to the angiography suite and placed supine
 on the table.  His internal and external biliary drain was aspirated and only
 1.5 cc of bile could be obtained.  Tube cholangiogram with 4 cc of Optiray
 contrast showed contrast passage through the proximal ports of the tube which
 track down the common bile duct and into the area of known anastomotic leak.
 Subsequently, it was decided to attempt to pass a wire through the tube to see
 if there was a clog.  A 0.035 [**Last Name (un) 2244**] wire was easily advanced through the tip
 of the tube into the jejunum.  At this time, it was thought that perhaps the
 end holes were clogged.  The indwelling tube was a modified nephrostomy tube
 and the holes are small.  Therefore, the current tube was removed over the
 [**Last Name (un) 2244**] wire.  Inspection of the tube showed that the distal holes were indeed
 clogged.  It was decided to [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] tube with large holes both proximally
 and distally.  A 12-French nephrostomy tube was modified with an 11 blade
 scalpel such that large holes would be present both proximal and distal to
 anastomotic leak.  We used the prior tube to determine the placement of the
 holes on the current tube.  The modified tube was advanced over the [**Last Name (un) 2244**]
 wire such that the tip lay within the jejunum.  The proximal holes are seen to
 be within the intrahepatic common duct and the distal holes are seen to be
 within the jejunum.  A final cholangiogram was obtained showing passage of
 contrast into the jejunum.  The tube was sutured in place with 0-silk sutures
 and also with a Flexitrak.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post liver transplant with bile draining from the [**Last Name (ambig) 3076**]
 [**Location (un) 1732**]-[**Location (un) 1733**] drain.

 FINDINGS:

 Comparison is made to the prior study of [**2110-2-28**].

 NON-CONTRAST CT ABDOMEN:  An initial non-contrast CT of the abdomen was
 performed, again demonstrating the air and fluid collection medial to the
 lower aspect of the liver currently measuring 6.7 x 3.8 cm.

 The patient was placed in a prone position on the CT table after the risks and
 benefits of the procedure were explained to the patient and informed consent
 was obtained.

 A region on the skin was localized using CT fluoroscopic guidance and the
 initial scout images.

 CT-GUIDED NEEDLE PLACEMENT:  The skin was prepped and draped in standard
 sterile fashion.  Lidocaine was infiltrated subcutaneously.  Subsequently, an
 18-gauge spinal needle was advanced into the collection and about 2 cc of
 brownish fluid was aspirated.  The specimen was sent to the lab for
 interpretation.

 CT-GUIDED CATHETER PLACEMENT:  Subsequently, a 10-French locking loop catheter
 was advanced under direct CT fluoroscopic guidance into the fluid collection.
 A locking loop was formed.  Approximately 20 cc of brownish fluid was
 aspirated.  The catheter was adhered to the skin.

 The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate complications and
 left the department in satisfactory condition.

 The entire procedure was performed with and directly supervised by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3537**]
 [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3538**].

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Successful CT-guided aspiration and drain placement within a right
 perihepatic fluid collection.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post liver transplant, hepatojejunostomy with bile and JP
 drains.  Evaluate for abscess.

 TECHNIQUE:  CT of the abdomen and pelvis were performed after the
 administration of oral and IV contrast.  100 cc of optiray nonionic contrast
 was given, and nonionic contrast was given due to patient debility.

 COMPARISON:  CT performed [**2110-2-3**]

 FINDINGS:

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST: The lung bases are clear.  There is trace
 bibasilar atelectasis vs. trace effusions.  A percutaneous biliary drainage
 catheter is present. Inferior to the liver, there is a loculated collection of
 fluid, containing bubbles of gas, measuring up to 7.3 x 2.9 cm in cross
 sectional size.  In this location on the prior study, there was a similar
 loculation of material containing gas measuring 2.3 x 4.0 cm, but the [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1732**]
 [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1733**] drain has since been removed from this area. Extremely large perisplenic
 varices are again seen. The adrenal glands, kidneys, pancreas, stomach, and
 small bowel are within normal limits.  There are multiple small,
 nonpathologically enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes. No significant
 abdominal lymphadenopathy is evident.  There is a lesser degree of mesenteric
 fat stranding than on the prior study.

 The tip of the PTC terminates within the duodenum in a pig-tail.  Post pyloric
 feeding tube reaches the third portion of the duodenum.

 CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  There is a large amount of stool throughout
 the colon, besides the sigmoid colon and rectum.  A small amount of free fluid
 tracks into the pelvis.  There is no significant pelvic lymphadenopathy.

 Examination of the osseous structures show mild degenerative changes without
 evidence of lytic or blastic lesions.

 Multiplanar reformatted images are used to help assess the fluid collections
 described above.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATIONS: Status post liver transplant with diminished arterial hepatic
 flow by CAT scan.

 HEPATIC ARTERIOGRAM:  Details of the procedure and possible complications were
 explained to the patient and informed consent was obtained.

 RADIOLOGISTS: Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2243**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7**] was present for the
 entire procedure.

 TECHNIQUE:   Using sterile technique, local anesthesia and conscious sedation
 the right common femoral artery was punctured and the 5 French sheath was
 introduced over a guidewire using Seldinger technique. A 5 French C2 glide
 catheter was then placed through the sheath over the guidewire and its tip
 positioned in the common hepatic artery under fluoroscopic guidance.  Hepatic
 arteriogram was performed in AP and oblique projections.  The catheter and
 sheath were then removed and hemostasis was achieved.  The patient tolerated
 the procedure well. There were no immediate complications.

 CONTRAST:  40 cc of nonionic contrast material were used.

 FINDINGS:   The patient is status post liver transplant.  There is
 opacification of short segment of hepatic propia artery after take off of the
 gastroduodenal  artery and only few small branches are seen in the posterior
 segment of the liver, but overall, there is pretty much no hepatic arterial
 blood supply to the liver.

 IMPRESSION:   Status post liver transplant with markedly reduced hepatic
 arterial flow.  The findings were discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 236**].

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY: Liver transplant with ongoing infection requiring antibiotics. Failed
 attempts at bedside placement of PICC line.

 PHYSICIANS: The procedure was performed by Dr[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 324**] and [**Doctor Last Name **] [**Doctor Last Name 325**] with
 Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) 325**] (staff radiologist) present and supervising.

 PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS: The patient was placed supine on the angiography
 table. His right upper arm was prepped in sterile fashion. Since no suitable
 superficial veins were visible, ultrasound was used for localization of a
 suitable vein. The basilic vein was patent and compressible. After local
 anesthesia with 1% Lidocaine, the basilic vein was entered under
 ultrasonographic guidance with a 21 gauge needle. An 0.018 guidewire was
 advanced under fluoroscopy into the superior vena cava (SVC). Based on the
 markers on the guidewire it was determined that a length of 32 cm would be
 suitable. The PICC line was trimmed to length and advanced over a 4 French
 introducer sheath under fluoroscopic guidance into the SVC. The sheath was
 removed. The catheter was flushed. A final chest x- ray was obtained. The film
 demonstrates the tip to be in the SVC just above the atrium. A Stat-Lock was
 applied and the line was hep-locked. The line is ready for use.

 IMPRESSION: Successful placement of a 32 cm long, 4 French single lumen right
 basilic PICC line with tip in the superior vena cava, ready for use.

 INDICATION:  52 year old man with liver transplant, post-op day 30.  Tube
 cholangiogram demonstrates probable leak from a peripheral bile duct.
 Extrabiliary drain putting out 300 cc a day.  Please evaluate for leak and
 percutaneously ligate if possible.

 RADIOLOGISTS PERFORMING PROCEDURE:  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 994**]; Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 413**] [**Name (STitle) 7**], the
 staff radiologist, present throughout the entire procedure.

 PROCEDURE/TECHNIQUE:  Informed, written consent was obtained.  The right flank
 and indwelling Silastic catheter were prepped and draped in the usual sterile
 fashion.  The catheter was injected.  This demonstrated the catheter to be
 within the biliary tree.  There was prompt filling of the biliary tree.
 Contrast flowed freely into a wide anastomotic leak.  Contrast filled within
 this collection and was seen moving into the JP type drain.

 At this point the extensive suture material was removed.  An 035 angled
 glidewire was then passed through the Silastic catheter into the roux limb.
 The Silastic catheter was removed and exchanged for a 6 French angiographic
 sheath.  A Kumpe catheter was advanced over the glidewire.  The glidewire was
 then exchanged for a 035 [**Last Name (un) 414**] wire.  The catheter was removed and a second
 [**Last Name (un) 414**] wire was advanced into the central biliary system.  The angiographic
 sheath was then exchanged and readvanced over the wire located within the
 central biliary tree.  The second wire within the roux limb was secured and
 used as a safety wire.  An antegrade cholangiogram was then performed through
 the sheath.  This demonstrated a wide leak at the anastomosis.  The peripheral
 leaking duct could not be identified.  This is felt to be related to a steal
 phenomenon caused by the free flow of contrast from the anastomotic leak into
 the extrahepatic bile collection.  Multiple attempts were made attempting to
 opacify the peripheral leaking duct.  These were mostly unsuccessful.  Only
 the proximal portion could be opacified by placing the Kumpe catheter near the
 anastomosis and injecting contrast.  Attempts were made at selecting this duct
 using an 035 angled glidewire, an 018 wire, renegade catheter and a Kumpe
 catheter as well as a 4 French C2 catheter.  These were all unsuccessful.
 Other visualized ducts were selected out with the renegade catheter and
 contrast was injected to confirm that these ducts were not the peripheral duct
 that was leaking.

 At this point all equipment was removed and a 10 French internal/external
 biliary drain was advanced over the safety wire into the roux limb.  The
 pigtail was formed in this location.  Sideholes extended from the pigtail
 within the roux limb into a peripheral right hepatic duct.  Contrast was
 injected and demonstrated filling of the roux limb as well as the biliary
 tree.  The catheter was secured to the skin using O-silk and Flexi-[**Last Name (un) **].  The
 catheter was placed to external drainage.

 COMPLICATIONS:  None.

 CONTRAST/MEDICATIONS:  IV conscious sedation consisted of incremental doses of
 Versed and Fentanyl.  10 cc of 1% Lidocaine.  100 cc of Conray 60.

 IMPRESSION:  Cholangiogram showing a large leak at the anastomosis which fills
 an extrahepatic biliary collection that is drained by the JP drain.

 The known leak within a peripheral medial duct (probably right posterior)
 could not be opacified on this examination secondary to steal phenomenon
 associated with this anastomotic leak.  Therefore a 10 French
 internal/external biliary drainage catheter was placed with the pigtail formed
 in the roux limb and sideholes extending into the right peripheral duct.  The
 catheter was placed to external drainage.

 HISTORY:  Liver transplant with bile leak and indwelling drains.  Assess for
 ibloma and porta hepatis.

 COMPARISON:  [**2110-9-15**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Multiphasic pre and postcontrast CT of the abdomen with delayed-
 enhanced imaging of the abdomen and pelvis.

 CONTRAST:  100 cc of Visipaque secondary to high creatinine.

 CT OF ABDOMEN WITHOUT & WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is an internal-external
 biliary drain entering through the right portion of the liver.  There is also
 a surgical drain entering the porta hepatis with a small amount of gas around
 its distal portion.  There is no fluid collection in the porta hepatis.  There
 is  moderate amount of ascites that remains distributed throughout the
 abdomen, thouth less than on the prior study.  Portions of this appear to be
 loculating in the right lower quadrant with enhancing rims.  The liver itself
 enhances uniformly.  The intrahepatic vessels appear patent, though the portal
 vein in the porta hepatis is difficult to identify, which may relate to
 artifact from the adjacent drain or which may imply that it is somewhat
 narrowed, perhaps at the anastamosis-- an appearance which is unchanged.  The
 extrahepatic portal vein proximal to he porta hepatis is patent, as is the
 splenic vein. There are very large splenorenal varices persisting.  There is
 persistent splenomegaly as well. There are scattered small lymph nodes
 throughout the mesentery and retroperitoneum, not significantly changed. There
 is a fair amount of stool throughout the colon, and there is small bowel
 dilatation with smooth wall thickening.  This appearance is consistent with
 ileus.  The kidneys themselves are unremarkable and the adrenal glands and
 pancreas are within normal limits. There is no free air.

 CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is no free air. There is no
 adenopathy.  There is postsurgical stranding in the subcutaneous fat from the
 patient's incision.

 IMPRESSION:  Decreased amount of ascites.  No fluid collection in the porta
 hepatis. Ileus.

 ______________________________________________________________________________
                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY: 53-year-old male status post liver transplant with right TTBD
 catheter. Catheter has been leaking copious amounts of fluid around the exit
 site. Please perform cholangiogram with possible catheter exchange.

 PROCEDURE/FINDINGS: The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 411**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 412**] and Dr.
 [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2091**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 27**]. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 27**], the staff radiologist, was present and supervising
 throughout. After the risks and benefits of the procedure were discussed with
 the patient and informed consent was obtained, the patient was placed supine
 on the angiography table. His abdomen including the existing catheter was
 prepped and draped in the standard sterile fashion. The skin and subcutaneous
 tissues surrounding the catheter were anesthetized with 10 cc of 1% lidocaine.
 A fluoroscopic spot image was obtained, demonstrating the catheter tip to be
 withdrawn as compared with the prior film from [**2110-9-9**]. Tube
 cholangiogram was then performed using 10 cc of hand-injected  contrast. This
 demonstrated that the holes at the distal portion of the catheter were fluted
 as contrast flowed through the proximal side holes into the right hepatic duct
 and the jejunal loop. As compared with previous tube cholangiograms, the right
 hepatic duct was significantly more dilated. The catheter was then cut
 releasing the pigtail. A .035 [**Doctor Last Name 8**] wire was advanced through the exiting
 catheter into the jejunum under fluoroscopy. The catheter was removed. A 5 Fr
 C2 Cobra catheter was then advanced over the guide wire into the proximal
 jejunum. The guide wire was then removed and hand injection of 10 cc of
 contrast confirmed the position of the catheter within the jejunum beyond the
 surgical anastomosis. A .035 [**Location (un) 1406**] J-wire was then advanced into the jejunum
 through the 5 Fr C2 Cobra catheter. The catheter was removed. A 10 Fr biliary
 catheter was advanced over the guide wire into the jejunum. The guide wire was
 removed. The pigtail was formed and locked in the jejunum beyond the
 anastomosis. Repeat cholangiography via the new 10 Fr biliary drainage
 catheter confirmed the position of the side holes throughout the biliary tree
 and into the jejunal loop. The contrast was aspirated and the catheter was
 flushed with 10 cc of normal saline. The catheter was placed to external bag
 drainage. It was secured to the skin using a #0 silk suture. A StatLock was
 applied, followed by a dry sterile gauze dressing.

 1
 HISTORY:  A 53-year-old male status post [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 16279**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1280**] hepaticojejunostomy with
 right PTBD and additional intraperitoneal [**Doctor Last Name **] drain likely through a fistula
 tract into the jejunum.  Please perform injection of [**Doctor Last Name **] drain to assess for
 leak or fistula.

 PROCEDURE/FINDINGS:  The procedure was  performed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 411**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 412**] and
 Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2091**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 27**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 27**], the staff radiologist, was present and
 supervising throughout.  After the risks and benefits of the procedure were
 discussed with the patient and informed consent was obtained, the patient was
 placed supine on the angiography table.  His abdomen, including both drains,
 was prepped and draped in the standard sterile fashion.  Under fluoroscopic
 visualization, 10 cc of contrast was hand injected through the [**Doctor Last Name **] drain.
 This demonstrated filling of the jejunal loop along with retrograde
 opacification of the biliary ducts as well.  There was no evidence of
 extravasation.  This finding was consistent with the presence of a a fistula
 between the intraperitoneal tract and the jejunal loop.  The right PTBD
 catheter was also present and with the pigtail formed in the jejunal loop
 beyond the anastomosis. These findings were discussed with the transplant
 surgery service at the time of the procedure. After a discussion with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
 [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 908**] from the transplant service, it was decided that the catheter would be
 withdrawn until the tip of the [**Doctor Last Name **] drain was present outside the jejunal
 loop. Perhaps this would allow the fistula tract to close down over time. Once
 the [**Doctor Last Name **] drain was appropriately positioned, it was secured to the skin using
 a 0-silk suture. Following the procedure, the bile ducts were emptied of
 contrast. The [**Doctor Last Name **] drain was placed to bulb suction. The patient tolerated
 the procedure well and was transferred to the recovery room following the
 procedure in stable condition.

 COMPLICATIONS:  None.

 CONTRAST:  30 cc of 60% Optiray.

 IMPRESSION:  Hand injection of contrast into the intraperitoneal [**Doctor Last Name **] drain
 demonstrated filling of the jejunal loop along with retrograde opacification
 of the biliary tree. This study confirmed the presence of a fistula between

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hepaticojejunostomy with prior bile leak.

 TECHNIQUE/FINDINGS:  And informed consent was obtained, the patient's
 previously placed 10-French internal-external biliary drain was prepped and
 draped in sterile fashion.  Under real-time fluoroscopic evaluation, an
 initial cholangiogram was performed.  This demonstrated that the current tube
 was patent, the biliary tree was decompressed, and there was no leakage of
 contrast.

 The current tube was removed over a 0.035 [**Last Name (un) 414**] wire after which a similar
 tube was placed and post-placement cholangiogram was performed to confirm
 position.  Again, no evidence of leakage, free fluid into the jejunum,
 decompressed biliary tree.  Of note, the current tube was patent though side
 holes were markedly compromised by debris.

 IMPRESSION:  Patent decompressed biliary tree, no leakage, free flow into the
 jejunum.  Current 10-French drain replaced with similar drain without
 complication.

 ______________________________________________________________________________
                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION: Recurrent fevers on post op day eight from a biliary anastomosis
 hepatojejunostomy and liver transplant.

 COMPARISON: [**2110-3-4**].

 TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images through the abdomen and pelvis were
 obtained following the administration of oral and IV contrast.

 IV CONTRAST: Nonionic contrast was used due to debility.

 ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST: There is atelectasis at both lung bases, left greater
 than right.  There are trace bilateral pleural effusions.  The heart is
 enlarged.  An NG tube is in place.  Surgical drainage catheters surround the
 liver.  The previously seen heterogeneous collection adjacent to the medial
 edge of the right lobe of the liver has predominantly resolved, with only a
 small trace of fluid remaining.  This does not appear drainable.  There are no
 focal liver abnormalities.  The PCC drain has apparently been removed, and a
 small amount of high density material is seen along the PCC tract.  The spleen
 is massively enlarged, and there are enormous varices throughout the left
 abdomen.  The pancreas, adrenal glands and kidneys are unremarkable in
 appearance.  A small amount of free abdominal fluid is noted.

 PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: The bladder and pelvic loops of bowel are unremarkable
 in appearance.  There is a moderate amount of free pelvic fluid.  There is no
 inguinal or deep pelvic  lymphadenopathy.

 BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic bony lesions.

 IMPRESSION:
 1) Interval near complete resolution of the heterogeneous collection of fluid
 and gas adjacent to the medial liver edge.  No new collections seen.
 2) Splenomegaly with massive varices.
 3) Moderate bilateral atelectasis.

 PROCEDURE/FINDINGS:  The procedure was performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1812**] and Dr.
 [**Last Name (STitle) 884**], who was present and supervising throughout. The patient's right
 abdomen and [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 16279**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1280**] tube were prepped and draped in usual sterile
 fashion. Contrast was injected via gravity which opacified only the first 5 cm
 of the 10 cm 12 FR tube.  Contrast was passing anteriorly into a collection.
 There was no opacification of the bowel observed. The ducts were nondilated.
 An 0.035 glide wire was passed into what appeared to be bowel. The wire was
 then removed and cholangiogram repeated which still did not reveal any passage
 of contrast into the bowel.  These findings were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] at
 the time of procedure.  There were no immediate post procedure complications.

 IMPRESSION:

 Tube cholangiogram demonstrating passage of contrast anteriorly into a

 CLINICAL INFORMATION & QUESTIONS TO BE ANSWERED:
  Pt s/p liver transplant with existing Ttube. Cholangiogram from [**4-18**] showed
  persistent, but improved size of bile leak. F/u cholangiogram to assess bile
  leak, position of catheter and check for dilation of bile ducts
 ______________________________________________________________________________
                                 FINAL REPORT


 INDICATION:  Status post liver transplant with existing percutaneous biliary
 drain with continued output.  Please assess for bile leak, catheter position
 and biliary obstruction.

 PHYSICIANS:  The procedure was performed by Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 27**].  Dr.
 [**Last Name (STitle) 27**], the attending radiologist, performed the procedure after a telephone
 discussion with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

 PROCEDURE/FINDINGS:  After explaining the risks and benefits of the procedure,
 written informed consent was obtained. The patient was placed supine on the
 angiography table and prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. Optiray
 contrast material was then slowly administered under fluoroscopic guidance via
 the existing biliary catheter.  Contrast passed freely into the Roux-en-Y
 limb.  There was no dilatation of the intrahepatic biliary ducts or evidence
 of leak. A 0.035 Stiff glide wire was then advanced through the existing
 catheter and into the Roux-en-Y limb.  The skin sutures anchoring the biliary
 drainage catheter were cut, and the tube was removed, with moderate
 difficulty.  A 10 French Flexima biliary catheter was then advanced over the
 wire and into the Roux-en- Y limb. The pigtail mechanism was deployed as the
 wire was withdrawn. Injection of 5 cc of Optiray contrast confirmed tube
 location within the Roux- en-Y limb.

 ANESTHESIA/MEDICATIONS:  Approximately 50 cc of Optiray contrast material was
 used.  The patient received conscious sedation using Versed and Fentanyl, with
 continuous hemodynamic monitoring.

 IMPRESSION:
 1. No evidence of biliary ductal dilatation or leak.  Removal of existing
 percutaneous biliary drainage catheter.

 2. Successful placement of 10 French Flexima biliary catheter.  The tip is in
 the duodenum.

  without output. Check for dilation of bile ducts, position of catheter, check
  for leaks.
 ______________________________________________________________________________
                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY: 53 year old man with living-related liver transplant complicated by
 common bile duct necrosis and hepaticojejunostomy. Patient had revision of
 hepaticojejunostomy in 02/[**2110**]. Patient has existing percutaneous transhepatic
 biliary drain (PTBD) in place with minimal output and [**Location (un) 1732**]-[**Location (un) 1733**] drain
 without any output. Patient is here today for tube cholangiogram to check for
 dilatation of bile ducts, position of the catheter, and check for any leaks.

 PHYSICIANS: This procedure was performed by Drs. [**First Name (STitle) 32904**] [**Name (STitle) 2243**] and
 [**Name5 (PTitle) 737**] [**Doctor Last Name **] [**Doctor Last Name 325**] (the staff radiologist, who was present and supervising
 throughout the procedure).

 PROCEDURE/FINDINGS: The patient was placed supine on the angiography table and
 his abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. Contrast was
 infused slowly by gravity drainage under fluoroscopic guidance via the
 existing biliary catheter, and cholangiograms were taken in several
 projections (PA and obliques).
 Contrast was passing anteriorly into a collection. There was opacification of
 non-dilated intrahepatic biliary ducts. There was good, rapid passage of
 contrast into the small bowel through the anastomosis.
 Compared to the prior study, there is improvement (reduction) in the size of
 the leak and apperance of passage of contrast into the small bowel through the
 hepaticojejunal anastomosis.
 The tube was re-connected to its external bag drainage.

 COMPLICATIONS: No immediate post-procedure complications were noted.

 ANESTHESIA/MEDICATIONS: For conscious sedation, divided doses of Versed (1 mg
 total) and fentanyl (50 microg total) were given intravenously under
 continuous hemodynamic monitoring. Ionic contrast (Conray 60%): 20 ml. Patient
 was already on antibiotics (including Unasyn).

 IMPRESSION: As compared to the previous study, this tube cholangiogram
 demonstrated persistence but improvement in the size of the bile leak.

 present entering the right lobe of the liver, with a radiopaque tip.  There is
 a small amount of contrast within this tube.

 A small amount of biliary air is present.  As there may be a subtlely
 heterogeneous enhancement in segment 5 of the liver a tiny hypodense focus in
 this region is non-specific, and was more discretely seen on prior studies.
 There is splenomegaly, with massive splenic varices and a splenorenal shunt.
 The kidneys, adrenal glands, stomach, and small bowel appears unremarkable.
 There is a large amount of post-operative fat stranding in the right upper
 quadrant, worse in the remainder of the abdomen.  No frank fluid collection is
 present, aside from the small sliver of fluid along the inferior aspect of the
 liver, which is much smaller than on the prior study.  There is no abdominal
 lymphadenopathy evident.

 CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  There is a large amount of stool within the
 rectum.  A trace amount of pelvic free fluid is present.  There is no pelvic
 lymphadenopathy, and the bladder and visualized portions of the ureters are
 within normal limits.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post liver transplant.  Abdominal pain.

 COMPARISON:  [**2110-7-31**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Helically acquired contiguous axial images of the abdomen were
 obtained without contrast and then with 140 cc of intravenous Optiray in
 arterial and portal venous phases.  Delayed images of the abdomen and pelvis
 were also obtained.

 ABDOMEN CT WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST:  There is minimal pleural effusion or
 pleural thickening at the left lung base.  The transplant liver enhances
 uniformly.  The portal, splenic, and superior mesenteric veins are patent. The
 celiac, common hepatic, superior mesenteric and inferior mesenteric arteries
 are patent.  A transhepatic percutaneous biliary stent is again noted.  There
 is a second percutaneous catheter entering the patient in the right lower
 quadrant, coursing superiorly and terminating in the liver hilum. The spleen
 is stable in size.  Multiple varices and a markedly enlarged left renal vein
 are again noted.  The pancreas, adrenal glands, and kidneys appear
 unremarkable.

 PELVIS CT WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  There is contiguous wall thickening in
 the sigmoid and descending colon, which is consistent with colitis.
 Inflammatory, infectious, and ischemic etiologies should be considered.
 Specifically, if the patient has been on antibiotics, C. difficile colitis
 should be considered.  There is no wall thickening in the transverse or
 ascending colon, which are distended with stool.  The distal ileum is
 collapsed, with some fecalization of its contents (series 3B, image 182).  The
 proximal small bowel is dilated and opacified with oral contrast.  Oral
 contrast does not pass through to the collapsed distal small bowel.  These
 findings are concerning for partial bowel obstruction, possibly secondary to
 the large amount of stool in the proximal colon.  A follow-up CT scan may be
 helpful to assess progression of oral contrast.

 There are multiple small foci of free air.  The largest collection of free air
 is located adjacent to the distal jejunojejunal anastomosis (series 3B, image
 159).  There is an adjacent 2 cm fluid collection.  There is also a small
 amount of fluid in the paracolic gutters, and a small-to-moderate amount of
 fluid in the deep pelvis.  These findings are concerning for bowel

 could be secondary to recent catheter placement.  Clinical correlation is
 recommended.

 2.  Colitis in the descending and sigmoid colon, which may be inflammatory,
 infectious, or ischemic.  If the patient has been treated with antibiotics, C.
 difficile colitis should be considered.

 3.  Possible partial small bowel obstruction, which may be secondary to a
 large amount of stool in the proximal colon.  A follow-up CT could be helpful
 for assessing progression of oral contrast.

 4.  Small amount of free fluid without evidence of an abscess.

 REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
  Pt s/p liver transplant with existing [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1732**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1733**] drain. Tube to be downsized
  and replaced with pigtail catheter by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 63**].
 ______________________________________________________________________________
                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Liver transplant, currently with right upper quadrant J-P drain and
 transhepatic catheter, for J-P drain downsizing in anticipation of eventual
 removal.

 TECHNIQUE/FINDINGS:  After informed consent was obtained, both the patient's
 transhepatic biliary catheter as well as the J-P drain exit site were prepped
 and draped in  sterile fashion.

 Initial injection of the J-P drain demonstrated prompt antegrade flow into
 both a decompressed biliary tree as well as jejunum at approximately the
 hepaticojejunal anastomosis.  Hence, a persistent leak, although previous
 injections of the transhepatic catheter,  demonstrated no evidence of
 extravasation at the level of the anastomosis.

 A stiff glide wire was advanced through the J-P drain and the J-P drain
 removed.  Given the course of the J-P drain, no sheath was long enough to
 reach the original final position of the drain.  Therefore, a 5-French multi-
 side hole catheter was advanced over the wire to the level of the
 hepaticojejunostomy and injection performed over the wire.  This revealed a
 contained tract from the hepaticojejunal anastomosis and along the previous J-
 P tract for approximately 10 cm.  Catheter withdrawal over a wire with
 repeated injection demonstrated the tract to terminate after about 10 cm with
 free contrast flowing into the abdomen.

 Hence, a tract approximately 10 cm in length, which is contained, does exist
 where the previously J-P drain was placed.  Because of the route of the
 original J-P drain, no drain of sufficient length to reach the hepaticojejunal
 anastomosis is available (biliary drain, nephrostomy tubes and multi-purpose
 drains all 35 cm or less, 65 cm  required to reach the hepaticojejunal
 anastomosis through the previous J-P drain tract).

 Therefore, a 7-French Grohlman catheter was used, additional multiple side
 holes were placed and the catheter cut to appropriate size with an O-ring
 placed.  This was sutured in place with 0-silk.  The catheter tip does form a
 small pigtail and this was placed approximately 2 cm distal to the
 hepaticojejunal anastomosis, i.e., withdrawn approximately 2 cm from the
 original J-P drain tip.  Injection confirmed position and confirmed no
 evidence of extravasation.

 A transhepataic cholangiogram was also performed, again demonstrating no
 evidence of extravasation despite the known presence of a persistent leak.  As
 this catheter has not been changed since [**4-20**], the catheter was changed
 uneventfully over [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 2244**] wire for a similar 10-French biliary drainage
 catheter.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  J-P drain injection demonstrating persistent leak at approximately the
 hepaticojejunal anastomosis with opacification of both jejunum and a
 decompressed biliary tree.  This is associated with a J-P drain tract of
 approximately 10 cm in length from the hepaticojejunal anastomosis until
 there is free extravasation into the abdomen.  J-P drain was removed and a
 tailored 7-French catheter replaced approximately 8 cm within the tract,
 distal to the hepaticojejunal anastomosis.
 2.  Due to the route of the original J-P drain, no larger drain or catheter
 could be placed as the tract was over 65 cm in length.
 3.  Contained tract for 10 cm does make this amenable to an attempt at
 eventual tract embolization.
 4.  Transhepatic cholangiogram demonstrating a nondilated biliary tree with
 free flow into the jejunum via the hepaticojejunal anastomosis.  Again, no
 extravasation was seen despite the above findings.  Catheter exchanged for a
 similar 10-French biliary drain uneventfully.

 TECHNIQUE: Noncontrast CT of the abdomen and pelvis was performed.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT CONTRAST: Comparison to the previous exam reveals
 only a minimal passage of contrast, which still lies within mid- to distal
 small bowel. Compared to the prior exam, there is increase in the amount of
 free fluid within the abdomen and pelvis. Colonic wall thickening is still
 appreciated. No leak of oral contrast is seen. Loops of small bowel to the
 point of contrast termination are still dilated.

 CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT CONTRAST: There is a mild increase in pelvic free
 fluid since the previous exam.

 IMPRESSION: Only little movement of contrast within the small bowel, which
 still terminates at a point within the mid-to-distal small bowel. As there was
 no evidence of small bowel obstruction on recently performed interventional
 study of [**2110-9-4**], (when administered contrast was seen to progress
 through the small bowel without difficulty) the findings likely relate to an
 ileus from chemical peritonitis. Additionally, the findings of bowel wall
 thickening within the colon may relate to hypoproteinemia, or also could be
 secondary to chemical peritonitis from biliary leak.

 REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
  Pt. is one year s/p liver transplant. Pt. has a PTC tube in situ. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
  would like pt. to have a tube cholangiogram- Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] would like to be paged

 ______________________________________________________________________________
                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY: Patient is one year status post liver transplant, with BDC tube in
 situ, for cholangiogram, and possible downsizing of tube.

 PROCEDURE/FINDINGS:
 The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 4608**] [**Name (STitle) 4609**], and Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 63**] with Dr.
 [**Last Name (STitle) 63**], attending radiologist, supervising the procedure.  After explaining
 the risks and benefits of the procedure and informed consent was obtained, the
 patient was placed supine on the angiographic table, and the right upper
 abdomen around the insertion site of the existing tube prepped and draped in
 standard sterile fashion.  The skin and subcutaneous tissues surrounding the
 catheter were anesthetized with 8 cc of 1% lidocaine.  A fluoroscopic spot
 image was obtained demonstrating the catheter tip to be within the jejunum.  A
 tube cholangiogram was then performed using 10 cc of hand injection contrast
 which demonstrated opacification of the right hepatic duct, with free flow
 into the jejunum.  No intrahepatic biliary dictal dilatation is seen.  No
 leakage of contrast was seen.  The catheter was then cut releasing the
 pigtail.  An 0.035 [**Last Name (un) 414**] wire was advanced through the existing catheter
 into the jejunum under fluoroscopy, and the catheter was removed.  An 8 french
 bright tipped sheath was advanced over the wire, and the inner dilator
 removed.  Contrast was hand injected through the sheath which again
 demonstrated normal right hepatic system, with no evidence of dilatation.  The
 bright tipped sheath was removed and an 8 french biliary catheter was advanced
 over the guidewire into the jejunum.  The guidewire was removed.  The pigtail
 was formed and lodged in the jejunum beyond the anastomosis.  Repeat
 cholangiography via the new 8 french biliary drainage catheter confirmed
 position of sideholes throughout the biliary tree and into the jejunal loop.
 The contrast was aspirated and the catheter was flushed with 10 cc of normal
 saline.  The catheter was capped, and secured to the skin using 0 silk suture.
  A stat-lock was applied, followed by a dry sterile gauze dressing.

 COMPLICATIONS: None.

 ______________________________________________________________________________
                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  53-year-old man with questionable portal vein thrombosis.
 Status-post living donor liver transplant 9 months ago with question of portal
 vein thrombosis.

 TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar MRI of the abdomen was performed utilizing T1- and T2-
 weighted images both prior to, and following uneventful intravenous
 administration of gadolinium.  Additional multiplanar reconstruction was
 performed on a separate workstation.

 COMPARISON STUDIES:  Multiple prior CT scans, including that from [**2110-9-29**].

 FINDINGS:  The transplant liver is unremarkable in appearance, except for a
 scar at mid portion which is related to the prior biliary drainage tube.  No
 focal hepatic lesions are identified.  The gallbladder is absent.

 The spleen is markedly enlarged, and there are numerous large varices at the
 splenic hilum, and near the left kidney.  The left renal vein is markedly
 enlarged with suggestion of an enlarged hemi-azygos inferior to the left
 kidney. These appearances are unchanged when compared with previous CT
 studies.

 The splenic vein and superior mesenteric vein in its visualized portions are
 patent.  The portal confluence is patent.  There is attenuation of the portal
 vein at its anastomotic site at the porta hepatis.  Within the liver, the
 portal vein is patent.

 There is a 1.3 x 1.2 cm septated cystic lesion within the uncinate process of
 the pancreas, which does not definitely communicate with the pancreatic duct.
 The differential diagnosis for this lesion includes an IPMT, a microcystic
 tumor, or a sequela of prior pancreatitis. Follow up imaging in 4 months is
 recommended to confirm its stability.  The pancreatic duct is normal in
 caliber within the pancreatic body.  This duct is seen to continue into the
 duct of Wirsung which is normal in caliber.  There is a dilated duct of
 Santorini, measuring 7 mm with thickening of soft tissue at its ampulla. These
 appearances may be a result of pancreas divisum with stenosis of the ampulla
 of the duct of Santorini.  There is suggestion of another 5-6 mm cystic lesion
 within the junction of the pancreatic body and tail which is not completely
 visualized on this study, and may be additionally evaluated at the time of the
 follow up imaging for the pancreas.  The common bile duct is normal in
 caliber.

 There is mild diffuse thickening of the bowel wall, and a minimal amount of
 free fluid within the abdomen which may be related to anarsarca.  There is no
 significant lymphadenopathy.

 Multiplanar reconstructions were helpful in delineating the above findings.

 IMPRESSION

 1.  Attenuation of the main portal vein at its anastomosis at the porta
     hepatis with patent portal confluence and portal branches within the
     liver.

 2.  Suggestion of pancreas divisum with dilated duct of Santorini and
     thickening of its ampulla.  An ERCP may be helpful for further evaluation
     of this finding.

 3.  Two (2) cystic lesions within the pancreas.  The differential diagnosis
     includes IPMT, a cystic pancreatic tumor, or sequela of
     pancreatitis.   Follow up MRCP in 4 months is recommended to assess its
     stability.

 4.  Splenomegaly and prominent splenorenal varices, consistent with the
     patient's prior history of portal hypertension.

 5.  Anasarca.

 INDICATION:  53 year old man status post liver transplant complicated by
 biliary leak, who presents with liver and abdominal pain.

 COMPARISON:  [**2110-4-18**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Helically acquired contiguous axial images of the abdomen were
 obtained without contrast and with intravenous Optiray in arterial and portal
 venous phases.  Images of the pelvis were also obtained in the portal venous
 phase.  Delayed images of the abdomen were then obtained.

 ABDOMEN CT WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST:  There is minimal atelectasis at the
 visualized lung bases.  There is a biliary stent within the liver transplant.
 There is a JP drain terminating at the liver hilum.  There is a linear low
 density tract in the liver, likely secondary to a prior catheter.  Otherwise,
 there are no focal liver lesions.  There is no intrahepatic biliary
 dilatation.  The main hepatic artery is patent.  The portal vein and its
 branches appear patent.  However, there is relative narrowing of the portal
 vein just prior to its bifurcation, which is unchanged since the prior study.
 There is a large splenorenal shunt and perisplenic varices.  The spleen is
 enlarged, measuring 16 cm.  There are no perihepatic or other fluid
 collections.  There is no evidence of an abscess.  There is air in the
 surgical bed, likely secondary to the JP drain and biliary stent.

 The pancreas, adrenal glands, kidneys, small bowel and colon appear
 unremarkable.

 PELVIS CT WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The bladder, prostate, seminal vesicles
 and rectum appear unremarkable.  There is no free fluid.  There is no evidence
 of an abscess.

 BONE WINDOWS:  The visualized osseous structures are grossly unremarkable.

 IMPRESSION:

 1.  No abscess or fluid collection.

 2.  Stable appearance of a relative narrowing at the portal vein origin just
 prior to its bifurcation.  Large splenorenal shunt and perisplenic varices.

 ADDENDUM:

 There was subcutaneous infiltration of intravenous Optiray at the end of the
 infusion.  The patient was examined by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 450**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].  A cold compress was
 immediately applied to the infiltration site, according the contrast
 infiltration policy.  The patient's floor nurse was immediately notified.  The
 intravenous line was removed.  As less than 30 cc of Optiray were infiltrated,
 no further action was taken.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 69272**] was also notified and provided with a
 copy of the contrast infiltration policy.  It was recommended to apply cold
 compresses for the first two hours following infiltration, and to apply heat
 subsequently.

 redemonstrate a small focal fluid collection in the left lower quadrant.

 CT GUDANCE: CT fluoroscopy was used throughout the procedure to document
 adequate needle positioning.

 CT ASPIRATION: After a pre- procedure time- out to confirm the identity of the
 patient and the procedure which he has to undergo informed consent was
 obtained.  The patient was placed in a supine position and limited axial CT
 images were obtained to delineate the small fluid collection to be aspirated.
 The skin was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion and 1% Lidocaine
 was used for local anesthesia. Under direct CT guidance 1.5 cc of clear yellow
 fluid was aspirated by a 20 ga needle from the left-sided peritoneal fluid
 collection. The specimen was sent for culture.  The patient tolerated the
 procedure well and there were no immediate complications.

 Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 979**], attending radiologist, was present and supervised the entire
 procedure.

 IMPRESSION:  Technically successful aspiration of small amount of fluid from a
 small peritoneal fluid collection.

 COMPARISON:  [**2110-9-29**]

 TECHNIQUE:   Contrast enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis.

 CONTRAST:   150 cc of Optiray secondary to debility.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is atelectasis at the left lung
 base.  There is no effusion.  The patient has an internal/external biliary
 drain in the transplanted liver with pig-tail coiled in the bowel.  There is
 persistent splenomegaly and large collaterals, including splenorenal shunt,
 that are well opacified with contrast.  The pancreas, adrenal glands are
 unremarkable and the aorta is of normal caliber.  The large bowel is
 underdistended with areas of equivocal wall thickening in the sigmoid and
 hepatic flexure regions.  These are of undetermined significance.

 CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  In the left abdomen superficially there is
 a 2.5 x 3.0 cm enhancing fluid collection.  There is a small amount of ascites
 in addition distributed throughout the abdomen, which is decreased in degree
 since the prior study.  There is no free air.  The bladder is unremarkable.

 The bones reveal no suspicious findings.

 IMPRESSION: 1)  2.5 x 3 cm enhancing fluid collection in left mid abdomen.
 This is too small to place a pig-tail catheter in, but would be amenable to CT
 guided aspiration.
 2)  Continued small amount of ascites with splenomegaly and large collateral
 vessels.
 3)  Colon underdistended with contrast material with equivocal areas of wall
 thickening at the hepatic flexure and sigmoid colon.  Correlation with
 symptoms of colitis suggested.  These areas looked unremarkable on prior study
 from 3 weeks.

 ______________________________________________________________________________
                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Subhepatic fluid collection which communicates with the patient's
 biliary system as demonstrated on recent injection of his PTBD catheter.

 FINDINGS:

 The procedure was deemed necessary on an emergent basis by the clinical team
 and a note has been written in the patient's chart to this effect.  The
 patient was placed in the supine position on the CT table and axial CT images
 of the abdomen again demonstrate a subhepatic fluid collection which now
 contains contrast from the recent injection of the PTBD catheter.  A spot was
 marked on the right upper quadrant overlying the patient's collection.  The
 region was then prepped and draped in the standard sterile fashion.
 Subsequently under direct CT guidance, a 19 gauge needle was advanced into
 this collection. A 12 French Flexima locking loop catheter was then advanced
 under CT guidance into the collection and a total of 350 cc of a combination
 of bilious and bloody fluid was aspirated. The position of the catheter was
 confirmed by CT and a locking loop was formed.

 A specimen was sent to the lab for interpretation.

 The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate complication and
 left the department in satisfactory position.

 The entire procedure was performed with and directly supervised by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 650**]
 [**Name (STitle) 651**].

 ANESTHESIA:  Versed and fentanyl.

 IMPRESSION:

 Successful CT guided placement of a locking loop pigtail catheter into the
 patient's subhepatic fluid collection.

 INDICATION:  52 y/o gentleman status post liver transplant with persistent
 bile leak.  Presents for evaluation of source of leak.

 Physicians: Tham and [**Doctor Last Name 7**], with the Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7**] present and supervising

 PROCEDURE:  Patient's abdomen was prepped and draped in sterile fashion. Tube
 cholangiogram through patient's existing PTBD demonstrated a biliary leak
 through peripheral medial duct as previously seen on prior studies. This
 filled prior fluid collection before passing inferiorly and laterally into
 subhepatic space. The patient's t-tube was then injected lightly with no
 evidence of extravasation from the common bile duct. The patient tolerated the
 procedure well and there were no complications.

 Impression: PTBD tube cholangiogram confirming previously seen biliary leak
 through medial peripheral duct draining into fluid collection before passing
 into subhepatic space. T-tube cholangiogram with no evidence of leak from CBD.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3825**] [**Known lastname 56003**] was born at 33
6/7 weeks gestation by cesarean section for a nonreassuring
fetal heart tracing.  Mother is a 28 year old gravida 5, para
1, now 2 woman.  Mother's prenatal screens are blood type A
positive, antibody negative, Rubella immune, RPR nonreactive
and hepatitis surface antigen negative.  This pregnancy was
complicated by a cerclage placement at 14 weeks gestation and
intrauterine growth restriction of unclear etiology.  The
mother's cytomegalovirus and toxoplasmosis titers were
negative.  She had a low amniotic fluid index of 6.  The
infant emerged vigorous.  Apgars were 8 at one minute and 9
at five minutes.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The birthweight was 1,640 gm, in the
26th percentile and birth length was 79.5 cm, that is in the
10th percentile and birth head circumference was 30 cm which
is the 25th percentile for gestational age.

The admission physical examination reveals a vigorous preterm
infant.  The anterior fontanelle is soft and flat.
Tachypnea.  Breath sounds clear.  Decreased perfusion.
Extremely pale.  No murmur.  Abdomen, soft, nontender and
nondistended.  Extremities warm.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
Respiratory status - The infant has always been in room air.
He has had some initial respiratory distress which resolved
in the first 12 hours of life and he has remained in room air
since that time.  He has had no apnea or bradycardia.  His
respirations are comfortable.  Breath sounds are clear and
equal.

Cardiovascular status - [**Location (un) 3825**] received some fluid
resuscitation after admission for poor perfusion and
metabolic acidosis which resolved.  He has remained
normotensive since that time.  He has a regular heart rate
and rhythm and no murmur.

Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition - At the time of
discharge, his weight is 2,005 gm, his length is 43.5 cm and
his head circumference is 31 cm.  Enteral feeds were begun on
day of life #1 and advanced to full volume feeds by day of
life #4.  At the time of discharge he is eating 26 cal/oz
breastmilk make with NeoSure powder and corn oil added to
breastmilk on an ad lib schedule.

Gastrointestinal status - [**Location (un) 3825**] was treated with
phototherapy with hyperbilirubinemia of prematurity on day of
life #2 until day of life #8.  His peak bilirubin occurred on
day of life #2 and was a total of 9.3, direct 0.3.

Urology - The infant was circumcised on [**2136-7-6**], and the
area is healing well with mixed granulation tissue.

Hematology status - [**Location (un) 3825**] never received any blood product
transfusions during his Neonatal Intensive Care Unit stay.
His hematocrit at the time of admission was 44.1.

Infectious disease status - He was started on ampicillin and
gentamicin at the time of admission for sepsis risk factors.
After 48 hours the antibiotics were discontinued because the
blood cultures were negative and the infant was clinically
well.  There had been no further infectious disease issues.
The infant had a negative urine cytomegalovirus.  Placenta
pathology was completely within normal limits.

Skin - The infant has a sebaceous nevi on the right temporal
scalp, measuring 1 cm by 0.5 cm.  This is to be followed up
by the [**Hospital 2652**] Clinic at [**Hospital3 1810**].

section for worsening PIH.  Maternal prenatal screens
included blood type A positive, rubella immune, RPR
nonreactive, hepatitis B surface antigen negative, and GBS
unknown.  Pregnancy was conceived via IVF and was complicated
by PIH.

Patient emerged vigorous.  Was given blow-by O2 in the
delivery room and facial CPAP secondary to grunting.  APGAR 8
at one minute and 8 at fuve minutes. He was transported to the
NICU secondary to respiratory distress and prematurity.

PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 97.5, heart rate
170, respiratory rate in the 50s, blood pressure 54/39 with a
mean of 50.  Anterior fontanel open and flat.  Palate intact.
Heart with a regular rate and rhythm, no murmur.  Normal
pulses.  Chest with a mild pectus.  Patient retracting with
fair air exchange.  Abdomen is soft, bowel sounds present,
anus patent.  Normal male external genitalia.  Testes
descended.  Normal tone for gestational age.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
1. Respiratory:  Initially placed on CPAP, then intubated and
received one dose of Surfactant.  Rapidly extubated to CPAP
and transitioned to room air on day of life one.
Subsequently breathing comfortably in room air.  Infrequent
episodes of apnea and bradycardia of prematurity.  At the
time of this dictation, the patient is six days without a
spell.

2. Cardiovascular:  Patient with a soft murmur noted on day
of life one.  Murmur persisted through day of life three.  An
echocardiogram was obtained, which revealed a PDA with left
to right flow.  Patient was started on Indocin.  Completed
one course of Indocin.  Follow-up ECHO with small residual
PDA, not clinically significant. Murmur subsequently resolved.
Patient maintained normal blood pressures throughout
admission.

3. FEN: Initially NPO and on IV fluids. Feeds were initiated
on day of life one and were advanced as tolerated.  Patient
was made NPO on day of life three when he was started on a
course of Indocin for a PDA.  He remained NPO throughout his
Indocin course.  His feeds were restarted on day of life six,
and advanced without difficulty.  Patient reached full feeds
on day of life 10, and then calories were then advanced.
Advanced to 150 cc/kg/day of PE24 or breast milk 24. Has taken
all of his feeds p.o. for two days. On [**3-31**] was switched to an
adlib feeding regimen of NeoSure 24 calories/ounce in
preparation for discharge home.  He was started on Vi-Daylin
and iron supplements.  Electrolytes monitored and last checked
on day of life seven with a sodium of 140, potassium of 4.3,
chloride of 108, and a bicarb of 20.

4. GI:  Bilirubin levels monitored.  Phototherapy was
initiated for hyperbilirubinemia with a peak bilirubin of
9.7/0.2.  Phototherapy was discontinued on day of life six
for a bilirubin of 5.3/0.2 and rebound bilirubin the
following day was 6.0/0.2.

5. ID:  CBC and blood cultures sent on admission.  White
count of 12 with 30 polys and no bands.  Started on
ampicillin and gentamicin.  Blood cultures had no growth at
48 hours and antibiotics were discontinued.  No further ID
issues.  Patient does have an umbilicus that we are
monitoring since his cord came off.  It is continuing to heal
well with no signs of infection.

6. Hematology:  Hematocrit on admission 48.2, platelets of
352.  Patient required no blood products during this
hospitalization.

7. Sensory:  Audiology:  Hearing screen was performed
automated auditory brain stem responses and patient passed
bilaterally on [**3-30**].

8. Routine healthcare maintenance:  Patient received
hepatitis B vaccine on [**3-30**].  Patient will need a car
seat test prior to discharge home.  Parents are requesting a
circumcision prior to discharge home.  Newborn state screens
sent on day of life three.  Repeated on day of life 14, and
results are pending at this time.

[**2140-10-30**] Head CT :1. Bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhage. Possible
tiny left cerebral subdural hemorrhage measuring less than 2 mm.

2. Hemorrhage within the prepontine cistern and in the pons
(anteriorly).
Linear hyperdensity anterior to the pons is likely extraaxial.
3. Bilateral longitudinal temporal bone fractures extending to
the right
carotid canal. Left lateral and medial orbital wall fractures
and left
zygomatic fracture. CTA is recommended to exclude carotid
injury.
4. Sinus opacification with fractures of the sphenoid sinus.

[**2140-10-30**] Abd/Chest CT : 1. ET and NG tubes positioned adequately.

2. Consolidation in the superior segment of the right lower lobe
and complete consolidation of the left lower lobe which reflect
aspiration.
3. Anterior mediastinal density which is most compatible with
residual thymic tissue. No evidence of aortic injury.
4. Nonspecific hypodense lesions in the liver and right kidney
which are
incompletely characterized

[**2140-10-30**] C Spine CT : 1. No cervical spine fracture.
2. Bilateral skull base fractures, better evaluated on dedicated
head CT.
3. Secretions within trachea surrounding endotracheal balloon
concerning for aspiration.

[**2140-10-31**] Left forearm : No fracture of the left forearm is
detected. Assessment of the left wrist is limited on these
views. Allowing for this, the left wrist is grossly
unremarkable. However, if there is specific clinical concern for
wrist injury, dedicated views of the wrist would be recommended.


[**2140-10-30**] CTA Head :
  1. No evidence of carotid artery dissection.
  2. Focal abnormality of the right ACA just superior to the
ACA/ACOM junction. This likely represents tortuosity of vessel,
although tiny focal aneurysm cannot be excluded. Repeat CTA or
MRA could be performed in two to three weeks for further
evaluation.
  3. Multiple bilateral skull base fractures, unchanged.
  4. Bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhage and hemorrhage anterior
to the pons
within the interpeduncular cistern is better appreciated on
non-contrast head CT performed earlier.

[**2140-11-1**] Head CT : 1. Apparent resolution of subarachnoid
hemorrhage.
  2. Persistence of possible left cerebral subdural hemorrhage.
  3. Bilateral longitudinal temporal bone fractures and left
lateral medial orbital wall fractures and left zygomatic
fracture (see CT fromSeptember 20, [**2140**] for details).
  4. Sphenoid sinus opacification and sphenoid fractures.
  5. High-density material in the bilateral maxillary sinuses is
likely
hemorrhage.

[**2140-11-1**] CT sinus/mandible :
There is partial opacification of bilateral mastoid air cells as

well as fluid seen within the left external auditory canal.
High-density
material is seen within the bilateral maxillary sinuses and
sphenoid sinuses compatible with blood. The right skull base
fracture extends longitudinally through the temporal bone
(series 2, image 39; series 401B, image 16). There is also a
fracture that extends from the right posterior wall of the
sphenoid sinus (series 401B, image 41; series 2, image 41) into
the right carotid canal. A longitudinal left temporal bone
fracture is noted that extends into the left parietal bone
superiorly series 2, image 4).There is a minimally displaced
fracture of the left zygoma (series 2, image 35) as well as the
left lateral wall of the left orbit. A thin lucency noted at the
superomedial aspect may represent a subtle fracture. No obvious
extension into the TMJ is noted, the lucency noted on the
studies in the posterior aspect of the TMJ relating to the site
of [**Hospital1 **] of the mastoid and squamous portions of the temporal
bone and seen on both sides. Thin non-displaced fracture of the
lateral pterygoid is noted on the left. Scattered foci of air
are noted including the right side of the neck , related to the
trauma. Evaluation for any other subtle
 fractures may be limited.

[**2140-11-5**] CTA Chest :
1. Enlarged now moderate-to-large left pneumothorax. Left chest
tube
terminates in the anterolateral subcutaneous soft tissues of the
chest wall. Slight rightward shift of midline structures.
  2. Pneumomediastinum. Subcutaneous gas along bilateral
anterior chest wall, tracking up to the thoracic inlet on the
left. Right chest wall laceration.
  3. Multifocal consolidation involving all lobes of the lungs,
likely due to aspiration and pneumonia.
  4. Assessment is slightly limited due to respiratory motion,
particularly along the lingula, but no evidence of PE seen.

[**2140-11-5**] MRI C Spine ;
Negative cervical spine MRI scan. Incomplete study of the
thoracic spine.

[**2140-11-8**] MRI Head and orbits :
1. Punctate hemorrhagic diffuse axonal injury in the left
parietal
subcortical white matter, and possibly also in the left
posterior frontal
subcortical white matter. Extensive diffuse axonal injury in the
splenium of the corpus callosum and associated infarction, with
a small hemorrhagic
component.
  2. Probable evolving acute/early subacute infarct in the right
pons, which is nonspecific but could be related to
nonhemorrhagic axial injury.
  3. Bilateral small retrocerebellar subdural hematomas.
  4. Subarachnoid hemorrhage again demonstrated.
  5. Unremarkable appearance of the orbits.

[**2140-11-10**] CXR : Near resolution of left apical pneumothorax.





Brief Hospital Course:
[**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the Trauma ICU for management of
his traumatic brain injury.  His GCS at the scene was 3 and 7 at
the time of admission.  He was seen by the Neurosurgical service
for evaluation and placement of a bolt for ICP monitoring.His
initial ICP was 10.  His left pupil was fixed and dilated and he
had a left hemiparesis.  His right upper and lower extremities
were moving.  He did require sedation while he was intubated as
he was very agitated.

From a neurologic standpoint he has had marked improvement
during his hospitalization.  He was treated with dilantin for 12
days and had no seizure activity.  Following his extubation from
the respirator he was able to speak and understand, respond to
commands and his left sided weakness improved. He continued to
have a left HP though this had been improving daily.  Most
recent MRI of the C and T spine showed no cord contusion.  MRI
of his brainshows axonal injury parietal and frontal white
matter on left aswell as in the left corpus collosum and the
right pons infarct,likely the cause of his left hemiparesis. His
left CN III palsey is unchanged.  With the help of physical
therapy he is up and walking but needs to refocus and needs
reminders to concentrate.

[**Known firstname **] developed drainage from his right ear about 1 week ago and
the consistency was old blood.  He was reevaluated by the
Neurosurgery Service to assure that it was not CSF.  His
drainage gradually decreased and resolved 48 hours ago. He will
continue to follow up with Neurosurgery as an outpatient.

He was treated with antibiotics in the ICU for a presumed
pneumonia.  His CXR is notable for b/l atelectesis and he has
remained afebrile off antibiotcs for 24 hours. He is using his
incentive spirometer.  On [**2140-11-2**] a right chest tube was placed
for a hemothotax and this drained and was removed without
difficulya few days later.  There is no effusion or pneumothorax
on his post pull film.

His nutritional status is being monitored and he is tolerating a
regular diet with nectar thick liquids.  He has been seen by the
Speech and Swallow Service who recommend strict aspiration
precautions and a repeat study after he gets settled in rehab.

During his hospitalization his family has been with him 24/7 and
are very supportive, attentive and concerned for his future
recovery.  They will appreciate
updates as his condition improves or changes.

   BEDSIDE SWALLOWING EVALUATION:
   HISTORY:
   Thank you for consulting on this 22 y/o male who was transferred from
   OSH on [**10-30**] s/p fall off dirt bike at approximate speed of 35 mph. He
   was found to be combative by EMS with GCS 6 and was intubated and
   sedated  at OSH. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 19**]
   for further management. Pt was found with  small SDH, SAH, prepontine
   hemorrhage fractures of his L lateral orbit, left zygomatic, and
   bilateral temporal bones. He had a bolt in place on the 21st to the
   22nd with normal pressures. Pt also with dilated left pupil, likely
   from peripheral 3rd nerve
   palsy per neurology notes. CXR on [**11-3**] revealed increased RLL and
   retrocardiac opacities which may represent PNA.  CXR on [**11-4**] pending.
   Pt self extubated [**11-3**] and was apparently complaining of paresthesias
   in his left arm and leg.  He is currently NPO, pending our eval. We
   were consulted to evaluate oral and pharyngeal swallow function to
   determine the safest diet.
   EVALUATION:
   The examination was performed while the patient was seated upright in
   the chair on the TSICU.
   Cognition, language, speech, voice:
   Pt was asleep upon entry to the room, but roused quickly. He was
   oriented to person, but not date, and was confused about place (first
   said ""[**Location (un) 2911**]"" and then ""hospital"").  He was also confused about
   current job, at first reporting that he was in high school, but was
   able to correctly id his place of employment with prompting from step
   father (""High school was before, where do you work now?).  He also
   perseverat ed on previous instructions and continued to say ""ahh"" with
   food in mouth x3, even after instruction to swallow before speaking.
   However, pt was able to follow simple commands and was without
   dysarthria or paraphasias.  Speech was fluent and well articulated.
   Voice quality was low volume and hypophonic.
   Teeth: WNL
   Secretions: Thick, bloody secretions brought up with productive cough
   and removed with yankauer.
   ORAL MOTOR EXAM:
   Face was grossly symmetrical. Tongue protruded at midline with adequate
   ROM. Labial seal intact. Palatal elevation symmetric and gag present
   with deep prodding.
   SWALLOWING ASSESSMENT:
   Pt was offered ice chips, thin liquids (tsp, straw), nectar thick
   liquids (tsp, straw), puree, ground solids, and soft solids.  Oral
   phase was timely and without anterior spill. Laryngeal elevation was
   WFL, but difficult to palpate due to cervical collar.  Pt coughed with
   all trials of thin liquids and consecutive trials of soft solids. No
   choking, 02 desats, or vocal quality changes were observed.  Sensation
   appeared intact, given pt report of pharyngeal residue and ""I'm
   choking"" with thin liquids.
   SUMMARY / IMPRESSION:
   Pt presents with s/sx of aspiration with thin liquids and consecutive
   trials of soft solids.  A PO diet of ground solids and nectar thick
   liquids is recommended.  Meds should be crushed in puree.  1:1
   supervision is suggested with meals to assist with feeding and
   encourage alternating between solids and liquids. Consult Nutrition as
   needed.  We will f/u early next week for diets upgrades and cognitive
   dx/tx as able.
   This swallowing pattern correlates to a Functional Oral Intake Scale
   (FOIS) rating of 5 out of 7.
   RECOMMENDATIONS:
   1.) PO diet of ground solids and nectar thick liquids.
   2.) Meds crushed in puree
   3.) TID oral care
   4.) 1:1 supervision to assist with feeding and encourage alternating
   btwn solids and liquids.
   5.) Please consult Nutrition as needed
   6.) We will f/u early next week
   These recommendations were shared with the patient, nurse and medical
   team.

   palsy per neurology notes. CXR on [**11-3**] revealed increased RLL and
   retrocardiac opacities which may represent PNA.  CXR on [**11-4**] pending.
   Pt self extubated [**11-3**] and was apparently complaining of paresthesias
   in his left arm and leg.  He is currently NPO, pending our eval. We
   were consulted to evaluate oral and pharyngeal swallow function to
   determine the safest diet.
   EVALUATION:
   The examination was performed while the patient was seated upright in
   the chair on the TSICU.
   Cognition, language, speech, voice:
   Pt was asleep upon entry to the room, but roused quickly. He was
   oriented to person, but not date, and was confused about place (first
   said ""[**Location (un) 2911**]"" and then ""hospital"").  He was also confused about
   current job, at first reporting that he was in high school, but was
   able to correctly id his place of employment with prompting from step
   father (""High school was before, where do you work now?).  He also
   perseverat ed on previous instructions and continued to say ""ahh"" with
   food in mouth x3, even after instruction to swallow before speaking.
   However, pt was able to follow simple commands and was without
   dysarthria or paraphasias.  Speech was fluent and well articulated.
   Voice quality was low volume and hypophonic.
   Teeth: WNL
   Secretions: Thick, bloody secretions brought up with productive cough
   and removed with yankauer.
   ORAL MOTOR EXAM:
   Face was grossly symmetrical. Tongue protruded at midline with adequate
   ROM. Labial seal intact. Palatal elevation symmetric and gag present
   with deep prodding.
   SWALLOWING ASSESSMENT:
   Pt was offered ice chips, thin liquids (tsp, straw), nectar thick
   liquids (tsp, straw), puree, ground solids, and soft solids.  Oral
   phase was timely and without anterior spill. Laryngeal elevation was
   WFL, but difficult to palpate due to cervical collar.  Pt coughed with
   all trials of thin liquids and consecutive trials of soft solids. No
   choking, 02 desats, or vocal quality changes were observed.  Sensation
   appeared intact, given pt report of pharyngeal residue and ""I'm
   choking"" with thin liquids.
   SUMMARY / IMPRESSION:
   Pt presents with s/sx of aspiration with thin liquids and consecutive
   trials of soft solids.  A PO diet of ground solids and nectar thick
   liquids is recommended.  Meds should be crushed in puree.  1:1
   supervision is suggested with meals to assist with feeding and
   encourage alternating between solids and liquids. Consult Nutrition as
   needed.  We will f/u early next week for diets upgrades and cognitive
   dx/tx as able.
   This swallowing pattern correlates to a Functional Oral Intake Scale
   (FOIS) rating of 5 out of 7.
   RECOMMENDATIONS:
   1.) PO diet of ground solids and nectar thick liquids.
   2.) Meds crushed in puree
   3.) TID oral care
   4.) 1:1 supervision to assist with feeding and encourage alternating
   btwn solids and liquids.
   5.) Please consult Nutrition as needed
   6.) We will f/u early next week
   These recommendations were shared with the patient, nurse and medical
   team.

   infarct, witness aspiration, orbit fx, basilar skull fracture, ??L
   sided third nerve palsy (L pupil fixed and dilated since accident)
   Trauma, s/p
   Assessment:
   Pt. awake but confused, able to state name, follows commands but
   restless at times.  C/o lower back pain and pain in neck.  Normal
   movement of right side but minimal movement of left arm, and left leg
   weakness. R pupil briskly reactive, can only open L eye a slit. L pupil
   remains non reactive at 5-6mm.  Cervical collar remains in place.  R
   hand mitted to prevent pt. pulling at lines, tube or collar. Other
   safety measures including bed alarm, high visibility with frequent
   checks utilized.   Continues on dilantin 200 iv q 12 hours with level
   this am 9.6. BP remains < goal of 160, sats maintained  on 3L np.

   dilated since accident) and left hemiparesis, right pupil brisk and
   purposeful movement with RUE.  Spine clear radiographically, CT of
   torso significant for bibasilar consolidation c/w aspiration.
   Trauma, s/p
   Assessment:
   Pt. awake but confused, able to state name, follows commands.  Normal
   movement of right side but minimal movement of left arm, and left leg
   weakness. R pupil briskly reactive, can only open L eye a slit. L pupil
   remains non reactive at 5-6mm (believed to be third nerve palsy).

 INDICATION:  Facial fractures.

 COMPARISON:  None available.

 TECHNIQUE:  Multiple MDCT axial images were obtained through the facial bones
 without intravenous contrast.  Multiplanar reformats were derived.

 FINDINGS:  There is partial opacification of bilateral mastoid air cells as
 well as fluid seen within the left external auditory canal.  High-density
 material is seen within the bilateral maxillary sinuses and sphenoid sinuses
 compatible with blood.  The right skull base fracture extends longitudinally
 through the temporal bone (series 2, image 39; series 401B, image 16).  There
 is also a fracture that extends from the right posterior wall of the sphenoid
 sinus (series 401B, image 41; series 2, image 41) into the right carotid
 canal.  A longitudinal left temporal bone fracture is noted that extends into
 the left parietal bone superiorly series 2, image 4).There is a minimally
 displaced fracture of the left zygoma (series 2, image 35) as well as the left
 lateral wall of the left orbit. A thin lucency noted at the superomedial
 aspect may represent a subtle fracture.
 No obvious extension into the TMJ is noted, the lucency noted on the studies
 in the posterior aspect of the TMJ relating to the site of [**Hospital1 4980**] of the
 mastoid and squamous portions of the temporal bone and seen on both sides.
 Thin non-displaced fracture of the lateral pterygoid is noted on the left.
 Scattered foci of air are noted including the right side of the neck , related
 to the trauma.
 Evaluation for any other subtle fractures may be limited.

 IMPRESSION:  A complex fracture patent as enumerates above involving bilateral
 longitudinal temporal bone fractures, fractures of the left zygoma and left
 lateral orbital wall as detailed above.

 While the reason for blown pupil is not clear, MR [**Name13 (STitle) 1699**] may be helpful to

 MRI SCAN OF THE CERVICAL SPINE

 HISTORY:  Head trauma with ATV accident.  Decreased motor function of left
 face and cranial nerve III.  Assess for ocular injury on the left.

 TECHNIQUE:  Only a cervical spine MR scan was obtained at this time as well as
 a single sagittal T1-weighted image of the thoracic spine.  The patient,
 according to the technologist, could not complete the study.

 COMPARISON STUDIES ON PACS ARCHIVE:  CT scan of the cervical spine from
 [**2140-10-30**] reported as revealing ""no cervical spine fracture"" by Drs.
 [**Last Name (STitle) 5265**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) **].

 FINDINGS:  There is no disc or vertebral abnormality seen within the cervical
 spine and on the single available sagittal T1-weighted scan of the thoracic
 spine.  There is no prevertebral soft tissue swelling, abnormality of signal
 of the cord, nor abnormality of the foramen magnum and its contents.

 CONCLUSION:  Negative cervical spine MRI scan.  Incomplete study of the
 thoracic spine.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  A 32-year old man status post ATV accident with GCS 7.

 TECHNIQUE:  Sagittal short TR, short TE, spin echo images were obtained
 through the brain.  Axial imaging was performed with long TR, long TE, fast
 spin echo, FLAIR, gradient echo, and diffusion technique.  Contrast T1-
 weighted images were repeated in axial and sagittal projections following iv
 gadolinium. Axial and coronal T1W high- resolution images of the orbits were
 obtained before and after iv gadolinium.  Coronal STIR images of the orbits
 were also obtained.

 COMPARISON:  CTs of the head performed on [**2052-10-29**] and 22, [**2140**].  No
 prior head MRI for comparison.

 FINDINGS:  There are small bilateral retrocerebellar subdural hematomas in the
 posterior fossa, with high signal on T1-weighted and FLAIR images indicating
 subacuity.

 There is multifocal sulcal hyperintensity on FLAIR images, corresponding to
 the previously demonstrated subarachnoid hemorrhage.

 There is a microhemorrhage in the left superior posterior frontal region,
 which could be subarachoid or at the [**Doctor Last Name 107**]/white matter junction (13:21;
 11:21).  If intra-axial, this microhemorrhage could represent diffuse axonal
 injury.

 There is a microhemorrhage in the left parietal subcortical white matter
 (13:18), consistent with diffuse axonal injury.

 There is extensive symmetric slow diffusion and high T2 signal in the splenium
 of the corpus callosum, and a microhemorrhage in the left aspect of the
 affected splenium (13:15).  These findings are suggestive of diffuse axonal
 injury with a small hemorrhagic component and associated infarction.

 There is high signal on T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted images in the right

 pons, with equivocal associated low signal on the ADC map.  There is no
 evidence of associated blood products.  This could represent an evolving
 acute/early subacute infarct, possibly related to non-hemorrhagic diffuse
 axonal injury.

 The ventricles are normal in size and configuration. There is no cerebral
 edema and no shift of midline structures.

 There is opacification of the sphenoid sinuses, fluid in the right maxillary
 sinus and mucosal thickening in the ethmoid air cells, which could be related
 to the known facial and skull base fractures.  There is opacification of the
 mastoid air cells bilaterally, which could be related to the known temporal
 bone fractures and/or the presence of the endotracheal tube.

 MRI ORBITS:

 The globes appear intact.  There is no evidence of an intraorbital hematoma.
 The extraocular muscles, optic nerves, and optic chiasm are unremarkable. The
 cavernous sinuses are unremarkable.

 IMPRESSION:

 1.  Punctate hemorrhagic diffuse axonal injury in the left parietal
 subcortical white matter, and possibly also in the left posterior frontal
 subcortical white matter.  Extensive diffuse axonal injury in the splenium of
 the corpus callosum and associated infarction, with a small hemorrhagic
 component.

 2.  Probable evolving acute/early subacute infarct in the right pons, which
 is nonspecific but could be related to nonhemorrhagic axial injury.

 3.  Bilateral small retrocerebellar subdural hematomas.

 4.  Subarachnoid hemorrhage again demonstrated.

 5.  Unremarkable appearance of the orbits.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post ATV accident with multiple head injuries.

 COMPARISON:  No previous dedicated thoracic spine imaging.

 TECHNIQUE:  Sagittal T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and STIR images of the thoracic
 spine, with axial T2-weighted images from T1-2 through T9-10 levels.

 FINDINGS:  Vertebral body height and alignment are normal.  There is no
 evidence of edema in the bone marrow of the vertebral bodies.  The spinal
 ligaments appear intact without signal abnormalities.  There is no epidural
 collection.

 At T3-4, there is a left paracentral disc protrusion with overlying endplate
 osteophytes, which abuts the left ventral aspect of the spinal cord without
 evidence of cord deformation.

 At T5-6, there are left paracentral endplate osteophytes without significant
 mass effect on the spinal cord.

 At T11-12, there is a right paracentral disc protrusion with overlying
 endplate osteophytes.  There is no significant mass effect on the spinal cord.

 The spinal cord demonstrates normal signal intensity, terminating at T12-L1.

 There are scattered dependent opacities in the imaged portions of the lungs,
 which could be related to atelectasis or contusions.  Correlation with chest
 imaging is suggested.

 IMPRESSION:

 1.  No evidence of ligamentous injury.  No bone marrow edema in the vertebral
 bodies.

 2.  Mild spondylosis.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Left wrist swelling after ATV accident, question fracture.

 LEFT HUMERUS, TWO PORTABLE VIEWS:

 No fracture of the left humerus is detected.

 LEFT FOREARM, TWO PORTABLE VIEWS:

 No fracture of the left forearm is detected. Assessment of the left wrist is
 limited on these views.  Allowing for this, the left wrist is grossly
 unremarkable.  However, if there is specific clinical concern for wrist
 injury, dedicated views of the wrist would be recommended.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  22-year-old male post-ATV accident with a blown left pupil.

 COMPARISON:  Non-contrast head CT [**2140-10-30**], 18:22 hours.

 TECHNIQUE:  A non-contrast head CT was obtained.

 FINDINGS:  Hyperdensity of the anterior pons (2:8) is similar to one day
 prior.  Blood in the prepontine cistern, and left frontal and right parietal
 subarachnoid hemorrhage are slightly less conspicuous.  The previously
 identified possible 2-mm left extra-axial hematoma is unchanged, likely
 artifactual (2:21).  No new intracranial hemorrhage is identified.  The tiny
 focus of pneumocephalus along the left inferior frontal lobe persists (2:13
 mm).  [**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter differentiation is normal.  The ventricles are
 unchanged in size and configuration.  There is no evidence for uncal or
 transtentorial herniation, and there is no shift of normally midline
 structures.

 Blood in the right maxillary sinus has increased.  Blood in the left maxillary
 and sphenoid sinus, as well as in the ethmoid air cells is unchanged. Numerous
 facial and skull fractures are unchanged, as described on the initial head CT.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Unchanged anterior pons hemorrhage.

 2.  Bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhage and blood in the prepontine cistern is
 slightly less conspicuous.

 3.  Increased blood in the right maxillary sinus.

 4.  Facial bone and skull fractures as described on the initial head CT.

 STUDY:  AP semi-erect portable chest radiograph.

 COMPARISON:  [**2140-10-30**], portable chest radiograph and CT of the torso
 with contrast.

 FINDINGS:  The endotracheal tube ends 6 cm above the carina.  An endogastric
 tube courses inferiorly and below the GE junction out of the field of view.
 The heart size is normal.  Mediastinum is shifted to the left.  Retrocardiac
 opacification likely represents left lower lobe collapse.  The right lung is
 essentially clear.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Mild
 pneumomediastinum at the thoracic inlet is new; should be followed to
 distinguish clinically insignificant barotrauma, from extrasation originating
 in the trachea or esophagus.

 IMPRESSION:  Left lower lobe collapse; clear right lung. Unexplained
 pneumomediastinum.  Findyings discussed with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 54365**].

 CHEST, ABDOMEN, AND PELVIS CT SCAN PERFORMED ON [**2140-10-30**].

 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Status post ATV accident with question of internal injury.

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT was used to obtain contiguous axial images through the chest,
 abdomen, and pelvis following the administration of IV contrast.  Coronal and
 sagittal reformations were provided.

 FINDINGS:

 CHEST:  Endotracheal tube is seen with its tip approximately 4.7 cm above the
 carina.  An NG tube is seen coursing inferiorly with its tip coiled in the
 stomach.  The heart is normal in size and shape.  There is anterior
 mediastinal density which appears most compatible with residual thymic tissue.
 The aorta is normal in course and caliber without evidence of intimal flap.
 There is no lymphadenopathy.  At the level of the ET tube tip there is
 material that is dependently in the upper trachea, best seen on series 2,
 image 6.

 There is complete consolidation of the left lower lobe which may be secondary
 to aspiration.  There is consolidation within the superior segment of the
 right lower lobe which may be secondary to aspiration.  Additionally
 diffuse tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 462**] peripheral opacities in the right mid-lung are also likely
 reflective of aspiration. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
 Subsegmental right basilar atelectasis is noted.

 The liver and spleen appear intact without evidence of traumatic injury or
 adjacent free fluid.  There are two subcentimeter vague hypodensities within
 the liver seen on series 2, image 56 and 60 which are incompletely assessed.
 The gallbladder is unremarkable.  The pancreas, adrenal glands have a normal
 appearance bilaterally.  Kidneys enhance symmetrically and excrete contrast
 promptly. There is a cortical hypodensity in the lower pole of the right
 kidney seen on series 2, image 66, which is incompletely characterized given
 its small size. The abdominal aorta and the major branch vessels are widely
 patent.  There is no retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.  The stomach and
 duodenum appear grossly unremarkable.  There is no free air or free fluid.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CTA HEAD WITH CONTRAST.

 COMPARISON:  Non-contrast head CT immediately prior.

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT axially acquired images of the brain were obtained.  IV
 contrast was administered.  Coronal, sagittal, and volume-rendered reformats
 were performed.

 HISTORY:  Status post ATV accident with bilateral skull base fractures
 extending to the right carotid canal.  Evaluate for vascular injury.

 FINDINGS:

 HEAD CT:  Please note that a repeat non-contrast head CT was not performed as
 the CTA was performed immediately after the initial non-contrast head CT.
 Therefore, evaluation of known bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhages, hemorrhage
 anterior to the pons and in the interpeduncular cistern is not well
 appreciated on this contrast- enhanced study. There is no significant shift of
 normally midline structures or evidence of hydrocephalus. Multiple skull base
 fractures are again identified, better evaluated on initial head CT.

 CTA OF THE BRAIN:  The bilateral internal carotid arteries are intact.  There
 is no evidence of intimal flap or dissection.  There is no evidence of
 stenosis or occlusion within the intracranial portions of the bilateral
 internal carotid arteries or vertebral arteries or their branches.  Focal
 prominence of the right ACA just superior to the takeoff of the ACOM is noted
 on the source images only.  This likely represents a tortuous vessel, although
 tiny focal aneurysm cannot be entirely excluded.  No abnormalities are
 otherwise seen in the anterior or posterior intracranial circulation.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No evidence of carotid artery dissection.

 2.  Focal abnormality of the right ACA just superior to the ACA/ACOM junction.
 This likely represents tortuosity of vessel, although tiny focal aneurysm
 cannot be excluded.  Repeat CTA or MRA could be performed in two to three

 INDICATION:  22-year-old man with endotracheal tube, low saturation, status
 post bronchoscopy.  Evaluation for interval change.

 COMPARISON:  [**2140-11-1**].

 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the course and position of
 the endotracheal tube, the nasogastric tube and the left-sided central venous
 access line are unchanged.  Newly appeared is a right basal relatively
 homogeneous area of opacity with scarce air bronchograms that shows unusually
 sharp borders at the lateral, medial and caudal aspects.  This suggests that
 the opacity correspond collapsed lung in the presence of a small ventrobasal
 pneumothorax.

 The size of the cardiac silhouette and the pre-existing retrocardiac opacity
 are unchanged.  No other newly occurred parenchymal opacities.

 Unchanged overall extent of the pre-existing pneumomediastinum.

 CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST.

 COMPARISON:  None.

 HISTORY:  22-year-old male status post ATV accident with blown right pupil.
 Evaluate for head bleed.

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT axially acquired images through the brain were obtained.  No
 IV contrast was administered.  Coronal and sagittal reformats were performed.

 FINDINGS:  Scattered foci of subarachnoid hemorrhage noted. Specifically,
 in the left frontal lobe (2, 25), right parietal lobe (2, 18). Hemorrhage is
 noted within the prepontine cistern (2, 12).  There is a possible 2-mm left
 cerebral subdural hematoma (2, 21) although this may represent streak
 artifact. Anterior to the pons, there is hyperdensity which appears linear on
 sagittal views (400B, 44), likely an extra-axial hematoma. Increased density
 within the anterior inferior aspect of the pons may represent a hemorrhagic
 intra-axial contusion (400B, 44 and 2, 8).  There is no shift of normally
 midline structures or hydrocephalus.  There is no intraventricular hemorrhage.
 Tiny foci of pneumocephalus is identified (2, 13) along the inferior left
 frontal lobe. There is normal [**Doctor Last Name 107**]- white matter differentiation. There is no
 evidence of acute major vascular territorial infarction.

 There is hyperdense fluid (compatible with blood) within the left maxillary,
 sphenoid and ethmoid air cells as well as a small amount within the frontal
 sinuses. There are multiple skull base fractures including bilateral
 longitudinal temporal bone fractures, which extend to the middle ear
 bilaterally.  The mastoid air cells are opacified, right greater than left.
 The right skull base fracture extends from the right posterior wall of the
 sphenoid sinus into the right carotid canal. The left temporal bone fracture
 extends into the posterior wall of the left TMJ joint as well as superiorly
 into the left parietotemporal bone (3, 25). There are fractures of the left
 zygoma, left lateral and medial orbital wall (3, 15). The left orbital globe
 appears grossly intact.  There is a small amount of periorbital soft tissue
 swelling. Possible left lateral pterygoid fracture, although this is only seen
 on a single image and may represent artifact (3, 6).

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhage.  Possible tiny left cerebral subdural
 hemorrhage measuring less than 2 mm.
 2.  Hemorrhage within the prepontine cistern and in the pons (anteriorly).
 Linear hyperdensity anterior to the pons is likely extraaxial.
 3.  Bilateral longitudinal temporal bone fractures extending to the right
 carotid canal.  Left lateral and medial orbital wall fractures and left
 zygomatic fracture.  CTA is recommended to exclude carotid injury.
 4.  Sinus opacification with fractures of the sphenoid sinus.

 These findings were discussed with the trauma surgical team on-call at the

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Subarachnoid hemorrhage.  Evaluate for changes.

 COMPARISON:  [**2140-10-30**].

 FINDINGS:  There has been interval introduction of a right frontal approach
 bolt.  Foci of subarachnoid hemorrhage appeared to have resolved. A possible
 left cerebral subdural hematoma measuring to 2 mm persists.  There is no new
 intracranial hemorrhage.  [**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter differentiation is preserved.
 Ventricles, sulci, and cisterns are of normal configuration and size for age.
 Basal cisterns are preserved.  The foramen magnum is patent. Multiple skull
 base fractures including  temporal bones are again seen (refer to [**2140-10-19**] CT for further description). Visualized mastoid air cells appear clear.
 High-density material within bilateral maxillary and ethmoid sinuses likely
 represents hemorrhage.

 IMPRESSION:

 1.  Apparent resolution of subarachnoid hemorrhage.

 2.  Persistence of possible left cerebral subdural hemorrhage.

 3.  Bilateral longitudinal temporal bone fractures and left lateral medial
 orbital wall fractures and left zygomatic fracture (see CT from [**2140-10-30**] for details).

 4.  Sphenoid sinus opacification and sphenoid fractures.

 5.  High-density material in the bilateral maxillary sinuses is likely
 hemorrhage.

 PORTABLE CHEST, [**2140-11-2**]

 COMPARISON:  Study of one day earlier.

 INDICATION:  Acute lung injury.

 FINDINGS:  A small left pneumothorax is present, and has slightly increased
 from the recent radiograph.  Right-sided chest tube remains in place.  No
 residual visible pneumothorax on the right.  Persistent pneumomediastinum and
 slight worsening of subcutaneous emphysema within the left chest wall.
 Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.  Persistent bibasilar confluent
 opacities, with interval worsening on the right, with a few air bronchograms.
 Although the left-sided opacities have been present since the initial
 presentation radiograph of three days earlier, the right-sided opacities have
 more recently developed.  Although potentially due to atelectasis, evolving
 aspiration pneumonia should be considered in the appropriate setting.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  22-year-old man with subdural hematoma.  Assess for any changes.

 COMPARISON:  Multiple head CTs, most recent of [**2140-11-1**] and MRI of
 the brain, most recent of [**2140-11-8**].

 FINDINGS:  There is no acute hemorrhage, mass effect or shift of midline
 structures.  There is normal preservation of [**Doctor Last Name 107**]-white matter
 differentiation.  The sulci and ventricles are normal in size and
 configuration.

 Extra-axial fluid matching the density of cerebral spinal fluid is seen in the
 posterior fossa central and posterior to the cerebellar hemispheres indenting
 the vermis.  This appearance is likely due to evolution of  subdural hematoma
 into chronic stage; as there is no normal baseline study for comparison, there
 may be a component of [**Last Name (un) 1452**] cisterna magna also.
 The visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.
 Previously noted fractures are not well assessed on the present study due to
 lack of dedicated bone alg. images.

 IMPRESSION:  Small extra-axial clear fluid-containing space in the posterior
 fossa, likely evolving  subdural hematoma into chronic stage and superimposed
 possible [**Last Name (un) 1452**] cisterna magna. No acute findings.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2187-3-5**] - Thoracic aorta stent graft coverage of penetrating
descending thoracic aortic ulcer witha [**Doctor Last Name **] TAG endoprosthesis


History of Present Illness:
Patient is a 72-year-old gentleman who is admitted with
symptomatic penetrating
descending thoracic aortic ulcer. The patient remained
symptomatic from pain standpoint despite adequate medical
management with some radiographic evidence of progression of the
internal hematoma. The patient was therefore felt to be a
good candidate for stent graft placement to cover the
penetrating ulcer. The penetrating ulcer appeared to be at the
T9-T10 level by CT scan. The patient understood the risks and
benefits of the procedure and wished to proceed.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 66702**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2187-3-2**] for further
work-up of his epigastric pain. A CT Angiogram was performed
which revealed a tiny penetrating ulcer-like projection in the
distal descending thoracic aorta, with adjacent crescentic
hematoma, which appeared contained within the aortic wall
without evidence of active extravasation. Given these findings,
the vascular and cardiac surgical services were consulted for
surgical management. Mr. [**Known lastname 66702**] was worked-up in the usual
preoperative manner. He remained on nitroglycerin for blood
pressure control. On [**2187-3-5**], Mr. [**Known lastname 66702**] was taken to the
operating room where he underwent an endovascular stent
placement. Postoperatively he was taken to the cardiac surgical
intensive care unit for monitoring. By postoperative day one,
Mr. [**Known lastname 66702**] [**Last Name (Titles) 5058**] neurologically intact and was extubated. His
lumbar drain was removed on postoperative day two and he was
then transferred to the step down unit for further recovery. The
physical therapy service was consulted for assistance with his
postoperative strength and mobility. He continued to make steady
progress and was discharged home on postoperative day three. Mr.
[**Known lastname 66702**] will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 914**], Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and
his primary care provider as an outpatient.

Final Report
INDICATION: 72-year-old man with endovascular stent placement 2
months ago
inside old vascular stent placed on [**4-24**], presenting with left
upper quadrant
pain, with possible endovascular leak.

COMPARISON: [**2187-4-3**].

TECHNIQUE: MDCT acquired images were obtained through the torso
before and
then immediately after the uneventful administration of 80 cc of
IV Optiray
contrast. Multiplanar reformats were reviewed.

CTA CHEST: The patient is post endograft stent in the descending

thoracic aorta with marked soft tissue thickening around the
graft measuring
17 mm (previously 8 mm). Focal areas of air within the soft
tissue, are
highly concerning for infection. There is no evidence of
contrast
extravasation or ruptured atherosclerotic plaque. The lung
parenchyma is
grossly unremarkable. The airways are patent to the subsegmental
level. There
are no pathologically enlarged central or axillary lymph nodes.

CT ABDOMEN: The liver, spleen, pancreas, gallbladder, and
adrenals are
grossly unremarkable. The kidneys demonstrate several
subcentimeter cysts
bilaterally which are stable since [**2187-4-3**]. The intra-abdominal
loops of
large and small bowel are unremarkable. There is no free fluid
or free air.

CT PELVIS: The bladder is mildly enlarged. The prostate is
markedly enlarged
measuring 5.6 x 6.5 cm, unchanged. Seroma in the right inguinal
region has
resolved.

Bone windows demonstrate stable degenerative changes in the
lower lumbar spine
without evidence of suspicious lytic or blastic lesion.

IMPRESSION:
1. 8 weeks post-op from repeat thoracic aortic stent graft with
increase in
the peri- aortic soft tissue rind and perigraft pockets of air
suggestive of
infection. Close follow-up is recomended.
2. Markedly enlarged prostate, unchanged.


The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

LEFT ATRIUM: Normal LA size.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size and
regional/global systolic function (LVEF >55%). No resting LVOT
gradient. No VSD.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Mildly dilated
ascending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS.
No masses or vegetations on aortic valve, but cannot be fully
excluded due to suboptimal image quality. Trace AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MVP.
Mild mitral annular calcification. Calcified tips of papillary
muscles. Mild (1+) MR. Normal LV inflow pattern for age.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial
TR. Borderline PA systolic hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not visualized.
No PS. Physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.
Conclusions
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall
thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are
normal (LVEF >55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No
masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot
be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is borderline pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets without
obvious vegetation. Trace aortic regurgitation. Mild mitral
regurgitation. Preserved regional and global LV systolic
function.

If clinically suggested, the absence of a vegetation by 2D
echocardiography does not exclude endocarditis.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2187-4-11**],
the findings are similar. The prior echo measured the ascending
aorta as 4.5cm but this was likely an OVERestimation.

on [**2189-7-6**]
[**7-5**] No acute events, NPO for bronchoscopy in am.
[**7-6**]  EGD/Bronch to evaluate for fistula - no fistula, polyp in
esophagus
[**7-6**] Echo nl LV Fnx EFx >55%, thickened Ao leaflets, trace AR,
mild MR, mildly dilated Asc Ao, borderline pulm art htn.

[**2189-7-6**]   STRESS study- No anginal symptoms or ischemic ST
changes.

[**7-6**] MIBI  Normal mycocardial perfusion study; LVEF 69%.
[**7-6**] EGD/Bronch:  poylp in esophagus, no fistula, mild LLL infl

[**7-7**]:  MRI T-L spine:  Degenerative changes in the lumbar region
with mild-to-moderate spinal stenosis at L2-33 and mild spinal
stenosis at L3-4 and L4-5 levels due to disc degenerative
changes. No evidence of discitis or osteomyelitis. Other
changes as described above.

[**7-9**]:  OR for Replacement of the descending thoracic aortic
stent
with a 24-mm Vascutek Dacron tube graft using deep hypothermic
circulatory arrest; repair of aortoesophageal fistula as well as
aortolung fistula replacement stent, placement intraoperative
pacers, went to ICU with 3 CT, J tube, intbuated, started on
epicardial pacing (intraop) for complete heart block; started on
caspofungin, doxy, gent, vanco, zosyn

[**2104-7-8**]:  In CV ICU, on epi, neo, intubated, started on nitro
for ST depression
[**7-12**]:  In CVICU extubated, off pressors, started on tube feeds
[**7-14**]:  remains in heart block, EP consult -> for temp pacer
Next several days observed for rhythm recovery, possible PPM.
EP,ID, and thoracic continues to follow. Tube feeds at goal.
[**7-15**]: CT placed to Water seal, NTG drip weaned to off with ACE-I
initiated. Some confusion persists; narcotics minimized with
Methadone adjustments.
[**7-16**]:  PICC inserted, EP recommends temporary pacer- family
refused
[**7-17**]: transferred to floor, salt tabs for hyponatremia, which
would eventually resolve.
The pt was found to have a chylothorax, and tube feeds were
adjusted accordingly.
Temporary pacer was implanted on [**7-21**] with the plan to convert to
permanent pacer in [**12-21**] weeks.  Remaining chest tubes were
discontinued without complication.
The patient made progress with physical therapy and was
ambulating with minimal assistance before discharge.  The
patient was discharged to rehab on POD 18 with plans to follow
up with cardiology for an internal pacer, and with thoracics for
a barium swallow study, and infectious disease for further
anti-microbial management.

                                 FINAL REPORT


 INDICATION:  Status post thoracic aortic stent placement, readmitted with
 fever.

 COMPARISONS:  CTA chest of [**2187-3-2**].
 TECHNIQUE:  Axial MDCT images of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis with 150 cc of
 non-ionic Optiray contrast per CTA protocol with coronal and sagittal
 reformations.

 CTA CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  Patient is status post metallic stent placement
 in the descending thoracic aorta adjacent to the region of small aortic
 ulceration and intramural hematoma.  The stent appears intact and in good
 position.  Posterior wall of the native aorta remains thickened; however, is
 unchanged from the prior CT.  There is no evidence of air or other specific CT
 evidence to suggest abscess or peristent infection.  The remainder of the
 thoracic aorta is unremarkable.  Pulmonary arteries enhance normally.  The
 heart, pericardium, and great vessels are normal in appearance.  The lungs are
 clear.  Motion artifact limits assessment of the lung bases.

 CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  The abdominal aorta enhances normally without
 evidence of dissection, ulceration, or aneurysmal dilatation.  Severe motion
 artifact limits assessment of the abdomen and pelvis.  Allowing for this
 limitation, the liver, spleen, gallbladder, kidneys, adrenal glands, pancreas,
 and intra-abdominal bowel appear grossly normal with the exception of a
 simple-appearing left renal cyst.

 CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  The intrapelvic aorta and iliac branches opacify
 normally without evidence of dissection, ulceration, or aneurysmal dilatation.
 In the most inferior images, there is thickening of the lateral wall, with a
 markedly enlarged prostate impressing on the base of the bladder.  Given the
 single phase, it is difficult to exclude filling defect at the base of the
 bladder and ultrasound is recommended if clinically warranted.

 BONE WINDOWS:  Mild degenerative changes throughout the axial spine without
 suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.  There are severe degenerative and
 osteophytic changes involving the vertebral bodies of the lower thoracic
 level, adjacent to the lower portion of the stent; however, compared to the
 prior study, there is no evidence of interval bone destruction to suggest

 3) Motion artifact limits assessment of the abdomen and pelvis; however,
 allowing for this, no source of the patient's fever is identified.
 4) Likely simple left renal cyst, too small to characterize.
 5) Enlarged prostate impressing upon the base of the bladder, incompletely

 INDICATION:  72-year-old male with known atherosclerotic ulcer and possible
 periaortic hematoma, now with recurrence of substernal back pain.  Evaluate
 descending thoracic aorta for an atherosclerotic ulcer/hematoma.

 No comparison studies.

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT acquired axial images of the chest were obtained without IV
 contrast.  Chest, abdomen and pelvis images were then performed with IV
 contrast.  Multiplanar and thin-slice reformations were obtained according to
 the Aorta CTA protocol.

 CT CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST:  Lung windows demonstrate dependent
 atelectatic changes.  Soft tissue windows demonstrate a few nonpathologically
 enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes.  No pathological enlarged lymph nodes within
 the axilla and hila.  The proximal pulmonary arterial vasculature demonstrates
 no filling defects.  Examination not optimal for pulmonary emboli evaluation.
 No evidence of pericardial effusions. Small left pleural effusion.

 CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  The liver, pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands are
 within normal limits.  The gallbladder is difficult to visualize. There are
 multiple low-attenuation lesions within the left kidney, one within the middle
 pole, likely representing simple renal cyst, the others are too small to
 characterize.  Small bowel and large bowel are unremarkable.  No
 pathologically enlarged nodes within the retroperitoneum or mesentery.

 CTA AORTA:  As was previously described on outside CT report, there is focal
 soft tissue thickening immediately adjacent to and/or within the
 posterolateral wall of the distal descending thoracic aorta.  The overall
 outer axial diameters at this level are 3.5 cm x 3.4 cm. The aortic lumen
 measures 2.5 cm, with the thickness of this soft tissue crescentic area
 measuring 10 mm. It extends over about a 4 cm sagittal length. Protruding from
 the lumen into this soft tissue, there is a tiny approximately 3 mm
 penetrating ulcer / beak- like projection of contrast that has been described
 on outside reports. There is no definite evidence of active extravasation.

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT axial images of the chest, abdomen and pelvis were obtained
 after the administration of IV Optiray contrast.  Delayed scans as well as
 multiplanar reformatted images were performed.  Prior to administration of IV
 Optiray contrast, a non-contrast chest CT scan was performed.

 CT CHEST WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST:  Patient is status post metallic stent
 in the descending thoracic aorta.  The posterior wall of the native aorta
 remains thickened, compatible with the excluded ulceration sac/wall
 components, and has not changed in size compared to the prior CT examination.
 There is no evidence of air to suggest abscess. The remainder of the thoracic
 aorta is unremarkable. There is bibasilar atelectasis.  No pathologically
 enlarged mediastinal or hilar lymph nodes.

 CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  The liver, gallbladder, right kidney, spleen,
 pancreas, and adrenal glands are within normal limits. Left kidney
 hypodensities likely represent cysts but cannot be further characterized.
 There are no pathologically enlarged mesenteric or inguinal lymph nodes.  No
 free fluid or free air in the abdomen.

 The intra-abdominal portions of the aorta as well as major branches are
 unremarkable.

 CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  The rectum, sigmoid colon, and bladder are
 unremarkable.  The prostate is markedly enlarged.  There is a 3.8 x 2.5 cm
 fluid collection in the right inguinal region possibly representing a seroma.

 INDICATION:  72-year-old man, rule out brucellosis of spine.

 COMPARISON:  MR thoracic spine [**2187-4-8**].

 TECHNIQUE:  T1- and T2-weighted axial and sagittal scans were performed of the
 thoracic spine.  Axial images were obtained from the T5-T6 interspaces through
 the T9-T10 interspaces.  Post-gadolinium images imaging was performed.

 FINDINGS:

 As described on prior study at the level of T4-T5.  There is ligamentous
 hypertrophy pushing against the thecal sac with no evidence of compression.
 As previously described at the level of T9-T10, there is increase signal seen
 on T2-weighted and STIR imaging.  There is no evidence of disc enhancement in
 this region or elsewhere in the thoracic spine upon gadolinium administration.
 There is a very mild enhancement of the anterior portion of the T10 vertebral
 body and anterior osteophyte is again noted at the level of T9-T10.  No
 evidence of enhancing discs seen at this level or elsewhere within the
 thoracic vertebrae.  No evidence of leptomeningeal enhancement.  No evidence
 of paraspinal masses or paraspinal soft tissue enhancement.  No significant
 neural foramen narrowing throughout the thoracic vertebrae.

 IMPRESSION:

 1.  No evidence of leptomeningeal enhancement.

 2.  No evidence of paraspinal masses or paraspinal enhancement.

 3.  Very mild enhancement of T10 vertebral body with no adjacent disc
 enhancement.  Baseline increased signal is seen at this level and the level of
 T9 on T2-weighted and STIR images.  These findings are nonspecific and could
 represent degenerative change, infection, or even trauma.

 INDICATION:  72-year-old man status post aortic stent with fever and back
 pain.  Rule out abscess.

 TECHNIQUE:  Axial and sagittal T1- and T2-weighted imaging was performed of
 the cervical and thoracic spine.  Gadolinium-enhanced images were obtained.

 FINDINGS:  Sagittal images of the cervical spine demonstrate a small disc
 bulge with extrusion superiorly at the level of C4-C5 that is abutting upon
 the thecal sac and spinal cord.  An additional disc bulge is seen at the level
 of C5-C6 with a lesser degree of thecal sac and spinal cord abutment.  Axial
 views of the cervical spine were not performed.

 Within the thoracic spine at the level of T4, extensive left ligamentous
 hypertrophy is pushing upon the thecal sac and spinal cord with no evidence of
 compression.  At the level of T6, there is a hyperdense focus within the T6
 vertebral body on T1-weighted images, likely representing benign degenerative
 change.  At the level of T9-T10, there is moderate anterior osteophyte
 formation with mild hyperintensity seen on noncontrast-enhanced T2-weighted
 images and STIR images.  There is very mild enhancement post-gadolinium
 administration within the T10 vertebral body.  Within this region, there is no
 evidence of disc enhancement.  There is no evidence of cord or thecal sac
 enhancement.

 No significant neural foramen narrowing or cord compression is identified
 throughout the visualized cervical and thoracic spine.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Mild disc bulge with extrusion superiorly at the level of C4-C5 and to a
 lesser degree at C5-C6, abutting the thecal sac with no evidence of
 compression.
 2.  High signal within T9 and T10 vertebral bodies on T2 and STIR images with
 very slight enhancement of T9 vertebral body.  No enhancing discs or thecal
 sac.  These findings are fairly nonspecific as they could be from degenerative
 changes, infection or trauma.
 3.  No evidence of leptomeningeal enhancement.
 4.  No evidence of enhancing paraspinal soft tissues/masses.

                                 FINAL REPORT  (REVISED)
 INDICATION:  Rule out abscess.

 No comparison studies.

 TECHNIQUE:  Sagittal T1 and T2-weighted lumbar spine images were obtained with
 axial T1 and T2-weighted scan of the L2-3 through L5-S1 interspaces.

 FINDINGS:  There is a small, focal central disc protrusion seen at the level
 of L2/3 with mild superior extrusion.  There is mild-to-moderate compression
 of the thecal sac.

 Multilevel degenerative changes are present, the most prominent are seen at
 the endplates of the L3/4 interspace and L4/5 interspaces.  Mild disc bulges
 are seen at the L2/3-L4/5 levels. These bulging discs cause mild bilateral
 L2/3 and moderate bilateral L3/4 and L4/5 neural foraminal narrowing. At
 L5/S1, facet joint degeneration causes moderate bilateral foraminal narrowing.
 All lumbar discs are moderately desiccated.

 No evidence of abnormal enhancement is seen and there is no evidence for
 abscess.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No evidence of abscess.
 2.  Focal disc protrusion at the level of L2/3 with superior extrusion and
 mild thecal sac compression.
 3.  Multilevel degenerative change, predominantly at L3/4 and L4/5
 interspaces.

 See above report for additional findings.

 CT ANGIOGRAM OF THORAX, ABDOMEN AND PELVIS (CT ANGIOGRAM PROTOCOL)

 TECHNIQUE:  Arterial and delayed post-contrast CT of the abdomen and pelvis.

 RECONSTRUCTIONS:  Multiplanar reformations in the sagittal and coronal plane,
 volume rendered and MIP images are also included.

 CLINICAL DETAILS:  Followup post-endostent repair of intramural thoracic
 aortic hematoma.

 Comparison made to previous imaging.

 FINDINGS:

 Ascending arch and descending thoracic aorta are normal in caliber.  Interval
 placement of a 10cm descending thoracic aortic arch endoluminal stent
 extending from just inferior to the arch to the distal descending thoracic
 aorta.  A thin crescentic area of thickening along the posterior and
 posterolateral descending thoracic aorta measuring up to 1 cm is located at
 the most inferior extent of the endoluminal thoracic aortic graft (series 3,
 image 70).  This is at the site of small prior intramural ulceration, no
 evidence of residual ulceration at that point.
 Just below the inferior most extent of the stent graft, there is a small (7 mm
 x 4 mm) area of ulceration into the posterior descending thoracic aortic wall
 (series 3, image 80) without associated mural thickening. The descending
 thoracic aorta at that level is normal in caliber at 2.5 cm.

 The abdominal aorta is normal in caliber measuring 2 cm just below the origin
 of the renal arteries.  The celiac, superior mesenteric, inferior mesenteric,
 and renal arteries are widely patent and normal in caliber.  There are two
 left renal arteries which share a common ostial origin.  Mild atheromatous
 calcification in the abdominal aorta, both common, internal, and external
 iliac arteries are widely patent and normal in caliber.

 CT SCAN OF THORAX:

 Lungs clear.  No mass lesion or mediastinal lymphadenopathy.  Tiny 3-mm
 granuloma in the right middle lobe anteriorly (series 3, image 47).  Normal
 heart size and normal-caliber central pulmonary arterial vasculature.

 CT SCAN OF ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:

 The liver, spleen, pancreas, gallbladder, both adrenal glands are normal in
 size.  No concerning lesions. Several subcentimeter cysts noted bilaterally.

 (Cont)
 CT SCAN OF PELVIS (WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST):

 Marked enlargement of the prostate gland which measures up to 6.7 cm AP x 6 cm
 transverse. Mild concentric thickening of the moderately distended bladder. No
 hydronephrosis or hydroureter.

 No concerning bone lesions demonstrated on bone window setting.

 RECONSTRUCTIONS:  Multiplanar reformations in the sagittal and coronal plane,
 volume rendered and MIP images of the arterial anatomy are also included.

 CONCLUSION:

 1.  Minor (subcentimeter) residual posterior mural thickening at the site of
 prior intramural ulceration in the descending thoracic aorta. No residual
 ulceration at that point, the inferior extent of the endostent extends to that
 level.

 2. A tiny (7 mm x 5 mm) area of ulceration along the posterior descending
 thoracic aorta inferior to the stent without any acute complication or wall
 thickening.

 2.  Markedly enlarged prostate gland.

 Portable semi-upright chest with indication of pneumothorax.

 Left-sided chest tubes remain in place.  A tiny left apical pneumothorax has
 decreased in size, in retrospect since recent study.  Cardiomediastinal
 contours appear less widened, and there has been slight improvement in the
 degree of fluid overload.  Retrocardiac opacification and bilateral pleural
 effusions are probably unchanged, but exclusion of left costophrenic sulcus
 from the radiograph limits full assessment of the left pleural effusion.

 especially in the retrocardiac region with blunting of the costophrenic angle.
 There may well be a tiny residual left pneumothorax.  Central catheter and
 pacer lead remain in place.  The right lung is clear.

 EXAM:  MRI of the thoracic and lumbar spine.

 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Patient with descending thoracic aortic graft with
 infection.  For further evaluation to exclude spinal involvement.

 THORACIC SPINE:

 TECHNIQUE:  T1, T2, and inversion recovery sagittal, and T2 axial images
 obtained before gadolinium.  T1 sagittal and axial images obtained following
 gadolinium.

 Correlation was made with the previous abdominal CT.  Correlation was also
 made with the previous thoracic spine MRI of [**2187-4-13**].

 FINDINGS:  As seen on the CT examination of [**2189-7-3**], there is postoperative
 change seen in the descending aorta.  At the level of T8-T10 vertebra, there
 is focal dilatation of the aorta.  Soft tissue changes are seen surrounding
 the aorta, T8-T10 level.  The T10 vertebral body demonstrates increased signal
 on the left side on inversion recovery images with decreased signal on T1-
 weighted images.  This is adjacent to the focal dilatation of the aorta.
 Following gadolinium, subtle enhancement is seen in this region.  These
 findings are indicative of periaortic inflammation with pressure erosion or
 early osteomyelitis of the T10 vertebral body.  There is no epidural abscess
 identified.  At T4-T5 level, there is hypertrophic change seen in the facet
 joint on the left side with indentation on the left side of the spinal cord.
 This appears degenerative in nature.  Mild multilevel degenerative changes are
 seen in the thoracic vertebral bodies.  There is no intrinsic signal
 abnormality within the spinal cord.  No abnormal intraspinal enhancement is
 seen.

 IMPRESSION:  1. Findings indicative of periaortic inflammation in the lower
 thoracic region with abnormal signal in T10 vertebral predominantly on the

 left side.  The signal abnormality and subtle enhancement in the T10 vertebra
 could be due to pressure erosion with reactive marrow edema or due to early
 osteomyelitis.  2. No epidural abscess seen or intraspinal extension
 identified. No evidence of discitis noted.  3. Degenerative changes are seen
 predominantly in the upper thoracic region at T4-T5 level with facet
 hypertrophic change indenting the left side of the spinal cord.  No intrinsic
 spinal cord signal abnormalities.

 LUMBAR SPINE:

 TECHNIQUE:  T1, T2, and inversion recovery sagittal images were obtained
 before gadolinium.  T1 sagittal and axial images were obtained following
 gadolinium.

 FINDINGS:  At L1-2, disc degenerative changes are identified.  At L2-3, there
 is disc bulging and a central disc protrusion resulting in mild-to-moderate
 spinal stenosis.

 At L3-4, disc bulging and facet degenerative changes are identified with mild
 spinal stenosis.  There is mild bilateral foraminal narrowing seen.

 At L4-5, there is disc bulging identified.  There is mild spinal stenosis seen
 with mild narrowing of the left and moderate narrowing of the right foramen.

 At L5-S1 level, degenerative disc disease and mild bulging identified.

 Simple-appearing cysts are seen in both kidneys.  Following gadolinium, no
 abnormal intraspinal enhancement seen.  There is no paraspinal soft tissue
 abnormality or abscess identified.

 IMPRESSION:  Degenerative changes in the lumbar region with mild-to-moderate
 spinal stenosis at L2-33 and mild spinal stenosis at L3-4 and L4-5 levels due
 to disc degenerative changes.  No evidence of discitis or osteomyelitis. Other
 changes as described above.

    28.3 mCi Tc-99m Tetrofosmin Stress ([**2189-7-6**]);
 HISTORY: Chest pain.

 SUMMARY FROM THE EXERCISE LAB:
 Dipyridamole was infused intravenously for 4 minutes at a dose of 0.142
 mg/kg/min.
 No chest pain or EKG changes suring infusion.

 IMAGING METHOD:
 Resting perfusion images were obtained with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m tetrofosmin. Tracer was
 injected approximately 30 minutes prior to obtaining the resting images.
 Following resting images and two minutes following intravenous dipyridamole,
 approximately three times the resting dose of Tc-99m tetrofosmin was
 administered intravenously. Stress images were obtained approximately 30 minutes
 following tracer injection.
 Imaging protocol: Gated SPECT.
 This study was interpreted using the 17-segment myocardial perfusion model.

 INTERPRETATION:
 Left ventricular cavity size is normal.
 Rest and stress perfusion images reveal uniform tracer uptake throughout the
 left ventricular myocardium.

 Gated images reveal normal wall motion.
 The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 69%.

 IMPRESSION:   Normal mycocardial perfusion study; LVEF 69%.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST [**2189-8-18**].

 COMPARISON:  [**2189-7-27**].

 INDICATION:  Pacemaker placement and PICC placement.

 Permanent pacemaker is present in the right chest wall, with a single lead
 terminating in the expected location of the right ventricle.  The appearance
 of the lead near the generator pack is different than on the prior study, with
 a longer looping course of the wire near the generator compared to the prior
 exam.  As discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 38311**], the patient is scheduled to have this
 removed.  Left PICC terminates in the proximal superior vena cava.
 Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.  Improving left lower lobe
 atelectasis and small effusion but persistent elevation of left hemidiaphragm.
 Right lung grossly clear, but costophrenic sulcus excluded from the study and
 cannot be assessed.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 56811**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2122-7-14**] for emergent
surgical management of her type A dissection. She was taken to
the operating room where she underwent replacement of her
ascending aorta and hemiarch using a 38mm gelweave graft.
Postoperatively she was taken to the cardiac surgical intensive
care unit for monitoring. She received multiple blood products.
Her sedation was weaned to off but she remained unresponsive to
pain without pupillary reflex, head CT showed Subacute
infarction involving the cerebellum, frontal, parietal, and
occipital lobes bilaterally as well as chronic infarction in the
right temporal lobe. She began having seizures and was loaded
with and started on dilantin. She was followed closely by
neurology. Dobhoff tube was placed and she was started on tube
feeds.
She remained unresponsive. Repeat head ct showed Multiple
bilateral hypodensities consistent with evolving subacute
infarction. She was started on cipro and zosyn for gram negative
bacteria in sputum and UTI. General surgery consulted to plan
for trach/PEG placement. Her neuro exam improved very slightly
and she opened her eyes to noxious stim. Repeat EEG showed mild
to moderate encephalopathy but no evidence of seizures.
Neurological prognosis remained poor. Tracheostomy and PEG tube
were placed on [**7-27**]. Dilantin level should be maintained at
15-20. Tube feeds were restarted, and she tolerated 8 hours of
trach collar. PICC line became totally occluded seconadry to IV
dilantin and her dilantin was changed to PO. BUE U/S for edema
showed right axillary DVT but none on left. PICC line was
changed to a single lumen. She was raedy for discharge to rehab
on [**7-29**].

 The ET tube tip is about 6 cm above the carina.  The NG tube
 intrathoracic portion  is displaced to the left from its expected location,
 most likely in the stomach , due to leftward mediastinal shift and left lower
 lobe atelectasis. Mediastinal widening especially in its upper portion is
 demonstrated, most likely related to the recent surgery.  The Swan- Ganz
 catheter tip is at the level of right ventricle outflow tract.  Left and right
 chest tubes are in expected location.  The lungs are clear.  There is a small
 amount of bilateral pleural effusion but no evidence of pneumothorax.

  infarcts of R cerebellum, b/l occital, frontal, and parietal lobes likely

 ______________________________________________________________________________
                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  77-year-old female status post aortic repair.  Please evaluate for
 hemorrhage.

 COMPARISON:  None available.

 TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images were obtained through the brain without
 contrast.  Subsequently, rapid axial imaging was performed from the aortic
 arch through the brain during infusion of Omnipaque IV contrast.  Images were
 processed on a separate workstation with display of curved reformats, volume
 rendered images, maximum intensity projection images.

 HEAD CT WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  The right temporal lobe demonstrates a well-
 defined focus of hypoattenuation indicative of encephalomalacia, likely from
 prior infarction (2:16).  Additional less well-defined hypodensities in the
 frontal lobes, the parietal lobes, occipital lobes, and the cerebellum
 bilaterally are consistent with edema due to subacute infarction.
 Periventricular hypoattenuation is consistent with chronic small vessel
 ischemic disease.  The visualized paranasal sinuses are clear.  The mastoid
 air cells are clear. There is no fracture.  The patient is intubated.

 HEAD AND NECK CTA:  There is severe atheromatous disease involving the aorta
 and the common carotid arteries bilaterally.  The left subclavian demonstrates
 a long segment of severe atherosclerotic change.  There is an approximately
 33% stenosis of the proximal right ICA at the right carotid bifurcation. There
 is a 1.2-cm segment of the distal cervical left internal carotid artery which
 demonstrates a fenestration or possible dissection (3:187).  The left
 vertebral artery demonstrates an approximately 65% stenosis at its origin
 ([**Numeric Identifier 28951**]:25, 695).  The major intracranial vessels are patent, with no evidence
 of aneurysm formation.

 There is a 3.4 x 3.1 cm hypoattenuating left thyroid nodule (3:72).  There is
 a large left pleural effusion.

 PICC LINE PLACEMENT, [**2122-7-29**].

 INDICATION: 77 year-old female with clotted left PICC.

 RADIOLOGIST: Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 5473**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5549**] performed the procedure.  The
 Attending Radiologist, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 5473**], was present and supervising throughout.

 TECHNIQUE: Using sterile technique and local anesthesia, a 0.018 guidewire was
 advanced through the indwelling left arm double lumen PICC line. The wire
 could not be advanced through the catheter due to blockage at its mid portion
 and a 0.018 glidewire was also ineffective at traversing the obstructed
 portion through either lumen. Therefore, a close-fitting 4 Fr peel- away
 sheath was then advanced over the old PICC to secure access. The old PICC line
 and the wire were then removed. A single lumen catheter measuring 55 cm in
 length with 51.5 cm inside of the patient was then placed through the peel-
 away sheath with its tip positioned at the brachiocephalic junction under
 fluoroscopic guidance. (Tip postion was pulled back from SVC as catheter tip
 preferentially abutted right lateral wall of SVC) Position of the catheter was
 confirmed by a fluoroscopic spot film of the chest. The peel- away sheath and
 guidewire were then removed. The catheter was secured to the skin, flushed,
 and a sterile dressing applied. The sleeping patient tolerated the procedure
 well. There were no immediate complications.

 IMPRESSION:: Uncomplicated fluoroscopically guided left single lumen PICC line
 exchange. Final internal length is 51.5 cm (3.5 cm outside of the patient)
 with the tip positioned at the brachiocephalic junction. The line is ready to
 use

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 78957**] is a 53 yo Male readmitted to Nsurg on [**2181-11-18**] with
CSF rhinorrhea. He had underwent a right craniotomy for mass
resection on [**2181-10-5**]. The pathology was Metastatic
adenocarcinoma. He was readmitted for CSF leak from [**2181-11-7**]
         to [**2181-11-16**] and had a lumbar drain from [**2181-11-9**] to
[**2181-11-16**]. He had a recurrance of CSF rhinorrhea and was admitted
on [**2181-11-18**].

Upon admission he also reported left calf tenderness with a
positive [**Doctor Last Name **] sign. Lower extremity doppler study was
negative on [**11-18**]. Repeat studies showed LLE thrombosis
involving superficial calf veins. He was kept on bedrest until
being taken to surgery on [**2181-11-21**] for a right craniotomy for
dural repair and lumbar drain placement with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. He was
extubated and transfered to the SICU after the procedure. The
lumbar drain parameters were 15cc/CSF as goal.

Post-op CT imaging showed mild pneumocephalus and post-surgical
changes.  He was trasnfered to the [**Hospital Ward Name **] 11 floor. On [**11-22**] his
HOB was at 25 degress max and he had no sign of CSF leak. On
[**11-23**] he had a temp of 102. Fever work up was initiated which
included CSF sample from lumbar drain. He became disoriented and
agitated later that day. His CSF studies showed WBC 380.
Peripheral WBC was 19.

He was transfered to the SICU. ID was consulted and Vancomycin
and Cefipime were ordered. They recommended that the LD be
removed. The tip was sent for culture which had no growth. The
patient improved clincally within 24 hours and had a normal
neurological exam. He was transferred to surgical floor 48 hours
later and remained afebrile. ID recommended 14 days of IV
antibiotics and one week further treatment for C-Diff. He had no
headache or rhinorrhea. PT recommended he be discharged home
with with home PT on [**11-28**].

herniation. Small amount of subfalcine herniation.



Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted with 2-3 weeks of R sided HA, was sent in
with CT scan of head showing new R temporal mass with mass
effect and midline shift.  The patient was started on decadron
and morphine.  Patient was loaded with dilantin and admitted to
ICU.  f/u MRI revealed a new large right anterior temporal
intra-axial mass, 3 mm left parietal  focus of enhancement and a
questionable third focus areas of enhancement  within the left
parietal peripheral region strongly concerning for metastatic
disease.  On [**10-5**] the patient had R sided crainiotomy for
resection of the mass.  The patient had a unremarkable post op
course with the f/u MRI showing no residual tumor, with residual
edema.  The resected mass was sent for pathology and the patient
will follow up in Brain [**Hospital 341**] Clinic.

 INDICATION:  53-year-old male with a history of right craniotomy for tumor
 resection, with history of CSF rhinorrhea.  CT requested to evaluate for
 changes.

 TECHNIQUE:  CT of the head without IV contrast.

 COMPARISON:  CT of the head available from [**2181-11-12**], and [**2181-11-7**].

 FINDINGS:
 The patient is status post right craniotomy and resection of known right
 temporal mass.  There is tissue loss and edema at the resection site,
 unchanged in appearance in comparison with the prior [**2181-11-12**] study.
 There is opacification and air seen within the right frontal sinus, which is
 enlarged.  These findings are stable in comparison to the prior CT

 HISTORY:  A 53-year-old male after a brain metastasis resection with a
 question of CSF rhinorrhea.  According to the medical record, the patient has
 increasing nasal discharge and postnasal drip for one week.

 TECHNIQUE:  Noncontrast head CT was performed.  Sagittal and coronal
 reformatted images of the temporal bones were generated.

 FINDINGS:  The patient is post-right temporal mass resection.  In comparison
 to the most recent prior studies, there is no longer shift of midline
 structures.  The edema has essentially resolved.  There is no hydrocephalus or
 intracranial hemorrhage.

 The right posterior ethmoid air cells are partially opacified.  The right
 external and middle ear canals are patent.  There is focal opacification
 laterally and dependently of the right frontal sinus in the area of the
 craniotomy.  There is mucoscal thickening of bilateral anterior ethmoid air
 cells.

 The left maxillary sinus is nearly completely opacified, there is new, near
 complete opacification of the left mastoid air cells.  The left sphenoid,
 ethmoid, and frontal sinuses are well aerated.  There is partial opacification
 of bilateral anterior ethmoid air cells.  The left middle ear is opacified
 with soft tissue density.  The left external ear canal is patent.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Interval resolution of midline shift and edema in comparison to prior
 studies.

 2.  Partial opacification of right posterior mastoid air cells, new from prior
 studies.  The right middle ear canal is patent.

 3.  Near complete opacification of the left maxillary sinus, similar to the
 prior studies, with near complete opacification of the left mastoid air cells
 and new opacification of the left middle ear.

 NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: The frontal craniotomy extended through the
 right frontal sinus, involving the anterior and posterior walls. This portion
 of the sinus is opacified, and there is a small air bubble in the surgical
 defect in the anterior wall of the sinus. Overall, these findings suggest this
 is the source of the CSF leak. These findings were discussed with [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 3922**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 399**]

 hemorrhage.

 COMPARISON:  CT head without contrast on [**2181-11-18**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast MDCT images were acquired through the brain.

 FINDINGS:  In the right frontoparietal surgical site, there is a small amount
 of pneumocephalus along the right frontal convexity.  A small amount of soft
 tissue subcutaneous air and soft tissue swelling is also noted.  There is a
 sliver of hyperdensity tracking along the right frontoparietal convexity
 measuring less than 1 mm in thickness, likely represent post-surgical tiny
 subdural hematoma.  There is minimal effacement of adjacent sulci.  No other
 intracranial hemorrhage is noted.  There is no fluid collection to suggest CSF
 leakage.  The ventricles and sulci are otherwise normal in configuration and
 appearance.  There is no shift of normally midline structures.  The [**Doctor Last Name 107**]-white
 matter differentiation is well preserved.  Other than the right frontal and
 frontoparietal region craniotomy sites, there is no bony deformity.  Again
 noted is some fluid collection in the right lateral frontal sinus.  There is
 mild mucosal thickening in the left maxillary sinus and scattered
 opacification of the ethmoid air cells.

 MEDICAL HISTORY:  52-year-old man with lung cancer and brain metastasis status
 post craniotomy, now with large pulmonary embolism.  Request was made for an
 IVC filter placement.

 CLINICIANS:  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 9422**] [**Name (STitle) 90**] and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 411**] [**Name (STitle) 412**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 412**] is the
 attending radiologist who was present and supervising throughout.

 ANESTHESIA:  Moderate sedation was provided by administering divided doses of
 100 mcg of Fentanyl and 2 mg of Versed throughout the total intraservice time
 of 45 minutes during which the patient's hemodynamic parameters were
 continuously monitored.  Local anesthesia obtained with 1% lidocaine.

 PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  Informed consent was obtained after explaining the
 procedure, risks and benefits of the procedure.  The patient was brought to
 angiography suite and placed supine on the imaging table.  The right groin was
 prepped and draped in the standard sterile fashion.  A preprocedure huddle and
 time-out were performed as per [**Hospital1 184**] protocol.  Using fluoroscopic and
 ultrasound guidance and after injection of 8 cc of 1% lidocaine, a 19-gauge
 needle was used to puncture the right common femoral vein.  A 0.035 [**Last Name (un) 89**]
 wire was advanced through the needle into the inferior vena cava under
 fluoroscopic guidance.  The needle was then exchanged for a 5-French Omni
 flush catheter which was advanced over the guidewire.  The Omni flush catheter
 was redirected into the left common iliac vein over a 0.035 angled glidewire
 and the wire removed.  The catheter was connected to the power injector and a
 venogram obtained demonstrating a single patent inferior vena cava with no
 thrombus. The left renal vein was the lowest and its position was noted on the
 IVC gram with the help of a ruler.  Based on the diagnostic findings, it was
 decided to place an inferior vena cava filter in the infrarenal position.

 The [**Last Name (un) 89**] wire was replaced through the Omni flush catheter and the catheter
 removed.  Over the wire, the 5-French sheath from the Opt-Ease filter set was
 placed and advanced up to a level of left renal vein which is the lower most.
 The inner dilator was removed and an Opt-Ease filter was advanced through the

 Ease filter was deployed under fluoroscopic guidance.  Final fluoroscopic
 image was obtained and saved digitally demonstrating satisfactory position and
 placement of the filter.  The sheath was then removed and manual compression
 was held for 10 minutes and hemostasis was achieved.

 The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no immediate
 complications.

 IMPRESSION:  Successful placement of an inferior vena cava Opt-Ease filter in
 the infrarenal position.  The filter may be retrieved within 2 weeks of
 placement if clnically indicated.

 HISTORY:  53-year-old male patient with a large right temporal mass.

 TECHNIQUE:  MRI of the head was performed with and without IV contrast as per
 departmental protocol.

 COMPARISON:  [**2180-8-17**].

 FINDINGS:

 There has been interval development of a right anterior temporal lobe intra-
 axial heterogenously enhancing mass which demonstrates restricted diffusion.
 There is a large amount of surrounding T2/FLAIR hyperintensity extending
 superiorly to involve the frontal lobe, posteriorly to involve the parietal
 and temporal lobe and inferiorly to involve the right cerebral peduncle. There
 is midline shift of approximately 1.3 cm to the contralateral side. Minimal
 subfalcine herniation is demonstrated.  There is uncal herniation seen. There
 is mass effect on the midbrain.

 There is a questionable 3.8 and another 3.0-mm focus of enhancement within the
 left parietal [**Doctor Last Name 107**]-white matter junction seen best on the coronal views and to
 a lesser extent on the sagittal views which may represent other small areas of
 intraparenchymal enhancement versus a deep sulcal vessel.

 No other foci of abnormal enhancement are identified. There is no acute
 infarction. There is no evidence of hydrocephalus.  Mass effect is noted on
 the ipsilateral right lateral ventricle with no evidence for ventricular
 entrapment.  The orbital structures are unremarkable.  There is opacification
 in the left maxillary sinus. There is fluid within the left mastoid air
 cells.

 IMPRESSION:

 1.  New large right anterior temporal intra-axial mass, 3 mm left parietal
 focus of enhancement and a questionable third focus areas of enhancement
 within the left parietal peripheral region strongly concerning for metastatic
 disease.

 2.  Marked midline shift of 1.3 cm to the contralateral left side and uncal
 herniation.  Small amount of subfalcine herniation.

 HISTORY:  53-year-old man with 3 cm mass noted at outside hospital on CT scan.

 COMPARISON:  MRI of the brain dated [**2181-8-17**].

 FINDINGS:  A non-contrast CT of the head was obtained.  There is a hyperdense
 mass located in the right inferior temporal lobe measuring approximately 2.6
 cm and demonstrating central low density.  There is a significant amount of
 surrounding hypodensity likely representing vasogenic edema within the right
 frontal and temporal lobes.  There is mass effect with approximately 1.1 cm of
 right to left midline shift.  There is mild effacement of the right
 perimesencephalic cistern secondary to mass effect.  The suprasellar cistern
 is patent.  Also noted is mass effect on the right lateral ventricle which is
 almost completely compressed.  There is diffuse sulcal effacement noted
 throughout the right cerebral hemisphere.  The calvarium is intact.  There is
 near-complete opacification of the left maxillary sinus.

 IMPRESSION:

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Brain MRI.

 HISTORY:  54-year-old male presents with metastatic nonsmall cell lung cancer.

 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior brain MRIs [**2180-8-17**] through [**2182-3-4**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Sagittal T1, axial pre- and post-gadolinium T1, T2 FSE, T2 GRE,
 FLAIR, diffusion, sagittal post-gadolinium MP-RAGE with axial and coronal
 reformatted sequences of the brain were obtained.

 FINDINGS:  There are evolving post-surgical changes following prior right
 pterional craniotomy with resection of the large temporal mass.  The
 appearance of the residual encephalomalacia is unchanged with asymmetric
 dilatation of the right temporal [**Doctor Last Name 503**].  There is residual dural thickening and
 slight nodular enhancement along the posterior and inferior aspect of the
 resection cavity, also unchanged from the prior study (10:35).  Enhancement of
 the sphenoid triangle is stable.

 There is a 15-mm nodular mass within the right CP angle cistern which has a
 broad attachment to the tentorium and involves or compresses the enhancing
 right trigeminal nerve.  The mass appears to extend into the cavernous sinus,
 and/or Meckel's cave with equivocal extension into foramen ovale.

 There is no acute infarct.  There is a small residual fluid collection deep to
 the craniotomy flap.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Stable right temporal encephalomalacia, status post resection of the large
 mass with unchanged nodularity along the posterior and inferior aspect of the
 resection cavity.

 2.  More conspicuous on today's study is a right CP angle mass with a broad
 attachment to the tentorium.  The mass extends into the cavernous sinus and,
 given its rapid short interval enlargement, is concerning for a dural-based
 metastasis.  Meningioma is another possibility but would be unlikely to
 develop in this time frame.

 The findings were posted to the critical results dashboard.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  History of non-small cell lung cancer with brain
 metastases.

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was performed following the
 uneventful administration of nonionic intravenous contrast and oral contrast.
 Delayed images were obtained through the abdomen.

 Comparison exam is dated [**2181-10-4**].

 FINDINGS:

 CHEST:  There is a new soft tissue mass adjacent to the esophagus, measuring
 2.7 x 2.2 cm.  No other pathologically enlarged thoracic lymph nodes are
 identified.  There are coronary artery calcifications.  Otherwise, the heart
 and great vessels are unremarkable.  There is no pericardial or pleural
 effusion.

 Lung windows demonstrate post-surgical changes in the left lung, without
 nodule on the left.  Minimal atelectasis is noted at the right lung base.
 There is a vague 4 mm ground-glass nodule in the right upper lobe near the
 fissure seen on image 40 of series 2, and a punctate nodule is seen on image
 30 of series 2.  These are indeterminate, but may be infectious or
 inflammatory. The central airways are patent, without endobronchial lesions.

 ABDOMEN:  There are no focal liver lesions, and there is no biliary
 dilatation.  Again noted is a hypodensity within the upper pole of the right
 kidney, too small to characterize and parapelvic cysts in the left kidney. The
 kidneys are otherwise unremarkable.  The adrenal glands, spleen, and
 gallbladder are normal.  There is mild fatty replacement of the pancreas.
 There are no pathologically enlarged lymph nodes.  There is mild
 diverticulosis, without evidence of acute inflammation.  There is no free
 fluid or focal fluid collection.  An IVC filter is noted.

 PELVIS:  There is mild diverticulosis, without acute inflammation.  The
 bladder and prostate gland are unremarkable.  There is no pelvic adenopathy or
 free fluid.

 Bone windows demonstrate no focal suspicious lesions.

 MRI OF THE BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST DATED [**2182-1-7**]

 CLINICAL HISTORY:  54-year-old man with metastatic lung cancer to the brain,
 status post resection and radiation.

 TECHNIQUE:  MRI of the brain was performed both before and after the
 administration of intravenous contrast, as per the standard departmental
 protocol.  Additionally, tumor volumetric was also performed.

 COMPARISONS:  MRI of the brain dated [**2181-10-6**].

 FINDINGS:  Post-surgical changes are noted status post right temporal
 craniotomy, with a small fluid collection overlying the craniotomy site,
 measuring 3.0 x 0.7 cm.  Additionally, there is T1 hyperintensity within the
 right frontal sinus, consistent with the revision fat packing.  Since the
 prior study, there has been significant interval decrease in the degree of
 edema in the right hemisphere.  There is a small area of residual T2 and FLAIR
 hyperintensity in the right temporal lobe, measuring 6.5 cubic cm, which is
 significantly decreased since the prior examination.  There is a small single
 focal area of nodular enhancement along the periphery of the resection cavity.
 There is mild leptomeningeal enhancement overlying the resection cavity which
 is smooth in appearance, likely post-surgical in nature.

 Remainder of the brain parenchyma demonstrates stable appearance.  There is no
 midline shift, mass effect or evidence of a space-occupying lesion.  There is
 no new focus of abnormal enhancement.  The ventricles, sulci and cisterns
 remain mildly prominent, but unchanged.  There are scattered areas of T2 and
 FLAIR hyperintensity in the periventricular and subcortical white matter,
 stable since the prior study.  There is no decreased diffusion to indicate an
 acute infarct.  The flow voids of the major vessels are present.

 There is extensive fluid within the mastoid air cells bilaterally.  Mild
 mucosal thickening is noted in the visualized paranasal sinuses in addition to
 the hyperintensity related to the fat packing in the right frontal sinus.  The
 orbits and soft tissues are otherwise intact.

 IMPRESSION:  Post-surgical changes status post right temporal craniotomy and
 resection of a right temporal lobe mass as well as revision for a CSF leak
 with fat packing in the right frontal sinus.  A small focus of residual
 nodular enhancement in the resection bed may represent post-treatment related

                                 FINAL REPORT

 RADIOPHARMACEUTICAL DATA:
    21.3 mCi F-18 FDG ([**2182-2-13**]);
 INDICATION:  54 year-old male with a history of non-small cell lung cancer, now
 restaging.

 METHODS: Approximately 1 hour after intravenous administration of F-18
 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), noncontrast CT images were obtained for attenuation
 correction and for fusion with emission PET images.  The noncontrast CT images
 are not used to diagnose disease independently of the PET images.  A series of
 overlapping emission PET images was then obtained. The fasting blood glucose
 level, measured by glucometer before injection of FDG, was 96 mg/dL. The area
 imaged spanned the region from the top of the head to the thighs.

 Computed tomography (CT) images were co-registered and fused with emission PET
 images to assist with the anatomic localization of tracer uptake.  The
 determination of the site of tracer uptake seen on PET data can have important
 implications regarding the significance of that uptake.

 INTERPRETATION:
 Comparison is made to the CT Torso from [**2182-1-17**].

 HEAD AND NECK: There is no FDG-avid disease or significant lymphadenopathy in
 the imaged portions of the head and the neck.  There is evidence of a prior
 right-sided craniotomy with partial resection of the right temporal lobe.

 CHEST: There is a large area of FDG-avidity (18.9 SUV) corresponding to a
 subcarinal lymph node described on the previous study measuring 42 x 39 mm
 (image 96), much increased from previous study and concerning for a metastatic
 lesion. There is no axillary or hilar lymphadenopathy. There is no pleural or
 pericardial effusion.

 Additionally, the peri-fissural right upper lobe lung nodule described on
 previous study is unchanged in size and exhibits no FDG-avidity.  Additionally,
 in the right lower lung lobe, there is 12 x 5 mm subpleural nodule that appears
 unchanged from previous study and exhibits no FDG-avidity (image 107).

 ABDOMEN/PELVIS: Below the diaphragm, tracer is distributed physiologically in
 the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts. There is no significant
 lymphadenopathy and no FDG-avid disease.  An IVC filter is noted below the level
 of the renal vasculature.

 MUSCULOSKELETAL: There is no FDG-avid or destructive bone lesion.

 Physiologic uptake is seen in the brain, myocardium, salivary glands, GI and  GU
 tracts, liver and spleen.

 IMPRESSION: 1. 42 x 39 mm FDG-avid subcarinal lymph node, increased in size from

 CLINICAL HISTORY:  54-year-old male with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer
 to the brain, assess for progression.

 TECHNIQUE:  MRI of the brain was performed both before and after the
 administration of intravenous contrast, as per the standard departmental
 protocol.  Tumor volumetrics was also obtained.

 COMPARISONS:  MRI of the brain dated [**2182-1-7**] and [**2181-10-6**].

 FINDINGS:  Post-surgical changes are again noted status post right frontal and
 temporal craniotomy and resection of the previously seen mass within the right
 temporal lobe.  There is a stable appearance of the resection cavity, with a
 stable focus of nodular enhancement along the lateral aspect.  No new focus of
 abnormal enhancement is identified.  Additionally, there is mild
 pachymeningeal enhancement, most evident on the delayed FLAIR images which is
 smooth in appearance and overlies the right frontal and parietal lobe.  T2 and
 FLAIR signal changes in the right temporal lobe are stable in appearance.

 Post-surgical changes are also noted in the right frontal lobe, with the T1
 hyperintensity decreased slightly since the prior study.

 There is no midline shift.  There is no acute hemorrhage or extra-axial
 collection.  There is no decreased diffusion to indicate an acute infarct.
 The flow voids of the major vessels are present.

 Tumor volumetrics:  The area of residual FLAIR hyperintensity in the right
 temporal lobe measures 7.38 cm3 on the current study compared with 6.5 cm3 on
 the prior study, but given that the configuration is stable, this difference
 is felt to be related to increased motion on the current study rather than
 representing a true difference (with a FLAIR sequence that was even more
 motion compromised giving a volume of 10.07 cm3).

 IMPRESSION:  Stable appearance of the post-surgical changes status post right
 temporal craniotomy and resection of the mass within the right temporal lobe
 as well as revision of a CSF leak the right frontal sinus. The small focus of
 residual nodular enhancement previously noted along the resection margin is
 stable in appearance.  No new focus of abnormal enhancement is identified.

 similar study of [**2181-11-25**].  Comparison demonstrates the appearance of
 a new right-sided basal density obliterating the lateral pleural sinus.  In
 addition, there is a parenchymal density consisting with an infiltrative
 process in the right lower lobe lateral segment.  No other new infiltrates are
 seen.  No pulmonary vascular congestion is identified and no pneumothorax

 RADIOPHARMACEUTICAL DATA:
    20.7 mCi F-18 FDG ([**2182-6-25**]);
 INDICATION: 54 year-old-male with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.

 METHODS: Approximately 1 hour after intravenous administration of F-18
 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), noncontrast CT images were obtained for attenuation
 correction and for fusion with emission PET images. [The noncontrast CT images
 are not used to diagnose disease independently of the PET images.]  A series of
 overlapping emission PET images was then obtained. The fasting blood glucose
 level, measured by glucometer before injection of FDG, was 107 mg/dL. The area
 imaged spanned the region from the skull to the pubic symphysis.

 Computed tomography (CT) images were co-registered and fused with emission PET
 images to assist with the anatomic localization of tracer uptake.  The
 determination of the site of tracer uptake seen on PET data can have important
 implications regarding the significance of that uptake.

 INTERPRETATION:
 Comparison is made to PET-CT on [**2182-2-13**] and MR [**Name13 (STitle) 1699**] on [**6-14**] and [**4-15**], [**2182**].

 HEAD/NECK:  Again noted are hyper-pneumatized frontal sinuses.  The patient is
 status post right frontotemporal craniotomy with similar right temporal
 encephalomalacia.  The previously described nodular soft tissue lesion at the
 right pretemporal area adjacent to the carotid canal now measures approximately
 16 x 12 mm (Image 2:27) and demonstrates abnormal FDG-avidity at SUVmax 4.7,
 most compatible with a dural-based metastasis.

 CHEST:  A new left lower paratracheal node measures 20 x 12 mm (Image 2:87),
 with abnormal FDG-avidity at SUVmax 9.1.  A previously small and non-FDG-avid
 right lower paratracheal node now measures 26 x 21 mm (Image 2:80) with
 FDG-avidity at SUVmax 10.6.  A right upper paratracheal node measures 14 x 10 mm
 (Image 2:77) with FDG-avidity at SUVmax 3.5.

 There is also moderate interval progression of FDG-avid (SUVmax 15.2) large
 conglomerate subcarinal lymphadenopathy, now measures 67 x 44 mm (Image 2:97)
 compared to 42 x39 mm previously.

 There is no FDG-avid pulmonary nodule.  Bibasilar atelectasis is minimal.  No
 pneumothorax, pleural effusion or focal air-space consolidation is noted.

 ABDOMEN/PELVIS: No FDG-avid disease is noted in the liver, spleen, adrenal,
 pancreas.  An infra-renal IVC filter is again noted.

 MUSCULOSKELETAL:  No FDG-avid or destructive bone lesion is noted.

 Physiologic uptake is seen in the brain, myocardium, salivary glands, GI and  GU

 MR HEAD WITHOUT AND WITH CONTRAST, [**2182-8-5**]

 HISTORY:  Right cavernous sinus mass, is evidence of progression of metastatic
 disease?

 Sagittal and axial short TR short TE spin echo imaging were performed through
 the brain.  After administration of 20 cc of Magnevist intravenous contrast,
 axial imaging was performed with [**Last Name (LF) 1168**], [**First Name3 (LF) 1169**] TR long TE fast spin echo,
 gradient echo, diffusion, and short TR short TE spin echo technique.  Sagittal
 MP-RAGE imaging was performed and reformatted into axial and coronal
 orientations.  Comparison to brain MR examinations of [**2182-6-14**], [**2182-4-15**] and [**2182-3-4**].

 FINDINGS:  There is continued enlargement of the right cavernous sinus mass
 that fills Meckel's cave and extends posteriorly along the free edge of the
 tentorium.  This has enlarged significantly since the study of [**6-14**], however
 its irregular contours precludes meaningful measurement.  There have been no
 other significant changes.  No other masses or regions of abnormal enhancement
 are detected.  Again seen are postoperative changes with tissue loss in the
 right temporal lobe.  Although an MRA examination was not performed, the
 findings suggest encasement of the supraclinoid right internal carotid artery
 by the mass.

 The mastoid air cells remain densely opacified.

 CONCLUSION:  Continued enlargement of a right cavernous sinus mass, compatible
 with the history of metastatic disease.  No other masses are detected and
 there are no other findings suggestive of metastases elsewhere.

 RADIOPHARMACEUTICAL DATA:
    22.0 mCi F-18 FDG ([**2182-8-23**]);
 INDICATION: 54 y/o man with metastatic lung cancer on Tarceva to the brain and
 mediastinal lymph nodes for restaging.

 METHODS: Approximately 1 hour after intravenous administration of F-18
 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), noncontrast CT images were obtained for attenuation
 correction and for fusion with emission PET images. The noncontrast CT images
 are not used to diagnose disease independently of the PET images.  A series of
 overlapping emission PET images was then obtained. The fasting blood glucose
 level, measured by glucometer before injection of FDG, was 106 mg/dL. The area
 imaged spanned the region from the mid-skull to the thighs.

 Computed tomography (CT) images were co-registered and fused with emission PET
 images to assist with the anatomic localization of tracer uptake.  The
 determination of the site of tracer uptake seen on PET data can have important
 implications regarding the significance of that uptake.

 COMPARISON: [**2182-6-25**]

 CORRELATION: MR brain [**2182-8-5**]

 HEAD/NECK: There is a focus of moderate FDG avidity in the medial aspect of the
 right inferior temporal lobe with [**Year (4 digits) 31175**] 10.1, previously 11.4, although the
 extent of abnormal avidity has increased since the prior study. See the
 correlating MR study of the brain for more precise anatomical information. There
 has been prior right temporal-parietal craniotomy with underlying
 encephalomalacia consistent with prior resected brain metastasis from this
 location.

 There is mild uptake with the parotid gland with some muscular atrophy in the
 right temporal region. Prominent uptake in mucosa of the hard palate is
 unchanged. There is opacification of the mastoid air cells and a large frontal
 sinus.

 CHEST: There is scarring of the left lung base and volume loss of the left
 hemithorax consistent with prior LLL wedge resection. There is no suspicious
 lung nodules. There is a small pericardial effusion and no significant pleural
 effusion.

 There is a new 1.0 cm FDG left supraclavicular lymph node with [**Year (4 digits) 31175**] 4.5. There
 has been interval growth and avidity of several mediastinal lymph nodes. For
 example, a high right paratracheal lymph node measuring 2.4 x 2.3 cm seen on
 image 60 has [**Year (4 digits) 31175**] 11.9, previously 7.1. A smaller lymph node at the same level
 just to the right has increased in size and now has [**Year (4 digits) 31175**] 11.6, previously
 4.9. A high right paratracheal lymph node seen on image 65 has increased
 slightly in size and now has [**Year (4 digits) 31175**] 24.9, previously 10.6. A large subcarinal

 lymph node is relatively stable in size and now has [**Name (NI) 31175**] 26.3, previously
 13.7. Two paraesophageal lymph nodes, seen on images 83 and 88, have [**Name (NI) 31175**] 7.0
 and 8.4, respectively. There is no significant axillary or hilar
 lymphadenopathy.

 ABDOMEN/PELVIS: There is no significant lymphadenopathy or FDG avid disease in
 the abdomen or pelvis. There is an infrarenal IVC filter in place.

 MUSCULOSKELETAL: A focus of uptake adjacent to the C6 spinous process has no
 clear CT correlate and is probably the sequelae of minor trauma. There is
 diffuse tracer uptake in the muscles of the shoulder girdles and in the lateral
 hips, likely exertional.

 Physiologic uptake is seen in the brain, myocardium, salivary glands, GI, and GU
 tracts, liver and spleen.

 IMPRESSION:

 Increasing FDG avidity within the medial aspect of the right temporal lobe, new
 FDG avid left supraclavicular lymph node, and interval increase in size and
 uptake within enlarged, FDG avid mediastinal lymphadenopathy consistent with
 disease progression.

 HISTORY:  Male with history of intermittent vertigo, for further evaluation.

 TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted images were acquired through the
 cervical spine without administration of intravenous contrast.  There is no
 relevant prior imaging for comparison.

 FINDINGS:

 The C2-3 level is unremarkable with preserved alignment and disc anatomy.

 At C3-C4 level, there is bilateral uncovertebral joint hypertrophy with mild
 effacement of the thecal sac and mild bilateral foraminal narrowing.

 At C4-5 level, there is severe left-sided foraminal narrowing due to
 uncovertebral hypotrophy and mild right foraminal narrowing.  At C5-C6 level,
 there is mild right foraminal narrowing due to uncovertebral hypertrophy.

 At C6-7 level, there is moderate bilateral foraminal narrowing due to
 uncovertebral hypertrophy.  C7-T1 level, there is no significant disc disease
 or joint abnormality.  There is no abnormal cord signal or abnormal
 enhancement to suggest metastatic disease.  There is no abnormal marrow
 signal.

 The C7-T1 level demonstrates a posterior central disc protrusion with minor
 bilateral foraminal narrowing.

 The visualized brainstem and cerebellum appear unremarkable.

 IMPRESSION:

 Multilevel degenerative changes with uncovertebral joint hypertrophy as
 described above.  No evidence of metastatic disease to the cervical spine or
 the cord.
