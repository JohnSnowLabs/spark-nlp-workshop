The mass increased in size and she was seen by her primary care physician and referred to orthopedic surgeon. MRI showed inflammation and was thought to be secondary to rheumatoid arthritis. The mass increased in size. She eventually underwent a partial resection found to have pathologic grade 2 leiomyosarcoma, margins were impossible to assess, but were likely positive. She was evaluated by Dr. X and Dr. Y and a decision was made to proceed with preoperative chemotherapy. She began treatment with CIVI-CAD in December 2007. Her course was complicated by pulmonary embolus, pneumonia, and subdural hematoma while on anticoagulation. She eventually underwent surgical resection on May 1, 2008 with small area of residual disease, but otherwise clear margins.\n","HOSPITAL COURSE:1. Leiomyosarcoma, the patient was admitted to Hem/Onco B Service under attending Dr. XYZ for cycle six of continuous IV infusion Cytoxan, Adriamycin, and DTIC, which she tolerated well.2. History of pulmonary embolism. Upon admission, the patient reported an approximate two-week history of dyspnea on exertion and some mild chest pain. She underwent a CTA, which showed no evidence of pulmonary embolism and the patient was started on prophylactic doses of Lovenox at 40 mg a day. She had no further complaints throughout the hospitalization with any shortness of breath or chest pain.3. History of subdural hematoma, also on admission the patient noted some mild intermittent headaches that were fleeting in nature, several a day that would resolve on their own. Her headaches were not responding to pain medication and so on 07/24/2008, we obtained a head CT that showed no evidence of acute intracranial abnormalities. The patient also had a history of sinusitis and so a sinus CT scan was obtained, which was normal.4. Pancytopenia. On admission, the patient's white blood count was 3.4, hemoglobin 11.3, platelet count 82, and ANC of 2400. The patient's counts were followed throughout admission. She did not require transfusion of red blood cells or platelets; however, on 07/26/2008 her ANC did dip to 900 and she was placed on neutropenic diet. At discharge her ANC is back up to 1100 and she is taken off neutropenic diet. Her white blood cell count at discharge was 1.4 and her hemoglobin was 11.2 with a platelet count of 140.\n","5.

She had no prior history of skin cancer. She is status post bilateral cosmetic breast augmentation many years ago and the records are not available for this procedure. She has noted progressive hardening and distortion of the implant. She desires to have the implants removed, capsulectomy and replacement of implants. She would like to go slightly smaller than her current size as she has ptosis going with a smaller implant combined with capsulectomy will result in worsening of her ptosis. She may require a lift.

No clubbing, cyanosis or edema. SKIN: Significant environmental actinic skin damage.I recommended excision of basal cell cancers with frozen section control of the margin, closure will require local tissue flaps. I recommended exchange of the implants with reaugmentation. No final size is guaranteed or implied. We will decrease the size of the implants based on the intraoperative findings as the size is not known. Several options are available. Sizer implants will be placed to best estimate postoperative size. Ptosis will be worse following capsulectomy and going with a smaller implant. She may require a lift in the future. We have obtained preoperative clearance from the patient's cardiologist, Dr. K. The patient has been taken off Coumadin for five days and will be placed back on Coumadin the day after the surgery. The risk of deep venous thrombosis is discussed. Other risk including bleeding, infection, allergic reaction, pain, scarring, hypertrophic scarring and poor cosmetic resolve, worsening of ptosis, exposure, extrusion, the rupture of the implants, numbness of the nipple-areolar complex, hematoma, need for additional surgery, recurrent capsular contracture and recurrence of the skin cancer was all discussed, which she understands and informed consent is obtained.\n","PROCEDURE IN DETAILAfter appropriate informed consent was obtained, the patient was placed in the preoperative holding area with **** input. She was then taken to the major operating room with ABCD Surgery Center, placed in a supine position. Intravenous antibiotics were given. TED hose and SCDs were placed. After the induction of adequate general endotracheal anesthesia, she was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. Sites for excision and skin cancers were carefully marked with 5 mm margin. These were injected with 1% lidocaine with epinephrine.After allowing adequate time for basal constriction hemostasis, excision was performed, full thickness of the skin. They were tagged at the 12 o'clock position and sent for frozen section. Hemostasis was achieved using electrocautery. Once margins were determined to be free of involvement, local tissue flaps were designed for advancement. Undermining was performed. Hemostasis was achieved using electrocautery. Closure was performed under moderate tension with interrupted 5-0 Vicryl. Skin was closed under loop magnification paying meticulous attention and cosmetic details with 6-0 Prolene. Attention was then turned to the breast, clothes were changed, gloves were changed, incision was planned and the previous inframammary incision beginning on the right incision was made. Dissection was carried down to the capsule. It was extremely calcified. Dissection of the anterior surface of the capsule was performed. The implant was subglandular, the capsule was entered, implant was noted to be grossly intact; however, there was free silicone. Implant was removed and noted to be ruptured. No marking as to the size of the implant was found.Capsulectomy was performed leaving a small portion in the axilla in the inframammary fold. Pocket was modified to medialize the implant by placing 2-0 Prolene laterally in mattress sutures to restrict the pocket. In identical fashion, capsulectomy was performed on the left. Implant was noted to be grossly ruptured. No marking was found for the size of the implant. The entire content was weighed and found to be 350 grams. Right side was weighed and noted to be 338 grams, although some silicone was lost in the transfer and most likely was identical 350 grams. The implants appeared to be double lumen with the saline portion deflated. Completion of the capsulectomy was performed on the left.The pocket was again fashioned to improve symmetry with the right with Prolene. Pockets were thoroughly irrigated. Hemostasis was achieved using electrocautery, checked for symmetry, which is determined to be excellent. Several liters of normal saline were utilized to irrigate the pocket. Hemostasis was determined to be excellent. Drains were placed. 2-0 Vicryl sutures were preplaced. Pockets were checked for hemostasis, irrigated with normal saline, sizing was performed with placement of 275 cc implants. She was placed in a sitting position. This significantly worsened ptosis and for this reason, 325 cc implants were chosen. She is placed back in a supine position. Pockets were irrigated with antibiotic solution, 2-0 Vicryl sutures were preplaced and gloves were changed. The patient was reprepped with Betadine, towels were changed.These were soaked in antibiotic solution. Gloves were changed, gowns were changed, the patient was reprepped, towels were changed and implants were placed. The patient was placed in a sitting position. Symmetry was excellent. There was noted to be a decrease of volume of approximately 40 cc from the capsulectomy as well as the additional reduction of 25 cc. Ptosis was slightly worse; however, excellent shape of the breast. She was placed back in a supine position, preplaced 2-0 Vicryl sutures were tied; a second layer subcutaneous of 3-0 Vicryl was placed followed by a third of 4-0 Vicryl. The skin was closed with a running 4-0 Prolene. Drains were secured. All sponge and needle counts were correct. Dressing was applied.\n","COMPLICATIONSNone.\n","DISPOSITIONTo recovery room.\n","</td></tr><tr><td>dbfs:/FileStore/HLS/nlp/data/mt_oncology_10/mt_note_05.txt</td><td>Medical Specialty:Hematology - Oncology\n","Sample Name: Consult - Breast Cancer - 1\n","Description: The patient is a 57-year-old female with invasive ductal carcinoma of the left breast, T1c, Nx, M0 left breast carcinoma.\n","(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\n","CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Left breast cancer.\n","HISTORY: The patient is a 57-year-old female, who I initially saw in the office on 12/27/07, as a referral from the Tomball Breast Center. On 12/21/07, the patient underwent image-guided needle core biopsy of a 1.5 cm lesion at the 7 o'clock position of the left breast (inferomedial). The biopsy returned showing infiltrating ductal carcinoma high histologic grade. The patient stated that she had recently felt and her physician had felt a palpable mass in that area prior to her breast imaging. She prior to that area, denied any complaints. She had no nipple discharge. No trauma history. She has had been on no estrogen supplementation. She has had no other personal history of breast cancer. Her family history is positive for her mother having breast cancer at age 48. The patient has had no children and no pregnancies. She denies any change in the right breast. Subsequent to the office visit and tissue diagnosis of breast cancer, she has had medical oncology consultation with Dr. X and radiation oncology consultation with Dr. Y. I have discussed the case with Dr. X and Dr. Y, who are both in agreement with proceeding with surgery prior to adjuvant therapy. The patient's metastatic workup has otherwise been negative with MRI scan and CT scanning. The MRI scan showed some close involvement possibly involving the left pectoralis muscle, although thought to also possibly represent biopsy artifact. CT scan of the neck, chest, and abdomen is negative for metastatic disease. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Previous surgery is history of benign breast biopsy in 1972, laparotomy in 1981, 1982, and 1984, right oophorectomy in 1984, and ganglion cyst removal of the hand in 1987.\n","MEDICATIONS: She is currently on omeprazole for reflux and indigestion.\n","ALLERGIES: SHE HAS NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.\n","REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Negative for any recent febrile illnesses, chest pains or shortness of breath. Positive for restless leg syndrome. Negative for any unexplained weight loss and no change in bowel or bladder habits.\n","FAMILY HISTORY: Positive for breast cancer in her mother and also mesothelioma from possible asbestosis or asbestos exposure.\n","SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient works as a school teacher and teaching high school.\n","PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: GENERAL: The patient is a white female, alert and oriented x 3, appears her stated age of 57.\n","HEENT: Head is atraumatic and normocephalic. Sclerae are anicteric. NECK: Supple.\n","CHEST: Clear. HEART: Regular rate and rhythm. BREASTS: Exam reveals an approximately 1.5 cm relatively mobile focal palpable mass in the inferomedial left breast at the 7 o'clock position, which clinically is not fixed to the underlying pectoralis muscle. There are no nipple retractions. No skin dimpling. There is some, at the time of the office visit, ecchymosis from recent biopsy. There is no axillary adenopathy. The remainder of the left breast is without abnormality. The right breast is without abnormality. The axillary areas are negative for adenopathy bilaterally. ABDOMEN: Soft, nontender without masses. No gross organomegaly. No CVA or flank tenderness. EXTREMITIES: Grossly neurovascularly intact.\n","IMPRESSION:  The patient is a 57-year-old female with invasive ductal carcinoma of the left breast, T1c, Nx, M0 left breast carcinoma.\n","RECOMMENDATIONS:  I have discussed with the patient in detail about the diagnosis of breast cancer and the surgical options, and medical oncologist has discussed with her issues about adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy. We have decided to recommend to the patient breast conservation surgery with left breast lumpectomy with preoperative sentinel lymph node injection and mapping and left axillary dissection. The possibility of further surgery requiring wider lumpectomy or even completion mastectomy was explained to the patient. The procedure and risks of the surgery were explained to include, but not limited to extra bleeding, infection, unsightly scar formation, the possibility of local recurrence, the possibility of left upper extremity lymphedema was explained. Local numbness, paresthesias or chronic pain was explained. The patient was given an educational brochure and several brochures about the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancers.

Leiomyosarcoma.2. History of pulmonary embolism.3. History of subdural hematoma.4. Pancytopenia.5. History of pneumonia.\nPROCEDURES DURING HOSPITALIZATION:1. Cycle six of CIVI-CAD (Cytoxan, Adriamycin, and DTIC) from 07/22/2008 to 07/29/2008.2. CTA, chest PE study showing no evidence for pulmonary embolism.\n3. Head CT showing no evidence of acute intracranial abnormalities.4. Sinus CT, normal mini-CT of the paranasal sinuses.\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. ABC is a pleasant 66-year-old Caucasian female who first palpated a mass in the left posterior arm in spring of 2007. The mass increased in size and she was seen by her primary care physician and referred to orthopedic surgeon. MRI showed inflammation and was thought to be secondary to rheumatoid arthritis. The mass increased in size. She eventually underwent a partial resection found to have pathologic grade 2 leiomyosarcoma, margins were impossible to assess, but were likely positive. She was evaluated by Dr. X and Dr. Y and a decision was made to proceed with preoperative chemotherapy. She began treatment with CIVI-CAD in December 2007. Her course was complicated by pulmonary embolus, pneumonia, and subdural hematoma while on anticoagulation. She eventually underwent surgical resection on May 1, 2008 with small area of residual disease, but otherwise clear margins.\nHOSPITAL COURSE:1. Leiomyosarcoma, the patient was admitted to Hem/Onco B Service under attending Dr. XYZ for cycle six of continuous IV infusion Cytoxan, Adriamycin, and DTIC, which she tolerated well.2. History of pulmonary embolism. Upon admission, the patient reported an approximate two-week history of dyspnea on exertion and some mild chest pain. She underwent a CTA, which showed no evidence of pulmonary embolism and the patient was started on prophylactic doses of Lovenox at 40 mg a day. She had no further complaints throughout the hospitalization with any shortness of breath or chest pain.3. History of subdural hematoma, also on admission the patient noted some mild intermittent headaches that were fleeting in nature, several a day that would resolve on their own. Her headaches were not responding to pain medication and so on 07/24/2008, we obtained a head CT that showed no evidence of acute intracranial abnormalities. The patient also had a history of sinusitis and so a sinus CT scan was obtained, which was normal.4. Pancytopenia. On admission, the patient's white blood count was 3.4, hemoglobin 11.3, platelet count 82, and ANC of 2400. The patient's counts were followed throughout admission. She did not require transfusion of red blood cells or platelets; however, on 07/26/2008 her ANC did dip to 900 and she was placed on neutropenic diet. At discharge her ANC is back up to 1100 and she is taken off neutropenic diet. Her white blood cell count at discharge was 1.4 and her hemoglobin was 11.2 with a platelet count of 140.\n5. History of pneumonia. During admission, the patient did not exhibit any signs or symptoms of pneumonia.\nDISPOSITION:  Home in stable condition.\nDIET:  Regular and less neutropenic.\nACTIVITY:  Resume same activity.\nFOLLOWUP: The patient will have lab work at Dr. XYZ on 08/05/2008 and she will also return to the cancer center on 08/12/2008 at 10:20 a.m. The patient is also advised to monitor for any fevers greater than 100.5 and should she have any further problems in the meantime to please call in to be seen sooner.\n"],["dbfs:/FileStore/HLS/nlp/data/mt_oncology_10/mt_note_04.txt","Medical Specialty:Hematology - Oncology\nSample Name: BCCa Excision - Cheek\nDescription: Excision of basal cell carcinoma.

Replacement with bilateral silicone gel implants, 325 cc.\nINDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURESThe patient is a 61-year-old woman who presents with a history of biopsy-proven basal cell carcinoma, right and left cheek. She had no prior history of skin cancer. She is status post bilateral cosmetic breast augmentation many years ago and the records are not available for this procedure. She has noted progressive hardening and distortion of the implant. She desires to have the implants removed, capsulectomy and replacement of implants. She would like to go slightly smaller than her current size as she has ptosis going with a smaller implant combined with capsulectomy will result in worsening of her ptosis. She may require a lift. She is not consenting to lift due to the surgical scars.\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORYSignificant for deep venous thrombosis and acid reflux.\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY\nSignificant for appendectomy, colonoscopy and BAM.\nMEDICATIONS:\nCoumadin. She stopped her Coumadin five days prior to the procedures.2. Lipitor3. Effexor.4. Klonopin.\nALLERGIES: None.\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Negative for dyspnea on exertion, palpitations, chest pain, and phlebitis.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: VITAL SIGNS: Height 5'8\", weight 155 pounds. FACE: Examination of the face demonstrates basal cell carcinoma, right and left cheek. No lesions are noted in the regional lymph node base and no mass is appreciated.\nBREAST: Examination of the breast demonstrates bilateral grade IV capsular contracture. She has asymmetry in distortion of the breast. No masses are appreciated in the breast or the axilla. The implants appear to be subglandular.\nCHEST: Clear to auscultation and percussion.\nCARDIOVASCULAR: Regular rate and rhythm.\nEXTREMITIES: Show full range of motion. No clubbing, cyanosis or edema. SKIN: Significant environmental actinic skin damage.I recommended excision of basal cell cancers with frozen section control of the margin, closure will require local tissue flaps. I recommended exchange of the implants with reaugmentation. No final size is guaranteed or implied. We will decrease the size of the implants based on the intraoperative findings as the size is not known. Several options are available. Sizer implants will be placed to best estimate postoperative size. Ptosis will be worse following capsulectomy and going with a smaller implant. She may require a lift in the future. We have obtained preoperative clearance from the patient's cardiologist, Dr. K. The patient has been taken off Coumadin for five days and will be placed back on Coumadin the day after the surgery. The risk of deep venous thrombosis is discussed. Other risk including bleeding, infection, allergic reaction, pain, scarring, hypertrophic scarring and poor cosmetic resolve, worsening of ptosis, exposure, extrusion, the rupture of the implants, numbness of the nipple-areolar complex, hematoma, need for additional surgery, recurrent capsular contracture and recurrence of the skin cancer was all discussed, which she understands and informed consent is obtained.\nPROCEDURE IN DETAILAfter appropriate informed consent was obtained, the patient was placed in the preoperative holding area with **** input. She was then taken to the major operating room with ABCD Surgery Center, placed in a supine position. Intravenous antibiotics were given. TED hose and SCDs were placed. After the induction of adequate general endotracheal anesthesia, she was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. Sites for excision and skin cancers were carefully marked with 5 mm margin. These were injected with 1% lidocaine with epinephrine.After allowing adequate time for basal constriction hemostasis, excision was performed, full thickness of the skin. They were tagged at the 12 o'clock position and sent for frozen section. Hemostasis was achieved using electrocautery. Once margins were determined to be free of involvement, local tissue flaps were designed for advancement. Undermining was performed. Hemostasis was achieved using electrocautery. Closure was performed under moderate tension with interrupted 5-0 Vicryl. Skin was closed under loop magnification paying meticulous attention and cosmetic details with 6-0 Prolene. Attention was then turned to the breast, clothes were changed, gloves were changed, incision was planned and the previous inframammary incision beginning on the right incision was made. Dissection was carried down to the capsule. It was extremely calcified. Dissection of the anterior surface of the capsule was performed. The implant was subglandular, the capsule was entered, implant was noted to be grossly intact; however, there was free silicone. Implant was removed and noted to be ruptured. No marking as to the size of the implant was found.Capsulectomy was performed leaving a small portion in the axilla in the inframammary fold. Pocket was modified to medialize the implant by placing 2-0 Prolene laterally in mattress sutures to restrict the pocket. In identical fashion, capsulectomy was performed on the left. Implant was noted to be grossly ruptured. No marking was found for the size of the implant. The entire content was weighed and found to be 350 grams. Right side was weighed and noted to be 338 grams, although some silicone was lost in the transfer and most likely was identical 350 grams. The implants appeared to be double lumen with the saline portion deflated. Completion of the capsulectomy was performed on the left.The pocket was again fashioned to improve symmetry with the right with Prolene. Pockets were thoroughly irrigated. Hemostasis was achieved using electrocautery, checked for symmetry, which is determined to be excellent. Several liters of normal saline were utilized to irrigate the pocket. Hemostasis was determined to be excellent. Drains were placed. 2-0 Vicryl sutures were preplaced. Pockets were checked for hemostasis, irrigated with normal saline, sizing was performed with placement of 275 cc implants. She was placed in a sitting position. This significantly worsened ptosis and for this reason, 325 cc implants were chosen. She is placed back in a supine position. Pockets were irrigated with antibiotic solution, 2-0 Vicryl sutures were preplaced and gloves were changed. The patient was reprepped with Betadine, towels were changed.These were soaked in antibiotic solution. Gloves were changed, gowns were changed, the patient was reprepped, towels were changed and implants were placed. The patient was placed in a sitting position. Symmetry was excellent. There was noted to be a decrease of volume of approximately 40 cc from the capsulectomy as well as the additional reduction of 25 cc. Ptosis was slightly worse; however, excellent shape of the breast. She was placed back in a supine position, preplaced 2-0 Vicryl sutures were tied; a second layer subcutaneous of 3-0 Vicryl was placed followed by a third of 4-0 Vicryl. The skin was closed with a running 4-0 Prolene. Drains were secured. All sponge and needle counts were correct. Dressing was applied.\nCOMPLICATIONSNone.\nDISPOSITIONTo recovery room.\n"],["dbfs:/FileStore/HLS/nlp/data/mt_oncology_10/mt_note_05.txt","Medical Specialty:Hematology - Oncology\nSample Name: Consult - Breast Cancer - 1\nDescription: The patient is a 57-year-old female with invasive ductal carcinoma of the left breast, T1c, Nx, M0 left breast carcinoma.\n(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\nCHIEF COMPLAINT:  Left breast cancer.\nHISTORY: The patient is a 57-year-old female, who I initially saw in the office on 12/27/07, as a referral from the Tomball Breast Center. On 12/21/07, the patient underwent image-guided needle core biopsy of a 1.5 cm lesion at the 7 o'clock position of the left breast (inferomedial). The biopsy returned showing infiltrating ductal carcinoma high histologic grade. The patient stated that she had recently felt and her physician had felt a palpable mass in that area prior to her breast imaging. She prior to that area, denied any complaints. She had no nipple discharge. No trauma history. She has had been on no estrogen supplementation. She has had no other personal history of breast cancer. Her family history is positive for her mother having breast cancer at age 48. The patient has had no children and no pregnancies. She denies any change in the right breast. Subsequent to the office visit and tissue diagnosis of breast cancer, she has had medical oncology consultation with Dr. X and radiation oncology consultation with Dr. Y. I have discussed the case with Dr. X and Dr. Y, who are both in agreement with proceeding with surgery prior to adjuvant therapy. The patient's metastatic workup has otherwise been negative with MRI scan and CT scanning. The MRI scan showed some close involvement possibly involving the left pectoralis muscle, although thought to also possibly represent biopsy artifact. CT scan of the neck, chest, and abdomen is negative for metastatic disease. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Previous surgery is history of benign breast biopsy in 1972, laparotomy in 1981, 1982, and 1984, right oophorectomy in 1984, and ganglion cyst removal of the hand in 1987.\nMEDICATIONS: She is currently on omeprazole for reflux and indigestion.\nALLERGIES: SHE HAS NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Negative for any recent febrile illnesses, chest pains or shortness of breath. Positive for restless leg syndrome. Negative for any unexplained weight loss and no change in bowel or bladder habits.\nFAMILY HISTORY: Positive for breast cancer in her mother and also mesothelioma from possible asbestosis or asbestos exposure.\nSOCIAL HISTORY: The patient works as a school teacher and teaching high school.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: GENERAL: The patient is a white female, alert and oriented x 3, appears her stated age of 57.\nHEENT: Head is atraumatic and normocephalic. Sclerae are anicteric. NECK: Supple.\nCHEST: Clear. HEART: Regular rate and rhythm. BREASTS: Exam reveals an approximately 1.5 cm relatively mobile focal palpable mass in the inferomedial left breast at the 7 o'clock position, which clinically is not fixed to the underlying pectoralis muscle. There are no nipple retractions. No skin dimpling. There is some, at the time of the office visit, ecchymosis from recent biopsy. There is no axillary adenopathy. The remainder of the left breast is without abnormality. The right breast is without abnormality. The axillary areas are negative for adenopathy bilaterally. ABDOMEN: Soft, nontender without masses. No gross organomegaly. No CVA or flank tenderness. EXTREMITIES: Grossly neurovascularly intact.\nIMPRESSION:  The patient is a 57-year-old female with invasive ductal carcinoma of the left breast, T1c, Nx, M0 left breast carcinoma.\nRECOMMENDATIONS:  I have discussed with the patient in detail about the diagnosis of breast cancer and the surgical options, and medical oncologist has discussed with her issues about adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy. We have decided to recommend to the patient breast conservation surgery with left breast lumpectomy with preoperative sentinel lymph node injection and mapping and left axillary dissection. The possibility of further surgery requiring wider lumpectomy or even completion mastectomy was explained to the patient. The procedure and risks of the surgery were explained to include, but not limited to extra bleeding, infection, unsightly scar formation, the possibility of local recurrence, the possibility of left upper extremity lymphedema was explained. Local numbness, paresthesias or chronic pain was explained. The patient was given an educational brochure and several brochures about the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancers. She was certainly encouraged to obtain further surgical medical opinions prior to proceeding. I believe the patient has given full informed consent and desires to proceed with the above.\n"]],"datasetInfos":[],"dbfsResultPath":null,"isJsonSchema":true,"metadata":{},"overflow":false,"plotOptions":{"customPlotOptions":{},"displayType":"table","pivotAggregation":null,"pivotColumns":[],"xColumns":[],"yColumns":[]},"removedWidgets":[],"schema":[{"metadata":"{}","name":"path","type":"\"string\""},{"metadata":"{}","name":"text","type":"\"string\""}],"type":"table"}},"output_type":"display_data"}],"source":["df
