    "# Question Answering and Summarization with [T5](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.10683.pdf)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Google's T5 is a Sequence to Sequence model that was trained on over 15 different NLP datasets with various problem types, raning from Text Summarization, Question Answering, Translation to various semantical deduction tasks, which enriches T5's ability to map token sequences to semantic vectors which contain more meaning, which T5 leverages to generalize across various tasks and even to never before trained tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "On top of this, T5 is trained on the standard Word prediction task, which most transformer based models like BERT, GPT, ELMO have been trained on. This gives T5 general knowledge of real world concepts to additionally enhance its understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "With T5 you can answer **general knowledge based questions given no context** and in addition answer **questions on text databases**.      \n",
    "These questions can be asked in natural human.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a `open book question`? \n",
    "You can imagine an `open book` question similar to an examen where you are allowed to bring in text documents or cheat sheets that help you answer questions in an examen. Kinda like bringing a history book to an history examen. \n",
    "\n",
    "In `T5's` terms, this means the model is given a `question` and an **additional piece of textual information** or so called `context`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This enables the `T5` model to answer questions on textual datasets like `medical records`,`newsarticles` , `wiki-databases` , `stories` and `movie scripts` , `product descriptions`, 'legal documents' and many more.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a `closed book question`? \n",
    "A `closed book question` is the exact opposite of a `open book question`. In an examen scenario, you are only allowed to use what you have memorized in your brain and nothing else.      \n",
    "In `T5's` terms this means that T5 can only use it's stored weights to answer a `question` and is given **no aditional context**.        \n",
    "`T5` was pre-trained on the [C4 dataset](https://commoncrawl.org/) which contains **petabytes  of web crawling data**  collected over the last 8 years, including Wikipedia in every language.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives `T5` the broad knowledge of the internet stored in it's weights to answer various `closed book questions` \n",
