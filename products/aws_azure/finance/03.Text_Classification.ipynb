The city has been on the hook for $18 million in back-up utility charges since the spill and is trying a new energy delivery strategy: pay for the cost of the backup. In an internal report obtained by WXYZ-TV on Thursday, Energy Management officials were troubled by a decision to leave a gas pipeline running under a bus stop in Midlothian and instead deliver gas to a company called Energy Solutions. There are more than 8,000 residents who depend on this pipeline. On Wednesday, U.S. Sen. David Perdue, R-Ga., called on the EPA to conduct an investigation into why the company chose not to test the gas pipeline under the bus stop, a decision the company says was made solely to keep the company working. The EPA said Thursday that Energy Management is not responsible for the safety of the workers and equipment who were forced to live with the dangers of fuel.

While these improvements are promising, it is also important to understand just how important these initiatives are for maintaining the company's financial security. The following steps represent changes already being taken by the companies concerned, and they are designed to provide more assurance as a matter of public policy.1. Update the Privacy Policy to state that data is encrypted, regardless of where the encryption system is set up2.

Japan has already lowered the duties sharply and we must consider domestic market conditions, an official said. Duties on chocolate were cut to 20 pct from 31.9 pct in April 1983. Washington has been demanding a cut to seven pct, equivalent to its own duties, ministry sources said. Japanese chocolate imports rose to 8,285 tonnes in calendar 1986 from 5,908 in 1985, official statistics show. However, the ministry sources added it is possible the government may make further cuts in response to strong U.S. And European demand. \"Due to concern about the farm trade row with the U.S., Top-level government officials may press the ministry to cut the duties,\" one said. But he said it would be difficult for Japan to resolve its overall trade row with Washington and reduce its trade surplus, which reached 58.6 billion dolars in 1986.
