Alzheimerâ€™s disease. Treatment with KISUNLA should be\n"," initiated in patients with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia\n"," stage of disease, the population in which treatment was initiated in the\n"," clinical trials. (1)\n"," ------------------------DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION-----------------------\n"," â€¢ Confirm the presence of amyloid beta pathology prior to initiating\n"," treatment. (2.1)\n"," â€¢ The recommended dosage of KISUNLA is 700 mg administered as\n"," an intravenous infusion over approximately 30 minutes every four\n"," weeks for the first three doses, followed by 1400 mg every four\n"," weeks. (2.2)\n"," â€¢ Consider stopping dosing with KISUNLA based on reduction of\n"," amyloid plaques to minimal levels on amyloid PET imaging. (2.2)\n"," â€¢ Obtain a recent baseline brain MRI prior to initiating treatment.\n"," (2.3, 5.1)\n"," â€¢ Obtain an MRI prior to the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 7th infusions. If\n"," radiographically observed ARIA occurs, treatment\n"," recommendations are based on type, severity, and presence of\n"," symptoms. (2.3, 5.1)\n"," â€¢ Dilution to a final concentration of 4 mg/mL to 10 mg/mL with 0.9%\n"," Sodium Chloride Injection, is required prior to administration. (2.4)\n"," ----------------------DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS---------------------\n"," Injection: 350 mg/20 mL (17.5 mg/mL) in a single-dose vial. (3)\n"," ------------------------------- CONTRAINDICATIONS ------------------------------\n"," KISUNLA is contraindicated in patients with known serious\n"," hypersensitivity to donanemab-azbt or to any of the excipients. (4, 5.2)\n"," ------------------------WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS-----------------------\n"," â€¢ Amyloid Related Imaging Abnormalities (ARIA): Enhanced clinical\n"," vigilance for ARIA is recommended during the first 24 weeks of\n"," treatment with KISUNLA. Risk of ARIA, including symptomatic\n"," ARIA, was increased in apolipoprotein E Îµ4 (ApoE Îµ4)\n"," homozygotes compared to heterozygotes and noncarriers. The risk\n"," of ARIA-E and ARIA-H is increased in KISUNLA-treated patients\n"," with pretreatment microhemorrhages and/or superficial siderosis. If\n"," a patient experiences symptoms suggestive of ARIA, clinical\n"," evaluation should be performed, including MRI scanning if\n"," indicated. (2.3, 5.1)\n"," â€¢ Infusion-Related Reactions: The infusion rate may be reduced, or\n"," the infusion may be discontinued, and appropriate therapy initiated\n"," as clinically indicated. Consider pre-treatment with antihistamines,\n"," acetaminophen, or corticosteroids prior to subsequent dosing. (5.3)\n"," -------------------------------ADVERSE REACTIONS------------------------------\n"," Most common adverse reactions (at least 10% and higher incidence\n"," compared to placebo): ARIA-E, ARIA-H microhemorrhage, ARIA-H\n"," superficial siderosis, and headache.
