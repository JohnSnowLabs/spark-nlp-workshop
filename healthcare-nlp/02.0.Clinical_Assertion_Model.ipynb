    "\n",
    "The deep neural network architecture for assertion status detection in Spark NLP is based on a Bi-LSTM framework, and is a modified version of the architecture proposed by Federico Fancellu, Adam Lopez and Bonnie Webber ([Neural Networks For Negation Scope Detection](https://aclanthology.org/P16-1047.pdf)). Its goal is to classify the assertions made on given medical concepts as being present, absent, or possible in the patient, conditionally present in the patient under certain circumstances,\n",
    "hypothetically present in the patient at some future point, and\n",
    "mentioned in the patient report but associated with someoneelse.\n",
    "In the proposed implementation, input units depend on the\n",
    "target tokens (a named entity) and the neighboring words that\n",
    "are explicitly encoded as a sequence using word embeddings.\n",
    "Similar to paper mentioned above,  it is observed that that 95% of the scope tokens (neighboring words) fall in a window of 9 tokens to the left and 15\n",
    "to the right of the target tokens in the same dataset. Therefore, the same window size was implemented and it following parameters were used: learning\n",
    "rate 0.0012, dropout 0.05, batch size 64 and a maximum sentence length 250. The model has been implemented within\n",
    "Spark NLP as an annotator called AssertionDLModel. After\n",
    "training 20 epoch and measuring accuracy on the official test\n",

    "\n",
    "- `PipelineTracer` is a flexible class that tracks every stage of a pipeline. It provides detailed information about entities, assertions, de-identification, classification and relationships. This class also helps to build parser dictionaries to create a `PipelineOutputParser`. Some of the central functionality includes printing the pipeline schema, creating parser dictionaries, and retrieving possible assertions, relationships, and entities. Provide easy access to parser dictionaries and existing pipeline diagrams. Please see [PipelineTracer and PipelineOutputParser Notebook](https://github.com/JohnSnowLabs/spark-nlp-workshop/blob/master/tutorials/Certification_Trainings/Healthcare/11.4.PipelineTracer_and_PipelineOutputParser.ipynb) for more details"

When an entity is not found in the dictionary, no constraints are applied, ensuring flexibility in your data processing. With the `setEntityAssertionCaseSensitive` parameter, you can control the case sensitivity for both entities and assertion labels.

    "sample_text = '''Hello, I am a 20-year-old woman who was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism around a month ago. For approximately four months, I've been experiencing symptoms such as feeling light-headed, battling poor digestion, dealing with anxiety attacks, depression, a sharp pain on my left side chest, an elevated heart rate, and a significant loss of weight. Due to these conditions, I was admitted to the hospital and just got discharged recently. During my hospital stay, a number of different tests were carried out by various physicians who initially struggled to pinpoint my actual medical condition. These tests included numerous blood tests, a brain MRI, an ultrasound scan, and an endoscopy. At long last, I was examined by a homeopathic doctor who finally diagnosed me with hyperthyroidism, indicating my TSH level was at a low 0.15 while my T3 and T4 levels were normal. Additionally, I was found to be deficient in vitamins B12 and D. Hence, I've been on a regimen of vitamin D supplements once a week and a daily dose of 1000 mcg of vitamin B12. I've been undergoing homeopathic treatment for the last 40 days and underwent a second test after a month which showed my TSH level increased to 0.5. While I'm noticing a slight improvement in my feelings of weakness and depression, over the last week, I've encountered two new challenges: difficulty breathing and a dramatically increased heart rate. I'm now at a crossroads where I am unsure if I should switch to allopathic treatment or continue with homeopathy. I understand that thyroid conditions take a while to improve, but I'm wondering if both treatments would require the same duration for recovery. Several of my acquaintances have recommended transitioning to allopathy and warn against taking risks, given the potential of developing severe complications. Please forgive any errors in my English and thank you for your understanding.'''\n",

    "- `whiteList`: If defined, list of entities to process. The rest will be ignored. Do not include IOB prefix on labels.\n",
    "- `caseSensitive`: Determines whether the definitions of the white listed and black listed entities are case sensitive. Default: `True`.\n",
    "- `assertionsConfidence`: Pairs (assertion,confidenceThreshold) to filter assertions which have confidence lower than the confidence threshold.\n",
    "- `orderingFeatures`: Specifies the ordering features to use for overlapping entities. Possible values include: 'begin', 'end', 'length', 'source', 'confidence'. Default: `['begin', 'length', 'source']`\n",
    "- `electionStrategy`: Determines the strategy for selecting annotations. Annotations can be selected either sequentially based on their order (Sequential) or using a more diverse strategy (DiverseLonger). Currently, only Sequential and DiverseLonger options are available. Default: `Sequential`.\n",
    "- `defaultConfidence` :  When the confidence value is included in the orderingFeatures and a given annotation does not have any confidence, this parameter determines the value to be used. The default value is `0`.\n",
    "- `assertionSourcePrecedence`: Specifies the assertion sources to use for prioritizing overlapping annotations when the 'source' ordering feature is utilized. This parameter contains a comma-separated list of assertion sources that drive the prioritization. Annotations will be prioritized based on the order of the given string.\n",
    "- `sortByBegin`: Whether to sort the annotations by begin at the end of the merge and filter process. Default: `False`.\n",

The window is in format `[X,Y]` being `X` the number of tokens to consider on the left of the chunk, and `Y` the max number of tokens to consider on the right. Let’s take a look at what different windows mean:\n",

If it is set as True, the annotator tries to process as usual and ff exception-causing data (e.g. corrupted record/ document) is passed to the annotator, an exception warning is emitted which has the exception message. Processing continues with the next one while the rest of the records within the same batch is parsed without interruption. This comes with a performance penalty.
