balloon angioplasty .\\nThere were three lesions in the circumflex , dilated successfully .\\nHowever , the low circumflex marginal vessel could not be crossed with the balloon .\\nShe did well in follow up , being treated for hypertension .\\nIn the end of 1992 , she was feeling well and was taken off Isordil .\\nDuring the winter and early parts of 1993 , the patient noticed increasing fatigue , symptoms of breathlessness and recurrent substernal chest pressure which finally led to admission to Xas Tupalmsmodral Hospital on 11-11-93 with documentation of a subendocardial myocardial infarction and a blood pressure of 210/108 .\\nCardiac catheterization towards the end of the hospitalization showed recurrent right coronary artery stenosis proximally and high grade new stenosis in the distal circumflex at the area of the origin of the previously untreated low circumflex marginal vessel .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\nMedications on transfer were Ecotrin , Vasotec 5 mg , Lopressor 25 bid , Isordil 20 tid , Procardia XL once per day , and Lasix 20 q3 days .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nOn physical examination , the blood pressure was 150 , heart rate 70 , bilateral carotid bruits , grade II systolic ejection murmur , good femoral pulses without bruits , good dorsalis pedis pulses with no posterior tibial pulses felt .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nThe electrocardiogram revealed left bundle branch block .\\nThe electrolytes were normal .\\nThe admission hematocrit was 34 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nOn 12-6-93 , angioplasty was performed of the right coronary artery using a 3 mm solo balloon reducing the stenosis from 80 to approximately 20% with a faint diagonal lucency which was not obstructive .\\nThe new distal circumflex lesion was dilated with a 2.0 mm balloon with a good result and minimal persistent stenosis .\\nBut the low circumflex marginal could not be entered with a wire .\\nThe first marginal had a 505 stenosis at its origin , which was not attempted .\\nThe patient did well post procedure .\\nHe developed a grape sized hematoma over the femoral artery with a loud bruit .\\nThe ultrasound on the day of discharge showed no evidence of pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula .\\nThe blood pressure was 150-170 systolic .\\nThe patient was ambulating without symptoms .\\nADDENDUM :\\nThe admission hematocrit was 34 .\\nThis fell to 25 after the cardiac catheterization without evidence of bleeding and rose to 29 by the time of discharge .\\nDOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :\\nShe was discharged with advice by Cardiac Rehabilitation for gradually increasing activity .\\nShe will be followed by her physician at Cean , Dr. Dieseld Pollejesc , for further pressure management and follow up of the femoral hematoma .\\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE :\\nStable , resolving anemia .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nEcotrin 160 mg per day , Vasotec 5 mg per day , Lopressor 25 bid , Isordil 20 tid , Procardia XL 30 per day , Lasix 20 mg q3 days

:\\nFebruary 6 , 1994 , rigid bronchoscopy with biopsy and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy .\\nASSOCIATED PROCEDURES :\\nOn February 10 , 1994 , flexible bronchoscopy , flexible esophagoscopy , rigid bronchoscopy , transhiatal esophagectomy ( partial ) , substernal gastric interposition and jejunostomy .\\nMultiple bronchoscopies , chest tube insertion .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThe patient was a 71 year old white female with a history of carcinoid lung cancer who presented for evaluation of a tracheoesophageal fistula .\\nThe patient was initially diagnosed in 1978 with atypical small cell carcinoma of the lung and treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy until 1980 .\\nShe did well for approximately twelve years until she was diagnosed with carcinoid cancer of the same right upper lobe .\\nThis may have been the initial primary cancer although it is unclear at present .\\nBronchoscopy at that time showed an endobronchial tumor of the right upper lobe bronchus and it was felt to be unresectable .\\nShe underwent four treatments of brachytherapy in March through May of 1993 .\\nShe had been doing reasonably well until December of 1993 when she presented with persistent and worsening cough and near strangulation on attempts at eating solids or drinking liquids .\\nA bronchoscopy showed a tracheoesophageal fistula with an opening into the trachea above the carina and no tumor in the right upper lobe .\\nShe has been on total parenteral nutrition and has been nothing by mouth since then .\\nA barium swallow prior to admission showed the presence of a tracheoesophageal fistula with entrance into the right mainstem bronchus below the carina .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\nBronchitis , asthma , carcinoid cancer , no history of coronary artery disease or cerebrovascular accident .\\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY :\\nThe patient is status post appendectomy , hysterectomy and right salpingo-oophorectomy , bladder suspension and a tumor removal from the right neck .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\nCefuroxime 1.5 grams intravenously q8h , Solu-Medrol 62.5 mg intravenously q8h , Ventolin metered dose inhaler , 2 puffs PO q.i.d. , Pepcid 20 mg intravenously b.i.d.\\nALLERGIES :\\nThe patient is allergic to penicillin , morphine , codeine .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nThe patient is a pleasant white female in no acute distress .\\nShe is afebrile with stable vital signs .\\nThe head , eyes , ears , nose , throat examination was unremarkable .\\nNeck shows a well healed low collar incision without adenopathy or bruit .\\nThe lungs showed mild inspiratory wheeze and moderate expiratory wheezes .\\nBreath sounds are present bilaterally .\\nCardiovascular exam :\\nregular rate and rhythm .\\nThe abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended .\\nExtremities :\\nno clubbing , cyanosis or edema .\\nThe rectal examination is guaiac negative with a minimal amount of stool .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was admitted on February 5 , 1994 and had a central venous line placed in her right subclavian .\\nThe patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 6 , 1994 where she underwent rigid and flexible bronchoscopy and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy .\\nFindings included necrotic debris in the distal trachea at the carina and right mainstem bronchus .\\nEsophageal mucosa was visible through the trachea .\\nHer steroids were weaned and the patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 10 , 1994 where she underwent once again flexible bronchoscopy and flexible esophagoscopy , as well as rigid bronchoscopy .\\nShe then had a transhiatal esophagectomy which was partial , and a substernal gastric interposition as well as a jejunostomy .\\nThe pathology report suggested that the area was involved with radiation esophagitis and focal ulceration .\\nShe remained ventilator dependent postoperatively and was taken to the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit .\\nThe patient was maintained on triple antibiotics which included Vancomycin , ceftazidime and Gentamicin .\\nOn postoperative day two , she had an electroencephalogram which showed no evidence of seizure activity but some generalized slowing .\\nThe patient was seen in consultation by the Neurology Service for her apparent postoperative encephalopathy and episodes of shaking .\\nAn endoscopy was also performed on postoperative day two which showed clean anastomosis .\\nShe received multiple bronchoscopies for pulmonary toilet .\\nThe patient was maintained on tube feedings and the ventilator .\\nA repeat echocardiogram on February 18 showed no significant change of her previous echocardiogram on February 11 , which showed only a small pericardial effusion .\\nA pelvic and abdominal computerized tomography scan on February 18 also showed no evidence of a focal collection or abscess .\\nShe remained intermittently febrile despite numerous antibiotics .\\nHer chest X-ray showed bilateral air space disease , consistent with pneumonia or adult respiratory distress syndrome .\\nShe suffered an episode of renal failure which was felt attributable to aminoglycoside toxicity .\\nHer steroids were weaned .\\nBecause of her prolonged intubation and inability to wean , on February 24 , 1994 , she had a tracheostomy placed .\\nShe remained in a coma .\\nThe blood cultures on February 26 , 1994 grew out Staphylococcus and she was treated for septicemia .\\nHer sputum grew out Pseudomonas aeruginosa as well .\\nThe urine contained yeast and she was treated with amphotericin .\\nOn March 3 , 1994 , a repeat chest and abdominal and pelvis computerized tomography scan showed no evidence of fluid collections .\\nThere was a large left pleural effusion however .\\nThis was drained with a left chest tube .\\nHer sputum then grew out Klebsiella and she was treated with amikacin and imipenem .\\nShe developed a right pleural effusion and had a right chest tube placed .\\nOn March 13 , 1994 , she regained some level of consciousness .\\nShe was able to fix and follow with her eyes , respond to commands .\\nOn March 14 , 1994 , her right lung was pleurodesed .\\nAttempts were made to facilitate her wean by resting her overnight with a combination of propafol and Fentanyl .\\nThis was tried for approximately seven days with no real progress made toward facilitating her vent wean .\\nShe continued to require pressor support in the high 30 's .\\nShe also fell into a coma once again .\\nOn March 31 , 1994 , her pressor support requirement increased and she continued to have tachypneic episodes .\\nOn April 2 , 1994 , she had several episodes of bradycardia and asystole , which responded only to manual ventilation .\\nDiscussions were held with the patient 's family with regard to her previously expressed wishes not to be maintained on artificial life support for extended period of time with little or no hope for recovery .\\nShe had expressed these wishes in writing on several legal forms from the state of Jose Pineston , as well as in discussions with her loved ones .\\nDecision was made in conjunction with the family and Dr. Caslighlourdes to terminate artificial respiratory support .\\nThe patient was removed from the ventilator and placed on a T-piece in her trachea only and was made comfortable with narcotics .\\nHer respirations ceased and she died at 10:15 a.m. on April 2 , 1994 .\\nDISPOSITION / PLAN ON DISCHARGE :\\nThe family will return the body to Sa for burial .\\nThey have declined a post-mortem examination .\\nCA SHUFF , M.D.\\nDICTATING

:\\n12-9-93\\nIDENTIFYING DATA :\\nThis 75 year old female was transferred from Iming Medical Center for angioplasty .\\nPRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :\\nUnstable angina .\\nASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :\\nHypertension .\\nPRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :\\nRight and circumflex angioplasty , cardiac catheterization on 12-6-93 .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThis 75 year old woman was previously admitted here in November 1993 for chronic angina .\\nShe had mild mitral regurgitation and a slightly diminished ejection fraction .\\nThere was a 90% right coronary stenosis which was reduced to 30 with a balloon angioplasty .\\nThere were three lesions in the circumflex , dilated successfully .\\nHowever , the low circumflex marginal vessel could not be crossed with the balloon .\\nShe did well in follow up , being treated for hypertension .\\nIn the end of 1992 , she was feeling well and was taken off Isordil .\\nDuring the winter and early parts of 1993 , the patient noticed increasing fatigue , symptoms of breathlessness and recurrent substernal chest pressure which finally led to admission to Xas Tupalmsmodral Hospital on 11-11-93 with documentation of a subendocardial myocardial infarction and a blood pressure of 210/108 .\\nCardiac catheterization towards the end of the hospitalization showed recurrent right coronary artery stenosis proximally and high grade new stenosis in the distal circumflex at the area of the origin of the previously untreated low circumflex marginal vessel .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\nMedications on transfer were Ecotrin , Vasotec 5 mg , Lopressor 25 bid , Isordil 20 tid , Procardia XL once per day , and Lasix 20 q3 days .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nOn physical examination , the blood pressure was 150 , heart rate 70 , bilateral carotid bruits , grade II systolic ejection murmur , good femoral pulses without bruits , good dorsalis pedis pulses with no posterior tibial pulses felt .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nThe electrocardiogram revealed left bundle branch block .\\nThe electrolytes were normal .\\nThe admission hematocrit was 34 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nOn 12-6-93 , angioplasty was performed of the right coronary artery using a 3 mm solo balloon reducing the stenosis from 80 to approximately 20% with a faint diagonal lucency which was not obstructive .\\nThe new distal circumflex lesion was dilated with a 2.0 mm balloon with a good result and minimal persistent stenosis .\\nBut the low circumflex marginal could not be entered with a wire .\\nThe first marginal had a 505 stenosis at its origin , which was not attempted .\\nThe patient did well post procedure .\\nHe developed a grape sized hematoma over the femoral artery with a loud bruit .\\nThe ultrasound on the day of discharge showed no evidence of pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula .\\nThe blood pressure was 150-170 systolic .\\nThe patient was ambulating without symptoms .\\nADDENDUM :\\nThe admission hematocrit was 34 .\\nThis fell to 25 after the cardiac catheterization without evidence of bleeding and rose to 29 by the time of discharge .\\nDOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :\\nShe was discharged with advice by Cardiac Rehabilitation for gradually increasing activity .\\nShe will be followed by her physician at Cean , Dr. Dieseld Pollejesc , for further pressure management and follow up of the femoral hematoma .\\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE :\\nStable , resolving anemia .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nEcotrin 160 mg per day , Vasotec 5 mg per day , Lopressor 25 bid , Isordil 20 tid , Procardia XL 30 per day , Lasix 20 mg q3 days

on Aug 22 , 2003 , for follow-up .\\nShe was scheduled to have a total hi p replacement because of progressively worsening pain in the left hip .\\nHer pain was 8/10 .\\nShe limped .\\nShe did not use a cane .\\nShe did require a bannister going up and down stairs .\\nShe had trouble doing shoes and socks .\\nShe could walk limited distances .\\nSince seen by Dr. Overall in August , she had had a brain aneurysm .\\nShe had a mastectomy and had recently developed Parkinson 's.\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\n1. Breast cancer in the right breast , diagnosed in 1995 with negative nodes , treated with excision , recurrence in June , 2001 , further reconstructive surgery .\\nAt the same time , she underwent reduction of t he left breast .\\n2. History of bipolar disorder , for which she sees Dr. Lettefriscbreun .\\nShe indicates this is stable at this time .\\n3. History of chronic anxiety .\\n4. Sleep apnea treated with UPP surgery in 1997 .\\nShe does not use CPAP .\\n5. History of diverticulitis .\\n6. Intermittent migraines .\\n7. History of prior cervical dysplasia , treated with LEEP procedure .\\n8. Osteoporosis .\\n9. Obsessive-compulsive disorder .\\n10. Panic disorder .\\n11. Aneurysm of the right internal auditory canal , treated with coil insertion .\\n12. Prior renal surgery .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\n1. Eskalith , 300 mg. twice at bedtime .\\n2. Femara , 2.5 mg. at bedtime .\\n3. Primidone , 50 mg. PO q.h.s.\\n4. Diazepam , 1 mg. PO q.h.s.\\n5. Paxil , 37.5 mg. q.a.m.\\n6. Synthroid , 100 mcg. q.a.m.\\n7. Ditropan XL , 10 mg.\\n8. Imodium , 2 mg. q.a.m.\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nExamination reveals that the patient is walking with a mild limp .\\nThe left hip is a bit stiff with flexion to 90 degrees .\\nShe has 10 degrees of internal rotation and external rotation .\\nPulses are fine .\\nIMAGING :\\nX-rays were reviewed .\\nThey showed advanced arthritis of the left hip .\\nRECOMMENDATIONS :\\nDr. Etteme Overall recommended that the patient have a total hip replacement on the left side on February 2 , 2003 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nPlease refer to the operative note by Dr. Etteme Overall for details of the procedure .\\nPostoperatively , the patient was transferred to the floor in stable condition for observation , pain control and mobilization .\\nInitially postoperatively , she was doing quite well , though she did require four liters of oxygen postoperatively to maintain her oxygen saturations .\\nIt was hoped that she would wean off the oxygen over the course of the next few hours .\\nHowever , she did require four liters of oxygen all the way through the night to maintain oxygen saturations of 93% .\\nWithout oxygen , she dropped down to the low 80s .\\nGiven the unusual nature of this oxygen requirement , the patient underwent work-up with a chest X-ray , which essentially was normal .\\nAn ABG revealed a normal PCO2 of 32 , but a decrease in PO2- at 62 .\\nTherefore , given her history of breast cancer , the patient was taken for a spiral CT scan and the Medicine Service was consulted at that time .\\nThey agreed with our plan .\\nOn spiral CT scan , a small pulmonary embolus was seen in the right upper lobe and the left low er lobe .\\nShe was started on heparin at that time to maintain a PTT of 60 t o 80 , and was given doses of Coumadin , in addition to the Coumadin she had been given for DVT prophylaxis .\\nWith the recommendation of the medicine te am , we decided to maintain an INR of 2 to 3 with an overlap of heparin when the patient was therapeutic for two to three days .\\nShe continued to do quite well even though we did keep her on bed rest for three days while she was heparinized .\\nHer oxygen saturations continued to improve to the point that she was on room air on postoperative day four with oxygen saturation of 95% .\\nShe was given perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis for 48 hours after surgery .\\nShe was mobilized on postoperative day four , getting out of bed , able to do quite well on her new hip with a minimal amount of pain .\\nShe was given posterior hip dislocation precautions at that time , which she understood quite well .\\nShe continued to be followed by the medical team and was watched very closely by the orthopedic team until we felt comfortable that she was breathing quite well and was mobilizing well with physical therapy .\\nTherefore , it was decided at that time that the patient was ready for discharge to rehabilitation on Coumadin , which would be monitored for six months to maintain an INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nThe patient will continue all of her pre-admission medications , though no nonsteroidal analgesics , e.g. , aspirin or ibuprofen , will be given while she is on Coumadin therapy .\\n1. Colace , 100 mg. PO t.i.d.\\n2. Percocet , one to two tablets PO q.3 to 4 hours p.r.n. pain .\\n3. Coumadin with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nPlease prescribe 2 mg. tablets .\\nThe patient will be on Coumadin for six months given her history of pulmonary embolus .\\nDISCHARGE PLAN :\\nCoumadin for six months postoperatively with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nCheck INR three times a week until stable .\\nPlease call the results to Dr. Viennee Ester , the patient 's primary-care physician , who has agreed to follow her INR levels for the remainder of the six months .\\nDr. Viennee Ester is located in Tlandcousti Lo Vuclark , where the patient is from originally .\\nThe patient will call Dr. Overall 's office to arrange a follow-up appointment six weeks from the day of surgery .\\nStaples can be removed 10 to 14 days postoperatively .\\nPlease hold removal if the wound is draining .\\nThe patient may shower once the incision is dry , and may bathe and / or swim after the staples have been removed and there is no wound drainage .\\nPartial weight-bearing with crutches or a walker with posterior hip dislocation precautions for three months following surgery .\\nThese precautions have been explained and demonstrated to the patient .\\nThe patient has been instructed to call Dr. Overall 's office or the orthopedist on call with any questions or concerns about increasing pain , swelling , redness , wound drainage , fevers or chills at 094-897-3231 .\\nKEMA ESTER ,\\nMD DICTATING FOR :\\nElectronically Signed ETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D. 02/22/2003 07:01\\n_____________________________ ETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D.\\nTR :\\npe\\nDD :\\n02/08/2003\\nTD :\\n02/08/2003 6:34 P 737058\\ncc :\\nETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D. ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY ALLMID HEALTH CENTER KEMA ESTER , MILD VIENNEE C.

initially diagnosed in 1978 with atypical small cell carcinoma of the lung and treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy until 1980 .\\nShe did well for approximately twelve years until she was diagnosed with carcinoid cancer of the same right upper lobe .\\nThis may have been the initial primary cancer although it is unclear at present .\\nBronchoscopy at that time showed an endobronchial tumor of the right upper lobe bronchus and it was felt to be unresectable .\\nShe underwent four treatments of brachytherapy in March through May of 1993 .\\nShe had been doing reasonably well until December of 1993 when she presented with persistent and worsening cough and near strangulation on attempts at eating solids or drinking liquids .\\nA bronchoscopy showed a tracheoesophageal fistula with an opening into the trachea above the carina and no tumor in the right upper lobe .\\nShe has been on total parenteral nutrition and has been nothing by mouth since then .\\nA barium swallow

patient was admitted on February 5 , 1994 and had a central venous line placed in her right subclavian .\\nThe patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 6 , 1994 where she underwent rigid and flexible bronchoscopy and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy .\\nFindings included necrotic debris in the distal trachea at the carina and right mainstem bronchus .\\nEsophageal mucosa was visible through the trachea .\\nHer steroids were weaned and the patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 10 , 1994 where she underwent once again flexible bronchoscopy and flexible esophagoscopy , as well as rigid bronchoscopy .\\nShe then had a transhiatal esophagectomy which was partial , and a substernal gastric interposition as well as a jejunostomy .\\nThe pathology report suggested that the area was involved with radiation esophagitis and focal ulceration .\\nShe remained ventilator dependent postoperatively and was taken to the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit .\\nThe patient was maintained on triple antibiotics which included Vancomycin , ceftazidime and Gentamicin .\\nOn postoperative day two , she had an electroencephalogram which showed no evidence of seizure activity but

follow up , being treated for hypertension .\\nIn the end of 1992 , she was feeling well and was taken off Isordil .\\nDuring the winter and early parts of 1993 , the patient noticed increasing fatigue , symptoms of breathlessness and recurrent substernal chest pressure which finally led to admission to Xas Tupalmsmodral Hospital on 11-11-93 with documentation of a subendocardial myocardial infarction and a blood pressure of 210/108 .\\nCardiac catheterization towards the end of the hospitalization showed recurrent right coronary artery stenosis proximally and high grade new stenosis in the distal circumflex at the area of the origin of the previously untreated low circumflex marginal vessel .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\nMedications on transfer were Ecotrin , Vasotec 5 mg , Lopressor 25 bid , Isordil 20 tid , Procardia XL once per day , and Lasix 20 q3 days .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nOn physical examination , the blood pressure was 150 , heart rate 70 , bilateral carotid bruits , grade II systolic ejection murmur , good femoral pulses without bruits , good dorsalis pedis pulses with no posterior tibial pulses felt .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nThe electrocardiogram revealed left bundle branch block .\\nThe electrolytes were normal .\\nThe admission hematocrit was 34 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nOn 12-6-93 , angioplasty was performed of the right coronary artery using a 3 mm solo balloon reducing the stenosis from 80 to approximately 20% with a faint diagonal lucency which was not obstructive .\\nThe new distal circumflex lesion was dilated with a 2.0 mm balloon with a good result and minimal persistent stenosis .\\nBut the low circumflex marginal could not be entered with a wire .\\nThe first marginal had a 505 stenosis at its origin , which was not attempted .\\nThe patient did well post procedure .\\nHe developed a grape sized hematoma over the femoral artery with a loud bruit .\\nThe ultrasound on the day of discharge showed no evidence of pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula .\\nThe blood pressure was 150-170 systolic .\\nThe patient was ambulating without symptoms .\\nADDENDUM :\\nThe admission hematocrit was 34 .\\nThis fell to 25 after the cardiac catheterization without evidence of bleeding and rose to 29 by the time of discharge .\\nDOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :\\nShe was discharged with advice by Cardiac Rehabilitation for gradually increasing activity .\\nShe will be followed by her physician at Cean , Dr. Dieseld Pollejesc , for further pressure management and follow up of the femoral hematoma .\\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE :\\nStable , resolving anemia .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nEcotrin 160 mg per day , Vasotec 5 mg per day , Lopressor 25 bid , Isordil 20 tid , Procardia XL 30 per day , Lasix 20 mg q3 days

Colace , 100 mg. PO t.i.d.\\n2. Percocet , one to two tablets PO q.3 to 4 hours p.r.n. pain .\\n3. Coumadin with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nPlease prescribe 2 mg. tablets .\\nThe patient will be on Coumadin for six months given her history of pulmonary embolus .\\nDISCHARGE PLAN :\\nCoumadin for six months postoperatively with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nCheck INR three times a week until stable .\\nPlease call the results to Dr. Viennee Ester , the patient 's primary-care physician , who has agreed to follow her INR levels for the remainder of the six months .\\nDr. Viennee Ester is located in Tlandcousti Lo Vuclark , where the patient is from originally .\\nThe patient will call Dr. Overall 's office to arrange a follow-up appointment six weeks from the day of surgery .\\nStaples can be removed 10 to 14 days postoperatively .\\nPlease hold removal if the wound is draining .\\nThe patient may shower once the incision is dry , and may bathe and / or swim after the staples have been removed and there is no wound drainage .\\nPartial weight-bearing with crutches or a walker with posterior hip dislocation precautions for three months following surgery .\\nThese precautions have been explained and demonstrated to the patient .\\nThe patient has been instructed to call Dr. Overall 's office or the orthopedist on call with any questions or concerns about increasing pain , swelling , redness , wound drainage , fevers or chills at 094-897-3231 .\\nKEMA ESTER ,\\nMD DICTATING FOR :\\nElectronically Signed ETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D. 02/22/2003 07:01\\n_____________________________ ETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D.\\nTR :\\npe\\nDD :\\n02/08/2003\\nTD :\\n02/08/2003 6:34 P 737058\\ncc :\\nETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D. ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY ALLMID HEALTH CENTER KEMA ESTER , MILD VIENNEE C.

initially diagnosed in 1978 with atypical small cell carcinoma of the lung and treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy until 1980 .\\nShe did well for approximately twelve years until she was diagnosed with carcinoid cancer of the same right upper lobe .\\nThis may have been the initial primary cancer although it is unclear at present .\\nBronchoscopy at that time showed an endobronchial tumor of the right upper lobe bronchus and it was felt to be unresectable .\\nShe underwent four treatments of brachytherapy in March through May of 1993 .\\nShe had been doing reasonably well until December of 1993 when she presented with persistent and worsening cough and near strangulation on attempts at eating solids or drinking liquids .\\nA bronchoscopy showed a tracheoesophageal fistula with an opening into the trachea above the carina and no tumor in the right upper lobe .\\nShe has been on total parenteral nutrition and has been nothing by mouth since then .\\nA barium swallow

abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended .\\nExtremities :\\nno clubbing , cyanosis or edema .\\nThe rectal examination is guaiac negative with a minimal amount of stool .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was admitted on February 5 , 1994 and had a central venous line placed in her right subclavian .\\nThe patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 6 , 1994 where she underwent rigid and flexible bronchoscopy and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy .\\nFindings included necrotic debris in the distal trachea at the carina and right mainstem bronchus .\\nEsophageal mucosa was visible through the trachea .\\nHer steroids were weaned and the patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 10 , 1994 where she underwent once again flexible bronchoscopy and flexible esophagoscopy , as well as rigid bronchoscopy .\\nShe then had a transhiatal esophagectomy which was partial , and a substernal gastric interposition as well as a jejunostomy .\\nThe pathology report suggested that the area was involved with radiation esophagitis and focal ulceration .\\nShe remained ventilator dependent postoperatively and was taken to the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit .\\nThe patient was maintained on triple antibiotics which included Vancomycin , ceftazidime and Gentamicin .\\nOn postoperative day two , she had an electroencephalogram which showed no evidence of seizure activity but

postoperative day two which showed clean anastomosis .\\nShe received multiple bronchoscopies for pulmonary toilet .\\nThe patient was maintained on tube feedings and the ventilator .\\nA repeat echocardiogram on February 18 showed no significant change of her previous echocardiogram on February 11 , which showed only a small pericardial effusion .\\nA pelvic and abdominal computerized tomography scan on February 18 also showed no evidence of a focal collection or abscess .\\nShe remained intermittently febrile despite numerous antibiotics .\\nHer chest X-ray showed bilateral air space disease , consistent with pneumonia or adult respiratory distress syndrome .\\nShe suffered an episode of renal failure which was felt attributable to aminoglycoside toxicity .\\nHer steroids

left chest tube .\\nHer sputum then grew out Klebsiella and she was treated with amikacin and imipenem .\\nShe developed a right pleural effusion and had a right chest tube placed .\\nOn March 13 , 1994 , she regained some level of consciousness .\\nShe was able to fix and follow with her eyes , respond to commands .\\nOn March 14 , 1994 , her right lung was pleurodesed .\\nAttempts were made to facilitate her wean by resting her overnight with a combination of propafol and Fentanyl .\\nThis was tried for approximately seven days with no real progress made toward facilitating her vent wean .\\nShe continued to require pressor support in the high 30 's .\\nShe also fell into a coma once again .\\nOn March 31 , 1994 , her pressor support requirement increased and she continued to have tachypneic episodes .\\nOn April 2 , 1994 , she had several episodes of bradycardia and asystole , which responded only to manual ventilation .\\nDiscussions were held with the patient 's family with regard to her previously expressed wishes not to be maintained on artificial life support for extended period of time with little or no hope for recovery .\\nShe had expressed these wishes in writing on several legal forms from the state of Jose Pineston , as well as in discussions with her loved ones .\\nDecision was made in conjunction with the family and Dr. Caslighlourdes to terminate artificial respiratory support .\\nThe patient was removed from the ventilator and placed on a T-piece in her trachea only and was made comfortable with narcotics .\\nHer respirations ceased and she

:\\n12-9-93\\nIDENTIFYING DATA :\\nThis 75 year old female was transferred from Iming Medical Center for angioplasty .\\nPRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :\\nUnstable angina .\\nASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :\\nHypertension .\\nPRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :\\nRight and circumflex angioplasty , cardiac catheterization on 12-6-93 .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThis 75 year old woman was previously admitted here in November 1993 for chronic angina .\\nShe had mild mitral regurgitation and a slightly diminished ejection fraction .\\nThere was a 90% right coronary stenosis which was reduced to 30 with a balloon angioplasty .\\nThere were three lesions in the circumflex , dilated successfully .\\nHowever , the low circumflex marginal vessel could not be crossed with the balloon .\\nShe did well in follow up , being treated for hypertension .\\nIn the end of 1992 , she was feeling well and was taken off Isordil .\\nDuring the winter and early parts of 1993 , the patient noticed increasing fatigue , symptoms of breathlessness and recurrent substernal chest pressure which finally led to admission to Xas Tupalmsmodral Hospital on 11-11-93 with documentation of a subendocardial myocardial infarction and a blood pressure of 210/108 .\\nCardiac catheterization towards the end of the hospitalization showed recurrent right coronary artery stenosis proximally and high grade new stenosis in the distal circumflex at the area of the origin of the previously untreated low circumflex marginal vessel .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\nMedications on transfer were Ecotrin , Vasotec 5 mg , Lopressor 25 bid , Isordil 20 tid , Procardia XL once per day , and Lasix 20 q3 days .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nOn physical examination , the blood pressure was 150 , heart rate 70 , bilateral carotid bruits , grade II systolic ejection murmur , good femoral pulses without bruits , good dorsalis pedis pulses with no posterior tibial pulses felt .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nThe electrocardiogram revealed left bundle branch block .\\nThe electrolytes were normal .\\nThe admission hematocrit was 34 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nOn 12-6-93 , angioplasty was performed of the right coronary artery using a 3 mm solo balloon reducing the stenosis from 80 to approximately 20% with a faint diagonal lucency which was not obstructive .\\nThe new distal circumflex lesion was dilated with a 2.0 mm balloon with a good result and minimal persistent stenosis .\\nBut the low circumflex marginal could not be entered with a wire .\\nThe first marginal had a 505 stenosis at its origin , which was not attempted .\\nThe patient did well post procedure .\\nHe developed a grape sized hematoma over the femoral artery with a loud bruit .\\nThe ultrasound on the day of discharge showed no evidence of pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula .\\nThe blood pressure was 150-170 systolic .\\nThe patient was ambulating without symptoms .\\nADDENDUM :\\nThe admission hematocrit was 34 .\\nThis fell to 25 after the cardiac catheterization without evidence of bleeding and rose to 29 by the time of discharge .\\nDOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :\\nShe was discharged with advice by Cardiac Rehabilitation for gradually increasing activity .\\nShe will be followed by her physician at Cean , Dr. Dieseld Pollejesc , for further pressure management and follow up of the femoral hematoma .\\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE :\\nStable , resolving anemia .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nEcotrin 160 mg per day , Vasotec 5 mg per day , Lopressor 25 bid , Isordil 20 tid , Procardia XL 30 per day , Lasix 20 mg q3 days

on Aug 22 , 2003 , for follow-up .\\nShe was scheduled to have a total hi p replacement because of progressively worsening pain in the left hip .\\nHer pain was 8/10 .\\nShe limped .\\nShe did not use a cane .\\nShe did require a bannister going up and down stairs .\\nShe had trouble doing shoes and socks .\\nShe could walk limited distances .\\nSince seen by Dr. Overall in August , she had had a brain aneurysm .\\nShe had a mastectomy and had recently developed Parkinson 's.\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\n1. Breast cancer in the right breast , diagnosed in 1995 with negative nodes , treated with excision , recurrence in June , 2001 , further reconstructive surgery .\\nAt the same time , she underwent reduction of t he left breast .\\n2. History of bipolar disorder , for which she sees Dr. Lettefriscbreun .\\nShe indicates this is stable at this time .\\n3. History of chronic anxiety .\\n4. Sleep apnea treated with UPP surgery in 1997 .\\nShe does not use CPAP .\\n5. History of diverticulitis .\\n6. Intermittent migraines .\\n7.

Aneurysm of the right internal auditory canal , treated with coil insertion .\\n12. Prior renal surgery .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\n1. Eskalith , 300 mg. twice at bedtime .\\n2. Femara , 2.5 mg. at bedtime .\\n3. Primidone , 50 mg. PO q.h.s.\\n4. Diazepam , 1 mg. PO q.h.s.\\n5. Paxil , 37.5 mg. q.a.m.\\n6. Synthroid , 100 mcg. q.a.m.\\n7. Ditropan XL , 10 mg.\\n8. Imodium , 2 mg. q.a.m.\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nExamination reveals that the patient is walking with a mild limp .\\nThe left hip is a bit stiff with flexion to 90 degrees .\\nShe has 10 degrees of internal rotation and external rotation .\\nPulses are fine .\\nIMAGING :\\nX-rays were reviewed .\\nThey showed advanced arthritis of the left hip .\\nRECOMMENDATIONS :\\nDr. Etteme Overall recommended that the patient have a total hip replacement on the left side on February 2 , 2003 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nPlease refer to the operative note by Dr. Etteme Overall for details of the procedure .\\nPostoperatively , the patient was transferred to the floor in stable condition for observation , pain control and mobilization .\\nInitially postoperatively , she was doing quite well , though she did require four liters of oxygen postoperatively to maintain her oxygen saturations .\\nIt was hoped that she would wean off the oxygen over the course of the next few hours .\\nHowever , she did require four liters of oxygen all the way through the night to maintain oxygen saturations of 93% .\\nWithout oxygen , she dropped down to the low 80s .\\nGiven the unusual nature of this oxygen requirement , the patient underwent work-up with a chest X-ray , which essentially was normal .\\nAn ABG revealed a normal PCO2 of 32 , but a decrease in PO2- at 62 .\\nTherefore , given her history of breast cancer , the patient was taken for a spiral CT scan and the Medicine Service was consulted at that time .\\nThey agreed with our plan .\\nOn spiral CT scan , a small pulmonary embolus was seen in the right upper lobe and the left low er lobe .\\nShe was started on heparin at that time to maintain a PTT of 60 t o 80 , and was given doses of Coumadin , in addition to the Coumadin she had been given for DVT prophylaxis .\\nWith the recommendation of the medicine te am , we decided to maintain an INR of 2 to 3 with an overlap of heparin when the patient was therapeutic for two to three days .\\nShe continued to do quite well even though we did keep her on bed rest for three days while she was heparinized .\\nHer oxygen saturations continued to improve to the point that she was on room air on postoperative day four with oxygen saturation of 95% .\\nShe was given perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis for 48 hours after surgery .\\nShe was mobilized on postoperative day four , getting out of bed , able to do quite well on her new hip with a minimal amount of pain .\\nShe was given posterior hip dislocation precautions at that time , which she understood quite well .\\nShe continued to be followed by the medical team and was watched very closely by the orthopedic team until we felt comfortable that she was breathing quite well and was mobilizing well with physical therapy .\\nTherefore , it was decided at that time that the patient was ready for discharge to rehabilitation on Coumadin , which would be monitored for six months to maintain an INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nThe patient will continue all of her pre-admission medications , though no nonsteroidal analgesics , e.g. , aspirin or ibuprofen , will be given while she is on Coumadin therapy .\\n1. Colace , 100 mg. PO t.i.d.\\n2. Percocet , one to two tablets PO q.3 to 4 hours p.r.n. pain .\\n3. Coumadin with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nPlease prescribe 2 mg. tablets .\\nThe patient will be on Coumadin for six months given her history of pulmonary embolus .\\nDISCHARGE PLAN :\\nCoumadin for six months postoperatively with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nCheck INR three times a week until stable .\\nPlease call the results to Dr. Viennee Ester , the patient 's primary-care physician , who has agreed to follow her INR levels for the remainder of the six months .\\nDr. Viennee Ester is located in Tlandcousti Lo Vuclark , where the patient is from originally .\\nThe patient will call Dr. Overall 's office to arrange a follow-up appointment six weeks from the day of surgery .\\nStaples can be removed 10 to 14 days postoperatively .\\nPlease hold removal if the wound is draining .\\nThe patient may shower once the incision is dry , and may bathe and / or swim after the staples have been removed and there is no wound drainage .\\nPartial weight-bearing with crutches or a walker with posterior hip dislocation precautions for three months following surgery .\\nThese precautions have been explained and demonstrated to the patient .\\nThe patient has been instructed to call Dr. Overall 's office or the orthopedist on call with any questions or concerns about increasing pain , swelling , redness , wound drainage , fevers or chills at 094-897-3231 .\\nKEMA ESTER ,\\nMD DICTATING FOR :\\nElectronically Signed ETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D. 02/22/2003 07:01\\n_____________________________ ETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D.\\nTR :\\npe\\nDD :\\n02/08/2003\\nTD :\\n02/08/2003 6:34 P 737058\\ncc :\\nETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D. ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY ALLMID HEALTH CENTER KEMA ESTER , MILD VIENNEE C.

bronchoscopy , flexible esophagoscopy , rigid bronchoscopy , transhiatal esophagectomy ( partial ) , substernal gastric interposition and jejunostomy .\\nMultiple bronchoscopies , chest tube insertion .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThe patient was a 71 year old white female with a history of carcinoid lung cancer who presented for evaluation of a tracheoesophageal fistula .\\nThe patient was initially diagnosed in 1978 with atypical small cell carcinoma of the lung and treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy until 1980 .\\nShe did well for approximately twelve years until she was diagnosed with carcinoid cancer of the same right upper lobe .\\nThis may have been the initial primary cancer although it is unclear at present .\\nBronchoscopy at that time showed an endobronchial tumor of the right upper lobe bronchus and it was felt to be unresectable .\\nShe underwent four treatments of brachytherapy in March through May of 1993 .\\nShe had been doing reasonably well until December of 1993 when she presented with persistent and worsening cough and near strangulation on attempts at eating solids or drinking liquids .\\nA bronchoscopy showed a tracheoesophageal fistula with an opening into the trachea above the carina and no tumor in the right upper lobe .\\nShe has been on total parenteral nutrition and has been nothing by mouth since then .\\nA barium swallow prior to admission showed the presence of a tracheoesophageal fistula with entrance into the right mainstem bronchus below the carina .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\nBronchitis , asthma , carcinoid cancer , no history of coronary artery disease or cerebrovascular accident .\\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY :\\nThe patient is status post appendectomy , hysterectomy and right salpingo-oophorectomy ,

adenopathy or bruit .\\nThe lungs showed mild inspiratory wheeze and moderate expiratory wheezes .\\nBreath sounds are present bilaterally .\\nCardiovascular exam :\\nregular rate and rhythm .\\nThe abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended .\\nExtremities :\\nno clubbing , cyanosis or edema .\\nThe rectal examination is guaiac negative with a minimal amount of stool .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was admitted on February 5 , 1994 and had a central venous line placed in her right subclavian .\\nThe patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 6 , 1994 where she underwent rigid and flexible bronchoscopy and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy .\\nFindings included necrotic debris in the distal trachea at the carina and right mainstem bronchus .\\nEsophageal mucosa was visible through the trachea .\\nHer steroids were weaned and the patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 10 , 1994 where she underwent once again flexible bronchoscopy and flexible esophagoscopy , as well as rigid bronchoscopy .\\nShe then had a transhiatal esophagectomy which was partial , and a substernal gastric interposition as well as a jejunostomy .\\nThe pathology report suggested that the area was involved with radiation esophagitis and focal ulceration .\\nShe remained ventilator dependent postoperatively and was taken to the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit .\\nThe patient was maintained on triple antibiotics which included Vancomycin , ceftazidime and Gentamicin .\\nOn postoperative day two , she had an electroencephalogram which showed no evidence of seizure activity but some generalized slowing .\\nThe patient was seen in consultation by the Neurology Service for her apparent postoperative encephalopathy and episodes of shaking .\\nAn endoscopy was also performed on postoperative day two which showed clean anastomosis .\\nShe received multiple bronchoscopies for pulmonary toilet .\\nThe patient was maintained on tube feedings and the ventilator .\\nA repeat echocardiogram on February 18 showed no significant change of her previous echocardiogram on February 11 , which showed only a small pericardial effusion .\\nA pelvic and abdominal computerized tomography scan on February 18 also showed no evidence of a focal collection or abscess .\\nShe remained intermittently febrile despite numerous antibiotics .\\nHer chest X-ray showed bilateral air space disease , consistent with pneumonia or adult respiratory distress syndrome .\\nShe suffered an episode of renal failure which was felt attributable to aminoglycoside toxicity .\\nHer steroids were weaned .\\nBecause of her prolonged intubation and inability to wean , on February 24 , 1994 , she had a tracheostomy placed .\\nShe remained in a coma .\\nThe blood cultures on February 26 , 1994 grew out Staphylococcus and she was treated for septicemia .\\nHer sputum grew out Pseudomonas aeruginosa as well .\\nThe urine contained yeast and she was treated with amphotericin .\\nOn March 3 , 1994 , a repeat chest and abdominal and pelvis computerized tomography scan showed no evidence of fluid collections .\\nThere was a large left pleural effusion however .\\nThis was drained with a left chest tube .\\nHer sputum then grew out Klebsiella and she was treated with amikacin and imipenem .\\nShe developed a right pleural effusion and had a right chest tube placed .\\nOn March 13 , 1994 , she regained some level of consciousness .\\nShe was able to fix and follow with her eyes , respond to commands .\\nOn March 14 , 1994 , her right lung was pleurodesed .\\nAttempts were made to facilitate her wean by resting her overnight with a combination of propafol and Fentanyl .\\nThis was tried for approximately seven days with no real progress made toward facilitating her vent wean .\\nShe continued to require pressor support in the high 30 's .\\nShe also fell into a coma once again .\\nOn March 31 , 1994 , her pressor support requirement increased and she continued to have tachypneic episodes .\\nOn April 2 , 1994 , she had several episodes of bradycardia and asystole , which responded only to manual ventilation .\\nDiscussions were held with the patient 's family with regard to her previously expressed wishes not to be maintained on artificial life support for extended period of time with little or no hope for recovery .\\nShe had expressed these wishes in writing on several legal forms from the state of Jose Pineston , as well as in discussions with her loved ones .\\nDecision was made in conjunction with the family and Dr. Caslighlourdes to terminate artificial respiratory support .\\nThe patient was removed from the ventilator and placed on a T-piece in her trachea only and was made comfortable with narcotics .\\nHer respirations ceased and she died at 10:15 a.m. on April 2 , 1994 .\\nDISPOSITION / PLAN ON DISCHARGE :\\nThe family will return the body to Sa for burial .\\nThey have declined a post-mortem examination .\\nCA SHUFF ,

:\\n4-2-94\\nPRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :\\nTracheoesophageal fistula .\\nASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :\\nDiabetes mellitus , pneumonia , sepsis , respiratory failure , pleural effusion , postoperative encephalopathy , postoperative myocardial infarction , and thrombocytopenia .\\nSPECIAL PROCEDURES AND OPERATIONS :\\nFebruary 6 , 1994 , rigid bronchoscopy with biopsy and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy .\\nASSOCIATED PROCEDURES :\\nOn February 10 , 1994 , flexible bronchoscopy , flexible esophagoscopy , rigid bronchoscopy , transhiatal esophagectomy ( partial ) , substernal gastric interposition and jejunostomy .\\nMultiple bronchoscopies , chest tube insertion .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThe patient was a 71 year old white female with a history of carcinoid lung cancer who presented for evaluation of a tracheoesophageal fistula .\\nThe patient was initially diagnosed in 1978 with atypical small cell carcinoma of the lung and treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy until 1980 .\\nShe did well for approximately twelve years until she was diagnosed with carcinoid cancer of the same right upper lobe .\\nThis may have been the initial primary cancer although it is unclear at present .\\nBronchoscopy at that time showed an endobronchial tumor of the right upper lobe bronchus and it was felt to be unresectable .\\nShe underwent four treatments of brachytherapy in March through May of 1993 .\\nShe had been doing reasonably well until December of 1993 when she presented with persistent and worsening cough and near strangulation on attempts at eating solids or drinking liquids .\\nA bronchoscopy showed a tracheoesophageal fistula with an opening into the trachea above the carina and no tumor in the right upper lobe .\\nShe has been on total parenteral nutrition and has been nothing by mouth since then .\\nA barium swallow prior to admission showed the presence of a tracheoesophageal fistula with entrance into the right mainstem bronchus below the carina .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\nBronchitis , asthma , carcinoid cancer , no history of coronary artery disease or cerebrovascular accident .\\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY :\\nThe patient is status post appendectomy , hysterectomy and right salpingo-oophorectomy , bladder suspension and a tumor removal from the right neck .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\nCefuroxime 1.5 grams intravenously q8h , Solu-Medrol 62.5 mg intravenously q8h , Ventolin metered dose inhaler , 2 puffs PO q.i.d. , Pepcid 20 mg intravenously b.i.d.\\nALLERGIES :\\nThe patient is allergic to penicillin , morphine , codeine .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nThe patient is a pleasant white female in no acute distress .\\nShe is afebrile with stable vital signs .\\nThe head , eyes , ears , nose , throat examination was unremarkable .\\nNeck shows a well healed low collar incision without adenopathy or bruit .\\nThe lungs showed mild inspiratory wheeze and moderate expiratory wheezes .\\nBreath sounds are present bilaterally .\\nCardiovascular exam :\\nregular rate and rhythm .\\nThe abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended .\\nExtremities :\\nno clubbing , cyanosis or edema .\\nThe rectal examination is guaiac negative with a minimal amount of stool .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was admitted on February 5 , 1994 and had a central venous line placed in her right subclavian .\\nThe patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 6 , 1994 where she underwent rigid and flexible bronchoscopy and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy .\\nFindings included necrotic debris in the distal trachea at the carina and right mainstem bronchus .\\nEsophageal mucosa was visible through the trachea .\\nHer steroids were weaned and the patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 10 , 1994 where she underwent once again flexible bronchoscopy and flexible esophagoscopy , as well as rigid bronchoscopy .\\nShe then had a transhiatal esophagectomy which was partial , and a substernal gastric interposition as well as a jejunostomy .\\nThe pathology report suggested that the area was involved with radiation esophagitis and focal ulceration .\\nShe remained ventilator dependent postoperatively and was taken to the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit .\\nThe patient was maintained on triple antibiotics which included Vancomycin , ceftazidime and Gentamicin .\\nOn postoperative day two , she had an electroencephalogram which showed no evidence of seizure activity but some generalized slowing .\\nThe patient was seen in consultation by the Neurology Service for her apparent postoperative encephalopathy and episodes of shaking .\\nAn endoscopy was also performed on postoperative day two which showed clean anastomosis .\\nShe received multiple bronchoscopies for pulmonary toilet .\\nThe patient was maintained on tube feedings and the ventilator .\\nA repeat echocardiogram on February 18 showed no significant change of her previous echocardiogram on February 11 , which showed only a small pericardial effusion .\\nA pelvic and abdominal computerized tomography scan on February 18 also showed no evidence of a focal collection or abscess .\\nShe remained intermittently febrile despite numerous antibiotics .\\nHer chest X-ray showed bilateral air space disease , consistent with pneumonia or adult respiratory distress syndrome .\\nShe suffered an episode of renal failure which was felt attributable to aminoglycoside toxicity .\\nHer steroids were weaned .\\nBecause of her prolonged intubation and inability to wean , on February 24 , 1994 , she had a tracheostomy placed .\\nShe remained in a coma .\\nThe blood cultures on February 26 , 1994 grew out Staphylococcus and she was treated for septicemia .\\nHer sputum grew out Pseudomonas aeruginosa as well .\\nThe urine contained yeast and she was treated with amphotericin .\\nOn March 3 , 1994 , a repeat chest and abdominal and pelvis computerized tomography scan showed no evidence of fluid collections .\\nThere was a large left pleural effusion however .\\nThis was drained with a left chest tube .\\nHer sputum then grew out Klebsiella and she was treated with amikacin and imipenem .\\nShe developed a right pleural effusion and had a right chest tube placed .\\nOn March 13 , 1994 , she regained some level of consciousness .\\nShe was able to fix and follow with her eyes , respond to commands .\\nOn March 14 , 1994 , her right lung was pleurodesed .\\nAttempts were made to facilitate her wean by resting her overnight with a combination of propafol and Fentanyl .\\nThis was tried for approximately seven days with no real progress made toward facilitating her vent wean .\\nShe continued to require pressor support in the high 30 's .\\nShe also fell into a coma once again .\\nOn March 31 , 1994 , her pressor support requirement increased and she continued to have tachypneic episodes .\\nOn April 2 , 1994 , she had several episodes of bradycardia and asystole , which responded only to manual ventilation .\\nDiscussions were held with the patient 's family with regard to her previously expressed wishes not to be maintained on artificial life support for extended period of time with little or no hope for recovery .\\nShe had expressed these wishes in writing on several legal forms from the state of Jose Pineston , as well as in discussions with her loved ones .\\nDecision was made in conjunction with the family and Dr. Caslighlourdes to terminate artificial respiratory support .\\nThe patient was removed from the ventilator and placed on a T-piece in her trachea only and was made comfortable with narcotics .\\nHer respirations ceased and she died at 10:15 a.m. on April 2 , 1994 .\\nDISPOSITION / PLAN ON DISCHARGE :\\nThe family will return the body to Sa for burial .\\nThey have declined a post-mortem examination .\\nCA SHUFF , M.D.\\nDICTATING FOR :\\nRIEMIND CASLIGHLOURDES , M.D.\\nTR :\\nyu / bmot\\nDD :\\n4-2-94\\nTD

Medical Center for angioplasty .\\nPRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :\\nUnstable angina .\\nASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :\\nHypertension .\\nPRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :\\nRight and circumflex angioplasty , cardiac catheterization on 12-6-93 .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThis 75 year old woman was previously admitted here in November 1993 for chronic angina .\\nShe had mild mitral regurgitation and a slightly diminished ejection fraction .\\nThere was a 90% right coronary stenosis which was reduced to 30 with a balloon angioplasty .\\nThere were three lesions in the circumflex , dilated successfully .\\nHowever , the low circumflex marginal vessel could not be crossed with the balloon .\\nShe did well in follow up , being treated for hypertension .\\nIn the end of 1992 , she was feeling well and was taken off Isordil .\\nDuring the winter and early parts of 1993 , the patient noticed increasing fatigue , symptoms of breathlessness and recurrent substernal chest pressure which finally led to admission to Xas Tupalmsmodral Hospital on 11-11-93 with documentation of a subendocardial myocardial infarction and a blood pressure of 210/108 .\\nCardiac catheterization towards the end of the hospitalization showed recurrent right coronary artery stenosis proximally and high grade new stenosis in the distal circumflex at the area of the origin of the previously untreated low circumflex marginal vessel .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\nMedications on transfer were Ecotrin , Vasotec 5 mg , Lopressor 25 bid , Isordil 20 tid , Procardia XL once per day , and Lasix 20 q3 days .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nOn physical examination , the blood pressure was 150 , heart rate 70 , bilateral carotid bruits , grade II systolic ejection murmur , good femoral pulses without bruits , good dorsalis pedis pulses with no posterior tibial pulses felt .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nThe electrocardiogram revealed left bundle branch block .\\nThe electrolytes were normal .\\nThe admission hematocrit was 34 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nOn 12-6-93 , angioplasty was performed of the right coronary artery using a 3 mm solo balloon reducing the stenosis from 80 to approximately 20% with a faint diagonal lucency which was not obstructive .\\nThe new distal circumflex lesion was dilated with a 2.0 mm balloon with a good result and minimal persistent stenosis .\\nBut the low circumflex marginal could not be entered with a wire .\\nThe first marginal had a 505 stenosis at its origin , which was not attempted .\\nThe patient did well post procedure .\\nHe developed a grape sized hematoma over the femoral artery with a loud bruit .\\nThe ultrasound on the day of discharge showed no evidence of pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula .\\nThe blood pressure was 150-170 systolic .\\nThe patient was ambulating without symptoms .\\nADDENDUM :\\nThe admission hematocrit was 34 .\\nThis fell to 25 after the cardiac catheterization without evidence of bleeding and rose to 29 by the time of discharge .\\nDOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :\\nShe was discharged with advice by Cardiac Rehabilitation for gradually increasing activity .\\nShe will be followed by her physician at Cean , Dr. Dieseld Pollejesc , for further pressure management and follow up of the femoral hematoma .\\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE :\\nStable , resolving anemia .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nEcotrin 160 mg per day , Vasotec 5 mg per day , Lopressor 25 bid , Isordil 20 tid , Procardia XL 30 per day , Lasix 20 mg q3 days .\\nTELSHEY STUDY , M.D.\\nTR :\\nah / BMot\\nDD :\\n12-9-93\\nTD :\\n12/11/93\\nCC :\\nDr. Telshey Study

was seen by Dr. Overall in the office on Aug 22 , 2003 , for follow-up .\\nShe was scheduled to have a total hi p replacement because of progressively worsening pain in the left hip .\\nHer pain was 8/10 .\\nShe limped .\\nShe did not use a cane .\\nShe did require a bannister going up and down stairs .\\nShe had trouble doing shoes and socks .\\nShe could walk limited distances .\\nSince seen by Dr. Overall in August , she had had a brain aneurysm .\\nShe had a mastectomy and had recently developed Parkinson 's.\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\n1. Breast cancer in the right breast , diagnosed in 1995 with negative nodes , treated with excision , recurrence in June , 2001 , further reconstructive surgery .\\nAt the same time , she underwent reduction of t he left breast .\\n2. History of bipolar disorder , for which she sees Dr. Lettefriscbreun .\\nShe indicates this is stable at this time .\\n3. History of chronic anxiety .\\n4. Sleep apnea treated with UPP surgery in 1997 .\\nShe does not use CPAP .\\n5. History of diverticulitis .\\n6. Intermittent migraines .\\n7. History of prior cervical dysplasia , treated with LEEP procedure .\\n8. Osteoporosis .\\n9. Obsessive-compulsive disorder .\\n10. Panic disorder .\\n11. Aneurysm of the right internal auditory canal , treated with coil insertion .\\n12. Prior renal surgery .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\n1. Eskalith , 300 mg. twice at bedtime .\\n2. Femara , 2.5 mg. at bedtime .\\n3. Primidone , 50 mg. PO q.h.s.\\n4. Diazepam , 1 mg. PO q.h.s.\\n5. Paxil , 37.5 mg. q.a.m.\\n6. Synthroid , 100 mcg. q.a.m.\\n7. Ditropan XL , 10 mg.\\n8. Imodium , 2 mg. q.a.m.\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nExamination reveals that the patient is walking with a mild limp .\\nThe left hip is a bit stiff with flexion to 90 degrees .\\nShe has 10 degrees of internal rotation and external rotation .\\nPulses are fine .\\nIMAGING :\\nX-rays were reviewed .\\nThey showed advanced arthritis of the left hip .\\nRECOMMENDATIONS :\\nDr. Etteme Overall recommended that the patient have a total hip replacement on the left side on February 2 , 2003 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nPlease refer to the operative note by Dr. Etteme Overall for details of the procedure .\\nPostoperatively , the patient was transferred to the floor in stable condition for observation , pain control and mobilization .\\nInitially postoperatively , she was doing quite well , though she did require four liters of oxygen postoperatively to maintain her oxygen saturations .\\nIt was hoped that she would wean off the oxygen over the course of the next few hours .\\nHowever , she did require four liters of oxygen all the way through the night to maintain oxygen saturations of 93% .\\nWithout oxygen , she dropped down to the low 80s .\\nGiven the unusual nature of this oxygen requirement , the patient underwent work-up with a chest X-ray , which essentially was normal .\\nAn ABG revealed a normal PCO2 of 32 , but a decrease in PO2- at 62 .\\nTherefore , given her history of breast cancer , the patient was taken for a spiral CT scan and the Medicine Service was consulted at that time .\\nThey agreed with our plan .\\nOn spiral CT scan , a small pulmonary embolus was seen in the right upper lobe and the left low er lobe .\\nShe was started on heparin at that time to maintain a PTT of 60 t o 80 , and was given doses of Coumadin , in addition to the Coumadin she had been given for DVT prophylaxis .\\nWith the recommendation of the medicine te am , we decided to maintain an INR of 2 to 3 with an overlap of heparin when the patient was therapeutic for two to three days .\\nShe continued to do quite well even though we did keep her on bed rest for three days while she was heparinized .\\nHer oxygen saturations continued to improve to the point that she was on room air on postoperative day four with oxygen saturation of 95% .\\nShe was given perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis for 48 hours after surgery .\\nShe was mobilized on postoperative day four , getting out of bed , able to do quite well on her new hip with a minimal amount of pain .\\nShe was given posterior hip dislocation precautions at that time , which she understood quite well .\\nShe continued to be followed by the medical team and was watched very closely by the orthopedic team until we felt comfortable that she was breathing quite well and was mobilizing well with physical therapy .\\nTherefore , it was decided at that time that the patient was ready for discharge to rehabilitation on Coumadin , which would be monitored for six months to maintain an INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nThe patient will continue all of her pre-admission medications , though no nonsteroidal analgesics , e.g. , aspirin or ibuprofen , will be given while she is on Coumadin therapy .\\n1. Colace , 100 mg. PO t.i.d.\\n2. Percocet , one to two tablets PO q.3 to 4 hours p.r.n. pain .\\n3. Coumadin with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nPlease prescribe 2 mg. tablets .\\nThe patient will be on Coumadin for six months given her history of pulmonary embolus .\\nDISCHARGE PLAN :\\nCoumadin for six months postoperatively with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nCheck INR three times a week until stable .\\nPlease call the results to Dr. Viennee Ester , the patient 's primary-care physician , who has agreed to follow her INR levels for the remainder of the six months .\\nDr. Viennee Ester is located in Tlandcousti Lo Vuclark , where the patient is from originally .\\nThe patient will call Dr. Overall 's office to arrange a follow-up appointment six weeks from the day of surgery .\\nStaples can be removed 10 to 14 days postoperatively .\\nPlease hold removal if the wound is draining .\\nThe patient may shower once the incision is dry , and may bathe and / or swim after the staples have been removed and there is no wound drainage .\\nPartial weight-bearing with crutches or a walker with posterior hip dislocation precautions for three months following surgery .\\nThese precautions have been explained and demonstrated to the patient .\\nThe patient has been instructed to call Dr. Overall 's office or the orthopedist on call with any questions or concerns about increasing pain , swelling , redness , wound drainage , fevers or chills at 094-897-3231 .\\nKEMA ESTER ,\\nMD DICTATING FOR :\\nElectronically Signed ETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D. 02/22/2003 07:01\\n_____________________________ ETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D.\\nTR :\\npe\\nDD :\\n02/08/2003\\nTD :\\n02/08/2003 6:34 P 737058\\ncc :\\nETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D. ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY ALLMID HEALTH CENTER KEMA ESTER , MILD VIENNEE C.

initially diagnosed in 1978 with atypical small cell carcinoma of the lung and treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy until 1980 .\\nShe did well for approximately twelve years until she was diagnosed with carcinoid cancer of the same right upper lobe .\\nThis may have been the initial primary cancer although it is unclear at present .\\nBronchoscopy at that time showed an endobronchial tumor of the right upper lobe bronchus and it was felt to be unresectable .\\nShe underwent four treatments of brachytherapy in March through May of 1993 .\\nShe had been doing reasonably well until December of 1993 when she presented with persistent and worsening cough and near strangulation on attempts at eating solids or drinking liquids .\\nA bronchoscopy showed a tracheoesophageal fistula with an opening into the trachea above the carina and no tumor in the right upper lobe .\\nShe has been on total parenteral nutrition and has been nothing by mouth since then .\\nA barium swallow

patient was admitted on February 5 , 1994 and had a central venous line placed in her right subclavian .\\nThe patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 6 , 1994 where she underwent rigid and flexible bronchoscopy and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy .\\nFindings included necrotic debris in the distal trachea at the carina and right mainstem bronchus .\\nEsophageal mucosa was visible through the trachea .\\nHer steroids were weaned and the patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 10 , 1994 where she underwent once again flexible bronchoscopy and flexible esophagoscopy , as well as rigid bronchoscopy .\\nShe then had a transhiatal esophagectomy which was partial , and a substernal gastric interposition as well as a jejunostomy .\\nThe pathology report suggested that the area was involved with radiation esophagitis and focal ulceration .\\nShe remained ventilator dependent postoperatively and was taken to the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit .\\nThe patient was maintained on triple antibiotics which included Vancomycin , ceftazidime and Gentamicin .\\nOn postoperative day two , she had an electroencephalogram which showed no evidence of seizure activity but

Medical Center for angioplasty .\\nPRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :\\nUnstable angina .\\nASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :\\nHypertension .\\nPRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :\\nRight and circumflex angioplasty , cardiac catheterization on 12-6-93 .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThis 75 year old woman was previously admitted here in November 1993 for chronic angina .\\nShe had mild mitral regurgitation and a slightly diminished ejection fraction .\\nThere was a 90% right coronary stenosis which was reduced to 30 with a balloon angioplasty .\\nThere were three lesions in the circumflex , dilated successfully .\\nHowever , the low circumflex marginal vessel could not be crossed with the balloon .\\nShe did well in follow up , being treated for hypertension .\\nIn the end of 1992 , she was feeling well and was taken off Isordil .\\nDuring the winter and early parts of 1993 , the patient noticed increasing fatigue , symptoms of breathlessness and recurrent substernal chest pressure which finally led to admission to Xas Tupalmsmodral Hospital on 11-11-93 with documentation of a subendocardial myocardial infarction and a blood pressure of 210/108 .\\nCardiac catheterization towards the end of the hospitalization showed recurrent right coronary artery stenosis proximally and high grade new stenosis in the distal circumflex at the area of the origin of the previously untreated low circumflex marginal vessel .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\nMedications on transfer were Ecotrin , Vasotec 5 mg , Lopressor 25 bid , Isordil 20 tid , Procardia XL once per day , and Lasix 20 q3 days .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nOn physical examination , the blood pressure was 150 , heart rate 70 , bilateral carotid bruits , grade II systolic ejection murmur , good femoral pulses without bruits , good dorsalis pedis pulses with no posterior tibial pulses felt .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nThe electrocardiogram revealed left bundle branch block .\\nThe electrolytes were normal .\\nThe admission hematocrit was 34 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nOn 12-6-93 , angioplasty was performed of the right coronary artery using a 3 mm solo balloon reducing the stenosis from 80 to approximately 20% with a faint diagonal lucency which was not obstructive .\\nThe new distal circumflex lesion was dilated with a 2.0 mm balloon with a good result and minimal persistent stenosis .\\nBut the low circumflex marginal could not be entered with a wire .\\nThe first marginal had a 505 stenosis at its origin , which was not attempted .\\nThe patient did well post procedure .\\nHe developed a grape sized hematoma over the femoral artery with a loud bruit .\\nThe ultrasound on the day of discharge showed no evidence of pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula .\\nThe blood pressure was 150-170 systolic .\\nThe patient was ambulating without symptoms .\\nADDENDUM :\\nThe admission hematocrit was 34 .\\nThis fell to 25 after the cardiac catheterization without evidence of bleeding and rose to 29 by the time of discharge .\\nDOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :\\nShe was discharged with advice by Cardiac Rehabilitation for gradually increasing activity .\\nShe will be followed by her physician at Cean , Dr. Dieseld Pollejesc , for further pressure management and follow up of the femoral hematoma .\\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE :\\nStable , resolving anemia .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nEcotrin 160 mg per day , Vasotec 5 mg

Imodium , 2 mg. q.a.m.\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nExamination reveals that the patient is walking with a mild limp .\\nThe left hip is a bit stiff with flexion to 90 degrees .\\nShe has 10 degrees of internal rotation and external rotation .\\nPulses are fine .\\nIMAGING :\\nX-rays were reviewed .\\nThey showed advanced arthritis of the left hip .\\nRECOMMENDATIONS :\\nDr. Etteme Overall recommended that the patient have a total hip replacement on the left side on February 2 , 2003 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nPlease refer to the operative note by Dr. Etteme Overall for details of the procedure .\\nPostoperatively , the patient was transferred to the floor in stable condition for observation , pain control and mobilization .\\nInitially postoperatively , she was doing quite well , though she did require four liters of oxygen postoperatively to maintain her oxygen saturations .\\nIt was hoped that she would wean off the oxygen over the course of the next few hours .\\nHowever , she did require four liters of oxygen all the way through the night to maintain oxygen saturations of 93% .\\nWithout oxygen , she dropped down to the low 80s .\\nGiven the unusual nature of this oxygen requirement , the patient underwent work-up with a chest X-ray , which essentially was normal .\\nAn ABG revealed a normal PCO2 of 32 , but a decrease in PO2- at 62 .\\nTherefore , given her history of breast cancer , the patient was taken for a spiral CT scan and the Medicine Service was consulted at that time .\\nThey agreed with our plan .\\nOn spiral CT scan , a small pulmonary embolus was seen in the right upper lobe and the left low er lobe .\\nShe was started on heparin at that time to maintain a PTT of 60 t o 80 , and was given doses of Coumadin , in addition to the Coumadin she had been given for DVT prophylaxis .\\nWith the recommendation of the medicine te am , we decided to maintain an INR of 2 to 3 with an overlap of heparin when the patient was therapeutic for two to three days .\\nShe continued to do quite well even though we did keep her on bed rest for three days while she was heparinized .\\nHer oxygen saturations continued to improve to the point that she was on room air on postoperative day four with oxygen saturation of 95% .\\nShe was given perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis for 48 hours after surgery .\\nShe was mobilized on postoperative day four , getting out of bed , able to do quite well on her new hip with a minimal amount of pain .\\nShe was given posterior hip dislocation precautions at that time , which she understood quite well .\\nShe continued to be followed by the medical team and was watched very closely by the orthopedic team until we felt comfortable that she was breathing quite well and was mobilizing well with physical therapy .\\nTherefore , it was decided at that time that the patient was ready for discharge to rehabilitation on Coumadin , which would be monitored for six months to maintain an INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nThe patient will continue all of her pre-admission medications , though no nonsteroidal analgesics , e.g. , aspirin or ibuprofen , will be given while she is on Coumadin therapy .\\n1. Colace , 100 mg. PO t.i.d.\\n2. Percocet , one to two tablets PO q.3 to 4 hours p.r.n. pain .\\n3. Coumadin with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nPlease prescribe 2 mg. tablets .\\nThe patient will be on Coumadin for six months given her history of pulmonary embolus .\\nDISCHARGE PLAN :\\nCoumadin for six months postoperatively with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nCheck INR three times a week until stable .\\nPlease call the results to Dr. Viennee Ester , the patient 's primary-care physician , who has agreed to follow her INR levels for the remainder of the six months .\\nDr. Viennee Ester is located in Tlandcousti Lo Vuclark , where the patient is from originally .\\nThe patient will call Dr. Overall 's office to arrange a follow-up appointment six weeks from the day of surgery .\\nStaples can be removed 10 to 14 days postoperatively .\\nPlease hold removal if the wound is draining .\\nThe patient may shower once the incision is dry , and may bathe and / or swim after the staples have been removed and there is no wound drainage .\\nPartial weight-bearing with crutches or a walker with posterior hip dislocation precautions for three months following surgery .\\nThese precautions have been explained and demonstrated to the patient .\\nThe patient has been instructed to call Dr. Overall 's office or the orthopedist on call with any questions or concerns about increasing pain , swelling , redness , wound drainage , fevers or chills at 094-897-3231 .\\nKEMA ESTER ,\\nMD DICTATING FOR :\\nElectronically Signed ETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D. 02/22/2003 07:01\\n_____________________________ ETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D.\\nTR :\\npe\\nDD :\\n02/08/2003\\nTD :\\n02/08/2003 6:34 P 737058\\ncc :\\nETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D. ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY ALLMID HEALTH CENTER KEMA ESTER , MILD VIENNEE C.

initially diagnosed in 1978 with atypical small cell carcinoma of the lung and treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy until 1980 .\\nShe did well for approximately twelve years until she was diagnosed with carcinoid cancer of the same right upper lobe .\\nThis may have been the initial primary cancer although it is unclear at present .\\nBronchoscopy at that time showed an endobronchial tumor of the right upper lobe bronchus and it was felt to be unresectable .\\nShe underwent four treatments of brachytherapy in March through May of 1993 .\\nShe had been doing reasonably well until December of 1993 when she presented with persistent and worsening cough and near strangulation on attempts at eating solids or drinking liquids .\\nA bronchoscopy showed a tracheoesophageal fistula with an opening into the trachea above the carina and no tumor in the right upper lobe .\\nShe has been on total parenteral nutrition and has been nothing by mouth since then .\\nA barium swallow prior to admission showed the presence of a tracheoesophageal fistula with entrance into the right mainstem bronchus below the carina .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\nBronchitis , asthma , carcinoid cancer , no history of coronary artery disease or cerebrovascular accident .\\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY :\\nThe patient is status post appendectomy , hysterectomy and right salpingo-oophorectomy ,

abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended .\\nExtremities :\\nno clubbing , cyanosis or edema .\\nThe rectal examination is guaiac negative with a minimal amount of stool .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was admitted on February 5 , 1994 and had a central venous line placed in her right subclavian .\\nThe patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 6 , 1994 where she underwent rigid and flexible bronchoscopy and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy .\\nFindings included necrotic debris in the distal trachea at the carina and right mainstem bronchus .\\nEsophageal mucosa was visible through the trachea .\\nHer steroids were weaned and the patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 10 , 1994 where she underwent once again flexible bronchoscopy and flexible esophagoscopy , as well as rigid bronchoscopy .\\nShe then had a transhiatal esophagectomy which was partial , and a substernal gastric interposition as well as a jejunostomy .\\nThe pathology report suggested that the area was involved with radiation esophagitis and focal ulceration .\\nShe remained ventilator dependent postoperatively and was taken to the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit .\\nThe patient was maintained on triple antibiotics which included Vancomycin , ceftazidime and Gentamicin .\\nOn postoperative day two , she had an electroencephalogram which showed no evidence of seizure activity but some generalized slowing .\\nThe patient was seen in consultation by the Neurology Service for her apparent postoperative encephalopathy and episodes of shaking .\\nAn endoscopy was also performed on postoperative day two which showed clean anastomosis .\\nShe received multiple bronchoscopies for pulmonary toilet .\\nThe patient was maintained on tube feedings and the ventilator .\\nA repeat echocardiogram on February 18 showed no significant change of her previous echocardiogram on February 11 , which showed only a small pericardial effusion .\\nA pelvic and abdominal computerized tomography scan on February 18 also showed no evidence of a focal collection or abscess .\\nShe remained intermittently febrile despite numerous antibiotics .\\nHer chest X-ray showed bilateral air space disease , consistent with pneumonia or adult respiratory distress syndrome .\\nShe suffered an episode of renal failure which was felt attributable to aminoglycoside toxicity .\\nHer steroids were weaned .\\nBecause of her prolonged intubation and inability to wean , on February 24 , 1994 , she had a tracheostomy placed .\\nShe remained in a coma .\\nThe blood cultures on February 26 , 1994 grew out Staphylococcus and she was treated for septicemia .\\nHer sputum grew out Pseudomonas aeruginosa as well .\\nThe urine contained yeast and she was treated with amphotericin .\\nOn March 3 , 1994 , a repeat chest and abdominal and pelvis computerized tomography scan showed no evidence of fluid collections .\\nThere was a large left pleural effusion however .\\nThis was drained with a left chest tube .\\nHer sputum then grew out Klebsiella and she was treated with amikacin and imipenem .\\nShe developed a right pleural effusion and had a right chest tube placed .\\nOn March 13 , 1994 , she regained some level of consciousness .\\nShe was able to fix and follow with her eyes , respond to commands .\\nOn March 14 , 1994 , her right lung was pleurodesed .\\nAttempts were made to facilitate her wean by resting her overnight with a combination of propafol and Fentanyl .\\nThis was tried for approximately seven days with no real progress made toward facilitating her vent wean .\\nShe continued to require pressor support in the high 30 's .\\nShe also fell into a coma once again .\\nOn March 31 , 1994 , her pressor support requirement increased and she continued to have tachypneic episodes .\\nOn April 2 , 1994 , she had several episodes of bradycardia and asystole , which responded only to manual ventilation .\\nDiscussions were held with the patient 's family with regard to her previously expressed wishes not to be maintained on artificial life support for extended period of time with little or no hope for recovery .\\nShe had expressed these wishes in writing on several legal forms from the state of Jose Pineston , as well as in discussions with her loved ones .\\nDecision was made in conjunction with the family and Dr. Caslighlourdes to terminate artificial respiratory support .\\nThe patient was removed from the ventilator and placed on a T-piece in her trachea only and was made comfortable with narcotics .\\nHer respirations ceased and she died at 10:15 a.m. on April 2 , 1994 .\\nDISPOSITION / PLAN ON DISCHARGE :\\nThe family will return the body to Sa for burial .\\nThey have declined a post-mortem examination .\\nCA SHUFF ,

Medical Center for angioplasty .\\nPRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :\\nUnstable angina .\\nASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :\\nHypertension .\\nPRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :\\nRight and circumflex angioplasty , cardiac catheterization on 12-6-93 .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThis 75 year old woman was previously admitted here in November 1993 for chronic angina .\\nShe had mild mitral regurgitation and a slightly diminished ejection fraction .\\nThere was a 90% right coronary stenosis which was reduced to 30 with a balloon angioplasty .\\nThere were three lesions in the circumflex , dilated successfully .\\nHowever , the low circumflex marginal vessel could not be crossed with the balloon .\\nShe did well in follow up , being treated for hypertension .\\nIn the end of 1992 , she was feeling well and was taken off Isordil .\\nDuring the winter and early parts of 1993 , the patient noticed increasing fatigue , symptoms of breathlessness and recurrent substernal chest pressure which finally led to admission to Xas Tupalmsmodral Hospital on 11-11-93 with documentation of a subendocardial myocardial infarction and a blood pressure of 210/108 .\\nCardiac catheterization towards the end of the hospitalization showed recurrent right coronary artery stenosis proximally and high grade new stenosis in the distal circumflex at the area of the origin of the previously untreated low circumflex marginal vessel .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\nMedications on transfer were Ecotrin , Vasotec 5 mg , Lopressor 25 bid , Isordil 20 tid , Procardia XL once per day , and Lasix 20 q3 days .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nOn physical examination , the blood pressure was 150 , heart rate 70 , bilateral carotid bruits , grade II systolic ejection murmur , good femoral pulses without bruits , good dorsalis pedis pulses with no posterior tibial pulses felt .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nThe electrocardiogram revealed left bundle branch block .\\nThe electrolytes were normal .\\nThe admission hematocrit was 34 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nOn 12-6-93 , angioplasty was performed of the right coronary artery using a 3 mm solo balloon reducing the stenosis from 80 to approximately 20% with a faint diagonal lucency which was not obstructive .\\nThe new distal circumflex lesion was dilated with a 2.0 mm balloon with a good result and minimal persistent stenosis .\\nBut the low circumflex marginal could not be entered with a wire .\\nThe first marginal had a 505 stenosis at its origin , which was not attempted .\\nThe patient did well post procedure .\\nHe developed a grape sized hematoma over the femoral artery with a loud bruit .\\nThe ultrasound on the day of discharge showed no evidence of pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula .\\nThe blood pressure was 150-170 systolic .\\nThe patient was ambulating without symptoms .\\nADDENDUM :\\nThe admission hematocrit was 34 .\\nThis fell to 25 after the cardiac catheterization without evidence of bleeding and rose to 29 by the time of discharge .\\nDOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :\\nShe was discharged with advice by Cardiac Rehabilitation for gradually increasing activity .\\nShe will be followed by her physician at Cean , Dr. Dieseld Pollejesc , for further pressure management and follow up of the femoral hematoma .\\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE :\\nStable , resolving anemia .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nEcotrin 160 mg per day , Vasotec 5 mg per day , Lopressor 25 bid , Isordil 20 tid , Procardia XL 30 per day , Lasix 20 mg q3 days .\\nTELSHEY STUDY , M.D.\\nTR :\\nah / BMot\\nDD :\\n12-9-93\\nTD :\\n12/11/93\\nCC :\\nDr. Telshey Study

was seen by Dr. Overall in the office on Aug 22 , 2003 , for follow-up .\\nShe was scheduled to have a total hi p replacement because of progressively worsening pain in the left hip .\\nHer pain was 8/10 .\\nShe limped .\\nShe did not use a cane .\\nShe did require a bannister going up and down stairs .\\nShe had trouble doing shoes and socks .\\nShe could walk limited distances .\\nSince seen by Dr. Overall in August , she had had a brain aneurysm .\\nShe had a mastectomy and had recently developed Parkinson 's.\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\n1. Breast cancer in the right breast , diagnosed in 1995 with negative nodes , treated with excision , recurrence in June , 2001 , further reconstructive surgery .\\nAt the same time , she underwent reduction of t he left breast .\\n2. History of bipolar disorder , for which she sees Dr. Lettefriscbreun .\\nShe indicates this is stable at this time .\\n3. History of chronic anxiety .\\n4. Sleep apnea treated with UPP surgery in 1997 .\\nShe does not use CPAP .\\n5. History of diverticulitis .\\n6. Intermittent migraines .\\n7. History of prior cervical dysplasia , treated with LEEP procedure .\\n8. Osteoporosis .\\n9. Obsessive-compulsive disorder .\\n10. Panic disorder .\\n11. Aneurysm of the right internal auditory canal , treated with coil insertion .\\n12. Prior renal surgery .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\n1. Eskalith , 300 mg. twice at bedtime .\\n2. Femara , 2.5 mg. at bedtime .\\n3. Primidone , 50 mg. PO q.h.s.\\n4. Diazepam , 1 mg. PO q.h.s.\\n5. Paxil , 37.5 mg. q.a.m.\\n6. Synthroid , 100 mcg. q.a.m.\\n7. Ditropan XL , 10 mg.\\n8. Imodium , 2 mg. q.a.m.\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nExamination reveals that the patient is walking with a mild limp .\\nThe left hip is a bit stiff with flexion to 90 degrees .\\nShe has 10 degrees of internal rotation and external rotation .\\nPulses are fine .\\nIMAGING :\\nX-rays were reviewed .\\nThey showed advanced arthritis of the left hip .\\nRECOMMENDATIONS :\\nDr. Etteme Overall recommended that the patient have a total hip replacement on the left side on February 2 , 2003 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nPlease refer to the operative note by Dr. Etteme Overall for details of the procedure .\\nPostoperatively , the patient was transferred to the floor in stable condition for observation , pain control and mobilization .\\nInitially postoperatively , she was doing quite well , though she did require four liters of oxygen postoperatively to maintain her oxygen saturations .\\nIt was hoped that she would wean off the oxygen over the course of the next few hours .\\nHowever , she did require four liters of oxygen all the way through the night to maintain oxygen saturations of 93% .\\nWithout oxygen , she dropped down to the low 80s .\\nGiven the unusual nature of this oxygen requirement , the patient underwent work-up with a chest X-ray , which essentially was normal .\\nAn ABG revealed a normal PCO2 of 32 , but a decrease in PO2- at 62 .\\nTherefore , given her history of breast cancer , the patient was taken for a spiral CT scan and the Medicine Service was consulted at that time .\\nThey agreed with our plan .\\nOn spiral CT scan , a small pulmonary embolus was seen in the right upper lobe and the left low er lobe .\\nShe was started on heparin at that time to maintain a PTT of 60 t o 80 , and was given doses of Coumadin , in addition to the Coumadin she had been given for DVT prophylaxis .\\nWith the recommendation of the medicine te am , we decided to maintain an INR of 2 to 3 with an overlap of heparin when the patient was therapeutic for two to three days .\\nShe continued to do quite well even though we did keep her on bed rest for three days while she was heparinized .\\nHer oxygen saturations continued to improve to the point that she was on room air on postoperative day four with oxygen saturation of 95% .\\nShe was given perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis for 48 hours after surgery .\\nShe was mobilized on postoperative day four , getting out of bed , able to do quite well on her new hip with a minimal amount of pain .\\nShe was given posterior hip dislocation precautions at that time , which she understood quite well .\\nShe continued to be followed by the medical team and was watched very closely by the orthopedic team until we felt comfortable that she was breathing quite well and was mobilizing well with physical therapy .\\nTherefore , it was decided at that time that the patient was ready for discharge to rehabilitation on Coumadin , which would be monitored for six months to maintain an INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nThe patient will continue all of her pre-admission medications , though no nonsteroidal analgesics , e.g. , aspirin or ibuprofen , will be given while she is on Coumadin therapy .\\n1. Colace , 100 mg. PO t.i.d.\\n2. Percocet , one to two tablets PO q.3 to 4 hours p.r.n. pain .\\n3. Coumadin with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nPlease prescribe 2 mg. tablets .\\nThe patient will be on Coumadin for six months given her history of pulmonary embolus .\\nDISCHARGE PLAN :\\nCoumadin for six months postoperatively with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nCheck INR three times a week until stable .\\nPlease call the results to Dr. Viennee Ester , the patient 's primary-care physician , who has agreed to follow her INR levels for the remainder of the six months .\\nDr. Viennee Ester is located in Tlandcousti Lo Vuclark , where the patient is from originally .\\nThe patient will call Dr. Overall 's office to arrange a follow-up appointment six weeks from the day of surgery .\\nStaples can be removed 10 to 14 days postoperatively .\\nPlease hold removal if the wound is draining .\\nThe patient may shower once the incision is dry , and may bathe and / or swim after the staples have been removed and there is no wound drainage .\\nPartial weight-bearing with crutches or a walker with posterior hip dislocation precautions for three months following surgery .\\nThese precautions have been explained and demonstrated to the patient .\\nThe patient has been instructed to call Dr. Overall 's office or the orthopedist on call with any questions or concerns about increasing pain , swelling , redness , wound drainage , fevers or chills at 094-897-3231 .\\nKEMA ESTER ,\\nMD DICTATING FOR :\\nElectronically Signed ETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D. 02/22/2003 07:01\\n_____________________________ ETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D.\\nTR :\\npe\\nDD :\\n02/08/2003\\nTD :\\n02/08/2003 6:34 P 737058\\ncc :\\nETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D. ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY ALLMID HEALTH CENTER KEMA ESTER , MILD VIENNEE C.

initially diagnosed in 1978 with atypical small cell carcinoma of the lung and treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy until 1980 .\\nShe did well for approximately twelve years until she was diagnosed with carcinoid cancer of the same right upper lobe .\\nThis may have been the initial primary cancer although it is unclear at present .\\nBronchoscopy at that time showed an endobronchial tumor of the right upper lobe bronchus and it was felt to be unresectable .\\nShe underwent four treatments of brachytherapy in March through May of 1993 .\\nShe had been doing reasonably well until December of 1993 when she presented with persistent and worsening cough and near strangulation on attempts at eating solids or drinking liquids .\\nA bronchoscopy showed a tracheoesophageal fistula with an opening into the trachea above the carina and no tumor in the right upper lobe .\\nShe has been on total parenteral nutrition and has been nothing by mouth since then .\\nA barium swallow

patient was admitted on February 5 , 1994 and had a central venous line placed in her right subclavian .\\nThe patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 6 , 1994 where she underwent rigid and flexible bronchoscopy and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy .\\nFindings included necrotic debris in the distal trachea at the carina and right mainstem bronchus .\\nEsophageal mucosa was visible through the trachea .\\nHer steroids were weaned and the patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 10 , 1994 where she underwent once again flexible bronchoscopy and flexible esophagoscopy , as well as rigid bronchoscopy .\\nShe then had a transhiatal esophagectomy which was partial , and a substernal gastric interposition as well as a jejunostomy .\\nThe pathology report suggested that

catheterization on 12-6-93 .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThis 75 year old woman was previously admitted here in November 1993 for chronic angina .\\nShe had mild mitral regurgitation and a slightly diminished ejection fraction .\\nThere was a 90% right coronary stenosis which was reduced to 30 with a balloon angioplasty .\\nThere were three lesions in the circumflex , dilated successfully .\\nHowever , the low circumflex marginal vessel could not be crossed with the balloon .\\nShe did well in follow up , being treated for hypertension .\\nIn the end of 1992 , she was feeling well and was taken off Isordil .\\nDuring the winter and early parts of 1993 , the patient noticed increasing fatigue , symptoms of breathlessness and recurrent substernal chest pressure which finally led to admission to Xas Tupalmsmodral Hospital on 11-11-93 with documentation of a subendocardial myocardial infarction and a blood pressure of 210/108 .\\nCardiac catheterization towards the end of the hospitalization showed recurrent right coronary artery stenosis proximally and high grade new stenosis in the distal circumflex at the area of the origin of the previously untreated low circumflex marginal vessel .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\nMedications on transfer were Ecotrin , Vasotec 5 mg , Lopressor 25 bid , Isordil 20 tid , Procardia XL once per day , and Lasix 20 q3 days .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nOn physical examination , the blood pressure was 150 , heart rate 70 , bilateral carotid bruits , grade II systolic ejection murmur , good femoral pulses without bruits , good dorsalis pedis pulses with no posterior tibial pulses felt .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nThe electrocardiogram revealed left bundle branch block .\\nThe electrolytes were normal .\\nThe admission hematocrit was 34 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nOn 12-6-93 , angioplasty was performed of the right coronary artery using a 3 mm solo balloon reducing the stenosis from 80 to approximately 20% with a faint diagonal lucency which was not obstructive .\\nThe new distal circumflex lesion was dilated with a 2.0 mm balloon with a good result and minimal persistent stenosis .\\nBut the low circumflex marginal could not be entered with a wire .\\nThe first marginal had a 505 stenosis at its origin , which was not attempted .\\nThe patient did well post procedure .\\nHe developed a grape sized hematoma over the femoral artery with a loud bruit .\\nThe ultrasound on the day of discharge showed no evidence of pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula .\\nThe blood pressure was 150-170 systolic .\\nThe patient was ambulating without symptoms .\\nADDENDUM :\\nThe admission hematocrit was 34 .\\nThis fell to 25 after the cardiac catheterization without evidence of bleeding and rose to 29 by the time of discharge .\\nDOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :\\nShe was discharged with advice by Cardiac Rehabilitation for gradually increasing activity .\\nShe will be followed by her physician at Cean , Dr. Dieseld Pollejesc , for further pressure management and follow up of the femoral hematoma .\\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE :\\nStable , resolving anemia .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nEcotrin 160 mg per day , Vasotec 5 mg per day , Lopressor 25 bid , Isordil 20 tid , Procardia XL 30 per day , Lasix 20 mg q3 days .\\nTELSHEY STUDY , M.D.\\nTR :\\nah / BMot\\nDD :\\n12-9-93\\nTD :\\n12/11/93\\nCC :\\nDr. Telshey Study

was seen by Dr. Overall in the office on Aug 22 , 2003 , for follow-up .\\nShe was scheduled to have a total hi p replacement because of progressively worsening pain in the left hip .\\nHer pain was 8/10 .\\nShe limped .\\nShe did not use a cane .\\nShe did require a bannister going up and down stairs .\\nShe had trouble doing shoes and socks .\\nShe could walk limited distances .\\nSince seen by Dr. Overall in August , she had had a brain aneurysm .\\nShe had a mastectomy and had recently developed Parkinson 's.\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\n1. Breast cancer in the right breast , diagnosed in 1995 with negative nodes , treated with excision , recurrence in June , 2001 , further reconstructive surgery .\\nAt the same time , she underwent reduction of t he left breast .\\n2.

Imodium , 2 mg. q.a.m.\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nExamination reveals that the patient is walking with a mild limp .\\nThe left hip is a bit stiff with flexion to 90 degrees .\\nShe has 10 degrees of internal rotation and external rotation .\\nPulses are fine .\\nIMAGING :\\nX-rays were reviewed .\\nThey showed advanced arthritis of the left hip .\\nRECOMMENDATIONS :\\nDr. Etteme Overall recommended that the patient have a total hip replacement on the left side on February 2 , 2003 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nPlease refer to the operative note by Dr. Etteme Overall for details of the procedure .\\nPostoperatively , the patient was transferred to the floor in stable condition for observation , pain control and mobilization .\\nInitially postoperatively , she was doing quite well , though she did require four liters of oxygen postoperatively to maintain her oxygen saturations .\\nIt was hoped that she would wean off the oxygen over the course of the next few hours .\\nHowever , she did require four liters of oxygen all the way through the night to maintain oxygen saturations of 93% .\\nWithout oxygen , she dropped down to the low 80s .\\nGiven the unusual nature of this oxygen requirement , the patient underwent work-up with a chest X-ray , which essentially was normal .\\nAn ABG revealed a normal PCO2 of 32 , but a decrease in PO2- at 62 .\\nTherefore , given her history of breast cancer , the patient was taken for a spiral CT scan and the Medicine Service was consulted at that time .\\nThey agreed with our plan .\\nOn spiral CT scan , a small pulmonary embolus was seen in the right upper lobe and the left low er lobe .\\nShe was started on heparin at that time to maintain a PTT of 60 t o 80 , and was given doses of Coumadin , in addition to the Coumadin she had been given for DVT prophylaxis .\\nWith the recommendation of the medicine te am , we decided to maintain an INR of 2 to 3 with an overlap of heparin when the patient was therapeutic for two to three days .\\nShe continued to do quite well even though we did keep her on bed rest for three days while she was heparinized .\\nHer oxygen saturations continued to improve to the point that she was on room air on postoperative day four with oxygen saturation of 95% .\\nShe was given perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis for 48 hours after surgery .\\nShe was mobilized on postoperative day four , getting out of bed , able to do quite well on her new hip with a minimal amount of pain .\\nShe was given posterior hip dislocation precautions at that time , which she understood quite well .\\nShe continued to be followed by the medical team and was watched very closely by the orthopedic team until we felt comfortable that she was breathing quite well and was mobilizing well with physical therapy .\\nTherefore , it was decided at that time that the patient was ready for discharge to rehabilitation on Coumadin , which would be monitored for six months to maintain an INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nThe patient will continue all of her pre-admission medications , though no nonsteroidal analgesics , e.g. , aspirin or ibuprofen , will be given while she is on Coumadin therapy .\\n1. Colace , 100 mg. PO t.i.d.\\n2. Percocet , one to two tablets PO q.3 to 4 hours p.r.n. pain .\\n3. Coumadin with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nPlease prescribe 2 mg. tablets .\\nThe patient will be on Coumadin for six months given her history of pulmonary embolus .\\nDISCHARGE PLAN :\\nCoumadin for six months postoperatively with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nCheck INR three times a week until stable .\\nPlease call the results to Dr. Viennee Ester , the patient 's primary-care physician , who has agreed to follow her INR levels for the remainder of the six months .\\nDr. Viennee Ester is located in Tlandcousti Lo Vuclark , where the patient is from originally .\\nThe patient will call Dr. Overall 's office to arrange a follow-up appointment six weeks from the day of surgery .\\nStaples can be removed 10 to 14 days postoperatively .\\nPlease hold removal if the wound is draining .\\nThe patient may shower once the incision is dry , and may bathe and / or swim after the staples have been removed and there is no wound drainage .\\nPartial weight-bearing with crutches or a walker with posterior hip dislocation precautions for three months following surgery .\\nThese precautions have been explained and demonstrated to the patient .\\nThe patient has been instructed to call Dr. Overall 's office or the orthopedist on call with any questions or concerns about increasing pain , swelling , redness , wound drainage , fevers or chills at 094-897-3231 .\\nKEMA ESTER ,\\nMD DICTATING FOR :\\nElectronically Signed ETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D. 02/22/2003 07:01\\n_____________________________ ETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D.\\nTR :\\npe\\nDD :\\n02/08/2003\\nTD :\\n02/08/2003 6:34 P 737058\\ncc :\\nETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D. ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY ALLMID HEALTH CENTER KEMA ESTER , MILD VIENNEE C.

and flexible bronchoscopy and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy .\\nFindings included necrotic debris in the distal trachea at the carina and right mainstem bronchus .\\nEsophageal mucosa was visible through the trachea .\\nHer steroids were weaned and the patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 10 , 1994 where she underwent once again flexible bronchoscopy and flexible esophagoscopy , as well as rigid bronchoscopy .\\nShe then had a transhiatal esophagectomy which was partial , and a substernal gastric interposition as well as a jejunostomy .\\nThe pathology report suggested that the area was involved with radiation esophagitis and focal ulceration .\\nShe remained ventilator dependent postoperatively and was taken to the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit .\\nThe patient was maintained on triple antibiotics which included Vancomycin , ceftazidime and Gentamicin .\\nOn postoperative day two , she had an electroencephalogram which showed no evidence of seizure activity but some generalized slowing .\\nThe patient was seen in consultation by the Neurology Service for her apparent postoperative encephalopathy and episodes of shaking .\\nAn endoscopy was also performed on postoperative day two which showed clean anastomosis .\\nShe received multiple bronchoscopies for pulmonary toilet .\\nThe patient was maintained on tube feedings and the ventilator .\\nA repeat echocardiogram on February 18 showed no significant change of her previous echocardiogram on February 11 , which showed only a small pericardial effusion .\\nA pelvic and abdominal computerized tomography scan on February 18 also showed no evidence of a focal collection or abscess .\\nShe remained intermittently febrile despite numerous antibiotics .\\nHer chest X-ray showed bilateral air space disease , consistent with pneumonia or adult respiratory distress syndrome .\\nShe suffered an episode of renal failure which was felt attributable to aminoglycoside toxicity .\\nHer steroids were weaned .\\nBecause of her prolonged intubation and inability to wean , on February 24 , 1994 , she had a tracheostomy placed .\\nShe remained in a coma .\\nThe blood cultures on February 26 , 1994 grew out Staphylococcus and she was treated for septicemia .\\nHer sputum grew out Pseudomonas aeruginosa as well .\\nThe urine contained yeast and she was treated with amphotericin .\\nOn March 3 , 1994 , a repeat chest and abdominal and pelvis computerized tomography scan showed no evidence of fluid collections .\\nThere was a large left pleural effusion however .\\nThis was drained with a left chest tube .\\nHer sputum then grew out Klebsiella and she was treated with amikacin and imipenem .\\nShe developed a right pleural effusion and had a right chest tube placed .\\nOn March 13 , 1994 , she regained some level of consciousness .\\nShe was able to fix and follow with her eyes , respond to commands .\\nOn March 14 , 1994 , her right lung was pleurodesed .\\nAttempts were made to facilitate her wean by resting her overnight with a combination of propafol and Fentanyl .\\nThis was tried for approximately seven days with no real progress made toward facilitating her vent wean .\\nShe continued to require pressor support in the high 30 's .\\nShe also fell into a coma once again .\\nOn March 31 , 1994 , her pressor support requirement increased and she continued to have tachypneic episodes .\\nOn April 2 , 1994 , she had several episodes of bradycardia and asystole , which responded only to manual ventilation .\\nDiscussions were held with the patient 's family with regard to her previously expressed wishes not to be maintained on artificial life support for extended period of time with little or no hope for recovery .\\nShe had expressed these wishes in writing on several legal forms from the state of Jose Pineston , as well as in discussions with her loved ones .\\nDecision was made in conjunction with the family and Dr. Caslighlourdes to terminate artificial respiratory support .\\nThe patient was removed from the ventilator and placed on a T-piece in her trachea only and was made comfortable with narcotics .\\nHer respirations ceased and she died at 10:15 a.m. on April 2 , 1994 .\\nDISPOSITION / PLAN ON DISCHARGE :\\nThe family will return the body to Sa for burial .\\nThey have declined a post-mortem examination .\\nCA SHUFF ,

catheterization on 12-6-93 .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThis 75 year old woman was previously admitted here in November 1993 for chronic angina .\\nShe had mild mitral regurgitation and a slightly diminished ejection fraction .\\nThere was a 90% right coronary stenosis which was reduced to 30 with a balloon angioplasty .\\nThere were three lesions in the circumflex , dilated successfully .\\nHowever , the low circumflex marginal vessel could not be crossed with the balloon .\\nShe did well in follow up , being treated for hypertension .\\nIn the end of 1992 , she was feeling well and was taken off Isordil .\\nDuring the winter and early parts of 1993 , the patient noticed increasing fatigue , symptoms of breathlessness and recurrent substernal chest pressure which finally led to admission to Xas Tupalmsmodral Hospital on 11-11-93 with documentation of a subendocardial myocardial infarction and a blood pressure of 210/108 .\\nCardiac catheterization towards the end of the hospitalization showed recurrent right coronary artery stenosis proximally and high grade new stenosis in the distal circumflex at the area of the origin of the previously untreated low circumflex marginal vessel .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\nMedications on transfer were Ecotrin , Vasotec 5 mg , Lopressor 25 bid , Isordil 20 tid , Procardia XL once per day , and Lasix 20 q3 days .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nOn physical examination , the blood pressure was 150 , heart rate 70 , bilateral carotid bruits , grade II systolic ejection murmur , good femoral pulses without bruits , good dorsalis pedis pulses with no posterior tibial pulses felt .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nThe electrocardiogram revealed left bundle branch block .\\nThe electrolytes were normal .\\nThe admission hematocrit was 34 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nOn 12-6-93 , angioplasty was performed of the right coronary artery using a 3 mm solo balloon reducing the stenosis from 80 to approximately 20% with a faint diagonal lucency which was not obstructive .\\nThe new distal circumflex lesion was dilated with a 2.0 mm balloon with a good result and minimal persistent stenosis .\\nBut the low circumflex marginal could not be entered with a wire .\\nThe first marginal had a 505 stenosis at its origin , which was not attempted .\\nThe patient did well post procedure .\\nHe developed a grape sized hematoma over the femoral artery with a loud bruit .\\nThe ultrasound on the day of discharge showed no evidence of pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula .\\nThe blood pressure was 150-170 systolic .\\nThe patient was ambulating without symptoms .\\nADDENDUM :\\nThe admission hematocrit was 34 .\\nThis fell to 25 after the cardiac catheterization without evidence of bleeding and rose to 29 by the time of discharge .\\nDOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :\\nShe was discharged with advice by Cardiac Rehabilitation for gradually increasing activity .\\nShe will be followed by her physician at Cean , Dr. Dieseld Pollejesc , for further pressure management and follow up of the femoral hematoma .\\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE :\\nStable , resolving anemia .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nEcotrin 160 mg per day , Vasotec 5 mg

was seen by Dr. Overall in the office on Aug 22 , 2003 , for follow-up .\\nShe was scheduled to have a total hi p replacement because of progressively worsening pain in the left hip .\\nHer pain was 8/10 .\\nShe limped .\\nShe did not use a cane .\\nShe did require a bannister going up and down stairs .\\nShe had trouble doing shoes and socks .\\nShe could walk limited distances .\\nSince seen by Dr. Overall in August , she had had a brain aneurysm .\\nShe had a mastectomy and had recently developed Parkinson 's.\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\n1. Breast cancer in the right breast , diagnosed in 1995 with negative nodes , treated with excision , recurrence in June , 2001 , further reconstructive surgery .\\nAt the same time , she underwent reduction of t he left breast .\\n2. History of bipolar disorder , for which she sees Dr. Lettefriscbreun .\\nShe indicates this is stable at this time .\\n3. History of chronic anxiety .\\n4.

Imodium , 2 mg. q.a.m.\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nExamination reveals that the patient is walking with a mild limp .\\nThe left hip is a bit stiff with flexion to 90 degrees .\\nShe has 10 degrees of internal rotation and external rotation .\\nPulses are fine .\\nIMAGING :\\nX-rays were reviewed .\\nThey showed advanced arthritis of the left hip .\\nRECOMMENDATIONS :\\nDr. Etteme Overall recommended that the patient have a total hip replacement on the left side on February 2 , 2003 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nPlease refer to the operative note by Dr. Etteme Overall for details of the procedure .\\nPostoperatively , the patient was transferred to the floor in stable condition for observation , pain control and mobilization .\\nInitially postoperatively , she was doing quite well , though she did require four liters of oxygen postoperatively to maintain her oxygen saturations .\\nIt was hoped that she would wean off the oxygen over the course of the next few hours .\\nHowever , she did require four liters of oxygen all the way through the night to maintain oxygen saturations of 93% .\\nWithout oxygen , she dropped down to the low 80s .\\nGiven the unusual nature of this oxygen requirement , the patient underwent work-up with a chest X-ray , which essentially was normal .\\nAn ABG revealed a normal PCO2 of 32 , but a decrease in PO2- at 62 .\\nTherefore , given her history of breast cancer , the patient was taken for a spiral CT scan and the Medicine Service was consulted at that time .\\nThey agreed with our plan .\\nOn spiral CT scan , a small pulmonary embolus was seen in the right upper lobe and the left low er lobe .\\nShe was started on heparin at that time to maintain a PTT of 60 t o 80 , and was given doses of Coumadin , in addition to the Coumadin she had been given for DVT prophylaxis .\\nWith the recommendation of the medicine te am , we decided to maintain an INR of 2 to 3 with an overlap of heparin when the patient was therapeutic for two to three days .\\nShe continued to do quite well even though we did keep her on bed rest for three days while she was heparinized .\\nHer oxygen saturations continued to improve to the point that she was on room air on postoperative day four with oxygen saturation of 95% .\\nShe was given perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis for 48 hours after surgery .\\nShe was mobilized on postoperative day four , getting out of bed , able to do quite well on her new hip with a minimal amount of pain .\\nShe was given posterior hip dislocation precautions at that time , which she understood quite well .\\nShe continued to be followed by the medical team and was watched very closely by the orthopedic team until we felt comfortable that she was breathing quite well and was mobilizing well with physical therapy .\\nTherefore , it was decided at that time that the patient was ready for discharge to rehabilitation on Coumadin , which would be monitored for six months to maintain an INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nThe patient will continue all of her pre-admission medications , though no nonsteroidal analgesics , e.g. , aspirin or ibuprofen , will be given while she is on Coumadin therapy .\\n1. Colace , 100 mg. PO t.i.d.\\n2. Percocet , one to two tablets PO q.3 to 4 hours p.r.n. pain .\\n3. Coumadin with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nPlease prescribe 2 mg. tablets .\\nThe patient will be on Coumadin for six months given her history of pulmonary embolus .\\nDISCHARGE PLAN :\\nCoumadin for six months postoperatively with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nCheck INR three times a week until stable .\\nPlease call the results to Dr. Viennee Ester , the patient 's primary-care physician , who has agreed to follow her INR levels for the remainder of the six months .\\nDr. Viennee Ester is located in Tlandcousti Lo Vuclark , where the patient is from originally .\\nThe patient will call Dr. Overall 's office to arrange a follow-up appointment six weeks from the day of surgery .\\nStaples can be removed 10 to 14 days postoperatively .\\nPlease hold removal if the wound is draining .\\nThe patient may shower once the incision is dry , and may bathe and / or swim after the staples have been removed and there is no wound drainage .\\nPartial weight-bearing with crutches or a walker with posterior hip dislocation precautions for three months following surgery .\\nThese precautions have been explained and demonstrated to the patient .\\nThe patient has been instructed to call Dr. Overall 's office or the orthopedist on call with any questions or concerns about increasing pain , swelling , redness , wound drainage , fevers or chills at 094-897-3231 .\\nKEMA ESTER ,\\nMD DICTATING FOR :\\nElectronically Signed ETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D. 02/22/2003 07:01\\n_____________________________ ETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D.\\nTR :\\npe\\nDD :\\n02/08/2003\\nTD :\\n02/08/2003 6:34 P 737058\\ncc :\\nETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D. ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY ALLMID HEALTH CENTER KEMA ESTER , MILD VIENNEE C.

initially diagnosed in 1978 with atypical small cell carcinoma of the lung and treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy until 1980 .\\nShe did well for approximately twelve years until she was diagnosed with carcinoid cancer of the same right upper lobe .\\nThis may have been the initial primary cancer although it is unclear at present .\\nBronchoscopy at that time showed an endobronchial tumor of the right upper lobe bronchus and it was felt to be unresectable .\\nShe underwent four treatments of brachytherapy in March through May of 1993 .\\nShe had been doing reasonably well until December of 1993 when she presented with persistent and worsening cough and near strangulation on attempts at eating solids or drinking liquids .\\nA bronchoscopy showed a tracheoesophageal fistula with an opening into the trachea above the carina and no tumor in the right upper lobe .\\nShe has been on total parenteral nutrition and has been nothing by mouth since then .\\nA barium swallow prior to admission showed the presence of a tracheoesophageal fistula with entrance into the right mainstem bronchus below the carina .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\nBronchitis , asthma , carcinoid cancer , no history of coronary artery disease or cerebrovascular accident .\\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY :\\nThe patient is status post appendectomy , hysterectomy and right salpingo-oophorectomy ,

abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended .\\nExtremities :\\nno clubbing , cyanosis or edema .\\nThe rectal examination is guaiac negative with a minimal amount of stool .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was admitted on February 5 , 1994 and had a central venous line placed in her right subclavian .\\nThe patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 6 , 1994 where she underwent rigid and flexible bronchoscopy and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy .\\nFindings included necrotic debris in the distal trachea at the carina and right mainstem bronchus .\\nEsophageal mucosa was visible through the trachea .\\nHer steroids were weaned and the patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 10 , 1994 where she underwent once again flexible bronchoscopy and flexible esophagoscopy , as well as rigid bronchoscopy .\\nShe then had a transhiatal esophagectomy which was partial , and a substernal gastric interposition as well as a jejunostomy .\\nThe pathology report suggested that the area was involved with radiation esophagitis and focal ulceration .\\nShe remained ventilator dependent postoperatively and was taken to the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit .\\nThe patient was maintained on triple antibiotics which included Vancomycin , ceftazidime and Gentamicin .\\nOn postoperative day two , she had an electroencephalogram which showed no evidence of seizure activity but some generalized slowing .\\nThe patient was seen in consultation by the Neurology Service for her apparent postoperative encephalopathy and episodes of shaking .\\nAn endoscopy was also performed on postoperative day two which showed clean anastomosis .\\nShe received multiple bronchoscopies for pulmonary toilet .\\nThe patient was maintained on tube feedings and the ventilator .\\nA repeat echocardiogram on February 18 showed no significant change of her previous echocardiogram on February 11 , which showed only a small pericardial effusion .\\nA pelvic and abdominal computerized tomography scan on February 18 also showed no evidence of a focal collection or abscess .\\nShe remained intermittently febrile despite numerous antibiotics .\\nHer chest X-ray showed bilateral air space disease , consistent with pneumonia or adult respiratory distress syndrome .\\nShe suffered an episode of renal failure which was felt attributable to aminoglycoside toxicity .\\nHer steroids were weaned .\\nBecause of her prolonged intubation and inability to wean , on February 24 , 1994 , she had a tracheostomy placed .\\nShe remained in a coma .\\nThe blood cultures on February 26 , 1994 grew out Staphylococcus and she was treated for septicemia .\\nHer sputum grew out Pseudomonas aeruginosa as well .\\nThe urine contained yeast and she was treated with amphotericin .\\nOn March 3 , 1994 , a repeat chest and abdominal and pelvis computerized tomography scan showed no evidence of fluid collections .\\nThere was a large left pleural effusion however .\\nThis was drained with a left chest tube .\\nHer sputum then grew out Klebsiella and she was treated with amikacin and imipenem .\\nShe developed a right pleural effusion and had a right chest tube placed .\\nOn March 13 , 1994 , she regained some level of consciousness .\\nShe was able to fix and follow with her eyes , respond to commands .\\nOn March 14 , 1994 , her right lung was pleurodesed .\\nAttempts were made to facilitate her wean by resting her overnight with a combination of propafol and Fentanyl .\\nThis was tried for approximately seven days with no real progress made toward facilitating her vent wean .\\nShe continued to require pressor support in the high 30 's .\\nShe also fell into a coma once again .\\nOn March 31 , 1994 , her pressor support requirement increased and she continued to have tachypneic episodes .\\nOn April 2 , 1994 , she had several episodes of bradycardia and asystole , which responded only to manual ventilation .\\nDiscussions were held with the patient 's family with regard to her previously expressed wishes not to be maintained on artificial life support for extended period of time with little or no hope for recovery .\\nShe had expressed these wishes in writing on several legal forms from the state of Jose Pineston , as well as in discussions with her loved ones .\\nDecision was made in conjunction with the family and Dr. Caslighlourdes to terminate artificial respiratory support .\\nThe patient was removed from the ventilator and placed on a T-piece in her trachea only and was made comfortable with narcotics .\\nHer respirations ceased and she died at 10:15 a.m. on April 2 , 1994 .\\nDISPOSITION / PLAN ON DISCHARGE :\\nThe family will return the body to Sa for burial .\\nThey have declined a post-mortem examination .\\nCA SHUFF ,

Medical Center for angioplasty .\\nPRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :\\nUnstable angina .\\nASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :\\nHypertension .\\nPRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :\\nRight and circumflex angioplasty , cardiac catheterization on 12-6-93 .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThis 75 year old woman was previously admitted here in November 1993 for chronic angina .\\nShe had mild mitral regurgitation and a slightly diminished ejection fraction .\\nThere was a 90% right coronary stenosis which was reduced to 30 with a balloon angioplasty .\\nThere were three lesions in the circumflex , dilated successfully .\\nHowever , the low circumflex marginal vessel could not be crossed with the balloon .\\nShe did well in follow up , being treated for hypertension .\\nIn the end of 1992 , she was feeling well and was taken off Isordil .\\nDuring the winter and early parts of 1993 , the patient noticed increasing fatigue , symptoms of breathlessness and recurrent substernal chest pressure which finally led to admission to Xas Tupalmsmodral Hospital on 11-11-93 with documentation of a subendocardial myocardial infarction and a blood pressure of 210/108 .\\nCardiac catheterization towards the end of the hospitalization showed recurrent right coronary artery stenosis proximally and high grade new stenosis in the distal circumflex at the area of the origin of the previously untreated low circumflex marginal vessel .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\nMedications on transfer were Ecotrin , Vasotec 5 mg , Lopressor 25 bid , Isordil 20 tid , Procardia XL once per day , and Lasix 20 q3 days .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nOn physical examination , the blood pressure was 150 , heart rate 70 , bilateral carotid bruits , grade II systolic ejection murmur , good femoral pulses without bruits , good dorsalis pedis pulses with no posterior tibial pulses felt .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nThe electrocardiogram revealed left bundle branch block .\\nThe electrolytes were normal .\\nThe admission hematocrit was 34 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nOn 12-6-93 , angioplasty was performed of the right coronary artery using a 3 mm solo balloon reducing the stenosis from 80 to approximately 20% with a faint diagonal lucency which was not obstructive .\\nThe new distal circumflex lesion was dilated with a 2.0 mm balloon with a good result and minimal persistent stenosis .\\nBut the low circumflex marginal could not be entered with a wire .\\nThe first marginal had a 505 stenosis at its origin , which was not attempted .\\nThe patient did well post procedure .\\nHe developed a grape sized hematoma over the femoral artery with a loud bruit .\\nThe ultrasound on the day of discharge showed no evidence of pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula .\\nThe blood pressure was 150-170 systolic .\\nThe patient was ambulating without symptoms .\\nADDENDUM :\\nThe admission hematocrit was 34 .\\nThis fell to 25 after the cardiac catheterization without evidence of bleeding and rose to 29 by the time of discharge .\\nDOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :\\nShe was discharged with advice by Cardiac Rehabilitation for gradually increasing activity .\\nShe will be followed by her physician at Cean , Dr. Dieseld Pollejesc , for further pressure management and follow up of the femoral hematoma .\\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE :\\nStable , resolving anemia .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nEcotrin 160 mg per day , Vasotec 5 mg per day , Lopressor 25 bid , Isordil 20 tid , Procardia XL 30 per day , Lasix 20 mg q3 days .\\nTELSHEY STUDY , M.D.\\nTR :\\nah / BMot\\nDD :\\n12-9-93\\nTD :\\n12/11/93\\nCC :\\nDr. Telshey Study

Femara , 2.5 mg. at bedtime .\\n3. Primidone , 50 mg. PO q.h.s.\\n4. Diazepam , 1 mg. PO q.h.s.\\n5. Paxil , 37.5 mg. q.a.m.\\n6. Synthroid , 100 mcg. q.a.m.\\n7. Ditropan XL , 10 mg.\\n8. Imodium , 2 mg. q.a.m.\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nExamination reveals that the patient is walking with a mild limp .\\nThe left hip is a bit stiff with flexion to 90 degrees .\\nShe has 10 degrees of internal rotation and external rotation .\\nPulses are fine .\\nIMAGING :\\nX-rays were reviewed .\\nThey showed advanced arthritis of the left hip .\\nRECOMMENDATIONS :\\nDr. Etteme Overall recommended that the patient have a total hip replacement on the left side on February 2 , 2003 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nPlease refer to the operative note by Dr. Etteme Overall for details of the procedure .\\nPostoperatively , the patient was transferred to the floor in stable condition for observation , pain control and mobilization .\\nInitially postoperatively , she was doing quite well , though she did require four liters of oxygen postoperatively to maintain her oxygen saturations .\\nIt was hoped that she would wean off the oxygen over the course of the next few hours .\\nHowever , she did require four liters of oxygen all the way through the night to maintain oxygen saturations of 93% .\\nWithout oxygen , she dropped down to the low 80s .\\nGiven the unusual nature of this oxygen requirement , the patient underwent work-up with a chest X-ray , which essentially was normal .\\nAn ABG revealed a normal PCO2 of 32 , but a decrease in PO2- at 62 .\\nTherefore , given her history of breast cancer , the patient was taken for a spiral CT scan and the Medicine Service was consulted at that time .\\nThey agreed with our plan .\\nOn spiral CT scan , a small pulmonary embolus was seen in the right upper lobe and the left low er lobe .\\nShe was started on heparin at that time to maintain a PTT of 60 t o 80 , and was given doses of Coumadin , in addition to the Coumadin she had been given for DVT prophylaxis .\\nWith the recommendation of the medicine te am , we decided to maintain an INR of 2 to 3 with an overlap of heparin when the patient was therapeutic for two to three days .\\nShe continued to do quite well even though we did keep her on bed rest for three days while she was heparinized .\\nHer oxygen saturations continued to improve to the point that she was on room air on postoperative day four with oxygen saturation of 95% .\\nShe was given perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis for 48 hours after surgery .\\nShe was mobilized on postoperative day four , getting out of bed , able to do quite well on her new hip with a minimal amount of pain .\\nShe was given posterior hip dislocation precautions at that time , which she understood quite well .\\nShe continued to be followed by the medical team and was watched very closely by the orthopedic team until we felt comfortable that she was breathing quite well and was mobilizing well with physical therapy .\\nTherefore , it was decided at that time that the patient was ready for discharge to rehabilitation on Coumadin , which would be monitored for six months to maintain an INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nThe patient will continue all of her pre-admission medications , though no nonsteroidal analgesics , e.g. , aspirin or ibuprofen , will be given while she is on Coumadin therapy .\\n1. Colace , 100 mg. PO t.i.d.\\n2. Percocet , one to two tablets PO q.3 to 4 hours p.r.n. pain .\\n3. Coumadin with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nPlease prescribe 2 mg. tablets .\\nThe patient will be on Coumadin for six months given her history of pulmonary embolus .\\nDISCHARGE PLAN :\\nCoumadin for six months postoperatively with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nCheck INR three times a week until stable .\\nPlease call the results to Dr. Viennee Ester , the patient 's primary-care physician , who has agreed to follow her INR levels for the remainder of the six months .\\nDr. Viennee Ester is located in Tlandcousti Lo Vuclark , where the patient is from originally .\\nThe patient will call Dr. Overall 's office to arrange a follow-up appointment six weeks from the day of surgery .\\nStaples can be removed 10 to 14 days postoperatively .\\nPlease hold removal if the wound is draining .\\nThe patient may shower once the incision is dry , and may bathe and / or swim after the staples have been removed and there is no wound drainage .\\nPartial weight-bearing with crutches or a walker with posterior hip dislocation precautions for three months following surgery .\\nThese precautions have been explained and demonstrated to the patient .\\nThe patient has been instructed to call Dr. Overall 's office or the orthopedist on call with any questions or concerns about increasing pain , swelling , redness , wound drainage , fevers or chills at 094-897-3231 .\\nKEMA ESTER ,\\nMD DICTATING FOR :\\nElectronically Signed ETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D. 02/22/2003 07:01\\n_____________________________ ETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D.\\nTR :\\npe\\nDD :\\n02/08/2003\\nTD :\\n02/08/2003 6:34 P 737058\\ncc :\\nETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D. ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY ALLMID HEALTH CENTER KEMA ESTER , MILD VIENNEE C.

initially diagnosed in 1978 with atypical small cell carcinoma of the lung and treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy until 1980 .\\nShe did well for approximately twelve years until she was diagnosed with carcinoid cancer of the same right upper lobe .\\nThis may have been the initial primary cancer although it is unclear at present .\\nBronchoscopy at that time showed an endobronchial tumor of the right upper lobe bronchus and it was felt to be unresectable .\\nShe underwent four treatments of brachytherapy in March through May of 1993 .\\nShe had been doing reasonably well until December of 1993 when she presented with persistent and worsening cough and near strangulation on attempts at eating solids or drinking liquids .\\nA bronchoscopy showed a tracheoesophageal fistula with an opening into the trachea above the carina and no tumor in the right upper lobe .\\nShe has been on total parenteral nutrition and has been nothing by mouth since then .\\nA barium swallow

patient was admitted on February 5 , 1994 and had a central venous line placed in her right subclavian .\\nThe patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 6 , 1994 where she underwent rigid and flexible bronchoscopy and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy .\\nFindings included necrotic debris in the distal trachea at the carina and right mainstem bronchus .\\nEsophageal mucosa was visible through the trachea .\\nHer steroids were weaned and the patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 10 , 1994 where she underwent once again flexible bronchoscopy and flexible esophagoscopy , as well as rigid bronchoscopy .\\nShe then had a transhiatal esophagectomy which was partial , and a substernal gastric interposition as well as a jejunostomy .\\nThe pathology report suggested that

catheterization on 12-6-93 .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThis 75 year old woman was previously admitted here in November 1993 for chronic angina .\\nShe had mild mitral regurgitation and a slightly diminished ejection fraction .\\nThere was a 90% right coronary stenosis which was reduced to 30 with a balloon angioplasty .\\nThere were three lesions in the circumflex , dilated successfully .\\nHowever , the low circumflex marginal vessel could not be crossed with the balloon .\\nShe did well in follow up , being treated for hypertension .\\nIn the end of 1992 , she was feeling well and was taken off Isordil .\\nDuring the winter and early parts of 1993 , the patient noticed increasing fatigue , symptoms of breathlessness and recurrent substernal chest pressure which finally led to admission to Xas Tupalmsmodral Hospital on 11-11-93 with documentation of a subendocardial myocardial infarction and a blood pressure of 210/108 .\\nCardiac catheterization towards the end of the hospitalization showed recurrent right coronary artery stenosis proximally and high grade new stenosis in the distal circumflex at the area of the origin of the previously untreated low circumflex marginal vessel .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\nMedications on transfer were Ecotrin , Vasotec 5 mg , Lopressor 25 bid , Isordil 20 tid , Procardia XL once per day , and Lasix 20 q3 days .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nOn physical examination , the blood pressure was 150 , heart rate 70 , bilateral carotid bruits , grade II systolic ejection murmur , good femoral pulses without bruits , good dorsalis pedis pulses with no posterior tibial pulses felt .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nThe electrocardiogram revealed left bundle branch block .\\nThe electrolytes were normal .\\nThe admission hematocrit was 34 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nOn 12-6-93 , angioplasty was performed of the right coronary artery using a 3 mm solo balloon reducing the stenosis from 80 to approximately 20% with a faint diagonal lucency which was not obstructive .\\nThe new distal circumflex lesion was dilated with a 2.0 mm balloon with a good result and minimal persistent stenosis .\\nBut the low circumflex marginal could not be entered with a wire .\\nThe first marginal had a 505 stenosis at its origin , which was not attempted .\\nThe patient did well post procedure .\\nHe developed a grape sized hematoma over the femoral artery with a loud bruit .\\nThe ultrasound on the day of discharge showed no evidence of pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula .\\nThe blood pressure was 150-170 systolic .\\nThe patient was ambulating without symptoms .\\nADDENDUM :\\nThe admission hematocrit was 34 .\\nThis fell to 25 after the cardiac catheterization without evidence of bleeding and rose to 29 by the time of discharge .\\nDOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :\\nShe was discharged with advice by Cardiac Rehabilitation for gradually increasing activity .\\nShe will be followed by her physician at Cean , Dr. Dieseld Pollejesc , for further pressure management and follow up of the femoral hematoma .\\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE :\\nStable , resolving anemia .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nEcotrin 160 mg per day , Vasotec 5 mg per day , Lopressor 25 bid , Isordil 20 tid , Procardia XL 30 per day , Lasix 20 mg q3 days .\\nTELSHEY STUDY , M.D.\\nTR :\\nah / BMot\\nDD :\\n12-9-93\\nTD :\\n12/11/93\\nCC :\\nDr. Telshey Study

was seen by Dr. Overall in the office on Aug 22 , 2003 , for follow-up .\\nShe was scheduled to have a total hi p replacement because of progressively worsening pain in the left hip .\\nHer pain was 8/10 .\\nShe limped .\\nShe did not use a cane .\\nShe did require a bannister going up and down stairs .\\nShe had trouble doing shoes and socks .\\nShe could walk limited distances .\\nSince seen by Dr. Overall in August , she had had a brain aneurysm .\\nShe had a mastectomy and had recently developed Parkinson 's.\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\n1. Breast cancer in the right breast , diagnosed in 1995 with negative nodes , treated with excision , recurrence in June , 2001 , further reconstructive surgery .\\nAt the same time , she underwent reduction of t he left breast .\\n2.

Imodium , 2 mg. q.a.m.\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nExamination reveals that the patient is walking with a mild limp .\\nThe left hip is a bit stiff with flexion to 90 degrees .\\nShe has 10 degrees of internal rotation and external rotation .\\nPulses are fine .\\nIMAGING :\\nX-rays were reviewed .\\nThey showed advanced arthritis of the left hip .\\nRECOMMENDATIONS :\\nDr. Etteme Overall recommended that the patient have a total hip replacement on the left side on February 2 , 2003 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nPlease refer to the operative note by Dr. Etteme Overall for details of the procedure .\\nPostoperatively , the patient was transferred to the floor in stable condition for observation , pain control and mobilization .\\nInitially postoperatively , she was doing quite well , though she did require four liters of oxygen postoperatively to maintain her oxygen saturations .\\nIt was hoped that she would wean off the oxygen over the course of the next few hours .\\nHowever , she did require four liters of oxygen all the way through the night to maintain oxygen saturations of 93% .\\nWithout oxygen , she dropped down to the low 80s .\\nGiven the unusual nature of this oxygen requirement , the patient underwent work-up with a chest X-ray , which essentially was normal .\\nAn ABG revealed a normal PCO2 of 32 , but a decrease in PO2- at 62 .\\nTherefore , given her history of breast cancer , the patient was taken for a spiral CT scan and the Medicine Service was consulted at that time .\\nThey agreed with our plan .\\nOn spiral CT scan , a small pulmonary embolus was seen in the right upper lobe and the left low er lobe .\\nShe was started on heparin at that time to maintain a PTT of 60 t o 80 , and was given doses of Coumadin , in addition to the Coumadin she had been given for DVT prophylaxis .\\nWith the recommendation of the medicine te am , we decided to maintain an INR of 2 to 3 with an overlap of heparin when the patient was therapeutic for two to three days .\\nShe continued to do quite well even though we did keep her on bed rest for three days while she was heparinized .\\nHer oxygen saturations continued to improve to the point that she was on room air on postoperative day four with oxygen saturation of 95% .\\nShe was given perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis for 48 hours after surgery .\\nShe was mobilized on postoperative day four , getting out of bed , able to do quite well on her new hip with a minimal amount of pain .\\nShe was given posterior hip dislocation precautions at that time , which she understood quite well .\\nShe continued to be followed by the medical team and was watched very closely by the orthopedic team until we felt comfortable that she was breathing quite well and was mobilizing well with physical therapy .\\nTherefore , it was decided at that time that the patient was ready for discharge to rehabilitation on Coumadin , which would be monitored for six months to maintain an INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nThe patient will continue all of her pre-admission medications , though no nonsteroidal analgesics , e.g. , aspirin or ibuprofen , will be given while she is on Coumadin therapy .\\n1. Colace , 100 mg. PO t.i.d.\\n2. Percocet , one to two tablets PO q.3 to 4 hours p.r.n. pain .\\n3. Coumadin with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nPlease prescribe 2 mg. tablets .\\nThe patient will be on Coumadin for six months given her history of pulmonary embolus .\\nDISCHARGE PLAN :\\nCoumadin for six months postoperatively with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nCheck INR three times a week until stable .\\nPlease call the results to Dr. Viennee Ester , the patient 's primary-care physician , who has agreed to follow her INR levels for the remainder of the six months .\\nDr. Viennee Ester is located in Tlandcousti Lo Vuclark , where the patient is from originally .\\nThe patient will call Dr. Overall 's office to arrange a follow-up appointment six weeks from the day of surgery .\\nStaples can be removed 10 to 14 days postoperatively .\\nPlease hold removal if the wound is draining .\\nThe patient may shower once the incision is dry , and may bathe and / or swim after the staples have been removed and there is no wound drainage .\\nPartial weight-bearing with crutches or a walker with posterior hip dislocation precautions for three months following surgery .\\nThese precautions have been explained and demonstrated to the patient .\\nThe patient has been instructed to call Dr. Overall 's office or the orthopedist on call with any questions or concerns about increasing pain , swelling , redness , wound drainage , fevers or chills at 094-897-3231 .\\nKEMA ESTER ,\\nMD DICTATING FOR :\\nElectronically Signed ETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D. 02/22/2003 07:01\\n_____________________________ ETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D.\\nTR :\\npe\\nDD :\\n02/08/2003\\nTD :\\n02/08/2003 6:34 P 737058\\ncc :\\nETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D. ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY ALLMID HEALTH CENTER KEMA ESTER , MILD VIENNEE C.

and flexible bronchoscopy and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy .\\nFindings included necrotic debris in the distal trachea at the carina and right mainstem bronchus .\\nEsophageal mucosa was visible through the trachea .\\nHer steroids were weaned and the patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 10 , 1994 where she underwent once again flexible bronchoscopy and flexible esophagoscopy , as well as rigid bronchoscopy .\\nShe then had a transhiatal esophagectomy which was partial , and a substernal gastric interposition as well as a jejunostomy .\\nThe pathology report suggested that the area was involved with radiation esophagitis and focal ulceration .\\nShe remained ventilator dependent postoperatively and was taken to the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit .\\nThe patient was maintained on triple antibiotics which included Vancomycin , ceftazidime and Gentamicin .\\nOn postoperative day two , she had an electroencephalogram which showed no evidence of seizure activity but some generalized slowing .\\nThe patient was seen in consultation by the Neurology Service for her apparent postoperative encephalopathy and episodes of shaking .\\nAn endoscopy was also performed on postoperative day two which showed clean anastomosis .\\nShe received multiple bronchoscopies for pulmonary toilet .\\nThe patient was maintained on tube feedings and the ventilator .\\nA repeat echocardiogram on February 18 showed no significant change of her previous echocardiogram on February 11 , which showed only a small pericardial effusion .\\nA pelvic and abdominal computerized tomography scan on February 18 also showed no evidence of a focal collection or abscess .\\nShe remained intermittently febrile despite numerous antibiotics .\\nHer chest X-ray showed bilateral air space disease , consistent with pneumonia or adult respiratory distress syndrome .\\nShe suffered an episode of renal failure which was felt attributable to aminoglycoside toxicity .\\nHer steroids were weaned .\\nBecause of her prolonged intubation and inability to wean , on February 24 , 1994 , she had a tracheostomy placed .\\nShe remained in a coma .\\nThe blood cultures on February 26 , 1994 grew out Staphylococcus and she was treated for septicemia .\\nHer sputum grew out Pseudomonas aeruginosa as well .\\nThe urine contained yeast and she was treated with amphotericin .\\nOn March 3 , 1994 , a repeat chest and abdominal and pelvis computerized tomography scan showed no evidence of fluid collections .\\nThere was a large left pleural effusion however .\\nThis was drained with a left chest tube .\\nHer sputum then grew out Klebsiella and she was treated with amikacin and imipenem .\\nShe developed a right pleural effusion and had a right chest tube placed .\\nOn March 13 , 1994 , she regained some level of consciousness .\\nShe was able to fix and follow with her eyes , respond to commands .\\nOn March 14 , 1994 , her right lung was pleurodesed .\\nAttempts were made to facilitate her wean by resting her overnight with a combination of propafol and Fentanyl .\\nThis was tried for approximately seven days with no real progress made toward facilitating her vent wean .\\nShe continued to require pressor support in the high 30 's .\\nShe also fell into a coma once again .\\nOn March 31 , 1994 , her pressor support requirement increased and she continued to have tachypneic episodes .\\nOn April 2 , 1994 , she had several episodes of bradycardia and asystole , which responded only to manual ventilation .\\nDiscussions were held with the patient 's family with regard to her previously expressed wishes not to be maintained on artificial life support for extended period of time with little or no hope for recovery .\\nShe had expressed these wishes in writing on several legal forms from the state of Jose Pineston , as well as in discussions with her loved ones .\\nDecision was made in conjunction with the family and Dr. Caslighlourdes to terminate artificial respiratory support .\\nThe patient was removed from the ventilator and placed on a T-piece in her trachea only and was made comfortable with narcotics .\\nHer respirations ceased and she died at 10:15 a.m. on April 2 , 1994 .\\nDISPOSITION / PLAN ON DISCHARGE :\\nThe family will return the body to Sa for burial .\\nThey have declined a post-mortem examination .\\nCA SHUFF ,

Medical Center for angioplasty .\\nPRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :\\nUnstable angina .\\nASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :\\nHypertension .\\nPRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :\\nRight and circumflex angioplasty , cardiac catheterization on 12-6-93 .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThis 75 year old woman was previously admitted here in November 1993 for chronic angina .\\nShe had mild mitral regurgitation and a slightly diminished ejection fraction .\\nThere was a 90% right coronary stenosis which was reduced to 30 with a balloon angioplasty .\\nThere were three lesions in the circumflex , dilated successfully .\\nHowever , the low circumflex marginal vessel could not be crossed with the balloon .\\nShe did well in follow up , being treated for hypertension .\\nIn the end of 1992 , she was feeling well and was taken off Isordil .\\nDuring the winter and early parts of 1993 , the patient noticed increasing fatigue , symptoms of breathlessness and recurrent substernal chest pressure which finally led to admission to Xas Tupalmsmodral Hospital on 11-11-93 with documentation of a subendocardial myocardial infarction and a blood pressure of 210/108 .\\nCardiac catheterization towards the end of the hospitalization showed recurrent right coronary artery stenosis proximally and high grade new stenosis in the distal circumflex at the area of the origin of the previously untreated low circumflex marginal vessel .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\nMedications on transfer were Ecotrin , Vasotec 5 mg , Lopressor 25 bid , Isordil 20 tid , Procardia XL once per day , and Lasix 20 q3 days .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nOn physical examination , the blood pressure was 150 , heart rate 70 , bilateral carotid bruits , grade II systolic ejection murmur , good femoral pulses without bruits , good dorsalis pedis pulses with no posterior tibial pulses felt .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nThe electrocardiogram revealed left bundle branch block .\\nThe electrolytes were normal .\\nThe admission hematocrit was 34 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nOn 12-6-93 , angioplasty was performed of the right coronary artery using a 3 mm solo balloon reducing the stenosis from 80 to approximately 20% with a faint diagonal lucency which was not obstructive .\\nThe new distal circumflex lesion was dilated with a 2.0 mm balloon with a good result and minimal persistent stenosis .\\nBut the low circumflex marginal could not be entered with a wire .\\nThe first marginal had a 505 stenosis at its origin , which was not attempted .\\nThe patient did well post procedure .\\nHe developed a grape sized hematoma over the femoral artery with a loud bruit .\\nThe ultrasound on the day of discharge showed no evidence of pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula .\\nThe blood pressure was 150-170 systolic .\\nThe patient was ambulating without symptoms .\\nADDENDUM :\\nThe admission hematocrit was 34 .\\nThis fell to 25 after the cardiac catheterization without evidence of bleeding and rose to 29 by the time of discharge .\\nDOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :\\nShe was discharged with advice by Cardiac Rehabilitation for gradually increasing activity .\\nShe will be followed by her physician at Cean , Dr. Dieseld Pollejesc , for further pressure management and follow up of the femoral hematoma .\\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE :\\nStable , resolving anemia .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nEcotrin 160 mg per day , Vasotec 5 mg per day , Lopressor 25 bid , Isordil 20 tid , Procardia XL 30 per day , Lasix 20 mg q3 days .\\nTELSHEY STUDY , M.D.\\nTR :\\nah / BMot\\nDD :\\n12-9-93\\nTD :\\n12/11/93\\nCC :\\nDr. Telshey Study

Colace , 100 mg. PO t.i.d.\\n2. Percocet , one to two tablets PO q.3 to 4 hours p.r.n. pain .\\n3. Coumadin with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nPlease prescribe 2 mg. tablets .\\nThe patient will be on Coumadin for six months given her history of pulmonary embolus .\\nDISCHARGE PLAN :\\nCoumadin for six months postoperatively with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nCheck INR three times a week until stable .\\nPlease call the results to Dr. Viennee Ester , the patient 's primary-care physician , who has agreed to follow her INR levels for the remainder of the six months .\\nDr. Viennee Ester is located in Tlandcousti Lo Vuclark , where the patient is from originally .\\nThe patient will call Dr. Overall 's office to arrange a follow-up appointment six weeks from the day of surgery .\\nStaples can be removed 10 to 14 days postoperatively .\\nPlease hold removal if the wound is draining .\\nThe patient may shower once the incision is dry , and may bathe and / or swim after the staples have been removed and there is no wound drainage .\\nPartial weight-bearing with crutches or a walker with posterior hip dislocation precautions for three months following surgery .\\nThese precautions have been explained and demonstrated to the patient .\\nThe patient has been instructed to call Dr. Overall 's office or the orthopedist on call with any questions or concerns about increasing pain , swelling , redness , wound drainage , fevers or chills at 094-897-3231 .\\nKEMA ESTER ,\\nMD DICTATING FOR :\\nElectronically Signed ETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D. 02/22/2003 07:01\\n_____________________________ ETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D.\\nTR :\\npe\\nDD :\\n02/08/2003\\nTD :\\n02/08/2003 6:34 P 737058\\ncc :\\nETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D. ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY ALLMID HEALTH CENTER KEMA ESTER , MILD VIENNEE C.

initially diagnosed in 1978 with atypical small cell carcinoma of the lung and treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy until 1980 .\\nShe did well for approximately twelve years until she was diagnosed with carcinoid cancer of the same right upper lobe .\\nThis may have been the initial primary cancer although it is unclear at present .\\nBronchoscopy at that time showed an endobronchial tumor of the right upper lobe bronchus and it was felt to be unresectable .\\nShe underwent four treatments of brachytherapy in March through May of 1993 .\\nShe had been doing reasonably well until December of 1993 when she presented with persistent and worsening cough and near strangulation on attempts at eating solids or drinking liquids .\\nA bronchoscopy showed a tracheoesophageal fistula with an opening into the trachea above the carina and no tumor in the right upper lobe .\\nShe has been on total parenteral nutrition and has been nothing by mouth since then .\\nA barium swallow

abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended .\\nExtremities :\\nno clubbing , cyanosis or edema .\\nThe rectal examination is guaiac negative with a minimal amount of stool .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was admitted on February 5 , 1994 and had a central venous line placed in her right subclavian .\\nThe patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 6 , 1994 where she underwent rigid and flexible bronchoscopy and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy .\\nFindings included necrotic debris in the distal trachea at the carina and right mainstem bronchus .\\nEsophageal mucosa was visible through the trachea .\\nHer steroids were weaned and the patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 10 , 1994 where she underwent once again flexible bronchoscopy and flexible esophagoscopy , as well as rigid bronchoscopy .\\nShe then had a transhiatal esophagectomy which was partial , and a substernal gastric interposition as well as a jejunostomy .\\nThe pathology report suggested that the area was involved with radiation esophagitis and focal ulceration .\\nShe remained ventilator dependent postoperatively and was taken to the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit .\\nThe patient was maintained on triple antibiotics which included Vancomycin , ceftazidime and Gentamicin .\\nOn postoperative day two , she had an electroencephalogram which showed no evidence of seizure activity but some generalized slowing .\\nThe patient was seen in consultation by the Neurology Service for her apparent postoperative encephalopathy and episodes of shaking .\\nAn endoscopy was also performed on postoperative day two which showed clean anastomosis .\\nShe received multiple bronchoscopies for pulmonary toilet .\\nThe patient was maintained on tube feedings and the ventilator .\\nA repeat echocardiogram on February 18 showed no significant change of her previous echocardiogram on February 11 , which showed only a small pericardial effusion .\\nA pelvic and abdominal computerized tomography scan on February 18 also showed no evidence of a focal collection or abscess .\\nShe remained intermittently febrile despite numerous antibiotics .\\nHer chest X-ray showed bilateral air space disease , consistent with pneumonia or adult respiratory distress syndrome .\\nShe suffered an episode of renal failure which was felt attributable to aminoglycoside toxicity .\\nHer steroids were weaned .\\nBecause of her prolonged intubation and inability to wean , on February 24 , 1994 , she had a tracheostomy placed .\\nShe remained in a coma .\\nThe blood cultures on February 26 ,

3 , 1994 , a repeat chest and abdominal and pelvis computerized tomography scan showed no evidence of fluid collections .\\nThere was a large left pleural effusion however .\\nThis was drained with a left chest tube .\\nHer sputum then grew out Klebsiella and she was treated with amikacin and imipenem .\\nShe developed a right pleural effusion and had a right chest tube placed .\\nOn March 13 , 1994 , she regained some level of consciousness .\\nShe was able to fix and follow with her eyes , respond to commands .\\nOn March 14 , 1994 , her right lung was pleurodesed .\\nAttempts were made to facilitate her wean by resting her overnight with a combination of propafol and Fentanyl .\\nThis was tried for approximately seven days with no real progress made toward facilitating her vent wean .\\nShe continued to require pressor support in the high 30 's .\\nShe also fell into a coma once again .\\nOn March 31 , 1994 , her pressor support requirement increased and she continued to have tachypneic episodes .\\nOn April 2 , 1994 , she had several episodes of bradycardia and asystole , which responded only to manual ventilation .\\nDiscussions were held with the patient 's family with regard to her previously expressed wishes not to be maintained on artificial life support for extended period of time with little or no hope for recovery .\\nShe had expressed these wishes in writing on several legal forms from the state of Jose Pineston , as well as in discussions with her loved ones .\\nDecision was made in conjunction with the family and Dr. Caslighlourdes to terminate artificial respiratory support .\\nThe patient was removed from the ventilator and placed on a T-piece in her trachea only and was made comfortable with narcotics .\\nHer respirations ceased and she died at 10:15 a.m. on April 2 , 1994 .\\nDISPOSITION / PLAN ON DISCHARGE :\\nThe family will return the body to Sa for burial .\\nThey have declined a post-mortem examination .\\nCA SHUFF ,

Medical Center for angioplasty .\\nPRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :\\nUnstable angina .\\nASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :\\nHypertension .\\nPRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :\\nRight and circumflex angioplasty , cardiac catheterization on 12-6-93 .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThis 75 year old woman was previously admitted here in November 1993 for chronic angina .\\nShe had mild mitral regurgitation and a slightly diminished ejection fraction .\\nThere was a 90% right coronary stenosis which was reduced to 30 with a balloon angioplasty .\\nThere were three lesions in the circumflex , dilated successfully .\\nHowever , the low circumflex marginal vessel could not be crossed with the balloon .\\nShe did well in follow up , being treated for hypertension .\\nIn the end of 1992 , she was feeling well and was taken off Isordil .\\nDuring the winter and early parts of 1993 , the patient noticed increasing fatigue , symptoms of breathlessness and recurrent substernal chest pressure which finally led to admission to Xas Tupalmsmodral Hospital on 11-11-93 with documentation of a subendocardial myocardial infarction and a blood pressure of 210/108 .\\nCardiac catheterization towards the end of the hospitalization showed recurrent right coronary artery stenosis proximally and high grade new stenosis in the distal circumflex at the area of the origin of the previously untreated low circumflex marginal vessel .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\nMedications on transfer were Ecotrin , Vasotec 5 mg , Lopressor 25 bid , Isordil 20 tid , Procardia XL once per day , and Lasix 20 q3 days .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nOn physical examination , the blood pressure was 150 , heart rate 70 , bilateral carotid bruits , grade II systolic ejection murmur , good femoral pulses without bruits , good dorsalis pedis pulses with no posterior tibial pulses felt .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nThe electrocardiogram revealed left bundle branch block .\\nThe electrolytes were normal .\\nThe admission hematocrit was 34 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nOn 12-6-93 , angioplasty was performed of the right coronary artery using a 3 mm solo balloon reducing the stenosis from 80 to approximately 20% with a faint diagonal lucency which was not obstructive .\\nThe new distal circumflex lesion was dilated with a 2.0 mm balloon with a good result and minimal persistent stenosis .\\nBut the low circumflex marginal could not be entered with a wire .\\nThe first marginal had a 505 stenosis at its origin , which was not attempted .\\nThe patient did well post procedure .\\nHe developed a grape sized hematoma over the femoral artery with a loud bruit .\\nThe ultrasound on the day of discharge showed no evidence of pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula .\\nThe blood pressure was 150-170 systolic .\\nThe patient was ambulating without symptoms .\\nADDENDUM :\\nThe admission hematocrit was 34 .\\nThis fell to 25 after the cardiac catheterization without evidence of bleeding and rose to 29 by the time of discharge .\\nDOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :\\nShe was discharged with advice by Cardiac Rehabilitation for gradually increasing activity .\\nShe will be followed by her physician at Cean , Dr. Dieseld Pollejesc , for further pressure management and follow up of the femoral hematoma .\\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE :\\nStable , resolving anemia .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nEcotrin 160 mg per day , Vasotec 5 mg per day , Lopressor 25 bid , Isordil 20 tid , Procardia XL 30 per day , Lasix 20 mg q3 days .\\nTELSHEY STUDY , M.D.\\nTR :\\nah / BMot\\nDD :\\n12-9-93\\nTD :\\n12/11/93\\nCC :\\nDr. Telshey Study

was seen by Dr. Overall in the office on Aug 22 , 2003 , for follow-up .\\nShe was scheduled to have a total hi p replacement because of progressively worsening pain in the left hip .\\nHer pain was 8/10 .\\nShe limped .\\nShe did not use a cane .\\nShe did require a bannister going up and down stairs .\\nShe had trouble doing shoes and socks .\\nShe could walk limited distances .\\nSince seen by Dr. Overall in August , she had had a brain aneurysm .\\nShe had a mastectomy and had recently developed Parkinson 's.\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\n1. Breast cancer in the right breast , diagnosed in 1995 with negative nodes , treated with excision , recurrence in June , 2001 , further reconstructive surgery .\\nAt the same time , she underwent reduction of t he left breast .\\n2. History of bipolar disorder , for which she sees Dr. Lettefriscbreun .\\nShe indicates this is stable at this time .\\n3. History of chronic anxiety .\\n4. Sleep apnea treated with UPP surgery in 1997 .\\nShe does not use CPAP .\\n5. History of diverticulitis .\\n6. Intermittent migraines .\\n7.

Imodium , 2 mg. q.a.m.\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nExamination reveals that the patient is walking with a mild limp .\\nThe left hip is a bit stiff with flexion to 90 degrees .\\nShe has 10 degrees of internal rotation and external rotation .\\nPulses are fine .\\nIMAGING :\\nX-rays were reviewed .\\nThey showed advanced arthritis of the left hip .\\nRECOMMENDATIONS :\\nDr. Etteme Overall recommended that the patient have a total hip replacement on the left side on February 2 , 2003 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nPlease refer to the operative note by Dr. Etteme Overall for details of the procedure .\\nPostoperatively , the patient was transferred to the floor in stable condition for observation , pain control and mobilization .\\nInitially postoperatively , she was doing quite well , though she did require four liters of oxygen postoperatively to maintain her oxygen saturations .\\nIt was hoped that she would wean off the oxygen over the course of the next few hours .\\nHowever , she did require four liters of oxygen all the way through the night to maintain oxygen saturations of 93% .\\nWithout oxygen , she dropped down to the low 80s .\\nGiven the unusual nature of this oxygen requirement , the patient underwent work-up with a chest X-ray , which essentially was normal .\\nAn ABG revealed a normal PCO2 of 32 , but a decrease in PO2- at 62 .\\nTherefore , given her history of breast cancer , the patient was taken for a spiral CT scan and the Medicine Service was consulted at that time .\\nThey agreed with our plan .\\nOn spiral CT scan , a small pulmonary embolus was seen in the right upper lobe and the left low er lobe .\\nShe was started on heparin at that time to maintain a PTT of 60 t o 80 , and was given doses of Coumadin , in addition to the Coumadin she had been given for DVT prophylaxis .\\nWith the recommendation of the medicine te am , we decided to maintain an INR of 2 to 3 with an overlap of heparin when the patient was therapeutic for two to three days .\\nShe continued to do quite well even though we did keep her on bed rest for three days while she was heparinized .\\nHer oxygen saturations continued to improve to the point that she was on room air on postoperative day four with oxygen saturation of 95% .\\nShe was given perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis for 48 hours after surgery .\\nShe was mobilized on postoperative day four , getting out of bed , able to do quite well on her new hip with a minimal amount of pain .\\nShe was given posterior hip dislocation precautions at that time , which she understood quite well .\\nShe continued to be followed by the medical team and was watched very closely by the orthopedic team until we felt comfortable that she was breathing quite well and was mobilizing well with physical therapy .\\nTherefore , it was decided at that time that the patient was ready for discharge to rehabilitation on Coumadin , which would be monitored for six months to maintain an INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nThe patient will continue all of her pre-admission medications , though no nonsteroidal analgesics , e.g. , aspirin or ibuprofen , will be given while she is on Coumadin therapy .\\n1. Colace , 100 mg. PO t.i.d.\\n2. Percocet , one to two tablets PO q.3 to 4 hours p.r.n. pain .\\n3. Coumadin with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nPlease prescribe 2 mg. tablets .\\nThe patient will be on Coumadin for six months given her history of pulmonary embolus .\\nDISCHARGE PLAN :\\nCoumadin for six months postoperatively with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nCheck INR three times a week until stable .\\nPlease call the results to Dr. Viennee Ester , the patient 's primary-care physician , who has agreed to follow her INR levels for the remainder of the six months .\\nDr. Viennee Ester is located in Tlandcousti Lo Vuclark , where the patient is from originally .\\nThe patient will call Dr. Overall 's office to arrange a follow-up appointment six weeks from the day of surgery .\\nStaples can be removed 10 to 14 days postoperatively .\\nPlease hold removal if the wound is draining .\\nThe patient may shower once the incision is dry , and may bathe and / or swim after the staples have been removed and there is no wound drainage .\\nPartial weight-bearing with crutches or a walker with posterior hip dislocation precautions for three months following surgery .\\nThese precautions have been explained and demonstrated to the patient .\\nThe patient has been instructed to call Dr. Overall 's office or the orthopedist on call with any questions or concerns about increasing pain , swelling , redness , wound drainage , fevers or chills at 094-897-3231 .\\nKEMA ESTER ,\\nMD DICTATING FOR :\\nElectronically Signed ETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D. 02/22/2003 07:01\\n_____________________________ ETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D.\\nTR :\\npe\\nDD :\\n02/08/2003\\nTD :\\n02/08/2003 6:34 P 737058\\ncc :\\nETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D. ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY ALLMID HEALTH CENTER KEMA ESTER , MILD VIENNEE C.

patient was admitted on February 5 , 1994 and had a central venous line placed in her right subclavian .\\nThe patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 6 , 1994 where she underwent rigid and flexible bronchoscopy and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy .\\nFindings included necrotic debris in the distal trachea at the carina and right mainstem bronchus .\\nEsophageal mucosa was visible through the trachea .\\nHer steroids were weaned and the patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 10 , 1994 where she underwent once again flexible bronchoscopy and flexible esophagoscopy , as well as rigid bronchoscopy .\\nShe then had a transhiatal esophagectomy which was partial , and a substernal gastric interposition as well as a jejunostomy .\\nThe pathology report suggested that the area was involved with radiation esophagitis and focal ulceration .\\nShe remained ventilator dependent postoperatively and was taken to the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit .\\nThe patient was maintained on triple antibiotics which included Vancomycin , ceftazidime and Gentamicin .\\nOn postoperative day two , she had an electroencephalogram which showed no evidence of seizure activity but some generalized slowing .\\nThe patient was seen in consultation by the Neurology Service for her apparent postoperative encephalopathy and episodes of shaking .\\nAn endoscopy was also performed on postoperative day two which showed clean anastomosis .\\nShe received multiple bronchoscopies for pulmonary toilet .\\nThe patient was maintained on tube feedings and the ventilator .\\nA repeat echocardiogram on February 18 showed no significant change of her previous echocardiogram on February 11 , which showed only a small pericardial effusion .\\nA pelvic and abdominal computerized tomography scan on February 18 also showed no evidence of a focal collection or abscess .\\nShe remained intermittently febrile despite numerous antibiotics .\\nHer chest X-ray showed bilateral air space disease , consistent with pneumonia or adult respiratory distress syndrome .\\nShe suffered an episode of renal failure which was felt attributable to aminoglycoside toxicity .\\nHer steroids were weaned .\\nBecause of her prolonged intubation and inability to wean , on February 24 , 1994 , she had a tracheostomy placed .\\nShe remained in a coma .\\nThe blood cultures on February 26 , 1994 grew out Staphylococcus and she was treated for septicemia .\\nHer sputum grew out Pseudomonas aeruginosa as well .\\nThe urine contained yeast and she was treated with amphotericin .\\nOn March 3 , 1994 , a repeat chest and abdominal and pelvis computerized tomography scan showed no evidence of fluid collections .\\nThere was a large left pleural effusion however .\\nThis was drained with a left chest tube .\\nHer sputum then grew out Klebsiella and she was treated with amikacin and imipenem .\\nShe developed a right pleural effusion and had a right chest tube placed .\\nOn March 13 , 1994 , she regained some level of consciousness .\\nShe was able to fix and follow with her eyes , respond to commands .\\nOn March 14 , 1994 , her right lung was pleurodesed .\\nAttempts were made to facilitate her wean by resting her overnight with a combination of propafol and Fentanyl .\\nThis was tried for approximately seven days with no real progress made toward facilitating her vent wean .\\nShe continued to require pressor support in the high 30 's .\\nShe also fell into a coma once again .\\nOn March 31 , 1994 , her pressor support requirement increased and she continued to have tachypneic episodes .\\nOn April 2 , 1994 , she had several episodes of bradycardia and asystole , which responded only to manual ventilation .\\nDiscussions were held with the patient 's family with regard to her previously expressed wishes not to be maintained on artificial life support for extended period of time with little or no hope for recovery .\\nShe had expressed these wishes in writing on several legal forms from the state of Jose Pineston , as well as in discussions with her loved ones .\\nDecision was made in conjunction with the family and Dr. Caslighlourdes to terminate artificial respiratory support .\\nThe patient was removed from the ventilator and placed on a T-piece in her trachea only and was made comfortable with narcotics .\\nHer respirations ceased and she died at 10:15 a.m. on April 2 , 1994 .\\nDISPOSITION / PLAN ON DISCHARGE :\\nThe family will return the body to Sa for burial .\\nThey have declined a post-mortem examination .\\nCA SHUFF ,

Medical Center for angioplasty .\\nPRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :\\nUnstable angina .\\nASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :\\nHypertension .\\nPRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :\\nRight and circumflex angioplasty , cardiac catheterization on 12-6-93 .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThis 75 year old woman was previously admitted here in November 1993 for chronic angina .\\nShe had mild mitral regurgitation and a slightly diminished ejection fraction .\\nThere was a 90% right coronary stenosis which was reduced to 30 with a balloon angioplasty .\\nThere were three lesions in the circumflex , dilated successfully .\\nHowever , the low circumflex marginal vessel could not be crossed with the balloon .\\nShe did well in follow up , being treated for hypertension .\\nIn the end of 1992 , she was feeling well and was taken off Isordil .\\nDuring the winter and early parts of 1993 , the patient noticed increasing fatigue , symptoms of breathlessness and recurrent substernal chest pressure which finally led to admission to Xas Tupalmsmodral Hospital on 11-11-93 with documentation of a subendocardial myocardial infarction and a blood pressure of 210/108 .\\nCardiac catheterization towards the end of the hospitalization showed recurrent right coronary artery stenosis proximally and high grade new stenosis in the distal circumflex at the area of the origin of the previously untreated low circumflex marginal vessel .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\nMedications on transfer were Ecotrin , Vasotec 5 mg , Lopressor 25 bid , Isordil 20 tid , Procardia XL once per day , and Lasix 20 q3 days .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nOn physical examination , the blood pressure was 150 , heart rate 70 , bilateral carotid bruits , grade II systolic ejection murmur , good femoral pulses without bruits , good dorsalis pedis pulses with no posterior tibial pulses felt .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nThe electrocardiogram revealed left bundle branch block .\\nThe electrolytes were normal .\\nThe admission hematocrit was 34 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nOn 12-6-93 , angioplasty was performed of the right coronary artery using a 3 mm solo balloon reducing the stenosis from 80 to approximately 20% with a faint diagonal lucency which was not obstructive .\\nThe new distal circumflex lesion was dilated with a 2.0 mm balloon with a good result and minimal persistent stenosis .\\nBut the low circumflex marginal could not be entered with a wire .\\nThe first marginal had a 505 stenosis at its origin , which was not attempted .\\nThe patient did well post procedure .\\nHe developed a grape sized hematoma over the femoral artery with a loud bruit .\\nThe ultrasound on the day of discharge showed no evidence of pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula .\\nThe blood pressure was 150-170 systolic .\\nThe patient was ambulating without symptoms .\\nADDENDUM :\\nThe admission hematocrit was 34 .\\nThis fell to 25 after the cardiac catheterization without evidence of bleeding and rose to 29 by the time of discharge .\\nDOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :\\nShe was discharged with advice by Cardiac Rehabilitation for gradually increasing activity .\\nShe will be followed by her physician at Cean , Dr. Dieseld Pollejesc , for further pressure management and follow up of the femoral hematoma .\\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE :\\nStable , resolving anemia .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nEcotrin 160 mg per day , Vasotec 5 mg

was seen by Dr. Overall in the office on Aug 22 , 2003 , for follow-up .\\nShe was scheduled to have a total hi p replacement because of progressively worsening pain in the left hip .\\nHer pain was 8/10 .\\nShe limped .\\nShe did not use a cane .\\nShe did require a bannister going up and down stairs .\\nShe had trouble doing shoes and socks .\\nShe could walk limited distances .\\nSince seen by Dr. Overall in August , she had had a brain aneurysm .\\nShe had a mastectomy and had recently developed Parkinson 's.\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\n1. Breast cancer in the right breast , diagnosed in 1995 with negative nodes , treated with excision , recurrence in June , 2001 , further reconstructive surgery .\\nAt the same time , she underwent reduction of t he left breast .\\n2.

Imodium , 2 mg. q.a.m.\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nExamination reveals that the patient is walking with a mild limp .\\nThe left hip is a bit stiff with flexion to 90 degrees .\\nShe has 10 degrees of internal rotation and external rotation .\\nPulses are fine .\\nIMAGING :\\nX-rays were reviewed .\\nThey showed advanced arthritis of the left hip .\\nRECOMMENDATIONS :\\nDr. Etteme Overall recommended that the patient have a total hip replacement on the left side on February 2 , 2003 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nPlease refer to the operative note by Dr. Etteme Overall for details of the procedure .\\nPostoperatively , the patient was transferred to the floor in stable condition for observation , pain control and mobilization .\\nInitially postoperatively , she was doing quite well , though she did require four liters of oxygen postoperatively to maintain her oxygen saturations .\\nIt was hoped that she would wean off the oxygen over the course of the next few hours .\\nHowever , she did require four liters of oxygen all the way through the night to maintain oxygen saturations of 93% .\\nWithout oxygen , she dropped down to the low 80s .\\nGiven the unusual nature of this oxygen requirement , the patient underwent work-up with a chest X-ray , which essentially was normal .\\nAn ABG revealed a normal PCO2 of 32 , but a decrease in PO2- at 62 .\\nTherefore , given her history of breast cancer , the patient was taken for a spiral CT scan and the Medicine Service was consulted at that time .\\nThey agreed with our plan .\\nOn spiral CT scan , a small pulmonary embolus was seen in the right upper lobe and the left low er lobe .\\nShe was started on heparin at that time to maintain a PTT of 60 t o 80 , and was given doses of Coumadin , in addition to the Coumadin she had been given for DVT prophylaxis .\\nWith the recommendation of the medicine te am , we decided to maintain an INR of 2 to 3 with an overlap of heparin when the patient was therapeutic for two to three days .\\nShe continued to do quite well even though we did keep her on bed rest for three days while she was heparinized .\\nHer oxygen saturations continued to improve to the point that she was on room air on postoperative day four with oxygen saturation of 95% .\\nShe was given perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis for 48 hours after surgery .\\nShe was mobilized on postoperative day four , getting out of bed , able to do quite well on her new hip with a minimal amount of pain .\\nShe was given posterior hip dislocation precautions at that time , which she understood quite well .\\nShe continued to be followed by the medical team and was watched very closely by the orthopedic team until we felt comfortable that she was breathing quite well and was mobilizing well with physical therapy .\\nTherefore , it was decided at that time that the patient was ready for discharge to rehabilitation on Coumadin , which would be monitored for six months to maintain an INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nThe patient will continue all of her pre-admission medications , though no nonsteroidal analgesics , e.g. , aspirin or ibuprofen , will be given while she is on Coumadin therapy .\\n1. Colace , 100 mg. PO t.i.d.\\n2. Percocet , one to two tablets PO q.3 to 4 hours p.r.n. pain .\\n3. Coumadin with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nPlease prescribe 2 mg. tablets .\\nThe patient will be on Coumadin for six months given her history of pulmonary embolus .\\nDISCHARGE PLAN :\\nCoumadin for six months postoperatively with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nCheck INR three times a week until stable .\\nPlease call the results to Dr. Viennee Ester , the patient 's primary-care physician , who has agreed to follow her INR levels for the remainder of the six months .\\nDr. Viennee Ester is located in Tlandcousti Lo Vuclark , where the patient is from originally .\\nThe patient will call Dr. Overall 's office to arrange a follow-up appointment six weeks from the day of surgery .\\nStaples can be removed 10 to 14 days postoperatively .\\nPlease hold removal if the wound is draining .\\nThe patient may shower once the incision is dry , and may bathe and / or swim after the staples have been removed and there is no wound drainage .\\nPartial weight-bearing with crutches or a walker with posterior hip dislocation precautions for three months following surgery .\\nThese precautions have been explained and demonstrated to the patient .\\nThe patient has been instructed to call Dr. Overall 's office or the orthopedist on call with any questions or concerns about increasing pain , swelling , redness , wound drainage , fevers or chills at 094-897-3231 .\\nKEMA ESTER ,\\nMD DICTATING FOR :\\nElectronically Signed ETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D. 02/22/2003 07:01\\n_____________________________ ETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D.\\nTR :\\npe\\nDD :\\n02/08/2003\\nTD :\\n02/08/2003 6:34 P 737058\\ncc :\\nETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D. ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY ALLMID HEALTH CENTER KEMA ESTER , MILD VIENNEE C.

initially diagnosed in 1978 with atypical small cell carcinoma of the lung and treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy until 1980 .\\nShe did well for approximately twelve years until she was diagnosed with carcinoid cancer of the same right upper lobe .\\nThis may have been the initial primary cancer although it is unclear at present .\\nBronchoscopy at that time showed an endobronchial tumor of the right upper lobe bronchus and it was felt to be unresectable .\\nShe underwent four treatments of brachytherapy in March through May of 1993 .\\nShe had been doing reasonably well until December of 1993 when she presented with persistent and worsening cough and near strangulation on attempts at eating solids or drinking liquids .\\nA bronchoscopy showed a tracheoesophageal fistula with an opening into the trachea above the carina and no tumor in the right upper lobe .\\nShe has been on total parenteral nutrition and has been nothing by mouth since then .\\nA barium swallow prior to admission showed the presence of a tracheoesophageal fistula with entrance into the right mainstem bronchus below the carina .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\nBronchitis , asthma , carcinoid cancer , no history of coronary artery disease or cerebrovascular accident .\\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY :\\nThe patient is status post appendectomy , hysterectomy and right salpingo-oophorectomy ,

abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended .\\nExtremities :\\nno clubbing , cyanosis or edema .\\nThe rectal examination is guaiac negative with a minimal amount of stool .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was admitted on February 5 , 1994 and had a central venous line placed in her right subclavian .\\nThe patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 6 , 1994 where she underwent rigid and flexible bronchoscopy and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy .\\nFindings included necrotic debris in the distal trachea at the carina and right mainstem bronchus .\\nEsophageal mucosa was visible through the trachea .\\nHer steroids were weaned and the patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 10 , 1994 where she underwent once again flexible bronchoscopy and flexible esophagoscopy , as well as rigid bronchoscopy .\\nShe then had a transhiatal esophagectomy which was partial , and a substernal gastric interposition as well as a jejunostomy .\\nThe pathology report suggested that the area was involved with radiation esophagitis and focal ulceration .\\nShe remained ventilator dependent postoperatively and was taken to the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit .\\nThe patient was maintained on triple antibiotics which included Vancomycin , ceftazidime and Gentamicin .\\nOn postoperative day two , she had an electroencephalogram which showed no evidence of seizure activity but some generalized slowing .\\nThe patient was seen in consultation by the Neurology Service for her apparent postoperative encephalopathy and episodes of shaking .\\nAn endoscopy was also performed on postoperative day two which showed clean anastomosis .\\nShe received multiple bronchoscopies for pulmonary toilet .\\nThe patient was maintained on tube feedings and the ventilator .\\nA repeat echocardiogram on February 18 showed no significant change of her previous echocardiogram on February 11 , which showed only a small pericardial effusion .\\nA pelvic and abdominal computerized tomography scan on February 18 also showed no evidence of a focal collection or abscess .\\nShe remained intermittently febrile despite numerous antibiotics .\\nHer chest X-ray showed bilateral air space disease , consistent with pneumonia or adult respiratory distress syndrome .\\nShe suffered an episode of renal failure which was felt attributable to aminoglycoside toxicity .\\nHer steroids were weaned .\\nBecause of her prolonged intubation and inability to wean , on February 24 , 1994 , she had a tracheostomy placed .\\nShe remained in a coma .\\nThe blood cultures on February 26 , 1994 grew out Staphylococcus and she was treated for septicemia .\\nHer sputum grew out Pseudomonas aeruginosa as well .\\nThe urine contained yeast and she was treated with amphotericin .\\nOn March 3 , 1994 , a repeat chest and abdominal and pelvis computerized tomography scan showed no evidence of fluid collections .\\nThere was a large left pleural effusion however .\\nThis was drained with a left chest tube .\\nHer sputum then grew out Klebsiella and she was treated with amikacin and imipenem .\\nShe developed a right pleural effusion and had a right chest tube placed .\\nOn March 13 , 1994 , she regained some level of consciousness .\\nShe was able to fix and follow with her eyes , respond to commands .\\nOn March 14 , 1994 , her right lung was pleurodesed .\\nAttempts were made to facilitate her wean by resting her overnight with a combination of propafol and Fentanyl .\\nThis was tried for approximately seven days with no real progress made toward facilitating her vent wean .\\nShe continued to require pressor support in the high 30 's .\\nShe also fell into a coma once again .\\nOn March 31 , 1994 , her pressor support requirement increased and she continued to have tachypneic episodes .\\nOn April 2 , 1994 , she had several episodes of bradycardia and asystole , which responded only to manual ventilation .\\nDiscussions were held with the patient 's family with regard to her previously expressed wishes not to be maintained on artificial life support for extended period of time with little or no hope for recovery .\\nShe had expressed these wishes in writing on several legal forms from the state of Jose Pineston , as well as in discussions with her loved ones .\\nDecision was made in conjunction with the family and Dr. Caslighlourdes to terminate artificial respiratory support .\\nThe patient was removed from the ventilator and placed on a T-piece in her trachea only and was made comfortable with narcotics .\\nHer respirations ceased and she died at 10:15 a.m. on April 2 , 1994 .\\nDISPOSITION / PLAN ON DISCHARGE :\\nThe family will return the body to Sa for burial .\\nThey have declined a post-mortem examination .\\nCA SHUFF ,

Medical Center for angioplasty .\\nPRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :\\nUnstable angina .\\nASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :\\nHypertension .\\nPRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :\\nRight and circumflex angioplasty , cardiac catheterization on 12-6-93 .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThis 75 year old woman was previously admitted here in November 1993 for chronic angina .\\nShe had mild mitral regurgitation and a slightly diminished ejection fraction .\\nThere was a 90% right coronary stenosis which was reduced to 30 with a balloon angioplasty .\\nThere were three lesions in the circumflex , dilated successfully .\\nHowever , the low circumflex marginal vessel could not be crossed with the balloon .\\nShe did well in follow up , being treated for hypertension .\\nIn the end of 1992 , she was feeling well and was taken off Isordil .\\nDuring the winter and early parts of 1993 , the patient noticed increasing fatigue , symptoms of breathlessness and recurrent substernal chest pressure which finally led to admission to Xas Tupalmsmodral Hospital on 11-11-93 with documentation of a subendocardial myocardial infarction and a blood pressure of 210/108 .\\nCardiac catheterization towards the end of the hospitalization showed recurrent right coronary artery stenosis proximally and high grade new stenosis in the distal circumflex at the area of the origin of the previously untreated low circumflex marginal vessel .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\nMedications on transfer were Ecotrin , Vasotec 5 mg , Lopressor 25 bid , Isordil 20 tid , Procardia XL once per day , and Lasix 20 q3 days .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nOn physical examination , the blood pressure was 150 , heart rate 70 , bilateral carotid bruits , grade II systolic ejection murmur , good femoral pulses without bruits , good dorsalis pedis pulses with no posterior tibial pulses felt .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nThe electrocardiogram revealed left bundle branch block .\\nThe electrolytes were normal .\\nThe admission hematocrit was 34 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nOn 12-6-93 , angioplasty was performed of the right coronary artery using a 3 mm solo balloon reducing the stenosis from 80 to approximately 20% with a faint diagonal lucency which was not obstructive .\\nThe new distal circumflex lesion was dilated with a 2.0 mm balloon with a good result and minimal persistent stenosis .\\nBut the low circumflex marginal could not be entered with a wire .\\nThe first marginal had a 505 stenosis at its origin , which was not attempted .\\nThe patient did well post procedure .\\nHe developed a grape sized hematoma over the femoral artery with a loud bruit .\\nThe ultrasound on the day of discharge showed no evidence of pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula .\\nThe blood pressure was 150-170 systolic .\\nThe patient was ambulating without symptoms .\\nADDENDUM :\\nThe admission hematocrit was 34 .\\nThis fell to 25 after the cardiac catheterization without evidence of bleeding and rose to 29 by the time of discharge .\\nDOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :\\nShe was discharged with advice by Cardiac Rehabilitation for gradually increasing activity .\\nShe will be followed by her physician at Cean , Dr. Dieseld Pollejesc , for further pressure management and follow up of the femoral hematoma .\\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE :\\nStable , resolving anemia .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nEcotrin 160 mg per day , Vasotec 5 mg per day , Lopressor 25 bid , Isordil 20 tid , Procardia XL 30 per day , Lasix 20 mg q3 days .\\nTELSHEY STUDY , M.D.\\nTR :\\nah / BMot\\nDD :\\n12-9-93\\nTD :\\n12/11/93\\nCC :\\nDr. Telshey Study

was seen by Dr. Overall in the office on Aug 22 , 2003 , for follow-up .\\nShe was scheduled to have a total hi p replacement because of progressively worsening pain in the left hip .\\nHer pain was 8/10 .\\nShe limped .\\nShe did not use a cane .\\nShe did require a bannister going up and down stairs .\\nShe had trouble doing shoes and socks .\\nShe could walk limited distances .\\nSince seen by Dr. Overall in August , she had had a brain aneurysm .\\nShe had a mastectomy and had recently developed Parkinson 's.\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\n1. Breast cancer in the right breast , diagnosed in 1995 with negative nodes , treated with excision , recurrence in June , 2001 , further reconstructive surgery .\\nAt the same time , she underwent reduction of t he left breast .\\n2. History of bipolar disorder , for which she sees Dr. Lettefriscbreun .\\nShe indicates this is stable at this time .\\n3. History of chronic anxiety .\\n4. Sleep apnea treated with UPP surgery in 1997 .\\nShe does not use CPAP .\\n5. History of diverticulitis .\\n6. Intermittent migraines .\\n7. History of prior cervical dysplasia , treated with LEEP procedure .\\n8. Osteoporosis .\\n9. Obsessive-compulsive disorder .\\n10. Panic disorder .\\n11. Aneurysm of the right internal auditory canal , treated with coil insertion .\\n12. Prior renal surgery .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\n1. Eskalith , 300 mg. twice at bedtime .\\n2. Femara , 2.5 mg. at bedtime .\\n3. Primidone , 50 mg. PO q.h.s.\\n4. Diazepam , 1 mg. PO q.h.s.\\n5. Paxil , 37.5 mg. q.a.m.\\n6. Synthroid , 100 mcg. q.a.m.\\n7. Ditropan XL , 10 mg.\\n8. Imodium , 2 mg. q.a.m.\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nExamination reveals that the patient is walking with a mild limp .\\nThe left hip is a bit stiff with flexion to 90 degrees .\\nShe has 10 degrees of internal rotation and external rotation .\\nPulses are fine .\\nIMAGING :\\nX-rays were reviewed .\\nThey showed advanced arthritis of the left hip .\\nRECOMMENDATIONS :\\nDr. Etteme Overall recommended that the patient have a total hip replacement on the left side on February 2 , 2003 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nPlease refer to the operative note by Dr. Etteme Overall for details of the procedure .\\nPostoperatively , the patient was transferred to the floor in stable condition for observation , pain control and mobilization .\\nInitially postoperatively , she was doing quite well , though she did require four liters of oxygen postoperatively to maintain her oxygen saturations .\\nIt was hoped that she would wean off the oxygen over the course of the next few hours .\\nHowever , she did require four liters of oxygen all the way through the night to maintain oxygen saturations of 93% .\\nWithout oxygen , she dropped down to the low 80s .\\nGiven the unusual nature of this oxygen requirement , the patient underwent work-up with a chest X-ray , which essentially was normal .\\nAn ABG revealed a normal PCO2 of 32 , but a decrease in PO2- at 62 .\\nTherefore , given her history of breast cancer , the patient was taken for a spiral CT scan and the Medicine Service was consulted at that time .\\nThey agreed with our plan .\\nOn spiral CT scan , a small pulmonary embolus was seen in the right upper lobe and the left low er lobe .\\nShe was started on heparin at that time to maintain a PTT of 60 t o 80 , and was given doses of Coumadin , in addition to the Coumadin she had been given for DVT prophylaxis .\\nWith the recommendation of the medicine te am , we decided to maintain an INR of 2 to 3 with an overlap of heparin when the patient was therapeutic for two to three days .\\nShe continued to do quite well even though we did keep her on bed rest for three days while she was heparinized .\\nHer oxygen saturations continued to improve to the point that she was on room air on postoperative day four with oxygen saturation of 95% .\\nShe was given perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis for 48 hours after surgery .\\nShe was mobilized on postoperative day four , getting out of bed , able to do quite well on her new hip with a minimal amount of pain .\\nShe was given posterior hip dislocation precautions at that time , which she understood quite well .\\nShe continued to be followed by the medical team and was watched very closely by the orthopedic team until we felt comfortable that she was breathing quite well and was mobilizing well with physical therapy .\\nTherefore , it was decided at that time that the patient was ready for discharge to rehabilitation on Coumadin , which would be monitored for six months to maintain an INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nThe patient will continue all of her pre-admission medications , though no nonsteroidal analgesics , e.g. , aspirin or ibuprofen , will be given while she is on Coumadin therapy .\\n1.

.\\nASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :\\nDiabetes mellitus , pneumonia , sepsis , respiratory failure , pleural effusion , postoperative encephalopathy , postoperative myocardial infarction , and thrombocytopenia .\\nSPECIAL PROCEDURES AND OPERATIONS :\\nFebruary 6 , 1994 , rigid bronchoscopy with biopsy and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy .\\nASSOCIATED PROCEDURES :\\nOn February 10 , 1994 , flexible bronchoscopy , flexible esophagoscopy , rigid bronchoscopy , transhiatal esophagectomy ( partial ) , substernal gastric interposition and jejunostomy .\\nMultiple bronchoscopies , chest tube insertion .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThe patient was a 71 year old white female with a history of carcinoid lung cancer who presented for evaluation of a tracheoesophageal fistula .\\nThe patient was initially diagnosed in 1978 with atypical small cell carcinoma of the lung and treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy until 1980 .\\nShe did well for approximately twelve years until she was diagnosed with carcinoid cancer of the same right upper lobe .\\nThis may have been the initial primary cancer although it is unclear at present .\\nBronchoscopy at that time showed an endobronchial tumor of the right upper lobe bronchus and it was felt to be unresectable .\\nShe underwent four treatments of brachytherapy in March through May of 1993 .\\nShe had been doing reasonably well until December of 1993 when she presented with persistent and worsening cough and near strangulation on attempts at eating solids or drinking liquids .\\nA bronchoscopy showed a tracheoesophageal fistula with an opening into the trachea above the carina and no tumor in the right upper lobe .\\nShe has been on total parenteral nutrition and has been nothing by mouth since then .\\nA barium swallow prior to admission showed the presence of a tracheoesophageal fistula with entrance into the right mainstem bronchus below the carina .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\nBronchitis , asthma , carcinoid cancer , no history of coronary artery disease or cerebrovascular accident .\\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY :\\nThe patient is status post appendectomy , hysterectomy and right salpingo-oophorectomy , bladder suspension and a tumor removal from the right neck .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\nCefuroxime 1.5 grams intravenously q8h , Solu-Medrol 62.5 mg intravenously q8h , Ventolin metered dose inhaler , 2 puffs PO q.i.d. , Pepcid 20 mg intravenously b.i.d.\\nALLERGIES :\\nThe patient is allergic to penicillin , morphine , codeine .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nThe patient is a pleasant white female in no acute distress .\\nShe is afebrile with stable vital signs .\\nThe head , eyes , ears , nose , throat examination was unremarkable .\\nNeck shows a well healed low collar incision without adenopathy or bruit .\\nThe lungs showed mild inspiratory wheeze and moderate expiratory wheezes .\\nBreath sounds are present bilaterally .\\nCardiovascular exam :\\nregular rate and rhythm .\\nThe abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended .\\nExtremities :\\nno clubbing , cyanosis or edema .\\nThe rectal examination is guaiac negative with a minimal amount of stool .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was admitted on February 5 , 1994 and had a central venous line placed in her right subclavian .\\nThe patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 6 , 1994 where she underwent rigid and flexible bronchoscopy and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy .\\nFindings included necrotic debris in the distal trachea at the carina and right mainstem bronchus .\\nEsophageal mucosa was visible through the trachea .\\nHer steroids were weaned and the patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 10 , 1994 where she underwent once again flexible bronchoscopy and flexible esophagoscopy , as well as rigid bronchoscopy .\\nShe then had a transhiatal esophagectomy which was partial , and a substernal gastric interposition as well as a jejunostomy .\\nThe pathology report suggested that the area was involved with radiation esophagitis and focal ulceration .\\nShe remained ventilator dependent postoperatively and was taken to the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit .\\nThe patient was maintained on triple antibiotics which included Vancomycin , ceftazidime and Gentamicin .\\nOn postoperative day two , she had an electroencephalogram which showed no evidence of seizure activity but some generalized slowing .\\nThe patient was seen in consultation by the Neurology Service for her apparent postoperative encephalopathy and episodes of shaking .\\nAn endoscopy was also performed on postoperative day two which showed clean anastomosis .\\nShe received multiple bronchoscopies for pulmonary toilet .\\nThe patient was maintained on tube feedings and the ventilator .\\nA repeat echocardiogram on February 18 showed no significant change of her previous echocardiogram on February 11 , which showed only a small pericardial effusion .\\nA pelvic and abdominal computerized tomography scan on February 18 also showed no evidence of a focal collection or abscess .\\nShe remained intermittently febrile despite numerous antibiotics .\\nHer chest X-ray showed bilateral air space disease , consistent with pneumonia or adult respiratory distress syndrome .\\nShe suffered an episode of renal failure which was felt attributable to aminoglycoside toxicity .\\nHer steroids were weaned .\\nBecause of her prolonged intubation and inability to wean , on February 24 , 1994 , she had a tracheostomy placed .\\nShe remained in a coma .\\nThe blood cultures on February 26 , 1994 grew out Staphylococcus and she was treated for septicemia .\\nHer sputum grew out Pseudomonas aeruginosa as well .\\nThe urine contained yeast and she was treated with amphotericin .\\nOn March 3 , 1994 , a repeat chest and abdominal and pelvis computerized tomography scan showed no evidence of fluid collections .\\nThere was a large left pleural effusion however .\\nThis was drained with a left chest tube .\\nHer sputum then grew out Klebsiella and she was treated with amikacin and imipenem .\\nShe developed a right pleural effusion and had a right chest tube placed .\\nOn March 13 , 1994 , she regained some level of consciousness .\\nShe was able to fix and follow with her eyes , respond to commands .\\nOn March 14 , 1994 , her right lung was pleurodesed .\\nAttempts were made to facilitate her wean by resting her overnight with a combination of propafol and Fentanyl .\\nThis was tried for approximately seven days with no real progress made toward facilitating her vent wean .\\nShe continued to require pressor support in the high 30 's .\\nShe also fell into a coma once again .\\nOn March 31 , 1994 , her pressor support requirement increased and she continued to have tachypneic episodes .\\nOn April 2 , 1994 , she had several episodes of bradycardia and asystole , which responded only to manual ventilation .\\nDiscussions were held with the patient 's family with regard to her previously expressed wishes not to be maintained on artificial life support for extended period of time with little or no hope for recovery .\\nShe had expressed these wishes in writing on several legal forms from the state of Jose Pineston , as well as in discussions with her loved ones .\\nDecision was made in conjunction with the family and Dr. Caslighlourdes to terminate artificial respiratory support .\\nThe patient was removed from the ventilator and placed on a T-piece in her trachea only and was made comfortable with narcotics .\\nHer respirations ceased and she died at 10:15 a.m. on April 2 , 1994 .\\nDISPOSITION / PLAN ON DISCHARGE :\\nThe family will return the body to Sa for burial .\\nThey have declined a post-mortem examination .\\nCA SHUFF ,

catheterization on 12-6-93 .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThis 75 year old woman was previously admitted here in November 1993 for chronic angina .\\nShe had mild mitral regurgitation and a slightly diminished ejection fraction .\\nThere was a 90% right coronary stenosis which was reduced to 30 with a balloon angioplasty .\\nThere were three lesions in the circumflex , dilated successfully .\\nHowever , the low circumflex marginal vessel could not be crossed with the balloon .\\nShe did well in follow up , being treated for hypertension .\\nIn the end of 1992 , she was feeling well and was taken off Isordil .\\nDuring the winter and early parts of 1993 , the patient noticed increasing fatigue , symptoms of breathlessness and recurrent substernal chest pressure which finally led to admission to Xas Tupalmsmodral Hospital on 11-11-93 with documentation of a subendocardial myocardial infarction and a blood pressure of 210/108 .\\nCardiac catheterization towards the end of the hospitalization showed recurrent right coronary artery stenosis proximally and high grade new stenosis in the distal circumflex at the area of the origin of the previously untreated low circumflex marginal vessel .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\nMedications on transfer were Ecotrin , Vasotec 5 mg , Lopressor 25 bid , Isordil 20 tid , Procardia XL once per day , and Lasix 20 q3 days .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nOn physical examination , the blood pressure was 150 , heart rate 70 , bilateral carotid bruits , grade II systolic ejection murmur , good femoral pulses without bruits , good dorsalis pedis pulses with no posterior tibial pulses felt .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nThe electrocardiogram revealed left bundle branch block .\\nThe electrolytes were normal .\\nThe admission hematocrit was 34 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nOn 12-6-93 , angioplasty was performed of the right coronary artery using a 3 mm solo balloon reducing the stenosis from 80 to approximately 20% with a faint diagonal lucency which was not obstructive .\\nThe new distal circumflex lesion was dilated with a 2.0 mm balloon with a good result and minimal persistent stenosis .\\nBut the low circumflex marginal could not be entered with a wire .\\nThe first marginal had a 505 stenosis at its origin , which was not attempted .\\nThe patient did well post procedure .\\nHe developed a grape sized hematoma over the femoral artery with a loud bruit .\\nThe ultrasound on the day of discharge showed no evidence of pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula .\\nThe blood pressure was 150-170 systolic .\\nThe patient was ambulating without symptoms .\\nADDENDUM :\\nThe admission hematocrit was 34 .\\nThis fell to 25 after the cardiac catheterization without evidence of bleeding and rose to 29 by the time of discharge .\\nDOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :\\nShe was discharged with advice by Cardiac Rehabilitation for gradually increasing activity .\\nShe will be followed by her physician at Cean , Dr. Dieseld Pollejesc , for further pressure management and follow up of the femoral hematoma .\\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE :\\nStable , resolving anemia .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nEcotrin 160 mg per day , Vasotec 5 mg per day , Lopressor 25 bid , Isordil 20 tid , Procardia XL 30 per day , Lasix 20 mg q3 days .\\nTELSHEY STUDY , M.D.\\nTR :\\nah / BMot\\nDD :\\n12-9-93\\nTD :\\n12/11/93\\nCC :\\nDr. Telshey Study

was seen by Dr. Overall in the office on Aug 22 , 2003 , for follow-up .\\nShe was scheduled to have a total hi p replacement because of progressively worsening pain in the left hip .\\nHer pain was 8/10 .\\nShe limped .\\nShe did not use a cane .\\nShe did require a bannister going up and down stairs .\\nShe had trouble doing shoes and socks .\\nShe could walk limited distances .\\nSince seen by Dr. Overall in August , she had had a brain aneurysm .\\nShe had a mastectomy and had recently developed Parkinson 's.\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\n1. Breast cancer in the right breast , diagnosed in 1995 with negative nodes , treated with excision , recurrence in June , 2001 , further reconstructive surgery .\\nAt the same time , she underwent reduction of t he left breast .\\n2.

Imodium , 2 mg. q.a.m.\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nExamination reveals that the patient is walking with a mild limp .\\nThe left hip is a bit stiff with flexion to 90 degrees .\\nShe has 10 degrees of internal rotation and external rotation .\\nPulses are fine .\\nIMAGING :\\nX-rays were reviewed .\\nThey showed advanced arthritis of the left hip .\\nRECOMMENDATIONS :\\nDr. Etteme Overall recommended that the patient have a total hip replacement on the left side on February 2 , 2003 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nPlease refer to the operative note by Dr. Etteme Overall for details of the procedure .\\nPostoperatively , the patient was transferred to the floor in stable condition for observation , pain control and mobilization .\\nInitially postoperatively , she was doing quite well , though she did require four liters of oxygen postoperatively to maintain her oxygen saturations .\\nIt was hoped that she would wean off the oxygen over the course of the next few hours .\\nHowever , she did require four liters of oxygen all the way through the night to maintain oxygen saturations of 93% .\\nWithout oxygen , she dropped down to the low 80s .\\nGiven the unusual nature of this oxygen requirement , the patient underwent work-up with a chest X-ray , which essentially was normal .\\nAn ABG revealed a normal PCO2 of 32 , but a decrease in PO2- at 62 .\\nTherefore , given her history of breast cancer , the patient was taken for a spiral CT scan and the Medicine Service was consulted at that time .\\nThey agreed with our plan .\\nOn spiral CT scan , a small pulmonary embolus was seen in the right upper lobe and the left low er lobe .\\nShe was started on heparin at that time to maintain a PTT of 60 t o 80 , and was given doses of Coumadin , in addition to the Coumadin she had been given for DVT prophylaxis .\\nWith the recommendation of the medicine te am , we decided to maintain an INR of 2 to 3 with an overlap of heparin when the patient was therapeutic for two to three days .\\nShe continued to do quite well even though we did keep her on bed rest for three days while she was heparinized .\\nHer oxygen saturations continued to improve to the point that she was on room air on postoperative day four with oxygen saturation of 95% .\\nShe was given perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis for 48 hours after surgery .\\nShe was mobilized on postoperative day four , getting out of bed , able to do quite well on her new hip with a minimal amount of pain .\\nShe was given posterior hip dislocation precautions at that time , which she understood quite well .\\nShe continued to be followed by the medical team and was watched very closely by the orthopedic team until we felt comfortable that she was breathing quite well and was mobilizing well with physical therapy .\\nTherefore , it was decided at that time that the patient was ready for discharge to rehabilitation on Coumadin , which would be monitored for six months to maintain an INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nThe patient will continue all of her pre-admission medications , though no nonsteroidal analgesics , e.g. , aspirin or ibuprofen , will be given while she is on Coumadin therapy .\\n1. Colace , 100 mg. PO t.i.d.\\n2. Percocet , one to two tablets PO q.3 to 4 hours p.r.n. pain .\\n3. Coumadin with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nPlease prescribe 2 mg. tablets .\\nThe patient will be on Coumadin for six months given her history of pulmonary embolus .\\nDISCHARGE PLAN :\\nCoumadin for six months postoperatively with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nCheck INR three times a week until stable .\\nPlease call the results to Dr. Viennee Ester , the patient 's primary-care physician , who has agreed to follow her INR levels for the remainder of the six months .\\nDr. Viennee Ester is located in Tlandcousti Lo Vuclark , where the patient is from originally .\\nThe patient will call Dr. Overall 's office to arrange a follow-up appointment six weeks from the day of surgery .\\nStaples can be removed 10 to 14 days postoperatively .\\nPlease hold removal if the wound is draining .\\nThe patient may shower once the incision is dry , and may bathe and / or swim after the staples have been removed and there is no wound drainage .\\nPartial weight-bearing with crutches or a walker with posterior hip dislocation precautions for three months following surgery .\\nThese precautions have been explained and demonstrated to the patient .\\nThe patient has been instructed to call Dr. Overall 's office or the orthopedist on call with any questions or concerns about increasing pain , swelling , redness , wound drainage , fevers or chills at 094-897-3231 .\\nKEMA ESTER ,\\nMD DICTATING FOR :\\nElectronically Signed ETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D. 02/22/2003 07:01\\n_____________________________ ETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D.\\nTR :\\npe\\nDD :\\n02/08/2003\\nTD :\\n02/08/2003 6:34 P 737058\\ncc :\\nETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D. ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY ALLMID HEALTH CENTER KEMA ESTER , MILD VIENNEE C.

and flexible bronchoscopy and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy .\\nFindings included necrotic debris in the distal trachea at the carina and right mainstem bronchus .\\nEsophageal mucosa was visible through the trachea .\\nHer steroids were weaned and the patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 10 , 1994 where she underwent once again flexible bronchoscopy and flexible esophagoscopy , as well as rigid bronchoscopy .\\nShe then had a transhiatal esophagectomy which was partial , and a substernal gastric interposition as well as a jejunostomy .\\nThe pathology report suggested that the area was involved with radiation esophagitis and focal ulceration .\\nShe remained ventilator dependent postoperatively and was taken to the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit .\\nThe patient was maintained on triple antibiotics which included Vancomycin , ceftazidime and Gentamicin .\\nOn postoperative day two , she had an electroencephalogram which showed no evidence of seizure activity but some generalized slowing .\\nThe patient was seen in consultation by the Neurology Service for her apparent postoperative encephalopathy and episodes of shaking .\\nAn endoscopy was also performed on postoperative day two which showed clean anastomosis .\\nShe received multiple bronchoscopies for pulmonary toilet .\\nThe patient was maintained on tube feedings and the ventilator .\\nA repeat echocardiogram on February 18 showed no significant change of her previous echocardiogram on February 11 , which showed only a small pericardial effusion .\\nA pelvic and abdominal computerized tomography scan on February 18 also showed no evidence of a focal collection or abscess .\\nShe remained intermittently febrile despite numerous antibiotics .\\nHer chest X-ray showed bilateral air space disease , consistent with pneumonia or adult respiratory distress syndrome .\\nShe suffered an episode of renal failure which was felt attributable to aminoglycoside toxicity .\\nHer steroids were weaned .\\nBecause of her prolonged intubation and inability to wean , on February 24 , 1994 , she had a tracheostomy placed .\\nShe remained in a coma .\\nThe blood cultures on February 26 , 1994 grew out Staphylococcus and she was treated for septicemia .\\nHer sputum grew out Pseudomonas aeruginosa as well .\\nThe urine contained yeast and she was treated with amphotericin .\\nOn March 3 , 1994 , a repeat chest and abdominal and pelvis computerized tomography scan showed no evidence of fluid collections .\\nThere was a large left pleural effusion however .\\nThis was drained with a left chest tube .\\nHer sputum then grew out Klebsiella and she was treated with amikacin and imipenem .\\nShe developed a right pleural effusion and had a right chest tube placed .\\nOn March 13 , 1994 , she regained some level of consciousness .\\nShe was able to fix and follow with her eyes , respond to commands .\\nOn March 14 , 1994 , her right lung was pleurodesed .\\nAttempts were made to facilitate her wean by resting her overnight with a combination of propafol and Fentanyl .\\nThis was tried for approximately seven days with no real progress made toward facilitating her vent wean .\\nShe continued to require pressor support in the high 30 's .\\nShe also fell into a coma once again .\\nOn March 31 , 1994 , her pressor support requirement increased and she continued to have tachypneic episodes .\\nOn April 2 , 1994 , she had several episodes of bradycardia and asystole , which responded only to manual ventilation .\\nDiscussions were held with the patient 's family with regard to her previously expressed wishes not to be maintained on artificial life support for extended period of time with little or no hope for recovery .\\nShe had expressed these wishes in writing on several legal forms from the state of Jose Pineston , as well as in discussions with her loved ones .\\nDecision was made in conjunction with the family and Dr. Caslighlourdes to terminate artificial respiratory support .\\nThe patient was removed from the ventilator and placed on a T-piece in her trachea only and was made comfortable with narcotics .\\nHer respirations ceased and she died at 10:15 a.m. on April 2 , 1994 .\\nDISPOSITION / PLAN ON DISCHARGE :\\nThe family will return the body to Sa for burial .\\nThey have declined a post-mortem examination .\\nCA SHUFF ,

Medical Center for angioplasty .\\nPRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :\\nUnstable angina .\\nASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :\\nHypertension .\\nPRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :\\nRight and circumflex angioplasty , cardiac catheterization on 12-6-93 .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThis 75 year old woman was previously admitted here in November 1993 for chronic angina .\\nShe had mild mitral regurgitation and a slightly diminished ejection fraction .\\nThere was a 90% right coronary stenosis which was reduced to 30 with a balloon angioplasty .\\nThere were three lesions in the circumflex , dilated successfully .\\nHowever , the low circumflex marginal vessel could not be crossed with the balloon .\\nShe did well in follow up , being treated for hypertension .\\nIn the end of 1992 , she was feeling well and was taken off Isordil .\\nDuring the winter and early parts of 1993 , the patient noticed increasing fatigue , symptoms of breathlessness and recurrent substernal chest pressure which finally led to admission to Xas Tupalmsmodral Hospital on 11-11-93 with documentation of a subendocardial myocardial infarction and a blood pressure of 210/108 .\\nCardiac catheterization towards the end of the hospitalization showed recurrent right coronary artery stenosis proximally and high grade new stenosis in the distal circumflex at the area of the origin of the previously untreated low circumflex marginal vessel .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\nMedications on transfer were Ecotrin , Vasotec 5 mg , Lopressor 25 bid , Isordil 20 tid , Procardia XL once per day , and Lasix 20 q3 days .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nOn physical examination , the blood pressure was 150 , heart rate 70 , bilateral carotid bruits , grade II systolic ejection murmur , good femoral pulses without bruits , good dorsalis pedis pulses with no posterior tibial pulses felt .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nThe electrocardiogram revealed left bundle branch block .\\nThe electrolytes were normal .\\nThe admission hematocrit was 34 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nOn 12-6-93 , angioplasty was performed of the right coronary artery using a 3 mm solo balloon reducing the stenosis from 80 to approximately 20% with a faint diagonal lucency which was not obstructive .\\nThe new distal circumflex lesion was dilated with a 2.0 mm balloon with a good result and minimal persistent stenosis .\\nBut the low circumflex marginal could not be entered with a wire .\\nThe first marginal had a 505 stenosis at its origin , which was not attempted .\\nThe patient did well post procedure .\\nHe developed a grape sized hematoma over the femoral artery with a loud bruit .\\nThe ultrasound on the day of discharge showed no evidence of pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula .\\nThe blood pressure was 150-170 systolic .\\nThe patient was ambulating without symptoms .\\nADDENDUM :\\nThe admission hematocrit was 34 .\\nThis fell to 25 after the cardiac catheterization without evidence of bleeding and rose to 29 by the time of discharge .\\nDOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :\\nShe was discharged with advice by Cardiac Rehabilitation for gradually increasing activity .\\nShe will be followed by her physician at Cean , Dr. Dieseld Pollejesc , for further pressure management and follow up of the femoral hematoma .\\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE :\\nStable , resolving anemia .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nEcotrin 160 mg per day , Vasotec 5 mg

was seen by Dr. Overall in the office on Aug 22 , 2003 , for follow-up .\\nShe was scheduled to have a total hi p replacement because of progressively worsening pain in the left hip .\\nHer pain was 8/10 .\\nShe limped .\\nShe did not use a cane .\\nShe did require a bannister going up and down stairs .\\nShe had trouble doing shoes and socks .\\nShe could walk limited distances .\\nSince seen by Dr. Overall in August , she had had a brain aneurysm .\\nShe had a mastectomy and had recently developed Parkinson 's.\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\n1. Breast cancer in the right breast , diagnosed in 1995 with negative nodes , treated with excision , recurrence in June , 2001 , further reconstructive surgery .\\nAt the same time , she underwent reduction of t he left breast .\\n2. History of bipolar disorder , for which she sees Dr. Lettefriscbreun .\\nShe indicates this is stable at this time .\\n3. History of chronic anxiety .\\n4. Sleep apnea treated with UPP surgery in 1997 .\\nShe does not use CPAP .\\n5. History of diverticulitis .\\n6. Intermittent migraines .\\n7.

Imodium , 2 mg. q.a.m.\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nExamination reveals that the patient is walking with a mild limp .\\nThe left hip is a bit stiff with flexion to 90 degrees .\\nShe has 10 degrees of internal rotation and external rotation .\\nPulses are fine .\\nIMAGING :\\nX-rays were reviewed .\\nThey showed advanced arthritis of the left hip .\\nRECOMMENDATIONS :\\nDr. Etteme Overall recommended that the patient have a total hip replacement on the left side on February 2 , 2003 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nPlease refer to the operative note by Dr. Etteme Overall for details of the procedure .\\nPostoperatively , the patient was transferred to the floor in stable condition for observation , pain control and mobilization .\\nInitially postoperatively , she was doing quite well , though she did require four liters of oxygen postoperatively to maintain her oxygen saturations .\\nIt was hoped that she would wean off the oxygen over the course of the next few hours .\\nHowever , she did require four liters of oxygen all the way through the night to maintain oxygen saturations of 93% .\\nWithout oxygen , she dropped down to the low 80s .\\nGiven the unusual nature of this oxygen requirement , the patient underwent work-up with a chest X-ray , which essentially was normal .\\nAn ABG revealed a normal PCO2 of 32 , but a decrease in PO2- at 62 .\\nTherefore , given her history of breast cancer , the patient was taken for a spiral CT scan and the Medicine Service was consulted at that time .\\nThey agreed with our plan .\\nOn spiral CT scan , a small pulmonary embolus was seen in the right upper lobe and the left low er lobe .\\nShe was started on heparin at that time to maintain a PTT of 60 t o 80 , and was given doses of Coumadin , in addition to the Coumadin she had been given for DVT prophylaxis .\\nWith the recommendation of the medicine te am , we decided to maintain an INR of 2 to 3 with an overlap of heparin when the patient was therapeutic for two to three days .\\nShe continued to do quite well even though we did keep her on bed rest for three days while she was heparinized .\\nHer oxygen saturations continued to improve to the point that she was on room air on postoperative day four with oxygen saturation of 95% .\\nShe was given perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis for 48 hours after surgery .\\nShe was mobilized on postoperative day four , getting out of bed , able to do quite well on her new hip with a minimal amount of pain .\\nShe was given posterior hip dislocation precautions at that time , which she understood quite well .\\nShe continued to be followed by the medical team and was watched very closely by the orthopedic team until we felt comfortable that she was breathing quite well and was mobilizing well with physical therapy .\\nTherefore , it was decided at that time that the patient was ready for discharge to rehabilitation on Coumadin , which would be monitored for six months to maintain an INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nThe patient will continue all of her pre-admission medications , though no nonsteroidal analgesics , e.g. , aspirin or ibuprofen , will be given while she is on Coumadin therapy .\\n1. Colace , 100 mg. PO t.i.d.\\n2. Percocet , one to two tablets PO q.3 to 4 hours p.r.n. pain .\\n3. Coumadin with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nPlease prescribe 2 mg. tablets .\\nThe patient will be on Coumadin for six months given her history of pulmonary embolus .\\nDISCHARGE PLAN :\\nCoumadin for six months postoperatively with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nCheck INR three times a week until stable .\\nPlease call the results to Dr. Viennee Ester , the patient 's primary-care physician , who has agreed to follow her INR levels for the remainder of the six months .\\nDr. Viennee Ester is located in Tlandcousti Lo Vuclark , where the patient is from originally .\\nThe patient will call Dr. Overall 's office to arrange a follow-up appointment six weeks from the day of surgery .\\nStaples can be removed 10 to 14 days postoperatively .\\nPlease hold removal if the wound is draining .\\nThe patient may shower once the incision is dry , and may bathe and / or swim after the staples have been removed and there is no wound drainage .\\nPartial weight-bearing with crutches or a walker with posterior hip dislocation precautions for three months following surgery .\\nThese precautions have been explained and demonstrated to the patient .\\nThe patient has been instructed to call Dr. Overall 's office or the orthopedist on call with any questions or concerns about increasing pain , swelling , redness , wound drainage , fevers or chills at 094-897-3231 .\\nKEMA ESTER ,\\nMD DICTATING FOR :\\nElectronically Signed ETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D. 02/22/2003 07:01\\n_____________________________ ETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D.\\nTR :\\npe\\nDD :\\n02/08/2003\\nTD :\\n02/08/2003 6:34 P 737058\\ncc :\\nETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D. ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY ALLMID HEALTH CENTER KEMA ESTER , MILD VIENNEE C.

initially diagnosed in 1978 with atypical small cell carcinoma of the lung and treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy until 1980 .\\nShe did well for approximately twelve years until she was diagnosed with carcinoid cancer of the same right upper lobe .\\nThis may have been the initial primary cancer although it is unclear at present .\\nBronchoscopy at that time showed an endobronchial tumor of the right upper lobe bronchus and it was felt to be unresectable .\\nShe underwent four treatments of brachytherapy in March through May of 1993 .\\nShe had been doing reasonably well until December of 1993 when she presented with persistent and worsening cough and near strangulation on attempts at eating solids or drinking liquids .\\nA bronchoscopy showed a tracheoesophageal fistula with an opening into the trachea above the carina and no tumor in the right upper lobe .\\nShe has been on total parenteral nutrition and has been nothing by mouth since then .\\nA barium swallow prior to admission showed the presence of a tracheoesophageal fistula with entrance into the right mainstem bronchus below the carina .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\nBronchitis , asthma , carcinoid cancer , no history of coronary artery disease or cerebrovascular accident .\\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY :\\nThe patient is status post appendectomy , hysterectomy and right salpingo-oophorectomy ,

abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended .\\nExtremities :\\nno clubbing , cyanosis or edema .\\nThe rectal examination is guaiac negative with a minimal amount of stool .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was admitted on February 5 , 1994 and had a central venous line placed in her right subclavian .\\nThe patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 6 , 1994 where she underwent rigid and flexible bronchoscopy and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy .\\nFindings included necrotic debris in the distal trachea at the carina and right mainstem bronchus .\\nEsophageal mucosa was visible through the trachea .\\nHer steroids were weaned and the patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 10 , 1994 where she underwent once again flexible bronchoscopy and flexible esophagoscopy , as well as rigid bronchoscopy .\\nShe then had a transhiatal esophagectomy which was partial , and a substernal gastric interposition as well as a jejunostomy .\\nThe pathology report suggested that the area was involved with radiation esophagitis and focal ulceration .\\nShe remained ventilator dependent postoperatively and was taken to the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit .\\nThe patient was maintained on triple antibiotics which included Vancomycin , ceftazidime and Gentamicin .\\nOn postoperative day two , she had an electroencephalogram which showed no evidence of seizure activity but some generalized slowing .\\nThe patient was seen in consultation by the Neurology Service for her apparent postoperative encephalopathy and episodes of shaking .\\nAn endoscopy was also performed on postoperative day two which showed clean anastomosis .\\nShe received multiple bronchoscopies for pulmonary toilet .\\nThe patient was maintained on tube feedings and the ventilator .\\nA repeat echocardiogram on February 18 showed no significant change of her previous echocardiogram on February 11 , which showed only a small pericardial effusion .\\nA pelvic and abdominal computerized tomography scan on February 18 also showed no evidence of a focal collection or abscess .\\nShe remained intermittently febrile despite numerous antibiotics .\\nHer chest X-ray showed bilateral air space disease , consistent with pneumonia or adult respiratory distress syndrome .\\nShe suffered an episode of renal failure which was felt attributable to aminoglycoside toxicity .\\nHer steroids were weaned .\\nBecause of her prolonged intubation and inability to wean , on February 24 , 1994 , she had a tracheostomy placed .\\nShe remained in a coma .\\nThe blood cultures on February 26 , 1994 grew out Staphylococcus and she was treated for septicemia .\\nHer sputum grew out Pseudomonas aeruginosa as well .\\nThe urine contained yeast and she was treated with amphotericin .\\nOn March 3 , 1994 , a repeat chest and abdominal and pelvis computerized tomography scan showed no evidence of fluid collections .\\nThere was a large left pleural effusion however .\\nThis was drained with a left chest tube .\\nHer sputum then grew out Klebsiella and she was treated with amikacin and imipenem .\\nShe developed a right pleural effusion and had a right chest tube placed .\\nOn March 13 , 1994 , she regained some level of consciousness .\\nShe was able to fix and follow with her eyes , respond to commands .\\nOn March 14 , 1994 , her right lung was pleurodesed .\\nAttempts were made to facilitate her wean by resting her overnight with a combination of propafol and Fentanyl .\\nThis was tried for approximately seven days with no real progress made toward facilitating her vent wean .\\nShe continued to require pressor support in the high 30 's .\\nShe also fell into a coma once again .\\nOn March 31 , 1994 , her pressor support requirement increased and she continued to have tachypneic episodes .\\nOn April 2 , 1994 , she had several episodes of bradycardia and asystole , which responded only to manual ventilation .\\nDiscussions were held with the patient 's family with regard to her previously expressed wishes not to be maintained on artificial life support for extended period of time with little or no hope for recovery .\\nShe had expressed these wishes in writing on several legal forms from the state of Jose Pineston , as well as in discussions with her loved ones .\\nDecision was made in conjunction with the family and Dr. Caslighlourdes to terminate artificial respiratory support .\\nThe patient was removed from the ventilator and placed on a T-piece in her trachea only and was made comfortable with narcotics .\\nHer respirations ceased and she died at 10:15 a.m. on April 2 , 1994 .\\nDISPOSITION / PLAN ON DISCHARGE :\\nThe family will return the body to Sa for burial .\\nThey have declined a post-mortem examination .\\nCA SHUFF ,

catheterization on 12-6-93 .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThis 75 year old woman was previously admitted here in November 1993 for chronic angina .\\nShe had mild mitral regurgitation and a slightly diminished ejection fraction .\\nThere was a 90% right coronary stenosis which was reduced to 30 with a balloon angioplasty .\\nThere were three lesions in the circumflex , dilated successfully .\\nHowever , the low circumflex marginal vessel could not be crossed with the balloon .\\nShe did well in follow up , being treated for hypertension .\\nIn the end of 1992 , she was feeling well and was taken off Isordil .\\nDuring the winter and early parts of 1993 , the patient noticed increasing fatigue , symptoms of breathlessness and recurrent substernal chest pressure which finally led to admission to Xas Tupalmsmodral Hospital on 11-11-93 with documentation of a subendocardial myocardial infarction and a blood pressure of 210/108 .\\nCardiac catheterization towards the end of the hospitalization showed recurrent right coronary artery stenosis proximally and high grade new stenosis in the distal circumflex at the area of the origin of the previously untreated low circumflex marginal vessel .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\nMedications on transfer were Ecotrin , Vasotec 5 mg , Lopressor 25 bid , Isordil 20 tid , Procardia XL once per day , and Lasix 20 q3 days .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nOn physical examination , the blood pressure was 150 , heart rate 70 , bilateral carotid bruits , grade II systolic ejection murmur , good femoral pulses without bruits , good dorsalis pedis pulses with no posterior tibial pulses felt .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nThe electrocardiogram revealed left bundle branch block .\\nThe electrolytes were normal .\\nThe admission hematocrit was 34 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nOn 12-6-93 , angioplasty was performed of the right coronary artery using a 3 mm solo balloon reducing the stenosis from 80 to approximately 20% with a faint diagonal lucency which was not obstructive .\\nThe new distal circumflex lesion was dilated with a 2.0 mm balloon with a good result and minimal persistent stenosis .\\nBut the low circumflex marginal could not be entered with a wire .\\nThe first marginal had a 505 stenosis at its origin , which was not attempted .\\nThe patient did well post procedure .\\nHe developed a grape sized hematoma over the femoral artery with a loud bruit .\\nThe ultrasound on the day of discharge showed no evidence of pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula .\\nThe blood pressure was 150-170 systolic .\\nThe patient was ambulating without symptoms .\\nADDENDUM :\\nThe admission hematocrit was 34 .\\nThis fell to 25 after the cardiac catheterization without evidence of bleeding and rose to 29 by the time of discharge .\\nDOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :\\nShe was discharged with advice by Cardiac Rehabilitation for gradually increasing activity .\\nShe will be followed by her physician at Cean , Dr. Dieseld Pollejesc , for further pressure management and follow up of the femoral hematoma .\\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE :\\nStable , resolving anemia .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nEcotrin 160 mg per day , Vasotec 5 mg per day , Lopressor 25 bid , Isordil 20 tid , Procardia XL 30 per day , Lasix 20 mg q3 days .\\nTELSHEY STUDY , M.D.\\nTR :\\nah / BMot\\nDD :\\n12-9-93\\nTD :\\n12/11/93\\nCC :\\nDr. Telshey Study

was seen by Dr. Overall in the office on Aug 22 , 2003 , for follow-up .\\nShe was scheduled to have a total hi p replacement because of progressively worsening pain in the left hip .\\nHer pain was 8/10 .\\nShe limped .\\nShe did not use a cane .\\nShe did require a bannister going up and down stairs .\\nShe had trouble doing shoes and socks .\\nShe could walk limited distances .\\nSince seen by Dr. Overall in August , she had had a brain aneurysm .\\nShe had a mastectomy and had recently developed Parkinson 's.\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\n1. Breast cancer in the right breast , diagnosed in 1995 with negative nodes , treated with excision , recurrence in June , 2001 , further reconstructive surgery .\\nAt the same time , she underwent reduction of t he left breast .\\n2.

Imodium , 2 mg. q.a.m.\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nExamination reveals that the patient is walking with a mild limp .\\nThe left hip is a bit stiff with flexion to 90 degrees .\\nShe has 10 degrees of internal rotation and external rotation .\\nPulses are fine .\\nIMAGING :\\nX-rays were reviewed .\\nThey showed advanced arthritis of the left hip .\\nRECOMMENDATIONS :\\nDr. Etteme Overall recommended that the patient have a total hip replacement on the left side on February 2 , 2003 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nPlease refer to the operative note by Dr. Etteme Overall for details of the procedure .\\nPostoperatively , the patient was transferred to the floor in stable condition for observation , pain control and mobilization .\\nInitially postoperatively , she was doing quite well , though she did require four liters of oxygen postoperatively to maintain her oxygen saturations .\\nIt was hoped that she would wean off the oxygen over the course of the next few hours .\\nHowever , she did require four liters of oxygen all the way through the night to maintain oxygen saturations of 93% .\\nWithout oxygen , she dropped down to the low 80s .\\nGiven the unusual nature of this oxygen requirement , the patient underwent work-up with a chest X-ray , which essentially was normal .\\nAn ABG revealed a normal PCO2 of 32 , but a decrease in PO2- at 62 .\\nTherefore , given her history of breast cancer , the patient was taken for a spiral CT scan and the Medicine Service was consulted at that time .\\nThey agreed with our plan .\\nOn spiral CT scan , a small pulmonary embolus was seen in the right upper lobe and the left low er lobe .\\nShe was started on heparin at that time to maintain a PTT of 60 t o 80 , and was given doses of Coumadin , in addition to the Coumadin she had been given for DVT prophylaxis .\\nWith the recommendation of the medicine te am , we decided to maintain an INR of 2 to 3 with an overlap of heparin when the patient was therapeutic for two to three days .\\nShe continued to do quite well even though we did keep her on bed rest for three days while she was heparinized .\\nHer oxygen saturations continued to improve to the point that she was on room air on postoperative day four with oxygen saturation of 95% .\\nShe was given perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis for 48 hours after surgery .\\nShe was mobilized on postoperative day four , getting out of bed , able to do quite well on her new hip with a minimal amount of pain .\\nShe was given posterior hip dislocation precautions at that time , which she understood quite well .\\nShe continued to be followed by the medical team and was watched very closely by the orthopedic team until we felt comfortable that she was breathing quite well and was mobilizing well with physical therapy .\\nTherefore , it was decided at that time that the patient was ready for discharge to rehabilitation on Coumadin , which would be monitored for six months to maintain an INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nThe patient will continue all of her pre-admission medications , though no nonsteroidal analgesics , e.g. , aspirin or ibuprofen , will be given while she is on Coumadin therapy .\\n1. Colace , 100 mg. PO t.i.d.\\n2. Percocet , one to two tablets PO q.3 to 4 hours p.r.n. pain .\\n3. Coumadin with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nPlease prescribe 2 mg. tablets .\\nThe patient will be on Coumadin for six months given her history of pulmonary embolus .\\nDISCHARGE PLAN :\\nCoumadin for six months postoperatively with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nCheck INR three times a week until stable .\\nPlease call the results to Dr. Viennee Ester , the patient 's primary-care physician , who has agreed to follow her INR levels for the remainder of the six months .\\nDr. Viennee Ester is located in Tlandcousti Lo Vuclark , where the patient is from originally .\\nThe patient will call Dr. Overall 's office to arrange a follow-up appointment six weeks from the day of surgery .\\nStaples can be removed 10 to 14 days postoperatively .\\nPlease hold removal if the wound is draining .\\nThe patient may shower once the incision is dry , and may bathe and / or swim after the staples have been removed and there is no wound drainage .\\nPartial weight-bearing with crutches or a walker with posterior hip dislocation precautions for three months following surgery .\\nThese precautions have been explained and demonstrated to the patient .\\nThe patient has been instructed to call Dr. Overall 's office or the orthopedist on call with any questions or concerns about increasing pain , swelling , redness , wound drainage , fevers or chills at 094-897-3231 .\\nKEMA ESTER ,\\nMD DICTATING FOR :\\nElectronically Signed ETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D. 02/22/2003 07:01\\n_____________________________ ETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D.\\nTR :\\npe\\nDD :\\n02/08/2003\\nTD :\\n02/08/2003 6:34 P 737058\\ncc :\\nETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D. ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY ALLMID HEALTH CENTER KEMA ESTER , MILD VIENNEE C.

and flexible bronchoscopy and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy .\\nFindings included necrotic debris in the distal trachea at the carina and right mainstem bronchus .\\nEsophageal mucosa was visible through the trachea .\\nHer steroids were weaned and the patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 10 , 1994 where she underwent once again flexible bronchoscopy and flexible esophagoscopy , as well as rigid bronchoscopy .\\nShe then had a transhiatal esophagectomy which was partial , and a substernal gastric interposition as well as a jejunostomy .\\nThe pathology report suggested that the area was involved with radiation esophagitis and focal ulceration .\\nShe remained ventilator dependent postoperatively and was taken to the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit .\\nThe patient was maintained on triple antibiotics which included Vancomycin , ceftazidime and Gentamicin .\\nOn postoperative day two , she had an electroencephalogram which showed no evidence of seizure activity but some generalized slowing .\\nThe patient was seen in consultation by the Neurology Service for her apparent postoperative encephalopathy and episodes of shaking .\\nAn endoscopy was also performed on postoperative day two which showed clean anastomosis .\\nShe received multiple bronchoscopies for pulmonary toilet .\\nThe patient was maintained on tube feedings and the ventilator .\\nA repeat echocardiogram on February 18 showed no significant change of her previous echocardiogram on February 11 , which showed only a small pericardial effusion .\\nA pelvic and abdominal computerized tomography scan on February 18 also showed no evidence of a focal collection or abscess .\\nShe remained intermittently febrile despite numerous antibiotics .\\nHer chest X-ray showed bilateral air space disease , consistent with pneumonia or adult respiratory distress syndrome .\\nShe suffered an episode of renal failure which was felt attributable to aminoglycoside toxicity .\\nHer steroids were weaned .\\nBecause of her prolonged intubation and inability to wean , on February 24 , 1994 , she had a tracheostomy placed .\\nShe remained in a coma .\\nThe blood cultures on February 26 , 1994 grew out Staphylococcus and she was treated for septicemia .\\nHer sputum grew out Pseudomonas aeruginosa as well .\\nThe urine contained yeast and she was treated with amphotericin .\\nOn March 3 , 1994 , a repeat chest and abdominal and pelvis computerized tomography scan showed no evidence of fluid collections .\\nThere was a large left pleural effusion however .\\nThis was drained with a left chest tube .\\nHer sputum then grew out Klebsiella and she was treated with amikacin and imipenem .\\nShe developed a right pleural effusion and had a right chest tube placed .\\nOn March 13 , 1994 , she regained some level of consciousness .\\nShe was able to fix and follow with her eyes , respond to commands .\\nOn March 14 , 1994 , her right lung was pleurodesed .\\nAttempts were made to facilitate her wean by resting her overnight with a combination of propafol and Fentanyl .\\nThis was tried for approximately seven days with no real progress made toward facilitating her vent wean .\\nShe continued to require pressor support in the high 30 's .\\nShe also fell into a coma once again .\\nOn March 31 , 1994 , her pressor support requirement increased and she continued to have tachypneic episodes .\\nOn April 2 , 1994 , she had several episodes of bradycardia and asystole , which responded only to manual ventilation .\\nDiscussions were held with the patient 's family with regard to her previously expressed wishes not to be maintained on artificial life support for extended period of time with little or no hope for recovery .\\nShe had expressed these wishes in writing on several legal forms from the state of Jose Pineston , as well as in discussions with her loved ones .\\nDecision was made in conjunction with the family and Dr. Caslighlourdes to terminate artificial respiratory support .\\nThe patient was removed from the ventilator and placed on a T-piece in her trachea only and was made comfortable with narcotics .\\nHer respirations ceased and she died at 10:15 a.m. on April 2 , 1994 .\\nDISPOSITION / PLAN ON DISCHARGE :\\nThe family will return the body to Sa for burial .\\nThey have declined a post-mortem examination .\\nCA SHUFF ,

Medical Center for angioplasty .\\nPRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :\\nUnstable angina .\\nASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :\\nHypertension .\\nPRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :\\nRight and circumflex angioplasty , cardiac catheterization on 12-6-93 .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThis 75 year old woman was previously admitted here in November 1993 for chronic angina .\\nShe had mild mitral regurgitation and a slightly diminished ejection fraction .\\nThere was a 90% right coronary stenosis which was reduced to 30 with a balloon angioplasty .\\nThere were three lesions in the circumflex , dilated successfully .\\nHowever , the low circumflex marginal vessel could not be crossed with the balloon .\\nShe did well in follow up , being treated for hypertension .\\nIn the end of 1992 , she was feeling well and was taken off Isordil .\\nDuring the winter and early parts of 1993 , the patient noticed increasing fatigue , symptoms of breathlessness and recurrent substernal chest pressure which finally led to admission to Xas Tupalmsmodral Hospital on 11-11-93 with documentation of a subendocardial myocardial infarction and a blood pressure of 210/108 .\\nCardiac catheterization towards the end of the hospitalization showed recurrent right coronary artery stenosis proximally and high grade new stenosis in the distal circumflex at the area of the origin of the previously untreated low circumflex marginal vessel .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\nMedications on transfer were Ecotrin , Vasotec 5 mg , Lopressor 25 bid , Isordil 20 tid , Procardia XL once per day , and Lasix 20 q3 days .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nOn physical examination , the blood pressure was 150 , heart rate 70 , bilateral carotid bruits , grade II systolic ejection murmur , good femoral pulses without bruits , good dorsalis pedis pulses with no posterior tibial pulses felt .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nThe electrocardiogram revealed left bundle branch block .\\nThe electrolytes were normal .\\nThe admission hematocrit was 34 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nOn 12-6-93 , angioplasty was performed of the right coronary artery using a 3 mm solo balloon reducing the stenosis from 80 to approximately 20% with a faint diagonal lucency which was not obstructive .\\nThe new distal circumflex lesion was dilated with a 2.0 mm balloon with a good result and minimal persistent stenosis .\\nBut the low circumflex marginal could not be entered with a wire .\\nThe first marginal had a 505 stenosis at its origin , which was not attempted .\\nThe patient did well post procedure .\\nHe developed a grape sized hematoma over the femoral artery with a loud bruit .\\nThe ultrasound on the day of discharge showed no evidence of pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula .\\nThe blood pressure was 150-170 systolic .\\nThe patient was ambulating without symptoms .\\nADDENDUM :\\nThe admission hematocrit was 34 .\\nThis fell to 25 after the cardiac catheterization without evidence of bleeding and rose to 29 by the time of discharge .\\nDOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :\\nShe was discharged with advice by Cardiac Rehabilitation for gradually increasing activity .\\nShe will be followed by her physician at Cean , Dr. Dieseld Pollejesc , for further pressure management and follow up of the femoral hematoma .\\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE :\\nStable , resolving anemia .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nEcotrin 160 mg per day , Vasotec 5 mg per day , Lopressor 25 bid , Isordil 20 tid , Procardia XL 30 per day , Lasix 20 mg q3 days .\\nTELSHEY STUDY , M.D.\\nTR :\\nah / BMot\\nDD :\\n12-9-93\\nTD :\\n12/11/93\\nCC :\\nDr. Telshey Study

was seen by Dr. Overall in the office on Aug 22 , 2003 , for follow-up .\\nShe was scheduled to have a total hi p replacement because of progressively worsening pain in the left hip .\\nHer pain was 8/10 .\\nShe limped .\\nShe did not use a cane .\\nShe did require a bannister going up and down stairs .\\nShe had trouble doing shoes and socks .\\nShe could walk limited distances .\\nSince seen by Dr. Overall in August , she had had a brain aneurysm .\\nShe had a mastectomy and had recently developed Parkinson 's.\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\n1. Breast cancer in the right breast , diagnosed in 1995 with negative nodes , treated with excision , recurrence in June , 2001 , further reconstructive surgery .\\nAt the same time , she underwent reduction of t he left breast .\\n2. History of bipolar disorder , for which she sees Dr. Lettefriscbreun .\\nShe indicates this is stable at this time .\\n3. History of chronic anxiety .\\n4.

Colace , 100 mg. PO t.i.d.\\n2. Percocet , one to two tablets PO q.3 to 4 hours p.r.n. pain .\\n3. Coumadin with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nPlease prescribe 2 mg. tablets .\\nThe patient will be on Coumadin for six months given her history of pulmonary embolus .\\nDISCHARGE PLAN :\\nCoumadin for six months postoperatively with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nCheck INR three times a week until stable .\\nPlease call the results to Dr. Viennee Ester , the patient 's primary-care physician , who has agreed to follow her INR levels for the remainder of the six months .\\nDr. Viennee Ester is located in Tlandcousti Lo Vuclark , where the patient is from originally .\\nThe patient will call Dr. Overall 's office to arrange a follow-up appointment six weeks from the day of surgery .\\nStaples can be removed 10 to 14 days postoperatively .\\nPlease hold removal if the wound is draining .\\nThe patient may shower once the incision is dry , and may bathe and / or swim after the staples have been removed and there is no wound drainage .\\nPartial weight-bearing with crutches or a walker with posterior hip dislocation precautions for three months following surgery .\\nThese precautions have been explained and demonstrated to the patient .\\nThe patient has been instructed to call Dr. Overall 's office or the orthopedist on call with any questions or concerns about increasing pain , swelling , redness , wound drainage , fevers or chills at 094-897-3231 .\\nKEMA ESTER ,\\nMD DICTATING FOR :\\nElectronically Signed ETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D. 02/22/2003 07:01\\n_____________________________ ETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D.\\nTR :\\npe\\nDD :\\n02/08/2003\\nTD :\\n02/08/2003 6:34 P 737058\\ncc :\\nETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D. ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY ALLMID HEALTH CENTER KEMA ESTER , MILD VIENNEE C.

initially diagnosed in 1978 with atypical small cell carcinoma of the lung and treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy until 1980 .\\nShe did well for approximately twelve years until she was diagnosed with carcinoid cancer of the same right upper lobe .\\nThis may have been the initial primary cancer although it is unclear at present .\\nBronchoscopy at that time showed an endobronchial tumor of the right upper lobe bronchus and it was felt to be unresectable .\\nShe underwent four treatments of brachytherapy in March through May of 1993 .\\nShe had been doing reasonably well until December of 1993 when she presented with persistent and worsening cough and near strangulation on attempts at eating solids or drinking liquids .\\nA bronchoscopy showed a tracheoesophageal fistula with an opening into the trachea above the carina and no tumor in the right upper lobe .\\nShe has been on total parenteral nutrition and has been nothing by mouth since then .\\nA barium swallow

patient was admitted on February 5 , 1994 and had a central venous line placed in her right subclavian .\\nThe patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 6 , 1994 where she underwent rigid and flexible bronchoscopy and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy .\\nFindings included necrotic debris in the distal trachea at the carina and right mainstem bronchus .\\nEsophageal mucosa was visible through the trachea .\\nHer steroids were weaned and the patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 10 , 1994 where she underwent once again flexible bronchoscopy and flexible esophagoscopy , as well as rigid bronchoscopy .\\nShe then had a transhiatal esophagectomy which was partial , and a substernal gastric interposition as well as a jejunostomy .\\nThe pathology report suggested that

catheterization on 12-6-93 .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThis 75 year old woman was previously admitted here in November 1993 for chronic angina .\\nShe had mild mitral regurgitation and a slightly diminished ejection fraction .\\nThere was a 90% right coronary stenosis which was reduced to 30 with a balloon angioplasty .\\nThere were three lesions in the circumflex , dilated successfully .\\nHowever , the low circumflex marginal vessel could not be crossed with the balloon .\\nShe did well in follow up , being treated for hypertension .\\nIn the end of 1992 , she was feeling well and was taken off Isordil .\\nDuring the winter and early parts of 1993 , the patient noticed increasing fatigue , symptoms of breathlessness and recurrent substernal chest pressure which finally led to admission to Xas Tupalmsmodral Hospital on 11-11-93 with documentation of a subendocardial myocardial infarction and a blood pressure of 210/108 .\\nCardiac catheterization towards the end of the hospitalization showed recurrent right coronary artery stenosis proximally and high grade new stenosis in the distal circumflex at the area of the origin of the previously untreated low circumflex marginal vessel .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\nMedications on transfer were Ecotrin , Vasotec 5 mg , Lopressor 25 bid , Isordil 20 tid , Procardia XL once per day , and Lasix 20 q3 days .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nOn physical examination , the blood pressure was 150 , heart rate 70 , bilateral carotid bruits , grade II systolic ejection murmur , good femoral pulses without bruits , good dorsalis pedis pulses with no posterior tibial pulses felt .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nThe electrocardiogram revealed left bundle branch block .\\nThe electrolytes were normal .\\nThe admission hematocrit was 34 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nOn 12-6-93 , angioplasty was performed of the right coronary artery using a 3 mm solo balloon reducing the stenosis from 80 to approximately 20% with a faint diagonal lucency which was not obstructive .\\nThe new distal circumflex lesion was dilated with a 2.0 mm balloon with a good result and minimal persistent stenosis .\\nBut the low circumflex marginal could not be entered with a wire .\\nThe first marginal had a 505 stenosis at its origin , which was not attempted .\\nThe patient did well post procedure .\\nHe developed a grape sized hematoma over the femoral artery with a loud bruit .\\nThe ultrasound on the day of discharge showed no evidence of pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula .\\nThe blood pressure was 150-170 systolic .\\nThe patient was ambulating without symptoms .\\nADDENDUM :\\nThe admission hematocrit was 34 .\\nThis fell to 25 after the cardiac catheterization without evidence of bleeding and rose to 29 by the time of discharge .\\nDOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :\\nShe was discharged with advice by Cardiac Rehabilitation for gradually increasing activity .\\nShe will be followed by her physician at Cean , Dr. Dieseld Pollejesc , for further pressure management and follow up of the femoral hematoma .\\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE :\\nStable , resolving anemia .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nEcotrin 160 mg per day , Vasotec 5 mg per day , Lopressor 25 bid , Isordil 20 tid , Procardia XL 30 per day , Lasix 20 mg q3 days .\\nTELSHEY STUDY , M.D.\\nTR :\\nah / BMot\\nDD :\\n12-9-93\\nTD :\\n12/11/93\\nCC :\\nDr. Telshey Study

was seen by Dr. Overall in the office on Aug 22 , 2003 , for follow-up .\\nShe was scheduled to have a total hi p replacement because of progressively worsening pain in the left hip .\\nHer pain was 8/10 .\\nShe limped .\\nShe did not use a cane .\\nShe did require a bannister going up and down stairs .\\nShe had trouble doing shoes and socks .\\nShe could walk limited distances .\\nSince seen by Dr. Overall in August , she had had a brain aneurysm .\\nShe had a mastectomy and had recently developed Parkinson 's.\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\n1. Breast cancer in the right breast , diagnosed in 1995 with negative nodes , treated with excision , recurrence in June , 2001 , further reconstructive surgery .\\nAt the same time , she underwent reduction of t he left breast .\\n2.

Imodium , 2 mg. q.a.m.\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nExamination reveals that the patient is walking with a mild limp .\\nThe left hip is a bit stiff with flexion to 90 degrees .\\nShe has 10 degrees of internal rotation and external rotation .\\nPulses are fine .\\nIMAGING :\\nX-rays were reviewed .\\nThey showed advanced arthritis of the left hip .\\nRECOMMENDATIONS :\\nDr. Etteme Overall recommended that the patient have a total hip replacement on the left side on February 2 , 2003 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nPlease refer to the operative note by Dr. Etteme Overall for details of the procedure .\\nPostoperatively , the patient was transferred to the floor in stable condition for observation , pain control and mobilization .\\nInitially postoperatively , she was doing quite well , though she did require four liters of oxygen postoperatively to maintain her oxygen saturations .\\nIt was hoped that she would wean off the oxygen over the course of the next few hours .\\nHowever , she did require four liters of oxygen all the way through the night to maintain oxygen saturations of 93% .\\nWithout oxygen , she dropped down to the low 80s .\\nGiven the unusual nature of this oxygen requirement , the patient underwent work-up with a chest X-ray , which essentially was normal .\\nAn ABG revealed a normal PCO2 of 32 , but a decrease in PO2- at 62 .\\nTherefore , given her history of breast cancer , the patient was taken for a spiral CT scan and the Medicine Service was consulted at that time .\\nThey agreed with our plan .\\nOn spiral CT scan , a small pulmonary embolus was seen in the right upper lobe and the left low er lobe .\\nShe was started on heparin at that time to maintain a PTT of 60 t o 80 , and was given doses of Coumadin , in addition to the Coumadin she had been given for DVT prophylaxis .\\nWith the recommendation of the medicine te am , we decided to maintain an INR of 2 to 3 with an overlap of heparin when the patient was therapeutic for two to three days .\\nShe continued to do quite well even though we did keep her on bed rest for three days while she was heparinized .\\nHer oxygen saturations continued to improve to the point that she was on room air on postoperative day four with oxygen saturation of 95% .\\nShe was given perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis for 48 hours after surgery .\\nShe was mobilized on postoperative day four , getting out of bed , able to do quite well on her new hip with a minimal amount of pain .\\nShe was given posterior hip dislocation precautions at that time , which she understood quite well .\\nShe continued to be followed by the medical team and was watched very closely by the orthopedic team until we felt comfortable that she was breathing quite well and was mobilizing well with physical therapy .\\nTherefore , it was decided at that time that the patient was ready for discharge to rehabilitation on Coumadin , which would be monitored for six months to maintain an INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nThe patient will continue all of her pre-admission medications , though no nonsteroidal analgesics , e.g. , aspirin or ibuprofen , will be given while she is on Coumadin therapy .\\n1. Colace , 100 mg. PO t.i.d.\\n2. Percocet , one to two tablets PO q.3 to 4 hours p.r.n. pain .\\n3. Coumadin with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nPlease prescribe 2 mg. tablets .\\nThe patient will be on Coumadin for six months given her history of pulmonary embolus .\\nDISCHARGE PLAN :\\nCoumadin for six months postoperatively with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nCheck INR three times a week until stable .\\nPlease call the results to Dr. Viennee Ester , the patient 's primary-care physician , who has agreed to follow her INR levels for the remainder of the six months .\\nDr. Viennee Ester is located in Tlandcousti Lo Vuclark , where the patient is from originally .\\nThe patient will call Dr. Overall 's office to arrange a follow-up appointment six weeks from the day of surgery .\\nStaples can be removed 10 to 14 days postoperatively .\\nPlease hold removal if the wound is draining .\\nThe patient may shower once the incision is dry , and may bathe and / or swim after the staples have been removed and there is no wound drainage .\\nPartial weight-bearing with crutches or a walker with posterior hip dislocation precautions for three months following surgery .\\nThese precautions have been explained and demonstrated to the patient .\\nThe patient has been instructed to call Dr. Overall 's office or the orthopedist on call with any questions or concerns about increasing pain , swelling , redness , wound drainage , fevers or chills at 094-897-3231 .\\nKEMA ESTER ,\\nMD DICTATING FOR :\\nElectronically Signed ETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D. 02/22/2003 07:01\\n_____________________________ ETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D.\\nTR :\\npe\\nDD :\\n02/08/2003\\nTD :\\n02/08/2003 6:34 P 737058\\ncc :\\nETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D. ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY ALLMID HEALTH CENTER KEMA ESTER , MILD VIENNEE C.

and flexible bronchoscopy and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy .\\nFindings included necrotic debris in the distal trachea at the carina and right mainstem bronchus .\\nEsophageal mucosa was visible through the trachea .\\nHer steroids were weaned and the patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 10 , 1994 where she underwent once again flexible bronchoscopy and flexible esophagoscopy , as well as rigid bronchoscopy .\\nShe then had a transhiatal esophagectomy which was partial , and a substernal gastric interposition as well as a jejunostomy .\\nThe pathology report suggested that the area was involved with radiation esophagitis and focal ulceration .\\nShe remained ventilator dependent postoperatively and was taken to the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit .\\nThe patient was maintained on triple antibiotics which included Vancomycin , ceftazidime and Gentamicin .\\nOn postoperative day two , she had an electroencephalogram which showed no evidence of seizure activity but some generalized slowing .\\nThe patient was seen in consultation by the Neurology Service for her apparent postoperative encephalopathy and episodes of shaking .\\nAn endoscopy was also performed on postoperative day two which showed clean anastomosis .\\nShe received multiple bronchoscopies for pulmonary toilet .\\nThe patient was maintained on tube feedings and the ventilator .\\nA repeat echocardiogram on February 18 showed no significant change of her previous echocardiogram on February 11 , which showed only a small pericardial effusion .\\nA pelvic and abdominal computerized tomography scan on February 18 also showed no evidence of a focal collection or abscess .\\nShe remained intermittently febrile despite numerous antibiotics .\\nHer chest X-ray showed bilateral air space disease , consistent with pneumonia or adult respiratory distress syndrome .\\nShe suffered an episode of renal failure which was felt attributable to aminoglycoside toxicity .\\nHer steroids were weaned .\\nBecause of her prolonged intubation and inability to wean , on February 24 , 1994 , she had a tracheostomy placed .\\nShe remained in a coma .\\nThe blood cultures on February 26 , 1994 grew out Staphylococcus and she was treated for septicemia .\\nHer sputum grew out Pseudomonas aeruginosa as well .\\nThe urine contained yeast and she was treated with amphotericin .\\nOn March 3 , 1994 , a repeat chest and abdominal and pelvis computerized tomography scan showed no evidence of fluid collections .\\nThere was a large left pleural effusion however .\\nThis was drained with a left chest tube .\\nHer sputum then grew out Klebsiella and she was treated with amikacin and imipenem .\\nShe developed a right pleural effusion and had a right chest tube placed .\\nOn March 13 , 1994 , she regained some level of consciousness .\\nShe was able to fix and follow with her eyes , respond to commands .\\nOn March 14 , 1994 , her right lung was pleurodesed .\\nAttempts were made to facilitate her wean by resting her overnight with a combination of propafol and Fentanyl .\\nThis was tried for approximately seven days with no real progress made toward facilitating her vent wean .\\nShe continued to require pressor support in the high 30 's .\\nShe also fell into a coma once again .\\nOn March 31 , 1994 , her pressor support requirement increased and she continued to have tachypneic episodes .\\nOn April 2 , 1994 , she had several episodes of bradycardia and asystole , which responded only to manual ventilation .\\nDiscussions were held with the patient 's family with regard to her previously expressed wishes not to be maintained on artificial life support for extended period of time with little or no hope for recovery .\\nShe had expressed these wishes in writing on several legal forms from the state of Jose Pineston , as well as in discussions with her loved ones .\\nDecision was made in conjunction with the family and Dr. Caslighlourdes to terminate artificial respiratory support .\\nThe patient was removed from the ventilator and placed on a T-piece in her trachea only and was made comfortable with narcotics .\\nHer respirations ceased and she died at 10:15 a.m. on April 2 , 1994 .\\nDISPOSITION / PLAN ON DISCHARGE :\\nThe family will return the body to Sa for burial .\\nThey have declined a post-mortem examination .\\nCA SHUFF ,

Medical Center for angioplasty .\\nPRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :\\nUnstable angina .\\nASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :\\nHypertension .\\nPRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :\\nRight and circumflex angioplasty , cardiac catheterization on 12-6-93 .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThis 75 year old woman was previously admitted here in November 1993 for chronic angina .\\nShe had mild mitral regurgitation and a slightly diminished ejection fraction .\\nThere was a 90% right coronary stenosis which was reduced to 30 with a balloon angioplasty .\\nThere were three lesions in the circumflex , dilated successfully .\\nHowever , the low circumflex marginal vessel could not be crossed with the balloon .\\nShe did well in follow up , being treated for hypertension .\\nIn the end of 1992 , she was feeling well and was taken off Isordil .\\nDuring the winter and early parts of 1993 , the patient noticed increasing fatigue , symptoms of breathlessness and recurrent substernal chest pressure which finally led to admission to Xas Tupalmsmodral Hospital on 11-11-93 with documentation of a subendocardial myocardial infarction and a blood pressure of 210/108 .\\nCardiac catheterization towards the end of the hospitalization showed recurrent right coronary artery stenosis proximally and high grade new stenosis in the distal circumflex at the area of the origin of the previously untreated low circumflex marginal vessel .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\nMedications on transfer were Ecotrin , Vasotec 5 mg , Lopressor 25 bid , Isordil 20 tid , Procardia XL once per day , and Lasix 20 q3 days .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nOn physical examination , the blood pressure was 150 , heart rate 70 , bilateral carotid bruits , grade II systolic ejection murmur , good femoral pulses without bruits , good dorsalis pedis pulses with no posterior tibial pulses felt .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nThe electrocardiogram revealed left bundle branch block .\\nThe electrolytes were normal .\\nThe admission hematocrit was 34 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nOn 12-6-93 , angioplasty was performed of the right coronary artery using a 3 mm solo balloon reducing the stenosis from 80 to approximately 20% with a faint diagonal lucency which was not obstructive .\\nThe new distal circumflex lesion was dilated with a 2.0 mm balloon with a good result and minimal persistent stenosis .\\nBut the low circumflex marginal could not be entered with a wire .\\nThe first marginal had a 505 stenosis at its origin , which was not attempted .\\nThe patient did well post procedure .\\nHe developed a grape sized hematoma over the femoral artery with a loud bruit .\\nThe ultrasound on the day of discharge showed no evidence of pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula .\\nThe blood pressure was 150-170 systolic .\\nThe patient was ambulating without symptoms .\\nADDENDUM :\\nThe admission hematocrit was 34 .\\nThis fell to 25 after the cardiac catheterization without evidence of bleeding and rose to 29 by the time of discharge .\\nDOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :\\nShe was discharged with advice by Cardiac Rehabilitation for gradually increasing activity .\\nShe will be followed by her physician at Cean , Dr. Dieseld Pollejesc , for further pressure management and follow up of the femoral hematoma .\\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE :\\nStable , resolving anemia .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nEcotrin 160 mg per day , Vasotec 5 mg per day , Lopressor 25 bid , Isordil 20 tid , Procardia XL 30 per day , Lasix 20 mg q3 days .\\nTELSHEY STUDY , M.D.\\nTR :\\nah / BMot\\nDD :\\n12-9-93\\nTD :\\n12/11/93\\nCC :\\nDr. Telshey Study

Colace , 100 mg. PO t.i.d.\\n2. Percocet , one to two tablets PO q.3 to 4 hours p.r.n. pain .\\n3. Coumadin with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nPlease prescribe 2 mg. tablets .\\nThe patient will be on Coumadin for six months given her history of pulmonary embolus .\\nDISCHARGE PLAN :\\nCoumadin for six months postoperatively with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nCheck INR three times a week until stable .\\nPlease call the results to Dr. Viennee Ester , the patient 's primary-care physician , who has agreed to follow her INR levels for the remainder of the six months .\\nDr. Viennee Ester is located in Tlandcousti Lo Vuclark , where the patient is from originally .\\nThe patient will call Dr. Overall 's office to arrange a follow-up appointment six weeks from the day of surgery .\\nStaples can be removed 10 to 14 days postoperatively .\\nPlease hold removal if the wound is draining .\\nThe patient may shower once the incision is dry , and may bathe and / or swim after the staples have been removed and there is no wound drainage .\\nPartial weight-bearing with crutches or a walker with posterior hip dislocation precautions for three months following surgery .\\nThese precautions have been explained and demonstrated to the patient .\\nThe patient has been instructed to call Dr. Overall 's office or the orthopedist on call with any questions or concerns about increasing pain , swelling , redness , wound drainage , fevers or chills at 094-897-3231 .\\nKEMA ESTER ,\\nMD DICTATING FOR :\\nElectronically Signed ETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D. 02/22/2003 07:01\\n_____________________________ ETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D.\\nTR :\\npe\\nDD :\\n02/08/2003\\nTD :\\n02/08/2003 6:34 P 737058\\ncc :\\nETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D. ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY ALLMID HEALTH CENTER KEMA ESTER , MILD VIENNEE C.

initially diagnosed in 1978 with atypical small cell carcinoma of the lung and treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy until 1980 .\\nShe did well for approximately twelve years until she was diagnosed with carcinoid cancer of the same right upper lobe .\\nThis may have been the initial primary cancer although it is unclear at present .\\nBronchoscopy at that time showed an endobronchial tumor of the right upper lobe bronchus and it was felt to be unresectable .\\nShe underwent four treatments of brachytherapy in March through May of 1993 .\\nShe had been doing reasonably well until December of 1993 when she presented with persistent and worsening cough and near strangulation on attempts at eating solids or drinking liquids .\\nA bronchoscopy showed a tracheoesophageal fistula with an opening into the trachea above the carina and no tumor in the right upper lobe .\\nShe has been on total parenteral nutrition and has been nothing by mouth since then .\\nA barium swallow

abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended .\\nExtremities :\\nno clubbing , cyanosis or edema .\\nThe rectal examination is guaiac negative with a minimal amount of stool .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was admitted on February 5 , 1994 and had a central venous line placed in her right subclavian .\\nThe patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 6 , 1994 where she underwent rigid and flexible bronchoscopy and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy .\\nFindings included necrotic debris in the distal trachea at the carina and right mainstem bronchus .\\nEsophageal mucosa was visible through the trachea .\\nHer steroids were weaned and the patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 10 , 1994 where she underwent once again flexible bronchoscopy and flexible esophagoscopy , as well as rigid bronchoscopy .\\nShe then had a transhiatal esophagectomy which was partial , and a substernal gastric interposition as well as a jejunostomy .\\nThe pathology report suggested that the area was involved with radiation esophagitis and focal ulceration .\\nShe remained ventilator dependent postoperatively and was taken to the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit .\\nThe patient was maintained on triple antibiotics which included Vancomycin , ceftazidime and Gentamicin .\\nOn postoperative day two , she had an electroencephalogram which showed no evidence of seizure activity but some generalized slowing .\\nThe patient was seen in consultation by the Neurology Service for her apparent postoperative encephalopathy and episodes of shaking .\\nAn endoscopy was also performed on postoperative day two which showed clean anastomosis .\\nShe received multiple bronchoscopies for pulmonary toilet .\\nThe patient was maintained on tube feedings and the ventilator .\\nA repeat echocardiogram on February 18 showed no significant change of her previous echocardiogram on February 11 , which showed only a small pericardial effusion .\\nA pelvic and abdominal computerized tomography scan on February 18 also showed no evidence of a focal collection or abscess .\\nShe remained intermittently febrile despite numerous antibiotics .\\nHer chest X-ray showed bilateral air space disease , consistent with pneumonia or adult respiratory distress syndrome .\\nShe suffered an episode of renal failure which was felt attributable to aminoglycoside toxicity .\\nHer steroids

left chest tube .\\nHer sputum then grew out Klebsiella and she was treated with amikacin and imipenem .\\nShe developed a right pleural effusion and had a right chest tube placed .\\nOn March 13 , 1994 , she regained some level of consciousness .\\nShe was able to fix and follow with her eyes , respond to commands .\\nOn March 14 , 1994 , her right lung was pleurodesed .\\nAttempts were made to facilitate her wean by resting her overnight with a combination of propafol and Fentanyl .\\nThis was tried for approximately seven days with no real progress made toward facilitating her vent wean .\\nShe continued to require pressor support in the high 30 's .\\nShe also fell into a coma once again .\\nOn March 31 , 1994 , her pressor support requirement increased and she continued to have

catheterization on 12-6-93 .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThis 75 year old woman was previously admitted here in November 1993 for chronic angina .\\nShe had mild mitral regurgitation and a slightly diminished ejection fraction .\\nThere was a 90% right coronary stenosis which was reduced to 30 with a balloon angioplasty .\\nThere were three lesions in the circumflex , dilated successfully .\\nHowever , the low circumflex marginal vessel could not be crossed with the balloon .\\nShe did well in follow up , being treated for hypertension .\\nIn the end of 1992 , she was feeling well and was taken off Isordil .\\nDuring the winter and early parts of 1993 , the patient noticed increasing fatigue , symptoms of breathlessness and recurrent substernal chest pressure which finally led to admission to Xas Tupalmsmodral Hospital on 11-11-93 with documentation of a subendocardial myocardial infarction and a blood pressure of 210/108 .\\nCardiac catheterization towards the end of the hospitalization showed recurrent right coronary artery stenosis proximally and high grade new stenosis in the distal circumflex at the area of the origin of the previously untreated low circumflex marginal vessel .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\nMedications on transfer were Ecotrin , Vasotec 5 mg , Lopressor 25 bid , Isordil 20 tid , Procardia XL once per day , and Lasix 20 q3 days .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nOn physical examination , the blood pressure was 150 , heart rate 70 , bilateral carotid bruits , grade II systolic ejection murmur , good femoral pulses without bruits , good dorsalis pedis pulses with no posterior tibial pulses felt .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nThe electrocardiogram revealed left bundle branch block .\\nThe electrolytes were normal .\\nThe admission hematocrit was 34 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nOn 12-6-93 , angioplasty was performed of the right coronary artery using a 3 mm solo balloon reducing the stenosis from 80 to approximately 20% with a faint diagonal lucency which was not obstructive .\\nThe new distal circumflex lesion was dilated with a 2.0 mm balloon with a good result and minimal persistent stenosis .\\nBut the low circumflex marginal could not be entered with a wire .\\nThe first marginal had a 505 stenosis at its origin , which was not attempted .\\nThe patient did well post procedure .\\nHe developed a grape sized hematoma over the femoral artery with a loud bruit .\\nThe ultrasound on the day of discharge showed no evidence of pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula .\\nThe blood pressure was 150-170 systolic .\\nThe patient was ambulating without symptoms .\\nADDENDUM :\\nThe admission hematocrit was 34 .\\nThis fell to 25 after the cardiac catheterization without evidence of bleeding and rose to 29 by the time of discharge .\\nDOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :\\nShe was discharged with advice by Cardiac Rehabilitation for gradually increasing activity .\\nShe will be followed by her physician at Cean , Dr. Dieseld Pollejesc , for further pressure management and follow up of the femoral hematoma .\\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE :\\nStable , resolving anemia .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nEcotrin 160 mg per day , Vasotec 5 mg per day , Lopressor 25 bid , Isordil 20 tid , Procardia XL 30 per day , Lasix 20 mg q3 days .\\nTELSHEY STUDY , M.D.\\nTR :\\nah / BMot\\nDD :\\n12-9-93\\nTD :\\n12/11/93\\nCC :\\nDr. Telshey Study

was seen by Dr. Overall in the office on Aug 22 , 2003 , for follow-up .\\nShe was scheduled to have a total hi p replacement because of progressively worsening pain in the left hip .\\nHer pain was 8/10 .\\nShe limped .\\nShe did not use a cane .\\nShe did require a bannister going up and down stairs .\\nShe had trouble doing shoes and socks .\\nShe could walk limited distances .\\nSince seen by Dr. Overall in August , she had had a brain aneurysm .\\nShe had a mastectomy and had recently developed Parkinson 's.\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\n1. Breast cancer in the right breast , diagnosed in 1995 with negative nodes , treated with excision , recurrence in June , 2001 , further reconstructive surgery .\\nAt the same time , she underwent reduction of t he left breast .\\n2.

Imodium , 2 mg. q.a.m.\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nExamination reveals that the patient is walking with a mild limp .\\nThe left hip is a bit stiff with flexion to 90 degrees .\\nShe has 10 degrees of internal rotation and external rotation .\\nPulses are fine .\\nIMAGING :\\nX-rays were reviewed .\\nThey showed advanced arthritis of the left hip .\\nRECOMMENDATIONS :\\nDr. Etteme Overall recommended that the patient have a total hip replacement on the left side on February 2 , 2003 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nPlease refer to the operative note by Dr. Etteme Overall for details of the procedure .\\nPostoperatively , the patient was transferred to the floor in stable condition for observation , pain control and mobilization .\\nInitially postoperatively , she was doing quite well , though she did require four liters of oxygen postoperatively to maintain her oxygen saturations .\\nIt was hoped that she would wean off the oxygen over the course of the next few hours .\\nHowever , she did require four liters of oxygen all the way through the night to maintain oxygen saturations of 93% .\\nWithout oxygen , she dropped down to the low 80s .\\nGiven the unusual nature of this oxygen requirement , the patient underwent work-up with a chest X-ray , which essentially was normal .\\nAn ABG revealed a normal PCO2 of 32 , but a decrease in PO2- at 62 .\\nTherefore , given her history of breast cancer , the patient was taken for a spiral CT scan and the Medicine Service was consulted at that time .\\nThey agreed with our plan .\\nOn spiral CT scan , a small pulmonary embolus was seen in the right upper lobe and the left low er lobe .\\nShe was started on heparin at that time to maintain a PTT of 60 t o 80 , and was given doses of Coumadin , in addition to the Coumadin she had been given for DVT prophylaxis .\\nWith the recommendation of the medicine te am , we decided to maintain an INR of 2 to 3 with an overlap of heparin when the patient was therapeutic for two to three days .\\nShe continued to do quite well even though we did keep her on bed rest for three days while she was heparinized .\\nHer oxygen saturations continued to improve to the point that she was on room air on postoperative day four with oxygen saturation of 95% .\\nShe was given perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis for 48 hours after surgery .\\nShe was mobilized on postoperative day four , getting out of bed , able to do quite well on her new hip with a minimal amount of pain .\\nShe was given posterior hip dislocation precautions at that time , which she understood quite well .\\nShe continued to be followed by the medical team and was watched very closely by the orthopedic team until we felt comfortable that she was breathing quite well and was mobilizing well with physical therapy .\\nTherefore , it was decided at that time that the patient was ready for discharge to rehabilitation on Coumadin , which would be monitored for six months to maintain an INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nThe patient will continue all of her pre-admission medications , though no nonsteroidal analgesics , e.g. , aspirin or ibuprofen , will be given while she is on Coumadin therapy .\\n1. Colace , 100 mg. PO t.i.d.\\n2. Percocet , one to two tablets PO q.3 to 4 hours p.r.n. pain .\\n3. Coumadin with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nPlease prescribe 2 mg. tablets .\\nThe patient will be on Coumadin for six months given her history of pulmonary embolus .\\nDISCHARGE PLAN :\\nCoumadin for six months postoperatively with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nCheck INR three times a week until stable .\\nPlease call the results to Dr. Viennee Ester , the patient 's primary-care physician , who has agreed to follow her INR levels for the remainder of the six months .\\nDr. Viennee Ester is located in Tlandcousti Lo Vuclark , where the patient is from originally .\\nThe patient will call Dr. Overall 's office to arrange a follow-up appointment six weeks from the day of surgery .\\nStaples can be removed 10 to 14 days postoperatively .\\nPlease hold removal if the wound is draining .\\nThe patient may shower once the incision is dry , and may bathe and / or swim after the staples have been removed and there is no wound drainage .\\nPartial weight-bearing with crutches or a walker with posterior hip dislocation precautions for three months following surgery .\\nThese precautions have been explained and demonstrated to the patient .\\nThe patient has been instructed to call Dr. Overall 's office or the orthopedist on call with any questions or concerns about increasing pain , swelling , redness , wound drainage , fevers or chills at 094-897-3231 .\\nKEMA ESTER ,\\nMD DICTATING FOR :\\nElectronically Signed ETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D. 02/22/2003 07:01\\n_____________________________ ETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D.\\nTR :\\npe\\nDD :\\n02/08/2003\\nTD :\\n02/08/2003 6:34 P 737058\\ncc :\\nETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D. ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY ALLMID HEALTH CENTER KEMA ESTER , MILD VIENNEE C.

and flexible bronchoscopy and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy .\\nFindings included necrotic debris in the distal trachea at the carina and right mainstem bronchus .\\nEsophageal mucosa was visible through the trachea .\\nHer steroids were weaned and the patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 10 , 1994 where she underwent once again flexible bronchoscopy and flexible esophagoscopy , as well as rigid bronchoscopy .\\nShe then had a transhiatal esophagectomy which was partial , and a substernal gastric interposition as well as a jejunostomy .\\nThe pathology report suggested that the area was involved with radiation esophagitis and focal ulceration .\\nShe remained ventilator dependent postoperatively and was taken to the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit .\\nThe patient was maintained on triple antibiotics which included Vancomycin , ceftazidime and Gentamicin .\\nOn postoperative day two , she had an electroencephalogram which showed no evidence of seizure activity but some generalized slowing .\\nThe patient was seen in consultation by the Neurology Service for her apparent postoperative encephalopathy and episodes of shaking .\\nAn endoscopy was also performed on postoperative day two which showed clean anastomosis .\\nShe received multiple bronchoscopies for pulmonary toilet .\\nThe patient was maintained on tube feedings and the ventilator .\\nA repeat echocardiogram on February 18 showed no significant change of her previous echocardiogram on February 11 , which showed only a small pericardial effusion .\\nA pelvic and abdominal computerized tomography scan on February 18 also showed no evidence of a focal collection or abscess .\\nShe remained intermittently febrile despite numerous antibiotics .\\nHer chest X-ray showed bilateral air space disease , consistent with pneumonia or adult respiratory distress syndrome .\\nShe suffered an episode of renal failure which was felt attributable to aminoglycoside toxicity .\\nHer steroids were weaned .\\nBecause of her prolonged intubation and inability to wean , on February 24 , 1994 , she had a tracheostomy placed .\\nShe remained in a coma .\\nThe blood cultures on February 26 , 1994 grew out Staphylococcus and she was treated for septicemia .\\nHer sputum grew out Pseudomonas aeruginosa as well .\\nThe urine contained yeast and she was treated with amphotericin .\\nOn March 3 , 1994 , a repeat chest and abdominal and pelvis computerized tomography scan showed no evidence of fluid collections .\\nThere was a large left pleural effusion however .\\nThis was drained with a left chest tube .\\nHer sputum then grew out Klebsiella and she was treated with amikacin and imipenem .\\nShe developed a right pleural effusion and had a right chest tube placed .\\nOn March 13 , 1994 , she regained some level of consciousness .\\nShe was able to fix and follow with her eyes , respond to commands .\\nOn March 14 , 1994 , her right lung was pleurodesed .\\nAttempts were made to facilitate her wean by resting her overnight with a combination of propafol and Fentanyl .\\nThis was tried for approximately seven days with no real progress made toward facilitating her vent wean .\\nShe continued to require pressor support in the high 30 's .\\nShe also fell into a coma once again .\\nOn March 31 , 1994 , her pressor support requirement increased and she continued to have tachypneic episodes .\\nOn April 2 , 1994 , she had several episodes of bradycardia and asystole , which responded only to manual ventilation .\\nDiscussions were held with the patient 's family with regard to her previously expressed wishes not to be maintained on artificial life support for extended period of time with little or no hope for recovery .\\nShe had expressed these wishes in writing on several legal forms from the state of Jose Pineston , as well as in discussions with her loved ones .\\nDecision was made in conjunction with the family and Dr. Caslighlourdes to terminate artificial respiratory support .\\nThe patient was removed from the ventilator and placed on a T-piece in her trachea only and was made comfortable with narcotics .\\nHer respirations ceased and she died at 10:15 a.m. on April 2 , 1994 .\\nDISPOSITION / PLAN ON DISCHARGE :\\nThe family will return the body to Sa for burial .\\nThey have declined a post-mortem examination .\\nCA SHUFF ,

Medical Center for angioplasty .\\nPRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :\\nUnstable angina .\\nASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :\\nHypertension .\\nPRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :\\nRight and circumflex angioplasty , cardiac catheterization on 12-6-93 .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThis 75 year old woman was previously admitted here in November 1993 for chronic angina .\\nShe had mild mitral regurgitation and a slightly diminished ejection fraction .\\nThere was a 90% right coronary stenosis which was reduced to 30 with a balloon angioplasty .\\nThere were three lesions in the circumflex , dilated successfully .\\nHowever , the low circumflex marginal vessel could not be crossed with the balloon .\\nShe did well in follow up , being treated for hypertension .\\nIn the end of 1992 , she was feeling well and was taken off Isordil .\\nDuring the winter and early parts of 1993 , the patient noticed increasing fatigue , symptoms of breathlessness and recurrent substernal chest pressure which finally led to admission to Xas Tupalmsmodral Hospital on 11-11-93 with documentation of a subendocardial myocardial infarction and a blood pressure of 210/108 .\\nCardiac catheterization towards the end of the hospitalization showed recurrent right coronary artery stenosis proximally and high grade new stenosis in the distal circumflex at the area of the origin of the previously untreated low circumflex marginal vessel .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\nMedications on transfer were Ecotrin , Vasotec 5 mg , Lopressor 25 bid , Isordil 20 tid , Procardia XL once per day , and Lasix 20 q3 days .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nOn physical examination , the blood pressure was 150 , heart rate 70 , bilateral carotid bruits , grade II systolic ejection murmur , good femoral pulses without bruits , good dorsalis pedis pulses with no posterior tibial pulses felt .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nThe electrocardiogram revealed left bundle branch block .\\nThe electrolytes were normal .\\nThe admission hematocrit was 34 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nOn 12-6-93 , angioplasty was performed of the right coronary artery using a 3 mm solo balloon reducing the stenosis from 80 to approximately 20% with a faint diagonal lucency which was not obstructive .\\nThe new distal circumflex lesion was dilated with a 2.0 mm balloon with a good result and minimal persistent stenosis .\\nBut the low circumflex marginal could not be entered with a wire .\\nThe first marginal had a 505 stenosis at its origin , which was not attempted .\\nThe patient did well post procedure .\\nHe developed a grape sized hematoma over the femoral artery with a loud bruit .\\nThe ultrasound on the day of discharge showed no evidence of pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula .\\nThe blood pressure was 150-170 systolic .\\nThe patient was ambulating without symptoms .\\nADDENDUM :\\nThe admission hematocrit was 34 .\\nThis fell to 25 after the cardiac catheterization without evidence of bleeding and rose to 29 by the time of discharge .\\nDOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :\\nShe was discharged with advice by Cardiac Rehabilitation for gradually increasing activity .\\nShe will be followed by her physician at Cean , Dr. Dieseld Pollejesc , for further pressure management and follow up of the femoral hematoma .\\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE :\\nStable , resolving anemia .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nEcotrin 160 mg per day , Vasotec 5 mg

Colace , 100 mg. PO t.i.d.\\n2. Percocet , one to two tablets PO q.3 to 4 hours p.r.n. pain .\\n3. Coumadin with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nPlease prescribe 2 mg. tablets .\\nThe patient will be on Coumadin for six months given her history of pulmonary embolus .\\nDISCHARGE PLAN :\\nCoumadin for six months postoperatively with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nCheck INR three times a week until stable .\\nPlease call the results to Dr. Viennee Ester , the patient 's primary-care physician , who has agreed to follow her INR levels for the remainder of the six months .\\nDr. Viennee Ester is located in Tlandcousti Lo Vuclark , where the patient is from originally .\\nThe patient will call Dr. Overall 's office to arrange a follow-up appointment six weeks from the day of surgery .\\nStaples can be removed 10 to 14 days postoperatively .\\nPlease hold removal if the wound is draining .\\nThe patient may shower once the incision is dry , and may bathe and / or swim after the staples have been removed and there is no wound drainage .\\nPartial weight-bearing with crutches or a walker with posterior hip dislocation precautions for three months following surgery .\\nThese precautions have been explained and demonstrated to the patient .\\nThe patient has been instructed to call Dr. Overall 's office or the orthopedist on call with any questions or concerns about increasing pain , swelling , redness , wound drainage , fevers or chills at 094-897-3231 .\\nKEMA ESTER ,\\nMD DICTATING FOR :\\nElectronically Signed ETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D. 02/22/2003 07:01\\n_____________________________ ETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D.\\nTR :\\npe\\nDD :\\n02/08/2003\\nTD :\\n02/08/2003 6:34 P 737058\\ncc :\\nETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D. ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY ALLMID HEALTH CENTER KEMA ESTER , MILD VIENNEE C.

initially diagnosed in 1978 with atypical small cell carcinoma of the lung and treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy until 1980 .\\nShe did well for approximately twelve years until she was diagnosed with carcinoid cancer of the same right upper lobe .\\nThis may have been the initial primary cancer although it is unclear at present .\\nBronchoscopy at that time showed an endobronchial tumor of the right upper lobe bronchus and it was felt to be unresectable .\\nShe underwent four treatments of brachytherapy in March through May of 1993 .\\nShe had been doing reasonably well until December of 1993 when she presented with persistent and worsening cough and near strangulation on attempts at eating solids or drinking liquids .\\nA bronchoscopy showed a tracheoesophageal fistula with an opening into the trachea above the carina and no tumor in the right upper lobe .\\nShe has been on total parenteral nutrition and has been nothing by mouth since then .\\nA barium swallow

abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended .\\nExtremities :\\nno clubbing , cyanosis or edema .\\nThe rectal examination is guaiac negative with a minimal amount of stool .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was admitted on February 5 , 1994 and had a central venous line placed in her right subclavian .\\nThe patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 6 , 1994 where she underwent rigid and flexible bronchoscopy and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy .\\nFindings included necrotic debris in the distal trachea at the carina and right mainstem bronchus .\\nEsophageal mucosa was visible through the trachea .\\nHer steroids were weaned and the patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 10 , 1994 where she underwent once again flexible bronchoscopy and flexible esophagoscopy , as well as rigid bronchoscopy .\\nShe then had a transhiatal esophagectomy which was partial , and a substernal gastric interposition as well as a jejunostomy .\\nThe pathology report suggested that the area was involved with radiation esophagitis and focal ulceration .\\nShe remained ventilator dependent postoperatively and was taken to the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit .\\nThe patient was maintained on triple antibiotics which included Vancomycin , ceftazidime and Gentamicin .\\nOn postoperative day two , she had an electroencephalogram which showed no evidence of seizure activity but some generalized slowing .\\nThe patient was seen in consultation by the Neurology Service for her apparent postoperative encephalopathy and episodes of shaking .\\nAn endoscopy was also performed on postoperative day two which showed clean anastomosis .\\nShe received multiple bronchoscopies for pulmonary toilet .\\nThe patient was maintained on tube feedings and the ventilator .\\nA repeat echocardiogram on February 18 showed no significant change of her previous echocardiogram on February 11 , which showed only a small pericardial effusion .\\nA pelvic and abdominal computerized tomography scan on February 18 also showed no evidence of a focal collection or abscess .\\nShe remained intermittently febrile despite numerous antibiotics .\\nHer chest X-ray showed bilateral air space disease , consistent with pneumonia or adult respiratory distress syndrome .\\nShe suffered an episode of renal failure which was felt attributable to aminoglycoside toxicity .\\nHer steroids

3 , 1994 , a repeat chest and abdominal and pelvis computerized tomography scan showed no evidence of fluid collections .\\nThere was a large left pleural effusion however .\\nThis was drained with a left chest tube .\\nHer sputum then grew out Klebsiella and she was treated with amikacin and imipenem .\\nShe developed a right pleural effusion and had a right chest tube placed .\\nOn March 13 , 1994 , she regained some level of consciousness .\\nShe was able to fix and follow with her eyes , respond to commands .\\nOn March 14 , 1994 , her right lung was pleurodesed .\\nAttempts were made to facilitate her wean by resting her overnight with a combination of propafol and Fentanyl .\\nThis was tried for approximately seven days with no real progress made toward facilitating her vent wean .\\nShe continued to require pressor support in the high 30 's .\\nShe also fell into a coma once again .\\nOn March 31 , 1994 , her pressor support requirement increased and she continued to have tachypneic episodes .\\nOn April 2 , 1994 , she had several episodes of bradycardia and asystole , which responded only to manual ventilation .\\nDiscussions were held with the patient 's family with regard to her previously expressed wishes not to be maintained on artificial life support for extended period of time with little or no hope for recovery .\\nShe had expressed these wishes in writing on several legal forms from the state of Jose Pineston , as well as in discussions with her loved ones .\\nDecision was made in conjunction with the family and Dr. Caslighlourdes to terminate artificial respiratory support .\\nThe patient was removed from the ventilator and placed on a T-piece in her trachea only and was made comfortable with narcotics .\\nHer respirations ceased and she died at 10:15 a.m. on April 2 , 1994 .\\nDISPOSITION / PLAN ON DISCHARGE :\\nThe family will return the body to Sa for burial .\\nThey have declined a post-mortem examination .\\nCA SHUFF ,

catheterization on 12-6-93 .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThis 75 year old woman was previously admitted here in November 1993 for chronic angina .\\nShe had mild mitral regurgitation and a slightly diminished ejection fraction .\\nThere was a 90% right coronary stenosis which was reduced to 30 with a balloon angioplasty .\\nThere were three lesions in the circumflex , dilated successfully .\\nHowever , the low circumflex marginal vessel could not be crossed with the balloon .\\nShe did well in follow up , being treated for hypertension .\\nIn the end of 1992 , she was feeling well and was taken off Isordil .\\nDuring the winter and early parts of 1993 , the patient noticed increasing fatigue , symptoms of breathlessness and recurrent substernal chest pressure which finally led to admission to Xas Tupalmsmodral Hospital on 11-11-93 with documentation of a subendocardial myocardial infarction and a blood pressure of 210/108 .\\nCardiac catheterization towards the end of the hospitalization showed recurrent right coronary artery stenosis proximally and high grade new stenosis in the distal circumflex at the area of the origin of the previously untreated low circumflex marginal vessel .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\nMedications on transfer were Ecotrin , Vasotec 5 mg , Lopressor 25 bid , Isordil 20 tid , Procardia XL once per day , and Lasix 20 q3 days .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nOn physical examination , the blood pressure was 150 , heart rate 70 , bilateral carotid bruits , grade II systolic ejection murmur , good femoral pulses without bruits , good dorsalis pedis pulses with no posterior tibial pulses felt .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nThe electrocardiogram revealed left bundle branch block .\\nThe electrolytes were normal .\\nThe admission hematocrit was 34 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nOn 12-6-93 , angioplasty was performed of the right coronary artery using a 3 mm solo balloon reducing the stenosis from 80 to approximately 20% with a faint diagonal lucency which was not obstructive .\\nThe new distal circumflex lesion was dilated with a 2.0 mm balloon with a good result and minimal persistent stenosis .\\nBut the low circumflex marginal could not be entered with a wire .\\nThe first marginal had a 505 stenosis at its origin , which was not attempted .\\nThe patient did well post procedure .\\nHe developed a grape sized hematoma over the femoral artery with a loud bruit .\\nThe ultrasound on the day of discharge showed no evidence of pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula .\\nThe blood pressure was 150-170 systolic .\\nThe patient was ambulating without symptoms .\\nADDENDUM :\\nThe admission hematocrit was 34 .\\nThis fell to 25 after the cardiac catheterization without evidence of bleeding and rose to 29 by the time of discharge .\\nDOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :\\nShe was discharged with advice by Cardiac Rehabilitation for gradually increasing activity .\\nShe will be followed by her physician at Cean , Dr. Dieseld Pollejesc , for further pressure management and follow up of the femoral hematoma .\\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE :\\nStable , resolving anemia .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nEcotrin 160 mg per day , Vasotec 5 mg per day , Lopressor 25 bid , Isordil 20 tid , Procardia XL 30 per day , Lasix 20 mg q3 days .\\nTELSHEY STUDY , M.D.\\nTR :\\nah / BMot\\nDD :\\n12-9-93\\nTD :\\n12/11/93\\nCC :\\nDr. Telshey Study

was seen by Dr. Overall in the office on Aug 22 , 2003 , for follow-up .\\nShe was scheduled to have a total hi p replacement because of progressively worsening pain in the left hip .\\nHer pain was 8/10 .\\nShe limped .\\nShe did not use a cane .\\nShe did require a bannister going up and down stairs .\\nShe had trouble doing shoes and socks .\\nShe could walk limited distances .\\nSince seen by Dr. Overall in August , she had had a brain aneurysm .\\nShe had a mastectomy and had recently developed Parkinson 's.\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\n1. Breast cancer in the right breast , diagnosed in 1995 with negative nodes , treated with excision , recurrence in June , 2001 , further reconstructive surgery .\\nAt the same time , she underwent reduction of t he left breast .\\n2.

Imodium , 2 mg. q.a.m.\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nExamination reveals that the patient is walking with a mild limp .\\nThe left hip is a bit stiff with flexion to 90 degrees .\\nShe has 10 degrees of internal rotation and external rotation .\\nPulses are fine .\\nIMAGING :\\nX-rays were reviewed .\\nThey showed advanced arthritis of the left hip .\\nRECOMMENDATIONS :\\nDr. Etteme Overall recommended that the patient have a total hip replacement on the left side on February 2 , 2003 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nPlease refer to the operative note by Dr. Etteme Overall for details of the procedure .\\nPostoperatively , the patient was transferred to the floor in stable condition for observation , pain control and mobilization .\\nInitially postoperatively , she was doing quite well , though she did require four liters of oxygen postoperatively to maintain her oxygen saturations .\\nIt was hoped that she would wean off the oxygen over the course of the next few hours .\\nHowever , she did require four liters of oxygen all the way through the night to maintain oxygen saturations of 93% .\\nWithout oxygen , she dropped down to the low 80s .\\nGiven the unusual nature of this oxygen requirement , the patient underwent work-up with a chest X-ray , which essentially was normal .\\nAn ABG revealed a normal PCO2 of 32 , but a decrease in PO2- at 62 .\\nTherefore , given her history of breast cancer , the patient was taken for a spiral CT scan and the Medicine Service was consulted at that time .\\nThey agreed with our plan .\\nOn spiral CT scan , a small pulmonary embolus was seen in the right upper lobe and the left low er lobe .\\nShe was started on heparin at that time to maintain a PTT of 60 t o 80 , and was given doses of Coumadin , in addition to the Coumadin she had been given for DVT prophylaxis .\\nWith the recommendation of the medicine te am , we decided to maintain an INR of 2 to 3 with an overlap of heparin when the patient was therapeutic for two to three days .\\nShe continued to do quite well even though we did keep her on bed rest for three days while she was heparinized .\\nHer oxygen saturations continued to improve to the point that she was on room air on postoperative day four with oxygen saturation of 95% .\\nShe was given perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis for 48 hours after surgery .\\nShe was mobilized on postoperative day four , getting out of bed , able to do quite well on her new hip with a minimal amount of pain .\\nShe was given posterior hip dislocation precautions at that time , which she understood quite well .\\nShe continued to be followed by the medical team and was watched very closely by the orthopedic team until we felt comfortable that she was breathing quite well and was mobilizing well with physical therapy .\\nTherefore , it was decided at that time that the patient was ready for discharge to rehabilitation on Coumadin , which would be monitored for six months to maintain an INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nThe patient will continue all of her pre-admission medications , though no nonsteroidal analgesics , e.g. , aspirin or ibuprofen , will be given while she is on Coumadin therapy .\\n1. Colace , 100 mg. PO t.i.d.\\n2. Percocet , one to two tablets PO q.3 to 4 hours p.r.n. pain .\\n3. Coumadin with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nPlease prescribe 2 mg. tablets .\\nThe patient will be on Coumadin for six months given her history of pulmonary embolus .\\nDISCHARGE PLAN :\\nCoumadin for six months postoperatively with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nCheck INR three times a week until stable .\\nPlease call the results to Dr. Viennee Ester , the patient 's primary-care physician , who has agreed to follow her INR levels for the remainder of the six months .\\nDr. Viennee Ester is located in Tlandcousti Lo Vuclark , where the patient is from originally .\\nThe patient will call Dr. Overall 's office to arrange a follow-up appointment six weeks from the day of surgery .\\nStaples can be removed 10 to 14 days postoperatively .\\nPlease hold removal if the wound is draining .\\nThe patient may shower once the incision is dry , and may bathe and / or swim after the staples have been removed and there is no wound drainage .\\nPartial weight-bearing with crutches or a walker with posterior hip dislocation precautions for three months following surgery .\\nThese precautions have been explained and demonstrated to the patient .\\nThe patient has been instructed to call Dr. Overall 's office or the orthopedist on call with any questions or concerns about increasing pain , swelling , redness , wound drainage , fevers or chills at 094-897-3231 .\\nKEMA ESTER ,\\nMD DICTATING FOR :\\nElectronically Signed ETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D. 02/22/2003 07:01\\n_____________________________ ETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D.\\nTR :\\npe\\nDD :\\n02/08/2003\\nTD :\\n02/08/2003 6:34 P 737058\\ncc :\\nETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D. ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY ALLMID HEALTH CENTER KEMA ESTER , MILD VIENNEE C.

and flexible bronchoscopy and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy .\\nFindings included necrotic debris in the distal trachea at the carina and right mainstem bronchus .\\nEsophageal mucosa was visible through the trachea .\\nHer steroids were weaned and the patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 10 , 1994 where she underwent once again flexible bronchoscopy and flexible esophagoscopy , as well as rigid bronchoscopy .\\nShe then had a transhiatal esophagectomy which was partial , and a substernal gastric interposition as well as a jejunostomy .\\nThe pathology report suggested that the area was involved with radiation esophagitis and focal ulceration .\\nShe remained ventilator dependent postoperatively and was taken to the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit .\\nThe patient was maintained on triple antibiotics which included Vancomycin , ceftazidime and Gentamicin .\\nOn postoperative day two , she had an electroencephalogram which showed no evidence of seizure activity but some generalized slowing .\\nThe patient was seen in consultation by the Neurology Service for her apparent postoperative encephalopathy and episodes of shaking .\\nAn endoscopy was also performed on postoperative day two which showed clean anastomosis .\\nShe received multiple bronchoscopies for pulmonary toilet .\\nThe patient was maintained on tube feedings and the ventilator .\\nA repeat echocardiogram on February 18 showed no significant change of her previous echocardiogram on February 11 , which showed only a small pericardial effusion .\\nA pelvic and abdominal computerized tomography scan on February 18 also showed no evidence of a focal collection or abscess .\\nShe remained intermittently febrile despite numerous antibiotics .\\nHer chest X-ray showed bilateral air space disease , consistent with pneumonia or adult respiratory distress syndrome .\\nShe suffered an episode of renal failure which was felt attributable to aminoglycoside toxicity .\\nHer steroids were weaned .\\nBecause of her prolonged intubation and inability to wean , on February 24 , 1994 , she had a tracheostomy placed .\\nShe remained in a coma .\\nThe blood cultures on February 26 , 1994 grew out Staphylococcus and she was treated for septicemia .\\nHer sputum grew out Pseudomonas aeruginosa as well .\\nThe urine contained yeast and she was treated with amphotericin .\\nOn March 3 , 1994 , a repeat chest and abdominal and pelvis computerized tomography scan showed no evidence of fluid collections .\\nThere was a large left pleural effusion however .\\nThis was drained with a left chest tube .\\nHer sputum then grew out Klebsiella and she was treated with amikacin and imipenem .\\nShe developed a right pleural effusion and had a right chest tube placed .\\nOn March 13 , 1994 , she regained some level of consciousness .\\nShe was able to fix and follow with her eyes , respond to commands .\\nOn March 14 , 1994 , her right lung was pleurodesed .\\nAttempts were made to facilitate her wean by resting her overnight with a combination of propafol and Fentanyl .\\nThis was tried for approximately seven days with no real progress made toward facilitating her vent wean .\\nShe continued to require pressor support in the high 30 's .\\nShe also fell into a coma once again .\\nOn March 31 , 1994 , her pressor support requirement increased and she continued to have tachypneic episodes .\\nOn April 2 , 1994 , she had several episodes of bradycardia and asystole , which responded only to manual ventilation .\\nDiscussions were held with the patient 's family with regard to her previously expressed wishes not to be maintained on artificial life support for extended period of time with little or no hope for recovery .\\nShe had expressed these wishes in writing on several legal forms from the state of Jose Pineston , as well as in discussions with her loved ones .\\nDecision was made in conjunction with the family and Dr. Caslighlourdes to terminate artificial respiratory support .\\nThe patient was removed from the ventilator and placed on a T-piece in her trachea only and was made comfortable with narcotics .\\nHer respirations ceased and she died at 10:15 a.m. on April 2 , 1994 .\\nDISPOSITION / PLAN ON DISCHARGE :\\nThe family will return the body to Sa for burial .\\nThey have declined a post-mortem examination .\\nCA SHUFF ,

Medical Center for angioplasty .\\nPRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :\\nUnstable angina .\\nASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :\\nHypertension .\\nPRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :\\nRight and circumflex angioplasty , cardiac catheterization on 12-6-93 .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThis 75 year old woman was previously admitted here in November 1993 for chronic angina .\\nShe had mild mitral regurgitation and a slightly diminished ejection fraction .\\nThere was a 90% right coronary stenosis which was reduced to 30 with a balloon angioplasty .\\nThere were three lesions in the circumflex , dilated successfully .\\nHowever , the low circumflex marginal vessel could not be crossed with the balloon .\\nShe did well in follow up , being treated for hypertension .\\nIn the end of 1992 , she was feeling well and was taken off Isordil .\\nDuring the winter and early parts of 1993 , the patient noticed increasing fatigue , symptoms of breathlessness and recurrent substernal chest pressure which finally led to admission to Xas Tupalmsmodral Hospital on 11-11-93 with documentation of a subendocardial myocardial infarction and a blood pressure of 210/108 .\\nCardiac catheterization towards the end of the hospitalization showed recurrent right coronary artery stenosis proximally and high grade new stenosis in the distal circumflex at the area of the origin of the previously untreated low circumflex marginal vessel .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\nMedications on transfer were Ecotrin , Vasotec 5 mg , Lopressor 25 bid , Isordil 20 tid , Procardia XL once per day , and Lasix 20 q3 days .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nOn physical examination , the blood pressure was 150 , heart rate 70 , bilateral carotid bruits , grade II systolic ejection murmur , good femoral pulses without bruits , good dorsalis pedis pulses with no posterior tibial pulses felt .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nThe electrocardiogram revealed left bundle branch block .\\nThe electrolytes were normal .\\nThe admission hematocrit was 34 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nOn 12-6-93 , angioplasty was performed of the right coronary artery using a 3 mm solo balloon reducing the stenosis from 80 to approximately 20% with a faint diagonal lucency which was not obstructive .\\nThe new distal circumflex lesion was dilated with a 2.0 mm balloon with a good result and minimal persistent stenosis .\\nBut the low circumflex marginal could not be entered with a wire .\\nThe first marginal had a 505 stenosis at its origin , which was not attempted .\\nThe patient did well post procedure .\\nHe developed a grape sized hematoma over the femoral artery with a loud bruit .\\nThe ultrasound on the day of discharge showed no evidence of pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula .\\nThe blood pressure was 150-170 systolic .\\nThe patient was ambulating without symptoms .\\nADDENDUM :\\nThe admission hematocrit was 34 .\\nThis fell to 25 after the cardiac catheterization without evidence of bleeding and rose to 29 by the time of discharge .\\nDOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :\\nShe was discharged with advice by Cardiac Rehabilitation for gradually increasing activity .\\nShe will be followed by her physician at Cean , Dr. Dieseld Pollejesc , for further pressure management and follow up of the femoral hematoma .\\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE :\\nStable , resolving anemia .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nEcotrin 160 mg per day , Vasotec 5 mg per day , Lopressor 25 bid , Isordil 20 tid , Procardia XL 30 per day , Lasix 20 mg q3 days .\\nTELSHEY STUDY , M.D.\\nTR :\\nah / BMot\\nDD :\\n12-9-93\\nTD :\\n12/11/93\\nCC :\\nDr. Telshey Study

Imodium , 2 mg. q.a.m.\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nExamination reveals that the patient is walking with a mild limp .\\nThe left hip is a bit stiff with flexion to 90 degrees .\\nShe has 10 degrees of internal rotation and external rotation .\\nPulses are fine .\\nIMAGING :\\nX-rays were reviewed .\\nThey showed advanced arthritis of the left hip .\\nRECOMMENDATIONS :\\nDr. Etteme Overall recommended that the patient have a total hip replacement on the left side on February 2 , 2003 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nPlease refer to the operative note by Dr. Etteme Overall for details of the procedure .\\nPostoperatively , the patient was transferred to the floor in stable condition for observation , pain control and mobilization .\\nInitially postoperatively , she was doing quite well , though she did require four liters of oxygen postoperatively to maintain her oxygen saturations .\\nIt was hoped that she would wean off the oxygen over the course of the next few hours .\\nHowever , she did require four liters of oxygen all the way through the night to maintain oxygen saturations of 93% .\\nWithout oxygen , she dropped down to the low 80s .\\nGiven the unusual nature of this oxygen requirement , the patient underwent work-up with a chest X-ray , which essentially was normal .\\nAn ABG revealed a normal PCO2 of 32 , but a decrease in PO2- at 62 .\\nTherefore , given her history of breast cancer , the patient was taken for a spiral CT scan and the Medicine Service was consulted at that time .\\nThey agreed with our plan .\\nOn spiral CT scan , a small pulmonary embolus was seen in the right upper lobe and the left low er lobe .\\nShe was started on heparin at that time to maintain a PTT of 60 t o 80 , and was given doses of Coumadin , in addition to the Coumadin she had been given for DVT prophylaxis .\\nWith the recommendation of the medicine te am , we decided to maintain an INR of 2 to 3 with an overlap of heparin when the patient was therapeutic for two to three days .\\nShe continued to do quite well even though we did keep her on bed rest for three days while she was heparinized .\\nHer oxygen saturations continued to improve to the point that she was on room air on postoperative day four with oxygen saturation of 95% .\\nShe was given perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis for 48 hours after surgery .\\nShe was mobilized on postoperative day four , getting out of bed , able to do quite well on her new hip with a minimal amount of pain .\\nShe was given posterior hip dislocation precautions at that time , which she understood quite well .\\nShe continued to be followed by the medical team and was watched very closely by the orthopedic team until we felt comfortable that she was breathing quite well and was mobilizing well with physical therapy .\\nTherefore , it was decided at that time that the patient was ready for discharge to rehabilitation on Coumadin , which would be monitored for six months to maintain an INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nThe patient will continue all of her pre-admission medications , though no nonsteroidal analgesics , e.g. , aspirin or ibuprofen , will be given while she is on Coumadin therapy .\\n1. Colace , 100 mg. PO t.i.d.\\n2. Percocet , one to two tablets PO q.3 to 4 hours p.r.n. pain .\\n3. Coumadin with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nPlease prescribe 2 mg. tablets .\\nThe patient will be on Coumadin for six months given her history of pulmonary embolus .\\nDISCHARGE PLAN :\\nCoumadin for six months postoperatively with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nCheck INR three times a week until stable .\\nPlease call the results to Dr. Viennee Ester , the patient 's primary-care physician , who has agreed to follow her INR levels for the remainder of the six months .\\nDr. Viennee Ester is located in Tlandcousti Lo Vuclark , where the patient is from originally .\\nThe patient will call Dr. Overall 's office to arrange a follow-up appointment six weeks from the day of surgery .\\nStaples can be removed 10 to 14 days postoperatively .\\nPlease hold removal if the wound is draining .\\nThe patient may shower once the incision is dry , and may bathe and / or swim after the staples have been removed and there is no wound drainage .\\nPartial weight-bearing with crutches or a walker with posterior hip dislocation precautions for three months following surgery .\\nThese precautions have been explained and demonstrated to the patient .\\nThe patient has been instructed to call Dr. Overall 's office or the orthopedist on call with any questions or concerns about increasing pain , swelling , redness , wound drainage , fevers or chills at 094-897-3231 .\\nKEMA ESTER ,\\nMD DICTATING FOR :\\nElectronically Signed ETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D. 02/22/2003 07:01\\n_____________________________ ETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D.\\nTR :\\npe\\nDD :\\n02/08/2003\\nTD :\\n02/08/2003 6:34 P 737058\\ncc :\\nETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D. ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY ALLMID HEALTH CENTER KEMA ESTER , MILD VIENNEE C.

initially diagnosed in 1978 with atypical small cell carcinoma of the lung and treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy until 1980 .\\nShe did well for approximately twelve years until she was diagnosed with carcinoid cancer of the same right upper lobe .\\nThis may have been the initial primary cancer although it is unclear at present .\\nBronchoscopy at that time showed an endobronchial tumor of the right upper lobe bronchus and it was felt to be unresectable .\\nShe underwent four treatments of brachytherapy in March through May of 1993 .\\nShe had been doing reasonably well until December of 1993 when she presented with persistent and worsening cough and near strangulation on attempts at eating solids or drinking liquids .\\nA bronchoscopy showed a tracheoesophageal fistula with an opening into the trachea above the carina and no tumor in the right upper lobe .\\nShe has been on total parenteral nutrition and has been nothing by mouth since then .\\nA barium swallow

patient was admitted on February 5 , 1994 and had a central venous line placed in her right subclavian .\\nThe patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 6 , 1994 where she underwent rigid and flexible bronchoscopy and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy .\\nFindings included necrotic debris in the distal trachea at the carina and right mainstem bronchus .\\nEsophageal mucosa was visible through the trachea .\\nHer steroids were weaned and the patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 10 , 1994 where she underwent once again flexible bronchoscopy and flexible esophagoscopy , as well as rigid bronchoscopy .\\nShe then had a transhiatal esophagectomy which was partial , and a substernal gastric interposition as well as a jejunostomy .\\nThe pathology report suggested that the area was involved with radiation esophagitis and focal ulceration .\\nShe remained ventilator dependent postoperatively and was taken to the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit .\\nThe patient was maintained on triple antibiotics which included Vancomycin , ceftazidime and Gentamicin .\\nOn postoperative day two , she had an electroencephalogram which showed no evidence of seizure activity but

Medical Center for angioplasty .\\nPRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :\\nUnstable angina .\\nASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :\\nHypertension .\\nPRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :\\nRight and circumflex angioplasty , cardiac catheterization on 12-6-93 .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThis 75 year old woman was previously admitted here in November 1993 for chronic angina .\\nShe had mild mitral regurgitation and a slightly diminished ejection fraction .\\nThere was a 90% right coronary stenosis which was reduced to 30 with a balloon angioplasty .\\nThere were three lesions in the circumflex , dilated successfully .\\nHowever , the low circumflex marginal vessel could not be crossed with the balloon .\\nShe did well in follow up , being treated for hypertension .\\nIn the end of 1992 , she was feeling well and was taken off Isordil .\\nDuring the winter and early parts of 1993 , the patient noticed increasing fatigue , symptoms of breathlessness and recurrent substernal chest pressure which finally led to admission to Xas Tupalmsmodral Hospital on 11-11-93 with documentation of a subendocardial myocardial infarction and a blood pressure of 210/108 .\\nCardiac catheterization towards the end of the hospitalization showed recurrent right coronary artery stenosis proximally and high grade new stenosis in the distal circumflex at the area of the origin of the previously untreated low circumflex marginal vessel .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\nMedications on transfer were Ecotrin , Vasotec 5 mg , Lopressor 25 bid , Isordil 20 tid , Procardia XL once per day , and Lasix 20 q3 days .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nOn physical examination , the blood pressure was 150 , heart rate 70 , bilateral carotid bruits , grade II systolic ejection murmur , good femoral pulses without bruits , good dorsalis pedis pulses with no posterior tibial pulses felt .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nThe electrocardiogram revealed left bundle branch block .\\nThe electrolytes were normal .\\nThe admission hematocrit was 34 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nOn 12-6-93 , angioplasty was performed of the right coronary artery using a 3 mm solo balloon reducing the stenosis from 80 to approximately 20% with a faint diagonal lucency which was not obstructive .\\nThe new distal circumflex lesion was dilated with a 2.0 mm balloon with a good result and minimal persistent stenosis .\\nBut the low circumflex marginal could not be entered with a wire .\\nThe first marginal had a 505 stenosis at its origin , which was not attempted .\\nThe patient did well post procedure .\\nHe developed a grape sized hematoma over the femoral artery with a loud bruit .\\nThe ultrasound on the day of discharge showed no evidence of pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula .\\nThe blood pressure was 150-170 systolic .\\nThe patient was ambulating without symptoms .\\nADDENDUM :\\nThe admission hematocrit was 34 .\\nThis fell to 25 after the cardiac catheterization without evidence of bleeding and rose to 29 by the time of discharge .\\nDOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :\\nShe was discharged with advice by Cardiac Rehabilitation for gradually increasing activity .\\nShe will be followed by her physician at Cean , Dr. Dieseld Pollejesc , for further pressure management and follow up of the femoral hematoma .\\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE :\\nStable , resolving anemia .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nEcotrin 160 mg per day , Vasotec 5 mg

was seen by Dr. Overall in the office on Aug 22 , 2003 , for follow-up .\\nShe was scheduled to have a total hi p replacement because of progressively worsening pain in the left hip .\\nHer pain was 8/10 .\\nShe limped .\\nShe did not use a cane .\\nShe did require a bannister going up and down stairs .\\nShe had trouble doing shoes and socks .\\nShe could walk limited distances .\\nSince seen by Dr. Overall in August , she had had a brain aneurysm .\\nShe had a mastectomy and had recently developed Parkinson 's.\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\n1. Breast cancer in the right breast , diagnosed in 1995 with negative nodes , treated with excision , recurrence in June , 2001 , further reconstructive surgery .\\nAt the same time , she underwent reduction of t he left breast .\\n2. History of bipolar disorder , for which she sees Dr. Lettefriscbreun .\\nShe indicates this is stable at this time .\\n3. History of chronic anxiety .\\n4.

Imodium , 2 mg. q.a.m.\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nExamination reveals that the patient is walking with a mild limp .\\nThe left hip is a bit stiff with flexion to 90 degrees .\\nShe has 10 degrees of internal rotation and external rotation .\\nPulses are fine .\\nIMAGING :\\nX-rays were reviewed .\\nThey showed advanced arthritis of the left hip .\\nRECOMMENDATIONS :\\nDr. Etteme Overall recommended that the patient have a total hip replacement on the left side on February 2 , 2003 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nPlease refer to the operative note by Dr. Etteme Overall for details of the procedure .\\nPostoperatively , the patient was transferred to the floor in stable condition for observation , pain control and mobilization .\\nInitially postoperatively , she was doing quite well , though she did require four liters of oxygen postoperatively to maintain her oxygen saturations .\\nIt was hoped that she would wean off the oxygen over the course of the next few hours .\\nHowever , she did require four liters of oxygen all the way through the night to maintain oxygen saturations of 93% .\\nWithout oxygen , she dropped down to the low 80s .\\nGiven the unusual nature of this oxygen requirement , the patient underwent work-up with a chest X-ray , which essentially was normal .\\nAn ABG revealed a normal PCO2 of 32 , but a decrease in PO2- at 62 .\\nTherefore , given her history of breast cancer , the patient was taken for a spiral CT scan and the Medicine Service was consulted at that time .\\nThey agreed with our plan .\\nOn spiral CT scan , a small pulmonary embolus was seen in the right upper lobe and the left low er lobe .\\nShe was started on heparin at that time to maintain a PTT of 60 t o 80 , and was given doses of Coumadin , in addition to the Coumadin she had been given for DVT prophylaxis .\\nWith the recommendation of the medicine te am , we decided to maintain an INR of 2 to 3 with an overlap of heparin when the patient was therapeutic for two to three days .\\nShe continued to do quite well even though we did keep her on bed rest for three days while she was heparinized .\\nHer oxygen saturations continued to improve to the point that she was on room air on postoperative day four with oxygen saturation of 95% .\\nShe was given perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis for 48 hours after surgery .\\nShe was mobilized on postoperative day four , getting out of bed , able to do quite well on her new hip with a minimal amount of pain .\\nShe was given posterior hip dislocation precautions at that time , which she understood quite well .\\nShe continued to be followed by the medical team and was watched very closely by the orthopedic team until we felt comfortable that she was breathing quite well and was mobilizing well with physical therapy .\\nTherefore , it was decided at that time that the patient was ready for discharge to rehabilitation on Coumadin , which would be monitored for six months to maintain an INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nThe patient will continue all of her pre-admission medications , though no nonsteroidal analgesics , e.g. , aspirin or ibuprofen , will be given while she is on Coumadin therapy .\\n1. Colace , 100 mg. PO t.i.d.\\n2. Percocet , one to two tablets PO q.3 to 4 hours p.r.n. pain .\\n3. Coumadin with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nPlease prescribe 2 mg. tablets .\\nThe patient will be on Coumadin for six months given her history of pulmonary embolus .\\nDISCHARGE PLAN :\\nCoumadin for six months postoperatively with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nCheck INR three times a week until stable .\\nPlease call the results to Dr. Viennee Ester , the patient 's primary-care physician , who has agreed to follow her INR levels for the remainder of the six months .\\nDr. Viennee Ester is located in Tlandcousti Lo Vuclark , where the patient is from originally .\\nThe patient will call Dr. Overall 's office to arrange a follow-up appointment six weeks from the day of surgery .\\nStaples can be removed 10 to 14 days postoperatively .\\nPlease hold removal if the wound is draining .\\nThe patient may shower once the incision is dry , and may bathe and / or swim after the staples have been removed and there is no wound drainage .\\nPartial weight-bearing with crutches or a walker with posterior hip dislocation precautions for three months following surgery .\\nThese precautions have been explained and demonstrated to the patient .\\nThe patient has been instructed to call Dr. Overall 's office or the orthopedist on call with any questions or concerns about increasing pain , swelling , redness , wound drainage , fevers or chills at 094-897-3231 .\\nKEMA ESTER ,\\nMD DICTATING FOR :\\nElectronically Signed ETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D. 02/22/2003 07:01\\n_____________________________ ETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D.\\nTR :\\npe\\nDD :\\n02/08/2003\\nTD :\\n02/08/2003 6:34 P 737058\\ncc :\\nETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D. ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY ALLMID HEALTH CENTER KEMA ESTER , MILD VIENNEE C.

initially diagnosed in 1978 with atypical small cell carcinoma of the lung and treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy until 1980 .\\nShe did well for approximately twelve years until she was diagnosed with carcinoid cancer of the same right upper lobe .\\nThis may have been the initial primary cancer although it is unclear at present .\\nBronchoscopy at that time showed an endobronchial tumor of the right upper lobe bronchus and it was felt to be unresectable .\\nShe underwent four treatments of brachytherapy in March through May of 1993 .\\nShe had been doing reasonably well until December of 1993 when she presented with persistent and worsening cough and near strangulation on attempts at eating solids or drinking liquids .\\nA bronchoscopy showed a tracheoesophageal fistula with an opening into the trachea above the carina and no tumor in the right upper lobe .\\nShe has been on total parenteral nutrition and has been nothing by mouth since then .\\nA barium swallow prior to admission showed the presence of a tracheoesophageal fistula with entrance into the right mainstem bronchus below the carina .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\nBronchitis , asthma , carcinoid cancer , no history of coronary artery disease or cerebrovascular accident .\\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY :\\nThe patient is status post appendectomy , hysterectomy and right salpingo-oophorectomy ,

abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended .\\nExtremities :\\nno clubbing , cyanosis or edema .\\nThe rectal examination is guaiac negative with a minimal amount of stool .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was admitted on February 5 , 1994 and had a central venous line placed in her right subclavian .\\nThe patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 6 , 1994 where she underwent rigid and flexible bronchoscopy and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy .\\nFindings included necrotic debris in the distal trachea at the carina and right mainstem bronchus .\\nEsophageal mucosa was visible through the trachea .\\nHer steroids were weaned and the patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 10 , 1994 where she underwent once again flexible bronchoscopy and flexible esophagoscopy , as well as rigid bronchoscopy .\\nShe then had a transhiatal esophagectomy which was partial , and a substernal gastric interposition as well as a jejunostomy .\\nThe pathology report suggested that the area was involved with radiation esophagitis and focal ulceration .\\nShe remained ventilator dependent postoperatively and was taken to the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit .\\nThe patient was maintained on triple antibiotics which included Vancomycin , ceftazidime and Gentamicin .\\nOn postoperative day two , she had an electroencephalogram which showed no evidence of seizure activity but some generalized slowing .\\nThe patient was seen in consultation by the Neurology Service for her apparent postoperative encephalopathy and episodes of shaking .\\nAn endoscopy was also performed on postoperative day two which showed clean anastomosis .\\nShe received multiple bronchoscopies for pulmonary toilet .\\nThe patient was maintained on tube feedings and the ventilator .\\nA repeat echocardiogram on February 18 showed no significant change of her previous echocardiogram on February 11 , which showed only a small pericardial effusion .\\nA pelvic and abdominal computerized tomography scan on February 18 also showed no evidence of a focal collection or abscess .\\nShe remained intermittently febrile despite numerous antibiotics .\\nHer chest X-ray showed bilateral air space disease , consistent with pneumonia or adult respiratory distress syndrome .\\nShe suffered an episode of renal failure which was felt attributable to aminoglycoside toxicity .\\nHer steroids were weaned .\\nBecause of her prolonged intubation and inability to wean , on February 24 , 1994 , she had a tracheostomy placed .\\nShe remained in a coma .\\nThe blood cultures on February 26 , 1994 grew out Staphylococcus and she was treated for septicemia .\\nHer sputum grew out Pseudomonas aeruginosa as well .\\nThe urine contained yeast and she was treated with amphotericin .\\nOn March 3 , 1994 , a repeat chest and abdominal and pelvis computerized tomography scan showed no evidence of fluid collections .\\nThere was a large left pleural effusion however .\\nThis was drained with a left chest tube .\\nHer sputum then grew out Klebsiella and she was treated with amikacin and imipenem .\\nShe developed a right pleural effusion and had a right chest tube placed .\\nOn March 13 , 1994 , she regained some level of consciousness .\\nShe was able to fix and follow with her eyes , respond to commands .\\nOn March 14 , 1994 , her right lung was pleurodesed .\\nAttempts were made to facilitate her wean by resting her overnight with a combination of propafol and Fentanyl .\\nThis was tried for approximately seven days with no real progress made toward facilitating her vent wean .\\nShe continued to require pressor support in the high 30 's .\\nShe also fell into a coma once again .\\nOn March 31 , 1994 , her pressor support requirement increased and she continued to have tachypneic episodes .\\nOn April 2 , 1994 , she had several episodes of bradycardia and asystole , which responded only to manual ventilation .\\nDiscussions were held with the patient 's family with regard to her previously expressed wishes not to be maintained on artificial life support for extended period of time with little or no hope for recovery .\\nShe had expressed these wishes in writing on several legal forms from the state of Jose Pineston , as well as in discussions with her loved ones .\\nDecision was made in conjunction with the family and Dr. Caslighlourdes to terminate artificial respiratory support .\\nThe patient was removed from the ventilator and placed on a T-piece in her trachea only and was made comfortable with narcotics .\\nHer respirations ceased and she died at 10:15 a.m. on April 2 , 1994 .\\nDISPOSITION / PLAN ON DISCHARGE :\\nThe family will return the body to Sa for burial .\\nThey have declined a post-mortem examination .\\nCA SHUFF ,

catheterization on 12-6-93 .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThis 75 year old woman was previously admitted here in November 1993 for chronic angina .\\nShe had mild mitral regurgitation and a slightly diminished ejection fraction .\\nThere was a 90% right coronary stenosis which was reduced to 30 with a balloon angioplasty .\\nThere were three lesions in the circumflex , dilated successfully .\\nHowever , the low circumflex marginal vessel could not be crossed with the balloon .\\nShe did well in follow up , being treated for hypertension .\\nIn the end of 1992 , she was feeling well and was taken off Isordil .\\nDuring the winter and early parts of 1993 , the patient noticed increasing fatigue , symptoms of breathlessness and recurrent substernal chest pressure which finally led to admission to Xas Tupalmsmodral Hospital on 11-11-93 with documentation of a subendocardial myocardial infarction and a blood pressure of 210/108 .\\nCardiac catheterization towards the end of the hospitalization showed recurrent right coronary artery stenosis proximally and high grade new stenosis in the distal circumflex at the area of the origin of the previously untreated low circumflex marginal vessel .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\nMedications on transfer were Ecotrin , Vasotec 5 mg , Lopressor 25 bid , Isordil 20 tid , Procardia XL once per day , and Lasix 20 q3 days .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nOn physical examination , the blood pressure was 150 , heart rate 70 , bilateral carotid bruits , grade II systolic ejection murmur , good femoral pulses without bruits , good dorsalis pedis pulses with no posterior tibial pulses felt .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nThe electrocardiogram revealed left bundle branch block .\\nThe electrolytes were normal .\\nThe admission hematocrit was 34 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nOn 12-6-93 , angioplasty was performed of the right coronary artery using a 3 mm solo balloon reducing the stenosis from 80 to approximately 20% with a faint diagonal lucency which was not obstructive .\\nThe new distal circumflex lesion was dilated with a 2.0 mm balloon with a good result and minimal persistent stenosis .\\nBut the low circumflex marginal could not be entered with a wire .\\nThe first marginal had a 505 stenosis at its origin , which was not attempted .\\nThe patient did well post procedure .\\nHe developed a grape sized hematoma over the femoral artery with a loud bruit .\\nThe ultrasound on the day of discharge showed no evidence of pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula .\\nThe blood pressure was 150-170 systolic .\\nThe patient was ambulating without symptoms .\\nADDENDUM :\\nThe admission hematocrit was 34 .\\nThis fell to 25 after the cardiac catheterization without evidence of bleeding and rose to 29 by the time of discharge .\\nDOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :\\nShe was discharged with advice by Cardiac Rehabilitation for gradually increasing activity .\\nShe will be followed by her physician at Cean , Dr. Dieseld Pollejesc , for further pressure management and follow up of the femoral hematoma .\\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE :\\nStable , resolving anemia .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nEcotrin 160 mg per day , Vasotec 5 mg per day , Lopressor 25 bid , Isordil 20 tid , Procardia XL 30 per day , Lasix 20 mg q3 days .\\nTELSHEY STUDY , M.D.\\nTR :\\nah / BMot\\nDD :\\n12-9-93\\nTD :\\n12/11/93\\nCC :\\nDr. Telshey Study

was seen by Dr. Overall in the office on Aug 22 , 2003 , for follow-up .\\nShe was scheduled to have a total hi p replacement because of progressively worsening pain in the left hip .\\nHer pain was 8/10 .\\nShe limped .\\nShe did not use a cane .\\nShe did require a bannister going up and down stairs .\\nShe had trouble doing shoes and socks .\\nShe could walk limited distances .\\nSince seen by Dr. Overall in August , she had had a brain aneurysm .\\nShe had a mastectomy and had recently developed Parkinson 's.\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\n1. Breast cancer in the right breast , diagnosed in 1995 with negative nodes , treated with excision , recurrence in June , 2001 , further reconstructive surgery .\\nAt the same time , she underwent reduction of t he left breast .\\n2.

Imodium , 2 mg. q.a.m.\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nExamination reveals that the patient is walking with a mild limp .\\nThe left hip is a bit stiff with flexion to 90 degrees .\\nShe has 10 degrees of internal rotation and external rotation .\\nPulses are fine .\\nIMAGING :\\nX-rays were reviewed .\\nThey showed advanced arthritis of the left hip .\\nRECOMMENDATIONS :\\nDr. Etteme Overall recommended that the patient have a total hip replacement on the left side on February 2 , 2003 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nPlease refer to the operative note by Dr. Etteme Overall for details of the procedure .\\nPostoperatively , the patient was transferred to the floor in stable condition for observation , pain control and mobilization .\\nInitially postoperatively , she was doing quite well , though she did require four liters of oxygen postoperatively to maintain her oxygen saturations .\\nIt was hoped that she would wean off the oxygen over the course of the next few hours .\\nHowever , she did require four liters of oxygen all the way through the night to maintain oxygen saturations of 93% .\\nWithout oxygen , she dropped down to the low 80s .\\nGiven the unusual nature of this oxygen requirement , the patient underwent work-up with a chest X-ray , which essentially was normal .\\nAn ABG revealed a normal PCO2 of 32 , but a decrease in PO2- at 62 .\\nTherefore , given her history of breast cancer , the patient was taken for a spiral CT scan and the Medicine Service was consulted at that time .\\nThey agreed with our plan .\\nOn spiral CT scan , a small pulmonary embolus was seen in the right upper lobe and the left low er lobe .\\nShe was started on heparin at that time to maintain a PTT of 60 t o 80 , and was given doses of Coumadin , in addition to the Coumadin she had been given for DVT prophylaxis .\\nWith the recommendation of the medicine te am , we decided to maintain an INR of 2 to 3 with an overlap of heparin when the patient was therapeutic for two to three days .\\nShe continued to do quite well even though we did keep her on bed rest for three days while she was heparinized .\\nHer oxygen saturations continued to improve to the point that she was on room air on postoperative day four with oxygen saturation of 95% .\\nShe was given perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis for 48 hours after surgery .\\nShe was mobilized on postoperative day four , getting out of bed , able to do quite well on her new hip with a minimal amount of pain .\\nShe was given posterior hip dislocation precautions at that time , which she understood quite well .\\nShe continued to be followed by the medical team and was watched very closely by the orthopedic team until we felt comfortable that she was breathing quite well and was mobilizing well with physical therapy .\\nTherefore , it was decided at that time that the patient was ready for discharge to rehabilitation on Coumadin , which would be monitored for six months to maintain an INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nThe patient will continue all of her pre-admission medications , though no nonsteroidal analgesics , e.g. , aspirin or ibuprofen , will be given while she is on Coumadin therapy .\\n1. Colace , 100 mg. PO t.i.d.\\n2. Percocet , one to two tablets PO q.3 to 4 hours p.r.n. pain .\\n3. Coumadin with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nPlease prescribe 2 mg. tablets .\\nThe patient will be on Coumadin for six months given her history of pulmonary embolus .\\nDISCHARGE PLAN :\\nCoumadin for six months postoperatively with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nCheck INR three times a week until stable .\\nPlease call the results to Dr. Viennee Ester , the patient 's primary-care physician , who has agreed to follow her INR levels for the remainder of the six months .\\nDr. Viennee Ester is located in Tlandcousti Lo Vuclark , where the patient is from originally .\\nThe patient will call Dr. Overall 's office to arrange a follow-up appointment six weeks from the day of surgery .\\nStaples can be removed 10 to 14 days postoperatively .\\nPlease hold removal if the wound is draining .\\nThe patient may shower once the incision is dry , and may bathe and / or swim after the staples have been removed and there is no wound drainage .\\nPartial weight-bearing with crutches or a walker with posterior hip dislocation precautions for three months following surgery .\\nThese precautions have been explained and demonstrated to the patient .\\nThe patient has been instructed to call Dr. Overall 's office or the orthopedist on call with any questions or concerns about increasing pain , swelling , redness , wound drainage , fevers or chills at 094-897-3231 .\\nKEMA ESTER ,\\nMD DICTATING FOR :\\nElectronically Signed ETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D. 02/22/2003 07:01\\n_____________________________ ETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D.\\nTR :\\npe\\nDD :\\n02/08/2003\\nTD :\\n02/08/2003 6:34 P 737058\\ncc :\\nETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D. ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY ALLMID HEALTH CENTER KEMA ESTER , MILD VIENNEE C.

and flexible bronchoscopy and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy .\\nFindings included necrotic debris in the distal trachea at the carina and right mainstem bronchus .\\nEsophageal mucosa was visible through the trachea .\\nHer steroids were weaned and the patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 10 , 1994 where she underwent once again flexible bronchoscopy and flexible esophagoscopy , as well as rigid bronchoscopy .\\nShe then had a transhiatal esophagectomy which was partial , and a substernal gastric interposition as well as a jejunostomy .\\nThe pathology report suggested that the area was involved with radiation esophagitis and focal ulceration .\\nShe remained ventilator dependent postoperatively and was taken to the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit .\\nThe patient was maintained on triple antibiotics which included Vancomycin , ceftazidime and Gentamicin .\\nOn postoperative day two , she had an electroencephalogram which showed no evidence of seizure activity but some generalized slowing .\\nThe patient was seen in consultation by the Neurology Service for her apparent postoperative encephalopathy and episodes of shaking .\\nAn endoscopy was also performed on postoperative day two which showed clean anastomosis .\\nShe received multiple bronchoscopies for pulmonary toilet .\\nThe patient was maintained on tube feedings and the ventilator .\\nA repeat echocardiogram on February 18 showed no significant change of her previous echocardiogram on February 11 , which showed only a small pericardial effusion .\\nA pelvic and abdominal computerized tomography scan on February 18 also showed no evidence of a focal collection or abscess .\\nShe remained intermittently febrile despite numerous antibiotics .\\nHer chest X-ray showed bilateral air space disease , consistent with pneumonia or adult respiratory distress syndrome .\\nShe suffered an episode of renal failure which was felt attributable to aminoglycoside toxicity .\\nHer steroids were weaned .\\nBecause of her prolonged intubation and inability to wean , on February 24 , 1994 , she had a tracheostomy placed .\\nShe remained in a coma .\\nThe blood cultures on February 26 , 1994 grew out Staphylococcus and she was treated for septicemia .\\nHer sputum grew out Pseudomonas aeruginosa as well .\\nThe urine contained yeast and she was treated with amphotericin .\\nOn March 3 , 1994 , a repeat chest and abdominal and pelvis computerized tomography scan showed no evidence of fluid collections .\\nThere was a large left pleural effusion however .\\nThis was drained with a left chest tube .\\nHer sputum then grew out Klebsiella and she was treated with amikacin and imipenem .\\nShe developed a right pleural effusion and had a right chest tube placed .\\nOn March 13 , 1994 , she regained some level of consciousness .\\nShe was able to fix and follow with her eyes , respond to commands .\\nOn March 14 , 1994 , her right lung was pleurodesed .\\nAttempts were made to facilitate her wean by resting her overnight with a combination of propafol and Fentanyl .\\nThis was tried for approximately seven days with no real progress made toward facilitating her vent wean .\\nShe continued to require pressor support in the high 30 's .\\nShe also fell into a coma once again .\\nOn March 31 , 1994 , her pressor support requirement increased and she continued to have tachypneic episodes .\\nOn April 2 , 1994 , she had several episodes of bradycardia and asystole , which responded only to manual ventilation .\\nDiscussions were held with the patient 's family with regard to her previously expressed wishes not to be maintained on artificial life support for extended period of time with little or no hope for recovery .\\nShe had expressed these wishes in writing on several legal forms from the state of Jose Pineston , as well as in discussions with her loved ones .\\nDecision was made in conjunction with the family and Dr. Caslighlourdes to terminate artificial respiratory support .\\nThe patient was removed from the ventilator and placed on a T-piece in her trachea only and was made comfortable with narcotics .\\nHer respirations ceased and she died at 10:15 a.m. on April 2 , 1994 .\\nDISPOSITION / PLAN ON DISCHARGE :\\nThe family will return the body to Sa for burial .\\nThey have declined a post-mortem examination .\\nCA SHUFF ,

Medical Center for angioplasty .\\nPRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :\\nUnstable angina .\\nASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :\\nHypertension .\\nPRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :\\nRight and circumflex angioplasty , cardiac catheterization on 12-6-93 .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThis 75 year old woman was previously admitted here in November 1993 for chronic angina .\\nShe had mild mitral regurgitation and a slightly diminished ejection fraction .\\nThere was a 90% right coronary stenosis which was reduced to 30 with a balloon angioplasty .\\nThere were three lesions in the circumflex , dilated successfully .\\nHowever , the low circumflex marginal vessel could not be crossed with the balloon .\\nShe did well in follow up , being treated for hypertension .\\nIn the end of 1992 , she was feeling well and was taken off Isordil .\\nDuring the winter and early parts of 1993 , the patient noticed increasing fatigue , symptoms of breathlessness and recurrent substernal chest pressure which finally led to admission to Xas Tupalmsmodral Hospital on 11-11-93 with documentation of a subendocardial myocardial infarction and a blood pressure of 210/108 .\\nCardiac catheterization towards the end of the hospitalization showed recurrent right coronary artery stenosis proximally and high grade new stenosis in the distal circumflex at the area of the origin of the previously untreated low circumflex marginal vessel .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\nMedications on transfer were Ecotrin , Vasotec 5 mg , Lopressor 25 bid , Isordil 20 tid , Procardia XL once per day , and Lasix 20 q3 days .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nOn physical examination , the blood pressure was 150 , heart rate 70 , bilateral carotid bruits , grade II systolic ejection murmur , good femoral pulses without bruits , good dorsalis pedis pulses with no posterior tibial pulses felt .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nThe electrocardiogram revealed left bundle branch block .\\nThe electrolytes were normal .\\nThe admission hematocrit was 34 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nOn 12-6-93 , angioplasty was performed of the right coronary artery using a 3 mm solo balloon reducing the stenosis from 80 to approximately 20% with a faint diagonal lucency which was not obstructive .\\nThe new distal circumflex lesion was dilated with a 2.0 mm balloon with a good result and minimal persistent stenosis .\\nBut the low circumflex marginal could not be entered with a wire .\\nThe first marginal had a 505 stenosis at its origin , which was not attempted .\\nThe patient did well post procedure .\\nHe developed a grape sized hematoma over the femoral artery with a loud bruit .\\nThe ultrasound on the day of discharge showed no evidence of pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula .\\nThe blood pressure was 150-170 systolic .\\nThe patient was ambulating without symptoms .\\nADDENDUM :\\nThe admission hematocrit was 34 .\\nThis fell to 25 after the cardiac catheterization without evidence of bleeding and rose to 29 by the time of discharge .\\nDOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :\\nShe was discharged with advice by Cardiac Rehabilitation for gradually increasing activity .\\nShe will be followed by her physician at Cean , Dr. Dieseld Pollejesc , for further pressure management and follow up of the femoral hematoma .\\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE :\\nStable , resolving anemia .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nEcotrin 160 mg per day , Vasotec 5 mg per day , Lopressor 25 bid , Isordil 20 tid , Procardia XL 30 per day , Lasix 20 mg q3 days .\\nTELSHEY STUDY , M.D.\\nTR :\\nah / BMot\\nDD :\\n12-9-93\\nTD :\\n12/11/93\\nCC :\\nDr. Telshey Study

was seen by Dr. Overall in the office on Aug 22 , 2003 , for follow-up .\\nShe was scheduled to have a total hi p replacement because of progressively worsening pain in the left hip .\\nHer pain was 8/10 .\\nShe limped .\\nShe did not use a cane .\\nShe did require a bannister going up and down stairs .\\nShe had trouble doing shoes and socks .\\nShe could walk limited distances .\\nSince seen by Dr. Overall in August , she had had a brain aneurysm .\\nShe had a mastectomy and had recently developed Parkinson 's.\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\n1. Breast cancer in the right breast , diagnosed in 1995 with negative nodes , treated with excision , recurrence in June , 2001 , further reconstructive surgery .\\nAt the same time , she underwent reduction of t he left breast .\\n2. History of bipolar disorder , for which she sees Dr. Lettefriscbreun .\\nShe indicates this is stable at this time .\\n3. History of chronic anxiety .\\n4. Sleep apnea treated with UPP surgery in 1997 .\\nShe does not use CPAP .\\n5. History of diverticulitis .\\n6. Intermittent migraines .\\n7.

Imodium , 2 mg. q.a.m.\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nExamination reveals that the patient is walking with a mild limp .\\nThe left hip is a bit stiff with flexion to 90 degrees .\\nShe has 10 degrees of internal rotation and external rotation .\\nPulses are fine .\\nIMAGING :\\nX-rays were reviewed .\\nThey showed advanced arthritis of the left hip .\\nRECOMMENDATIONS :\\nDr. Etteme Overall recommended that the patient have a total hip replacement on the left side on February 2 , 2003 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nPlease refer to the operative note by Dr. Etteme Overall for details of the procedure .\\nPostoperatively , the patient was transferred to the floor in stable condition for observation , pain control and mobilization .\\nInitially postoperatively , she was doing quite well , though she did require four liters of oxygen postoperatively to maintain her oxygen saturations .\\nIt was hoped that she would wean off the oxygen over the course of the next few hours .\\nHowever , she did require four liters of oxygen all the way through the night to maintain oxygen saturations of 93% .\\nWithout oxygen , she dropped down to the low 80s .\\nGiven the unusual nature of this oxygen requirement , the patient underwent work-up with a chest X-ray , which essentially was normal .\\nAn ABG revealed a normal PCO2 of 32 , but a decrease in PO2- at 62 .\\nTherefore , given her history of breast cancer , the patient was taken for a spiral CT scan and the Medicine Service was consulted at that time .\\nThey agreed with our plan .\\nOn spiral CT scan , a small pulmonary embolus was seen in the right upper lobe and the left low er lobe .\\nShe was started on heparin at that time to maintain a PTT of 60 t o 80 , and was given doses of Coumadin , in addition to the Coumadin she had been given for DVT prophylaxis .\\nWith the recommendation of the medicine te am , we decided to maintain an INR of 2 to 3 with an overlap of heparin when the patient was therapeutic for two to three days .\\nShe continued to do quite well even though we did keep her on bed rest for three days while she was heparinized .\\nHer oxygen saturations continued to improve to the point that she was on room air on postoperative day four with oxygen saturation of 95% .\\nShe was given perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis for 48 hours after surgery .\\nShe was mobilized on postoperative day four , getting out of bed , able to do quite well on her new hip with a minimal amount of pain .\\nShe was given posterior hip dislocation precautions at that time , which she understood quite well .\\nShe continued to be followed by the medical team and was watched very closely by the orthopedic team until we felt comfortable that she was breathing quite well and was mobilizing well with physical therapy .\\nTherefore , it was decided at that time that the patient was ready for discharge to rehabilitation on Coumadin , which would be monitored for six months to maintain an INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nThe patient will continue all of her pre-admission medications , though no nonsteroidal analgesics , e.g. , aspirin or ibuprofen , will be given while she is on Coumadin therapy .\\n1. Colace , 100 mg. PO t.i.d.\\n2. Percocet , one to two tablets PO q.3 to 4 hours p.r.n. pain .\\n3. Coumadin with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nPlease prescribe 2 mg. tablets .\\nThe patient will be on Coumadin for six months given her history of pulmonary embolus .\\nDISCHARGE PLAN :\\nCoumadin for six months postoperatively with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nCheck INR three times a week until stable .\\nPlease call the results to Dr. Viennee Ester , the patient 's primary-care physician , who has agreed to follow her INR levels for the remainder of the six months .\\nDr. Viennee Ester is located in Tlandcousti Lo Vuclark , where the patient is from originally .\\nThe patient will call Dr. Overall 's office to arrange a follow-up appointment six weeks from the day of surgery .\\nStaples can be removed 10 to 14 days postoperatively .\\nPlease hold removal if the wound is draining .\\nThe patient may shower once the incision is dry , and may bathe and / or swim after the staples have been removed and there is no wound drainage .\\nPartial weight-bearing with crutches or a walker with posterior hip dislocation precautions for three months following surgery .\\nThese precautions have been explained and demonstrated to the patient .\\nThe patient has been instructed to call Dr. Overall 's office or the orthopedist on call with any questions or concerns about increasing pain , swelling , redness , wound drainage , fevers or chills at 094-897-3231 .\\nKEMA ESTER ,\\nMD DICTATING FOR :\\nElectronically Signed ETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D. 02/22/2003 07:01\\n_____________________________ ETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D.\\nTR :\\npe\\nDD :\\n02/08/2003\\nTD :\\n02/08/2003 6:34 P 737058\\ncc :\\nETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D. ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY ALLMID HEALTH CENTER KEMA ESTER , MILD VIENNEE C.

initially diagnosed in 1978 with atypical small cell carcinoma of the lung and treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy until 1980 .\\nShe did well for approximately twelve years until she was diagnosed with carcinoid cancer of the same right upper lobe .\\nThis may have been the initial primary cancer although it is unclear at present .\\nBronchoscopy at that time showed an endobronchial tumor of the right upper lobe bronchus and it was felt to be unresectable .\\nShe underwent four treatments of brachytherapy in March through May of 1993 .\\nShe had been doing reasonably well until December of 1993 when she presented with persistent and worsening cough and near strangulation on attempts at eating solids or drinking liquids .\\nA bronchoscopy showed a tracheoesophageal fistula with an opening into the trachea above the carina and no tumor in the right upper lobe .\\nShe has been on total parenteral nutrition and has been nothing by mouth since then .\\nA barium swallow

patient was admitted on February 5 , 1994 and had a central venous line placed in her right subclavian .\\nThe patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 6 , 1994 where she underwent rigid and flexible bronchoscopy and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy .\\nFindings included necrotic debris in the distal trachea at the carina and right mainstem bronchus .\\nEsophageal mucosa was visible through the trachea .\\nHer steroids were weaned and the patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 10 , 1994 where she underwent once again flexible bronchoscopy and flexible esophagoscopy , as well as rigid bronchoscopy .\\nShe then had a transhiatal esophagectomy which was partial , and a substernal gastric interposition as well as a jejunostomy .\\nThe pathology report suggested that the area was involved with radiation esophagitis and focal ulceration .\\nShe remained ventilator dependent postoperatively and was taken to the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit .\\nThe patient was maintained on triple antibiotics which included Vancomycin , ceftazidime and Gentamicin .\\nOn postoperative day two , she had an electroencephalogram which showed no evidence of seizure activity but

Medical Center for angioplasty .\\nPRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :\\nUnstable angina .\\nASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :\\nHypertension .\\nPRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :\\nRight and circumflex angioplasty , cardiac catheterization on 12-6-93 .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThis 75 year old woman was previously admitted here in November 1993 for chronic angina .\\nShe had mild mitral regurgitation and a slightly diminished ejection fraction .\\nThere was a 90% right coronary stenosis which was reduced to 30 with a balloon angioplasty .\\nThere were three lesions in the circumflex , dilated successfully .\\nHowever , the low circumflex marginal vessel could not be crossed with the balloon .\\nShe did well in follow up , being treated for hypertension .\\nIn the end of 1992 , she was feeling well and was taken off Isordil .\\nDuring the winter and early parts of 1993 , the patient noticed increasing fatigue , symptoms of breathlessness and recurrent substernal chest pressure which finally led to admission to Xas Tupalmsmodral Hospital on 11-11-93 with documentation of a subendocardial myocardial infarction and a blood pressure of 210/108 .\\nCardiac catheterization towards the end of the hospitalization showed recurrent right coronary artery stenosis proximally and high grade new stenosis in the distal circumflex at the area of the origin of the previously untreated low circumflex marginal vessel .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\nMedications on transfer were Ecotrin , Vasotec 5 mg , Lopressor 25 bid , Isordil 20 tid , Procardia XL once per day , and Lasix 20 q3 days .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nOn physical examination , the blood pressure was 150 , heart rate 70 , bilateral carotid bruits , grade II systolic ejection murmur , good femoral pulses without bruits , good dorsalis pedis pulses with no posterior tibial pulses felt .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nThe electrocardiogram revealed left bundle branch block .\\nThe electrolytes were normal .\\nThe admission hematocrit was 34 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nOn 12-6-93 , angioplasty was performed of the right coronary artery using a 3 mm solo balloon reducing the stenosis from 80 to approximately 20% with a faint diagonal lucency which was not obstructive .\\nThe new distal circumflex lesion was dilated with a 2.0 mm balloon with a good result and minimal persistent stenosis .\\nBut the low circumflex marginal could not be entered with a wire .\\nThe first marginal had a 505 stenosis at its origin , which was not attempted .\\nThe patient did well post procedure .\\nHe developed a grape sized hematoma over the femoral artery with a loud bruit .\\nThe ultrasound on the day of discharge showed no evidence of pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula .\\nThe blood pressure was 150-170 systolic .\\nThe patient was ambulating without symptoms .\\nADDENDUM :\\nThe admission hematocrit was 34 .\\nThis fell to 25 after the cardiac catheterization without evidence of bleeding and rose to 29 by the time of discharge .\\nDOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :\\nShe was discharged with advice by Cardiac Rehabilitation for gradually increasing activity .\\nShe will be followed by her physician at Cean , Dr. Dieseld Pollejesc , for further pressure management and follow up of the femoral hematoma .\\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE :\\nStable , resolving anemia .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nEcotrin 160 mg per day , Vasotec 5 mg

was seen by Dr. Overall in the office on Aug 22 , 2003 , for follow-up .\\nShe was scheduled to have a total hi p replacement because of progressively worsening pain in the left hip .\\nHer pain was 8/10 .\\nShe limped .\\nShe did not use a cane .\\nShe did require a bannister going up and down stairs .\\nShe had trouble doing shoes and socks .\\nShe could walk limited distances .\\nSince seen by Dr. Overall in August , she had had a brain aneurysm .\\nShe had a mastectomy and had recently developed Parkinson 's.\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\n1. Breast cancer in the right breast , diagnosed in 1995 with negative nodes , treated with excision , recurrence in June , 2001 , further reconstructive surgery .\\nAt the same time , she underwent reduction of t he left breast .\\n2. History of bipolar disorder , for which she sees Dr. Lettefriscbreun .\\nShe indicates this is stable at this time .\\n3. History of chronic anxiety .\\n4.

Imodium , 2 mg. q.a.m.\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nExamination reveals that the patient is walking with a mild limp .\\nThe left hip is a bit stiff with flexion to 90 degrees .\\nShe has 10 degrees of internal rotation and external rotation .\\nPulses are fine .\\nIMAGING :\\nX-rays were reviewed .\\nThey showed advanced arthritis of the left hip .\\nRECOMMENDATIONS :\\nDr. Etteme Overall recommended that the patient have a total hip replacement on the left side on February 2 , 2003 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nPlease refer to the operative note by Dr. Etteme Overall for details of the procedure .\\nPostoperatively , the patient was transferred to the floor in stable condition for observation , pain control and mobilization .\\nInitially postoperatively , she was doing quite well , though she did require four liters of oxygen postoperatively to maintain her oxygen saturations .\\nIt was hoped that she would wean off the oxygen over the course of the next few hours .\\nHowever , she did require four liters of oxygen all the way through the night to maintain oxygen saturations of 93% .\\nWithout oxygen , she dropped down to the low 80s .\\nGiven the unusual nature of this oxygen requirement , the patient underwent work-up with a chest X-ray , which essentially was normal .\\nAn ABG revealed a normal PCO2 of 32 , but a decrease in PO2- at 62 .\\nTherefore , given her history of breast cancer , the patient was taken for a spiral CT scan and the Medicine Service was consulted at that time .\\nThey agreed with our plan .\\nOn spiral CT scan , a small pulmonary embolus was seen in the right upper lobe and the left low er lobe .\\nShe was started on heparin at that time to maintain a PTT of 60 t o 80 , and was given doses of Coumadin , in addition to the Coumadin she had been given for DVT prophylaxis .\\nWith the recommendation of the medicine te am , we decided to maintain an INR of 2 to 3 with an overlap of heparin when the patient was therapeutic for two to three days .\\nShe continued to do quite well even though we did keep her on bed rest for three days while she was heparinized .\\nHer oxygen saturations continued to improve to the point that she was on room air on postoperative day four with oxygen saturation of 95% .\\nShe was given perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis for 48 hours after surgery .\\nShe was mobilized on postoperative day four , getting out of bed , able to do quite well on her new hip with a minimal amount of pain .\\nShe was given posterior hip dislocation precautions at that time , which she understood quite well .\\nShe continued to be followed by the medical team and was watched very closely by the orthopedic team until we felt comfortable that she was breathing quite well and was mobilizing well with physical therapy .\\nTherefore , it was decided at that time that the patient was ready for discharge to rehabilitation on Coumadin , which would be monitored for six months to maintain an INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nThe patient will continue all of her pre-admission medications , though no nonsteroidal analgesics , e.g. , aspirin or ibuprofen , will be given while she is on Coumadin therapy .\\n1. Colace , 100 mg. PO t.i.d.\\n2. Percocet , one to two tablets PO q.3 to 4 hours p.r.n. pain .\\n3. Coumadin with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nPlease prescribe 2 mg. tablets .\\nThe patient will be on Coumadin for six months given her history of pulmonary embolus .\\nDISCHARGE PLAN :\\nCoumadin for six months postoperatively with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nCheck INR three times a week until stable .\\nPlease call the results to Dr. Viennee Ester , the patient 's primary-care physician , who has agreed to follow her INR levels for the remainder of the six months .\\nDr. Viennee Ester is located in Tlandcousti Lo Vuclark , where the patient is from originally .\\nThe patient will call Dr. Overall 's office to arrange a follow-up appointment six weeks from the day of surgery .\\nStaples can be removed 10 to 14 days postoperatively .\\nPlease hold removal if the wound is draining .\\nThe patient may shower once the incision is dry , and may bathe and / or swim after the staples have been removed and there is no wound drainage .\\nPartial weight-bearing with crutches or a walker with posterior hip dislocation precautions for three months following surgery .\\nThese precautions have been explained and demonstrated to the patient .\\nThe patient has been instructed to call Dr. Overall 's office or the orthopedist on call with any questions or concerns about increasing pain , swelling , redness , wound drainage , fevers or chills at 094-897-3231 .\\nKEMA ESTER ,\\nMD DICTATING FOR :\\nElectronically Signed ETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D. 02/22/2003 07:01\\n_____________________________ ETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D.\\nTR :\\npe\\nDD :\\n02/08/2003\\nTD :\\n02/08/2003 6:34 P 737058\\ncc :\\nETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D. ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY ALLMID HEALTH CENTER KEMA ESTER , MILD VIENNEE C.

initially diagnosed in 1978 with atypical small cell carcinoma of the lung and treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy until 1980 .\\nShe did well for approximately twelve years until she was diagnosed with carcinoid cancer of the same right upper lobe .\\nThis may have been the initial primary cancer although it is unclear at present .\\nBronchoscopy at that time showed an endobronchial tumor of the right upper lobe bronchus and it was felt to be unresectable .\\nShe underwent four treatments of brachytherapy in March through May of 1993 .\\nShe had been doing reasonably well until December of 1993 when she presented with persistent and worsening cough and near strangulation on attempts at eating solids or drinking liquids .\\nA bronchoscopy showed a tracheoesophageal fistula with an opening into the trachea above the carina and no tumor in the right upper lobe .\\nShe has been on total parenteral nutrition and has been nothing by mouth since then .\\nA barium swallow prior to admission showed the presence of a tracheoesophageal fistula with entrance into the right mainstem bronchus below the carina .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\nBronchitis , asthma , carcinoid cancer , no history of coronary artery disease or cerebrovascular accident .\\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY :\\nThe patient is status post appendectomy , hysterectomy and right salpingo-oophorectomy ,

abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended .\\nExtremities :\\nno clubbing , cyanosis or edema .\\nThe rectal examination is guaiac negative with a minimal amount of stool .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was admitted on February 5 , 1994 and had a central venous line placed in her right subclavian .\\nThe patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 6 , 1994 where she underwent rigid and flexible bronchoscopy and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy .\\nFindings included necrotic debris in the distal trachea at the carina and right mainstem bronchus .\\nEsophageal mucosa was visible through the trachea .\\nHer steroids were weaned and the patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 10 , 1994 where she underwent once again flexible bronchoscopy and flexible esophagoscopy , as well as rigid bronchoscopy .\\nShe then had a transhiatal esophagectomy which was partial , and a substernal gastric interposition as well as a jejunostomy .\\nThe pathology report suggested that the area was involved with radiation esophagitis and focal ulceration .\\nShe remained ventilator dependent postoperatively and was taken to the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit .\\nThe patient was maintained on triple antibiotics which included Vancomycin , ceftazidime and Gentamicin .\\nOn postoperative day two , she had an electroencephalogram which showed no evidence of seizure activity but some generalized slowing .\\nThe patient was seen in consultation by the Neurology Service for her apparent postoperative encephalopathy and episodes of shaking .\\nAn endoscopy was also performed on postoperative day two which showed clean anastomosis .\\nShe received multiple bronchoscopies for pulmonary toilet .\\nThe patient was maintained on tube feedings and the ventilator .\\nA repeat echocardiogram on February 18 showed no significant change of her previous echocardiogram on February 11 , which showed only a small pericardial effusion .\\nA pelvic and abdominal computerized tomography scan on February 18 also showed no evidence of a focal collection or abscess .\\nShe remained intermittently febrile despite numerous antibiotics .\\nHer chest X-ray showed bilateral air space disease , consistent with pneumonia or adult respiratory distress syndrome .\\nShe suffered an episode of renal failure which was felt attributable to aminoglycoside toxicity .\\nHer steroids were weaned .\\nBecause of her prolonged intubation and inability to wean , on February 24 , 1994 , she had a tracheostomy placed .\\nShe remained in a coma .\\nThe blood cultures on February 26 , 1994 grew out Staphylococcus and she was treated for septicemia .\\nHer sputum grew out Pseudomonas aeruginosa as well .\\nThe urine contained yeast and she was treated with amphotericin .\\nOn March 3 , 1994 , a repeat chest and abdominal and pelvis computerized tomography scan showed no evidence of fluid collections .\\nThere was a large left pleural effusion however .\\nThis was drained with a left chest tube .\\nHer sputum then grew out Klebsiella and she was treated with amikacin and imipenem .\\nShe developed a right pleural effusion and had a right chest tube placed .\\nOn March 13 , 1994 , she regained some level of consciousness .\\nShe was able to fix and follow with her eyes , respond to commands .\\nOn March 14 , 1994 , her right lung was pleurodesed .\\nAttempts were made to facilitate her wean by resting her overnight with a combination of propafol and Fentanyl .\\nThis was tried for approximately seven days with no real progress made toward facilitating her vent wean .\\nShe continued to require pressor support in the high 30 's .\\nShe also fell into a coma once again .\\nOn March 31 , 1994 , her pressor support requirement increased and she continued to have tachypneic episodes .\\nOn April 2 , 1994 , she had several episodes of bradycardia and asystole , which responded only to manual ventilation .\\nDiscussions were held with the patient 's family with regard to her previously expressed wishes not to be maintained on artificial life support for extended period of time with little or no hope for recovery .\\nShe had expressed these wishes in writing on several legal forms from the state of Jose Pineston , as well as in discussions with her loved ones .\\nDecision was made in conjunction with the family and Dr. Caslighlourdes to terminate artificial respiratory support .\\nThe patient was removed from the ventilator and placed on a T-piece in her trachea only and was made comfortable with narcotics .\\nHer respirations ceased and she died at 10:15 a.m. on April 2 , 1994 .\\nDISPOSITION / PLAN ON DISCHARGE :\\nThe family will return the body to Sa for burial .\\nThey have declined a post-mortem examination .\\nCA SHUFF ,

catheterization on 12-6-93 .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThis 75 year old woman was previously admitted here in November 1993 for chronic angina .\\nShe had mild mitral regurgitation and a slightly diminished ejection fraction .\\nThere was a 90% right coronary stenosis which was reduced to 30 with a balloon angioplasty .\\nThere were three lesions in the circumflex , dilated successfully .\\nHowever , the low circumflex marginal vessel could not be crossed with the balloon .\\nShe did well in follow up , being treated for hypertension .\\nIn the end of 1992 , she was feeling well and was taken off Isordil .\\nDuring the winter and early parts of 1993 , the patient noticed increasing fatigue , symptoms of breathlessness and recurrent substernal chest pressure which finally led to admission to Xas Tupalmsmodral Hospital on 11-11-93 with documentation of a subendocardial myocardial infarction and a blood pressure of 210/108 .\\nCardiac catheterization towards the end of the hospitalization showed recurrent right coronary artery stenosis proximally and high grade new stenosis in the distal circumflex at the area of the origin of the previously untreated low circumflex marginal vessel .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\nMedications on transfer were Ecotrin , Vasotec 5 mg , Lopressor 25 bid , Isordil 20 tid , Procardia XL once per day , and Lasix 20 q3 days .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nOn physical examination , the blood pressure was 150 , heart rate 70 , bilateral carotid bruits , grade II systolic ejection murmur , good femoral pulses without bruits , good dorsalis pedis pulses with no posterior tibial pulses felt .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nThe electrocardiogram revealed left bundle branch block .\\nThe electrolytes were normal .\\nThe admission hematocrit was 34 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nOn 12-6-93 , angioplasty was performed of the right coronary artery using a 3 mm solo balloon reducing the stenosis from 80 to approximately 20% with a faint diagonal lucency which was not obstructive .\\nThe new distal circumflex lesion was dilated with a 2.0 mm balloon with a good result and minimal persistent stenosis .\\nBut the low circumflex marginal could not be entered with a wire .\\nThe first marginal had a 505 stenosis at its origin , which was not attempted .\\nThe patient did well post procedure .\\nHe developed a grape sized hematoma over the femoral artery with a loud bruit .\\nThe ultrasound on the day of discharge showed no evidence of pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula .\\nThe blood pressure was 150-170 systolic .\\nThe patient was ambulating without symptoms .\\nADDENDUM :\\nThe admission hematocrit was 34 .\\nThis fell to 25 after the cardiac catheterization without evidence of bleeding and rose to 29 by the time of discharge .\\nDOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :\\nShe was discharged with advice by Cardiac Rehabilitation for gradually increasing activity .\\nShe will be followed by her physician at Cean , Dr. Dieseld Pollejesc , for further pressure management and follow up of the femoral hematoma .\\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE :\\nStable , resolving anemia .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nEcotrin 160 mg per day , Vasotec 5 mg per day , Lopressor 25 bid , Isordil 20 tid , Procardia XL 30 per day , Lasix 20 mg q3 days .\\nTELSHEY STUDY , M.D.\\nTR :\\nah / BMot\\nDD :\\n12-9-93\\nTD :\\n12/11/93\\nCC :\\nDr. Telshey Study

was seen by Dr. Overall in the office on Aug 22 , 2003 , for follow-up .\\nShe was scheduled to have a total hi p replacement because of progressively worsening pain in the left hip .\\nHer pain was 8/10 .\\nShe limped .\\nShe did not use a cane .\\nShe did require a bannister going up and down stairs .\\nShe had trouble doing shoes and socks .\\nShe could walk limited distances .\\nSince seen by Dr. Overall in August , she had had a brain aneurysm .\\nShe had a mastectomy and had recently developed Parkinson 's.\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\n1. Breast cancer in the right breast , diagnosed in 1995 with negative nodes , treated with excision , recurrence in June , 2001 , further reconstructive surgery .\\nAt the same time , she underwent reduction of t he left breast .\\n2.

Imodium , 2 mg. q.a.m.\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nExamination reveals that the patient is walking with a mild limp .\\nThe left hip is a bit stiff with flexion to 90 degrees .\\nShe has 10 degrees of internal rotation and external rotation .\\nPulses are fine .\\nIMAGING :\\nX-rays were reviewed .\\nThey showed advanced arthritis of the left hip .\\nRECOMMENDATIONS :\\nDr. Etteme Overall recommended that the patient have a total hip replacement on the left side on February 2 , 2003 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nPlease refer to the operative note by Dr. Etteme Overall for details of the procedure .\\nPostoperatively , the patient was transferred to the floor in stable condition for observation , pain control and mobilization .\\nInitially postoperatively , she was doing quite well , though she did require four liters of oxygen postoperatively to maintain her oxygen saturations .\\nIt was hoped that she would wean off the oxygen over the course of the next few hours .\\nHowever , she did require four liters of oxygen all the way through the night to maintain oxygen saturations of 93% .\\nWithout oxygen , she dropped down to the low 80s .\\nGiven the unusual nature of this oxygen requirement , the patient underwent work-up with a chest X-ray , which essentially was normal .\\nAn ABG revealed a normal PCO2 of 32 , but a decrease in PO2- at 62 .\\nTherefore , given her history of breast cancer , the patient was taken for a spiral CT scan and the Medicine Service was consulted at that time .\\nThey agreed with our plan .\\nOn spiral CT scan , a small pulmonary embolus was seen in the right upper lobe and the left low er lobe .\\nShe was started on heparin at that time to maintain a PTT of 60 t o 80 , and was given doses of Coumadin , in addition to the Coumadin she had been given for DVT prophylaxis .\\nWith the recommendation of the medicine te am , we decided to maintain an INR of 2 to 3 with an overlap of heparin when the patient was therapeutic for two to three days .\\nShe continued to do quite well even though we did keep her on bed rest for three days while she was heparinized .\\nHer oxygen saturations continued to improve to the point that she was on room air on postoperative day four with oxygen saturation of 95% .\\nShe was given perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis for 48 hours after surgery .\\nShe was mobilized on postoperative day four , getting out of bed , able to do quite well on her new hip with a minimal amount of pain .\\nShe was given posterior hip dislocation precautions at that time , which she understood quite well .\\nShe continued to be followed by the medical team and was watched very closely by the orthopedic team until we felt comfortable that she was breathing quite well and was mobilizing well with physical therapy .\\nTherefore , it was decided at that time that the patient was ready for discharge to rehabilitation on Coumadin , which would be monitored for six months to maintain an INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nThe patient will continue all of her pre-admission medications , though no nonsteroidal analgesics , e.g. , aspirin or ibuprofen , will be given while she is on Coumadin therapy .\\n1. Colace , 100 mg. PO t.i.d.\\n2. Percocet , one to two tablets PO q.3 to 4 hours p.r.n. pain .\\n3. Coumadin with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nPlease prescribe 2 mg. tablets .\\nThe patient will be on Coumadin for six months given her history of pulmonary embolus .\\nDISCHARGE PLAN :\\nCoumadin for six months postoperatively with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nCheck INR three times a week until stable .\\nPlease call the results to Dr. Viennee Ester , the patient 's primary-care physician , who has agreed to follow her INR levels for the remainder of the six months .\\nDr. Viennee Ester is located in Tlandcousti Lo Vuclark , where the patient is from originally .\\nThe patient will call Dr. Overall 's office to arrange a follow-up appointment six weeks from the day of surgery .\\nStaples can be removed 10 to 14 days postoperatively .\\nPlease hold removal if the wound is draining .\\nThe patient may shower once the incision is dry , and may bathe and / or swim after the staples have been removed and there is no wound drainage .\\nPartial weight-bearing with crutches or a walker with posterior hip dislocation precautions for three months following surgery .\\nThese precautions have been explained and demonstrated to the patient .\\nThe patient has been instructed to call Dr. Overall 's office or the orthopedist on call with any questions or concerns about increasing pain , swelling , redness , wound drainage , fevers or chills at 094-897-3231 .\\nKEMA ESTER ,\\nMD DICTATING FOR :\\nElectronically Signed ETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D. 02/22/2003 07:01\\n_____________________________ ETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D.\\nTR :\\npe\\nDD :\\n02/08/2003\\nTD :\\n02/08/2003 6:34 P 737058\\ncc :\\nETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D. ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY ALLMID HEALTH CENTER KEMA ESTER , MILD VIENNEE C.

and flexible bronchoscopy and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy .\\nFindings included necrotic debris in the distal trachea at the carina and right mainstem bronchus .\\nEsophageal mucosa was visible through the trachea .\\nHer steroids were weaned and the patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 10 , 1994 where she underwent once again flexible bronchoscopy and flexible esophagoscopy , as well as rigid bronchoscopy .\\nShe then had a transhiatal esophagectomy which was partial , and a substernal gastric interposition as well as a jejunostomy .\\nThe pathology report suggested that the area was involved with radiation esophagitis and focal ulceration .\\nShe remained ventilator dependent postoperatively and was taken to the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit .\\nThe patient was maintained on triple antibiotics which included Vancomycin , ceftazidime and Gentamicin .\\nOn postoperative day two , she had an electroencephalogram which showed no evidence of seizure activity but some generalized slowing .\\nThe patient was seen in consultation by the Neurology Service for her apparent postoperative encephalopathy and episodes of shaking .\\nAn endoscopy was also performed on postoperative day two which showed clean anastomosis .\\nShe received multiple bronchoscopies for pulmonary toilet .\\nThe patient was maintained on tube feedings and the ventilator .\\nA repeat echocardiogram on February 18 showed no significant change of her previous echocardiogram on February 11 , which showed only a small pericardial effusion .\\nA pelvic and abdominal computerized tomography scan on February 18 also showed no evidence of a focal collection or abscess .\\nShe remained intermittently febrile despite numerous antibiotics .\\nHer chest X-ray showed bilateral air space disease , consistent with pneumonia or adult respiratory distress syndrome .\\nShe suffered an episode of renal failure which was felt attributable to aminoglycoside toxicity .\\nHer steroids were weaned .\\nBecause of her prolonged intubation and inability to wean , on February 24 , 1994 , she had a tracheostomy placed .\\nShe remained in a coma .\\nThe blood cultures on February 26 ,

1994 , she regained some level of consciousness .\\nShe was able to fix and follow with her eyes , respond to commands .\\nOn March 14 , 1994 , her right lung was pleurodesed .\\nAttempts were made to facilitate her wean by resting her overnight with a combination of propafol and Fentanyl .\\nThis was tried for approximately seven days with no real progress made toward facilitating her vent wean .\\nShe continued to require pressor support in the high 30 's .\\nShe also fell into a coma once again .\\nOn March 31 , 1994 , her pressor support requirement increased and she continued to have tachypneic episodes .\\nOn April 2 , 1994 , she had several episodes of bradycardia and asystole , which responded only to manual ventilation .\\nDiscussions were held with the patient 's family with regard to her previously expressed wishes not to be maintained on artificial life support for extended period of time with little or no hope for recovery .\\nShe had expressed these wishes in writing on several legal forms from the state of Jose Pineston , as well as in discussions with her loved ones .\\nDecision was made in conjunction with the family and Dr. Caslighlourdes to terminate

Medical Center for angioplasty .\\nPRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :\\nUnstable angina .\\nASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :\\nHypertension .\\nPRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :\\nRight and circumflex angioplasty , cardiac catheterization on 12-6-93 .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThis 75 year old woman was previously admitted here in November 1993 for chronic angina .\\nShe had mild mitral regurgitation and a slightly diminished ejection fraction .\\nThere was a 90% right coronary stenosis which was reduced to 30 with a balloon angioplasty .\\nThere were three lesions in the circumflex , dilated successfully .\\nHowever , the low circumflex marginal vessel could not be crossed with the balloon .\\nShe did well in follow up , being treated for hypertension .\\nIn the end of 1992 , she was feeling well and was taken off Isordil .\\nDuring the winter and early parts of 1993 , the patient noticed increasing fatigue , symptoms of breathlessness and recurrent substernal chest pressure which finally led to admission to Xas Tupalmsmodral Hospital on 11-11-93 with documentation of a subendocardial myocardial infarction and a blood pressure of 210/108 .\\nCardiac catheterization towards the end of the hospitalization showed recurrent right coronary artery stenosis proximally and high grade new stenosis in the distal circumflex at the area of the origin of the previously untreated low circumflex marginal vessel .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\nMedications on transfer were Ecotrin , Vasotec 5 mg , Lopressor 25 bid , Isordil 20 tid , Procardia XL once per day , and Lasix 20 q3 days .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nOn physical examination , the blood pressure was 150 , heart rate 70 , bilateral carotid bruits , grade II systolic ejection murmur , good femoral pulses without bruits , good dorsalis pedis pulses with no posterior tibial pulses felt .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nThe electrocardiogram revealed left bundle branch block .\\nThe electrolytes were normal .\\nThe admission hematocrit was 34 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nOn 12-6-93 , angioplasty was performed of the right coronary artery using a 3 mm solo balloon reducing the stenosis from 80 to approximately 20% with a faint diagonal lucency which was not obstructive .\\nThe new distal circumflex lesion was dilated with a 2.0 mm balloon with a good result and minimal persistent stenosis .\\nBut the low circumflex marginal could not be entered with a wire .\\nThe first marginal had a 505 stenosis at its origin , which was not attempted .\\nThe patient did well post procedure .\\nHe developed a grape sized hematoma over the femoral artery with a loud bruit .\\nThe ultrasound on the day of discharge showed no evidence of pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula .\\nThe blood pressure was 150-170 systolic .\\nThe patient was ambulating without symptoms .\\nADDENDUM :\\nThe admission hematocrit was 34 .\\nThis fell to 25 after the cardiac catheterization without evidence of bleeding and rose to 29 by the time of discharge .\\nDOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :\\nShe was discharged with advice by Cardiac Rehabilitation for gradually increasing activity .\\nShe will be followed by her physician at Cean , Dr. Dieseld Pollejesc , for further pressure management and follow up of the femoral hematoma .\\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE :\\nStable , resolving anemia .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nEcotrin 160 mg per day , Vasotec 5 mg per day , Lopressor 25 bid , Isordil 20 tid , Procardia XL 30 per day , Lasix 20 mg q3 days .\\nTELSHEY STUDY , M.D.\\nTR :\\nah / BMot\\nDD :\\n12-9-93\\nTD :\\n12/11/93\\nCC :\\nDr. Telshey Study

was seen by Dr. Overall in the office on Aug 22 , 2003 , for follow-up .\\nShe was scheduled to have a total hi p replacement because of progressively worsening pain in the left hip .\\nHer pain was 8/10 .\\nShe limped .\\nShe did not use a cane .\\nShe did require a bannister going up and down stairs .\\nShe had trouble doing shoes and socks .\\nShe could walk limited distances .\\nSince seen by Dr. Overall in August , she had had a brain aneurysm .\\nShe had a mastectomy and had recently developed Parkinson 's.\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\n1. Breast cancer in the right breast , diagnosed in 1995 with negative nodes , treated with excision , recurrence in June , 2001 , further reconstructive surgery .\\nAt the same time , she underwent reduction of t he left breast .\\n2. History of bipolar disorder , for which she sees Dr. Lettefriscbreun .\\nShe indicates this is stable at this time .\\n3. History of chronic anxiety .\\n4. Sleep apnea treated with UPP surgery in 1997 .\\nShe does not use CPAP .\\n5. History of diverticulitis .\\n6. Intermittent migraines .\\n7. History of prior cervical dysplasia , treated with LEEP procedure .\\n8. Osteoporosis .\\n9. Obsessive-compulsive disorder .\\n10. Panic disorder .\\n11. Aneurysm of the right internal auditory canal , treated with coil insertion .\\n12. Prior renal surgery .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\n1. Eskalith , 300 mg. twice at bedtime .\\n2. Femara , 2.5 mg. at bedtime .\\n3. Primidone , 50 mg. PO q.h.s.\\n4. Diazepam , 1 mg. PO q.h.s.\\n5. Paxil , 37.5 mg. q.a.m.\\n6. Synthroid , 100 mcg. q.a.m.\\n7. Ditropan XL , 10 mg.\\n8. Imodium , 2 mg. q.a.m.\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nExamination reveals that the patient is walking with a mild limp .\\nThe left hip is a bit stiff with flexion to 90 degrees .\\nShe has 10 degrees of internal rotation and external rotation .\\nPulses are fine .\\nIMAGING :\\nX-rays were reviewed .\\nThey showed advanced arthritis of the left hip .\\nRECOMMENDATIONS :\\nDr. Etteme Overall recommended that the patient have a total hip replacement on the left side on February 2 , 2003 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nPlease refer to the operative note by Dr. Etteme Overall for details of the procedure .\\nPostoperatively , the patient was transferred to the floor in stable condition for observation , pain control and mobilization .\\nInitially postoperatively , she was doing quite well , though she did require four liters of oxygen postoperatively to maintain her oxygen saturations .\\nIt was hoped that she would wean off the oxygen over the course of the next few hours .\\nHowever , she did require four liters of oxygen all the way through the night to maintain oxygen saturations of 93% .\\nWithout oxygen , she dropped down to the low 80s .\\nGiven the unusual nature of this oxygen requirement , the patient underwent work-up with a chest X-ray , which essentially was normal .\\nAn ABG revealed a normal PCO2 of 32 , but a decrease in PO2- at 62 .\\nTherefore , given her history of breast cancer , the patient was taken for a spiral CT scan and the Medicine Service was consulted at that time .\\nThey agreed with our plan .\\nOn spiral CT scan , a small pulmonary embolus was seen in the right upper lobe and the left low er lobe .\\nShe was started on heparin at that time to maintain a PTT of 60 t o 80 , and was given doses of Coumadin , in addition to the Coumadin she had been given for DVT prophylaxis .\\nWith the recommendation of the medicine te am , we decided to maintain an INR of 2 to 3 with an overlap of heparin when the patient was therapeutic for two to three days .\\nShe continued to do quite well even though we did keep her on bed rest for three days while she was heparinized .\\nHer oxygen saturations continued to improve to the point that she was on room air on postoperative day four with oxygen saturation of 95% .\\nShe was given perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis for 48 hours after surgery .\\nShe was mobilized on postoperative day four , getting out of bed , able to do quite well on her new hip with a minimal amount of pain .\\nShe was given posterior hip dislocation precautions at that time , which she understood quite well .\\nShe continued to be followed by the medical team and was watched very closely by the orthopedic team until we felt comfortable that she was breathing quite well and was mobilizing well with physical therapy .\\nTherefore , it was decided at that time that the patient was ready for discharge to rehabilitation on Coumadin , which would be monitored for six months to maintain an INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nThe patient will continue all of her pre-admission medications , though no nonsteroidal analgesics , e.g. , aspirin or ibuprofen , will be given while she is on Coumadin therapy .\\n1. Colace , 100 mg. PO t.i.d.\\n2. Percocet , one to two tablets PO q.3 to 4 hours p.r.n. pain .\\n3. Coumadin with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nPlease prescribe 2 mg. tablets .\\nThe patient will be on Coumadin for six months given her history of pulmonary embolus .\\nDISCHARGE PLAN :\\nCoumadin for six months postoperatively with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nCheck INR three times a week until stable .\\nPlease call the results to Dr. Viennee Ester , the patient 's primary-care physician , who has agreed to follow her INR levels for the remainder of the six months .\\nDr. Viennee Ester is located in Tlandcousti Lo Vuclark , where the patient is from originally .\\nThe patient will call Dr. Overall 's office to arrange a follow-up appointment six weeks from the day of surgery .\\nStaples can be removed 10 to 14 days postoperatively .\\nPlease hold removal if the wound is draining .\\nThe patient may shower once the incision is dry , and may bathe and / or swim after the staples have been removed and there is no wound drainage .\\nPartial weight-bearing with crutches or a walker with posterior hip dislocation precautions for three months following surgery .\\nThese precautions have been explained and demonstrated to the patient .\\nThe patient has been instructed to call Dr. Overall 's office or the orthopedist on call with any questions or concerns about increasing pain , swelling , redness , wound drainage , fevers or chills at 094-897-3231 .\\nKEMA ESTER ,\\nMD DICTATING FOR :\\nElectronically Signed ETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D. 02/22/2003 07:01\\n_____________________________ ETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D.\\nTR :\\npe\\nDD :\\n02/08/2003\\nTD :\\n02/08/2003 6:34 P 737058\\ncc :\\nETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D. ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY ALLMID HEALTH CENTER KEMA ESTER , MILD VIENNEE C.

initially diagnosed in 1978 with atypical small cell carcinoma of the lung and treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy until 1980 .\\nShe did well for approximately twelve years until she was diagnosed with carcinoid cancer of the same right upper lobe .\\nThis may have been the initial primary cancer although it is unclear at present .\\nBronchoscopy at that time showed an endobronchial tumor of the right upper lobe bronchus and it was felt to be unresectable .\\nShe underwent four treatments of brachytherapy in March through May of 1993 .\\nShe had been doing reasonably well until December of 1993 when she presented with persistent and worsening cough and near strangulation on attempts at eating solids or drinking liquids .\\nA bronchoscopy showed a tracheoesophageal fistula with an opening into the trachea above the carina and no tumor in the right upper lobe .\\nShe has been on total parenteral nutrition and has been nothing by mouth since then .\\nA barium swallow

patient was admitted on February 5 , 1994 and had a central venous line placed in her right subclavian .\\nThe patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 6 , 1994 where she underwent rigid and flexible bronchoscopy and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy .\\nFindings included necrotic debris in the distal trachea at the carina and right mainstem bronchus .\\nEsophageal mucosa was visible through the trachea .\\nHer steroids were weaned and the patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 10 , 1994 where she underwent once again flexible bronchoscopy and flexible esophagoscopy , as well as rigid bronchoscopy .\\nShe then had a transhiatal esophagectomy which was partial , and a substernal gastric interposition as well as a jejunostomy .\\nThe pathology report suggested that

Medical Center for angioplasty .\\nPRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :\\nUnstable angina .\\nASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :\\nHypertension .\\nPRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :\\nRight and circumflex angioplasty , cardiac catheterization on 12-6-93 .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThis 75 year old woman was previously admitted here in November 1993 for chronic angina .\\nShe had mild mitral regurgitation and a slightly diminished ejection fraction .\\nThere was a 90% right coronary stenosis which was reduced to 30 with a balloon angioplasty .\\nThere were three lesions in the circumflex , dilated successfully .\\nHowever , the low circumflex marginal vessel could not be crossed with the balloon .\\nShe did well in follow up , being treated for hypertension .\\nIn the end of 1992 , she was feeling well and was taken off Isordil .\\nDuring the winter and early parts of 1993 , the patient noticed increasing fatigue , symptoms of breathlessness and recurrent substernal chest pressure which finally led to admission to Xas Tupalmsmodral Hospital on 11-11-93 with documentation of a subendocardial myocardial infarction and a blood pressure of 210/108 .\\nCardiac catheterization towards the end of the hospitalization showed recurrent right coronary artery stenosis proximally and high grade new stenosis in the distal circumflex at the area of the origin of the previously untreated low circumflex marginal vessel .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\nMedications on transfer were Ecotrin , Vasotec 5 mg , Lopressor 25 bid , Isordil 20 tid , Procardia XL once per day , and Lasix 20 q3 days

Colace , 100 mg. PO t.i.d.\\n2. Percocet , one to two tablets PO q.3 to 4 hours p.r.n. pain .\\n3. Coumadin with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nPlease prescribe 2 mg. tablets .\\nThe patient will be on Coumadin for six months given her history of pulmonary embolus .\\nDISCHARGE PLAN :\\nCoumadin for six months postoperatively with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nCheck INR three times a week until stable .\\nPlease call the results to Dr. Viennee Ester , the patient 's primary-care physician , who has agreed to follow her INR levels for the remainder of the six months .\\nDr. Viennee Ester is located in Tlandcousti Lo Vuclark , where the patient is from originally .\\nThe patient will call Dr. Overall 's office to arrange a follow-up appointment six weeks from the day of surgery .\\nStaples can be removed 10 to 14 days postoperatively .\\nPlease hold removal if the wound is draining .\\nThe patient may shower once the incision is dry , and may bathe and / or swim after the staples have been removed and there is no wound drainage .\\nPartial weight-bearing with crutches or a walker with posterior hip dislocation precautions for three months following surgery .\\nThese precautions have been explained and demonstrated to the patient .\\nThe patient has been instructed to call Dr. Overall 's office or the orthopedist on call with any questions or concerns about increasing pain , swelling , redness , wound drainage , fevers or chills at 094-897-3231 .\\nKEMA ESTER ,\\nMD DICTATING FOR :\\nElectronically Signed ETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D. 02/22/2003 07:01\\n_____________________________ ETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D.\\nTR :\\npe\\nDD :\\n02/08/2003\\nTD :\\n02/08/2003 6:34 P 737058\\ncc :\\nETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D. ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY ALLMID HEALTH CENTER KEMA ESTER , MILD VIENNEE C.

initially diagnosed in 1978 with atypical small cell carcinoma of the lung and treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy until 1980 .\\nShe did well for approximately twelve years until she was diagnosed with carcinoid cancer of the same right upper lobe .\\nThis may have been the initial primary cancer although it is unclear at present .\\nBronchoscopy at that time showed an endobronchial tumor of the right upper lobe bronchus and it was felt to be unresectable .\\nShe underwent four treatments of brachytherapy in March through May of 1993 .\\nShe had been doing reasonably well until December of 1993 when she presented with persistent and worsening cough and near strangulation on attempts at eating solids or drinking liquids .\\nA bronchoscopy showed a tracheoesophageal fistula with an opening into the trachea above the carina and no tumor in the right upper lobe .\\nShe has been on total parenteral nutrition and has been nothing by mouth since then .\\nA barium swallow prior to admission showed the presence of a tracheoesophageal fistula with entrance into the right mainstem bronchus below the carina .\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\nBronchitis , asthma , carcinoid

abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended .\\nExtremities :\\nno clubbing , cyanosis or edema .\\nThe rectal examination is guaiac negative with a minimal amount of stool .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was admitted on February 5 , 1994 and had a central venous line placed in her right subclavian .\\nThe patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 6 , 1994 where she underwent rigid and flexible bronchoscopy and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy .\\nFindings included necrotic debris in the distal trachea at the carina and right mainstem bronchus .\\nEsophageal mucosa was visible through the trachea .\\nHer steroids were weaned and the patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 10 , 1994 where she underwent once again flexible bronchoscopy and flexible esophagoscopy , as well as rigid bronchoscopy .\\nShe then had a transhiatal esophagectomy which was partial , and a substernal gastric interposition as well as a jejunostomy .\\nThe pathology report suggested that the area was involved with radiation esophagitis and focal ulceration .\\nShe remained ventilator dependent postoperatively and was taken to the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit .\\nThe patient was maintained on triple antibiotics which included Vancomycin , ceftazidime and Gentamicin .\\nOn postoperative day two , she had an electroencephalogram which showed no evidence of seizure activity but some generalized slowing .\\nThe patient was seen in consultation by the Neurology Service for her apparent postoperative encephalopathy and episodes of shaking .\\nAn endoscopy was also performed on postoperative day two which showed clean anastomosis .\\nShe received multiple bronchoscopies for pulmonary toilet .\\nThe patient was maintained on tube feedings and the ventilator .\\nA repeat echocardiogram on February 18 showed no significant change of her previous echocardiogram on February 11 , which showed only a small pericardial effusion .\\nA pelvic and abdominal computerized tomography scan on February 18 also showed no evidence of a focal collection or abscess .\\nShe remained intermittently febrile despite numerous antibiotics .\\nHer chest X-ray showed bilateral air space disease , consistent with pneumonia or adult respiratory distress syndrome .\\nShe suffered an episode of renal failure which was felt attributable to aminoglycoside toxicity .\\nHer steroids were weaned .\\nBecause of her prolonged intubation and inability to wean , on February 24 , 1994 , she had a tracheostomy placed .\\nShe remained in a coma .\\nThe blood cultures on February 26 , 1994 grew out Staphylococcus and she was treated for septicemia .\\nHer sputum grew out Pseudomonas aeruginosa as well .\\nThe urine contained yeast and she was treated with amphotericin .\\nOn March 3 , 1994 , a repeat chest and abdominal and pelvis computerized tomography scan showed no evidence of fluid collections .\\nThere was a large left pleural effusion however .\\nThis was drained with a left chest tube .\\nHer sputum then grew out Klebsiella and she was treated with amikacin and imipenem .\\nShe developed a right pleural effusion and had a right chest tube placed .\\nOn March 13 , 1994 , she regained some level of consciousness .\\nShe was able to fix and follow with her eyes , respond to commands .\\nOn March 14 , 1994 , her right lung was pleurodesed .\\nAttempts were made to facilitate her wean by resting her overnight with a combination of propafol and Fentanyl .\\nThis was tried for approximately seven days with no real progress made toward facilitating her vent wean .\\nShe continued to require pressor support in the high 30 's .\\nShe also fell into a coma once again .\\nOn March 31 , 1994 , her pressor support requirement increased and she continued to have tachypneic episodes .\\nOn April 2 , 1994 , she had several episodes of bradycardia and asystole , which responded only to manual ventilation .\\nDiscussions were held with the patient 's family with regard to her previously expressed wishes not to be maintained on artificial life support for extended period of time with little or no hope for recovery .\\nShe had expressed these wishes in writing on several legal forms from the state of Jose Pineston , as well as in discussions with her loved ones .\\nDecision was made in conjunction with the family and Dr. Caslighlourdes to terminate artificial respiratory support .\\nThe patient was removed from the ventilator and placed on a T-piece in her trachea only and was made comfortable with narcotics .\\nHer respirations ceased and she died at 10:15 a.m. on April 2 , 1994 .\\nDISPOSITION / PLAN ON DISCHARGE :\\nThe family will return the body to Sa for burial .\\nThey have declined a post-mortem examination .\\nCA SHUFF ,

catheterization on 12-6-93 .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThis 75 year old woman was previously admitted here in November 1993 for chronic angina .\\nShe had mild mitral regurgitation and a slightly diminished ejection fraction .\\nThere was a 90% right coronary stenosis which was reduced to 30 with a balloon angioplasty .\\nThere were three lesions in the circumflex , dilated successfully .\\nHowever , the low circumflex marginal vessel could not be crossed with the balloon .\\nShe did well in follow up , being treated for hypertension .\\nIn the end of 1992 , she was feeling well and was taken off Isordil .\\nDuring the winter and early parts of 1993 , the patient noticed increasing fatigue , symptoms of breathlessness and recurrent substernal chest pressure which finally led to admission to Xas Tupalmsmodral Hospital on 11-11-93 with documentation of a subendocardial myocardial infarction and a blood pressure of 210/108 .\\nCardiac catheterization towards the end of the hospitalization showed recurrent right coronary artery stenosis proximally and high grade new stenosis in the distal circumflex at the area of the origin of the previously untreated low circumflex marginal vessel .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\nMedications on transfer were Ecotrin , Vasotec 5 mg , Lopressor 25 bid , Isordil 20 tid , Procardia XL once per day , and Lasix 20 q3 days .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nOn physical examination , the blood pressure was 150 , heart rate 70 , bilateral carotid bruits , grade II systolic ejection murmur , good femoral pulses without bruits , good dorsalis pedis pulses with no posterior tibial pulses felt .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nThe electrocardiogram revealed left bundle branch block .\\nThe electrolytes were normal .\\nThe admission hematocrit was 34 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nOn 12-6-93 , angioplasty was performed of the right coronary artery using a 3 mm solo balloon reducing the stenosis from 80 to approximately 20% with a faint diagonal lucency which was not obstructive .\\nThe new distal circumflex lesion was dilated with a 2.0 mm balloon with a good result and minimal persistent stenosis .\\nBut the low circumflex marginal could not be entered with a wire .\\nThe first marginal had a 505 stenosis at its origin , which was not attempted .\\nThe patient did well post procedure .\\nHe developed a grape sized hematoma over the femoral artery with a loud bruit .\\nThe ultrasound on the day of discharge showed no evidence of pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula .\\nThe blood pressure was 150-170 systolic .\\nThe patient was ambulating without symptoms .\\nADDENDUM :\\nThe admission hematocrit was 34 .\\nThis fell to 25 after the cardiac catheterization without evidence of bleeding and rose to 29 by the time of discharge .\\nDOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :\\nShe was discharged with advice by Cardiac Rehabilitation for gradually increasing activity .\\nShe will be followed by her physician at Cean , Dr. Dieseld Pollejesc , for further pressure management and follow up of the femoral hematoma .\\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE :\\nStable , resolving anemia .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nEcotrin 160 mg per day , Vasotec 5 mg per day , Lopressor 25 bid , Isordil 20 tid , Procardia XL 30 per day , Lasix 20 mg q3 days .\\nTELSHEY STUDY , M.D.\\nTR :\\nah / BMot\\nDD :\\n12-9-93\\nTD :\\n12/11/93\\nCC :\\nDr. Telshey Study

was seen by Dr. Overall in the office on Aug 22 , 2003 , for follow-up .\\nShe was scheduled to have a total hi p replacement because of progressively worsening pain in the left hip .\\nHer pain was 8/10 .\\nShe limped .\\nShe did not use a cane .\\nShe did require a bannister going up and down stairs .\\nShe had trouble doing shoes and socks .\\nShe could walk limited distances .\\nSince seen by Dr. Overall in August , she had had a brain aneurysm .\\nShe had a mastectomy and had recently developed Parkinson 's.\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\n1. Breast cancer in the right breast , diagnosed in 1995 with negative nodes , treated with excision , recurrence in June , 2001 , further reconstructive surgery .\\nAt the same time , she underwent reduction of t he left breast .\\n2. History of bipolar disorder , for which she sees Dr. Lettefriscbreun .\\nShe indicates this is stable at this time .\\n3. History of chronic anxiety .\\n4.

Imodium , 2 mg. q.a.m.\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nExamination reveals that the patient is walking with a mild limp .\\nThe left hip is a bit stiff with flexion to 90 degrees .\\nShe has 10 degrees of internal rotation and external rotation .\\nPulses are fine .\\nIMAGING :\\nX-rays were reviewed .\\nThey showed advanced arthritis of the left hip .\\nRECOMMENDATIONS :\\nDr. Etteme Overall recommended that the patient have a total hip replacement on the left side on February 2 , 2003 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nPlease refer to the operative note by Dr. Etteme Overall for details of the procedure .\\nPostoperatively , the patient was transferred to the floor in stable condition for observation , pain control and mobilization .\\nInitially postoperatively , she was doing quite well , though she did require four liters of oxygen postoperatively to maintain her oxygen saturations .\\nIt was hoped that she would wean off the oxygen over the course of the next few hours .\\nHowever , she did require four liters of oxygen all the way through the night to maintain oxygen saturations of 93% .\\nWithout oxygen , she dropped down to the low 80s .\\nGiven the unusual nature of this oxygen requirement , the patient underwent work-up with a chest X-ray , which essentially was normal .\\nAn ABG revealed a normal PCO2 of 32 , but a decrease in PO2- at 62 .\\nTherefore , given her history of breast cancer , the patient was taken for a spiral CT scan and the Medicine Service was consulted at that time .\\nThey agreed with our plan .\\nOn spiral CT scan , a small pulmonary embolus was seen in the right upper lobe and the left low er lobe .\\nShe was started on heparin at that time to maintain a PTT of 60 t o 80 , and was given doses of Coumadin , in addition to the Coumadin she had been given for DVT prophylaxis .\\nWith the recommendation of the medicine te am , we decided to maintain an INR of 2 to 3 with an overlap of heparin when the patient was therapeutic for two to three days .\\nShe continued to do quite well even though we did keep her on bed rest for three days while she was heparinized .\\nHer oxygen saturations continued to improve to the point that she was on room air on postoperative day four with oxygen saturation of 95% .\\nShe was given perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis for 48 hours after surgery .\\nShe was mobilized on postoperative day four , getting out of bed , able to do quite well on her new hip with a minimal amount of pain .\\nShe was given posterior hip dislocation precautions at that time , which she understood quite well .\\nShe continued to be followed by the medical team and was watched very closely by the orthopedic team until we felt comfortable that she was breathing quite well and was mobilizing well with physical therapy .\\nTherefore , it was decided at that time that the patient was ready for discharge to rehabilitation on Coumadin , which would be monitored for six months to maintain an INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nThe patient will continue all of her pre-admission medications , though no nonsteroidal analgesics , e.g. , aspirin or ibuprofen , will be given while she is on Coumadin therapy .\\n1. Colace , 100 mg. PO t.i.d.\\n2. Percocet , one to two tablets PO q.3 to 4 hours p.r.n. pain .\\n3. Coumadin with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nPlease prescribe 2 mg. tablets .\\nThe patient will be on Coumadin for six months given her history of pulmonary embolus .\\nDISCHARGE PLAN :\\nCoumadin for six months postoperatively with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nCheck INR three times a week until stable .\\nPlease call the results to Dr. Viennee Ester , the patient 's primary-care physician , who has agreed to follow her INR levels for the remainder of the six months .\\nDr. Viennee Ester is located in Tlandcousti Lo Vuclark , where the patient is from originally .\\nThe patient will call Dr. Overall 's office to arrange a follow-up appointment six weeks from the day of surgery .\\nStaples can be removed 10 to 14 days postoperatively .\\nPlease hold removal if the wound is draining .\\nThe patient may shower once the incision is dry , and may bathe and / or swim after the staples have been removed and there is no wound drainage .\\nPartial weight-bearing with crutches or a walker with posterior hip dislocation precautions for three months following surgery .\\nThese precautions have been explained and demonstrated to the patient .\\nThe patient has been instructed to call Dr. Overall 's office or the orthopedist on call with any questions or concerns about increasing pain , swelling , redness , wound drainage , fevers or chills at 094-897-3231 .\\nKEMA ESTER ,\\nMD DICTATING FOR :\\nElectronically Signed ETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D. 02/22/2003 07:01\\n_____________________________ ETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D.\\nTR :\\npe\\nDD :\\n02/08/2003\\nTD :\\n02/08/2003 6:34 P 737058\\ncc :\\nETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D. ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY ALLMID HEALTH CENTER KEMA ESTER , MILD VIENNEE C.

through the trachea .\\nHer steroids were weaned and the patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 10 , 1994 where she underwent once again flexible bronchoscopy and flexible esophagoscopy , as well as rigid bronchoscopy .\\nShe then had a transhiatal esophagectomy which was partial , and a substernal gastric interposition as well as a jejunostomy .\\nThe pathology report suggested that the area was involved with radiation esophagitis and focal ulceration .\\nShe remained ventilator dependent postoperatively and was taken to the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit .\\nThe patient was maintained on triple antibiotics which included Vancomycin , ceftazidime and Gentamicin .\\nOn postoperative day two , she had an electroencephalogram which showed no evidence of seizure activity but some generalized slowing .\\nThe patient was seen in consultation by the Neurology Service for her apparent postoperative encephalopathy and episodes of shaking .\\nAn endoscopy was also performed on postoperative day two which showed clean anastomosis .\\nShe received multiple bronchoscopies for pulmonary toilet .\\nThe patient was maintained on tube feedings and the ventilator .\\nA repeat echocardiogram on February 18 showed no significant change of her previous echocardiogram on February 11 , which showed only a small pericardial effusion .\\nA pelvic and abdominal computerized tomography scan on February 18 also showed no evidence of a focal collection or abscess .\\nShe remained intermittently febrile despite numerous antibiotics .\\nHer chest X-ray showed bilateral air space disease , consistent with pneumonia or adult respiratory distress syndrome .\\nShe suffered an episode of renal failure which was felt attributable to aminoglycoside toxicity .\\nHer steroids were weaned .\\nBecause of her prolonged intubation and inability to wean , on February 24 , 1994 , she had a tracheostomy placed .\\nShe remained in a coma .\\nThe blood cultures on February 26 , 1994 grew out Staphylococcus and she was treated for septicemia .\\nHer sputum grew out Pseudomonas aeruginosa as well .\\nThe urine contained yeast and she was treated with amphotericin .\\nOn March 3 , 1994 , a repeat chest and abdominal and pelvis computerized tomography scan showed no evidence of fluid collections .\\nThere was a large left pleural effusion however .\\nThis was drained with a left chest tube .\\nHer sputum then grew out Klebsiella and she was treated with amikacin and imipenem .\\nShe developed a right pleural effusion and had a right chest tube placed .\\nOn March 13 , 1994 , she regained some level of consciousness .\\nShe was able to fix and follow with her eyes , respond to commands .\\nOn March 14 , 1994 , her right lung was pleurodesed .\\nAttempts were made to facilitate her wean by resting her overnight with a combination of propafol and Fentanyl .\\nThis was tried for approximately seven days with no real progress made toward facilitating her vent wean .\\nShe continued to require pressor support in the high 30 's .\\nShe also fell into a coma once again .\\nOn March 31 , 1994 , her pressor support requirement increased and she continued to have tachypneic episodes .\\nOn April 2 , 1994 , she had several episodes of bradycardia and asystole , which responded only to manual ventilation .\\nDiscussions were held with the patient 's family with regard to her previously expressed wishes not to be maintained on artificial life support for extended period of time with little or no hope for recovery .\\nShe had expressed these wishes in writing on several legal forms from the state of Jose Pineston , as well as in discussions with her loved ones .\\nDecision was made in conjunction with the family and Dr. Caslighlourdes to terminate artificial respiratory support .\\nThe patient was removed from the ventilator and placed on a T-piece in her trachea only and was made comfortable with narcotics .\\nHer respirations ceased and she died at 10:15 a.m. on April 2 , 1994 .\\nDISPOSITION / PLAN ON DISCHARGE :\\nThe family will return the body to Sa for burial .\\nThey have declined a post-mortem examination .\\nCA SHUFF ,

Medical Center for angioplasty .\\nPRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :\\nUnstable angina .\\nASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :\\nHypertension .\\nPRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :\\nRight and circumflex angioplasty , cardiac catheterization on 12-6-93 .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThis 75 year old woman was previously admitted here in November 1993 for chronic angina .\\nShe had mild mitral regurgitation and a slightly diminished ejection fraction .\\nThere was a 90% right coronary stenosis which was reduced to 30 with a balloon angioplasty .\\nThere were three lesions in the circumflex , dilated successfully .\\nHowever , the low circumflex marginal vessel could not be crossed with the balloon .\\nShe did well in follow up , being treated for hypertension .\\nIn the end of 1992 , she was feeling well and was taken off Isordil .\\nDuring the winter and early parts of 1993 , the patient noticed increasing fatigue , symptoms of breathlessness and recurrent substernal chest pressure which finally led to admission to Xas Tupalmsmodral Hospital on 11-11-93 with documentation of a subendocardial myocardial infarction and a blood pressure of 210/108 .\\nCardiac catheterization towards the end of the hospitalization showed recurrent right coronary artery stenosis proximally and high grade new stenosis in the distal circumflex at the area of the origin of the previously untreated low circumflex marginal vessel .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\nMedications on transfer were Ecotrin , Vasotec 5 mg , Lopressor 25 bid , Isordil 20 tid , Procardia XL once per day , and Lasix 20 q3 days .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nOn physical examination , the blood pressure was 150 , heart rate 70 , bilateral carotid bruits , grade II systolic ejection murmur , good femoral pulses without bruits , good dorsalis pedis pulses with no posterior tibial pulses felt .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nThe electrocardiogram revealed left bundle branch block .\\nThe electrolytes were normal .\\nThe admission hematocrit was 34 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nOn 12-6-93 , angioplasty was performed of the right coronary artery using a 3 mm solo balloon reducing the stenosis from 80 to approximately 20% with a faint diagonal lucency which was not obstructive .\\nThe new distal circumflex lesion was dilated with a 2.0 mm balloon with a good result and minimal persistent stenosis .\\nBut the low circumflex marginal could not be entered with a wire .\\nThe first marginal had a 505 stenosis at its origin , which was not attempted .\\nThe patient did well post procedure .\\nHe developed a grape sized hematoma over the femoral artery with a loud bruit .\\nThe ultrasound on the day of discharge showed no evidence of pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula .\\nThe blood pressure was 150-170 systolic .\\nThe patient was ambulating without symptoms .\\nADDENDUM :\\nThe admission hematocrit was 34 .\\nThis fell to 25 after the cardiac catheterization without evidence of bleeding and rose to 29 by the time of discharge .\\nDOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :\\nShe was discharged with advice by Cardiac Rehabilitation for gradually increasing activity .\\nShe will be followed by her physician at Cean , Dr. Dieseld Pollejesc , for further pressure management and follow up of the femoral hematoma .\\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE :\\nStable , resolving anemia .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nEcotrin 160 mg per day , Vasotec 5 mg per day , Lopressor 25 bid , Isordil 20 tid , Procardia XL 30 per day , Lasix 20 mg q3 days .\\nTELSHEY STUDY , M.D.\\nTR :\\nah / BMot\\nDD :\\n12-9-93\\nTD :\\n12/11/93\\nCC :\\nDr. Telshey Study

was seen by Dr. Overall in the office on Aug 22 , 2003 , for follow-up .\\nShe was scheduled to have a total hi p replacement because of progressively worsening pain in the left hip .\\nHer pain was 8/10 .\\nShe limped .\\nShe did not use a cane .\\nShe did require a bannister going up and down stairs .\\nShe had trouble doing shoes and socks .\\nShe could walk limited distances .\\nSince seen by Dr. Overall in August , she had had a brain aneurysm .\\nShe had a mastectomy and had recently developed Parkinson 's.\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\n1. Breast cancer in the right breast , diagnosed in 1995 with negative nodes , treated with excision , recurrence in June , 2001 , further reconstructive surgery .\\nAt the same time , she underwent reduction of t he left breast .\\n2. History of bipolar disorder , for which she sees Dr. Lettefriscbreun .\\nShe indicates this is stable at this time .\\n3. History of chronic anxiety .\\n4. Sleep apnea treated with UPP surgery in 1997 .\\nShe does not use CPAP .\\n5. History of diverticulitis .\\n6. Intermittent migraines .\\n7. History of prior cervical dysplasia , treated with LEEP procedure .\\n8. Osteoporosis .\\n9. Obsessive-compulsive disorder .\\n10. Panic disorder .\\n11. Aneurysm of the right internal auditory canal , treated with coil insertion .\\n12. Prior renal surgery .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\n1. Eskalith , 300 mg. twice at bedtime .\\n2. Femara , 2.5 mg. at bedtime .\\n3. Primidone , 50 mg. PO q.h.s.\\n4. Diazepam , 1 mg. PO q.h.s.\\n5. Paxil , 37.5 mg. q.a.m.\\n6. Synthroid , 100 mcg. q.a.m.\\n7. Ditropan XL , 10 mg.\\n8. Imodium , 2 mg. q.a.m.\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nExamination reveals that the patient is walking with a mild limp .\\nThe left hip is a bit stiff with flexion to 90 degrees .\\nShe has 10 degrees of internal rotation and external rotation .\\nPulses are fine .\\nIMAGING :\\nX-rays were reviewed .\\nThey showed advanced arthritis of the left hip .\\nRECOMMENDATIONS :\\nDr. Etteme Overall recommended that the patient have a total hip replacement on the left side on February 2 , 2003 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nPlease refer to the operative note by Dr. Etteme Overall for details of the procedure .\\nPostoperatively , the patient was transferred to the floor in stable condition for observation , pain control and mobilization .\\nInitially postoperatively , she was doing quite well , though she did require four liters of oxygen postoperatively to maintain her oxygen saturations .\\nIt was hoped that she would wean off the oxygen over the course of the next few hours .\\nHowever , she did require four liters of oxygen all the way through the night to maintain oxygen saturations of 93% .\\nWithout oxygen , she dropped down to the low 80s .\\nGiven the unusual nature of this oxygen requirement , the patient underwent work-up with a chest X-ray , which essentially was normal .\\nAn ABG revealed a normal PCO2 of 32 , but a decrease in PO2- at 62 .\\nTherefore , given her history of breast cancer , the patient was taken for a spiral CT scan and the Medicine Service was consulted at that time .\\nThey agreed with our plan .\\nOn spiral CT scan , a small pulmonary embolus was seen in the right upper lobe and the left low er lobe .\\nShe was started on heparin at that time to maintain a PTT of 60 t o 80 , and was given doses of Coumadin , in addition to the Coumadin she had been given for DVT prophylaxis .\\nWith the recommendation of the medicine te am , we decided to maintain an INR of 2 to 3 with an overlap of heparin when the patient was therapeutic for two to three days .\\nShe continued to do quite well even though we did keep her on bed rest for three days while she was heparinized .\\nHer oxygen saturations continued to improve to the point that she was on room air on postoperative day four with oxygen saturation of 95% .\\nShe was given perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis for 48 hours after surgery .\\nShe was mobilized on postoperative day four , getting out of bed , able to do quite well on her new hip with a minimal amount of pain .\\nShe was given posterior hip dislocation precautions at that time , which she understood quite well .\\nShe continued to be followed by the medical team and was watched very closely by the orthopedic team until we felt comfortable that she was breathing quite well and was mobilizing well with physical therapy .\\nTherefore , it was decided at that time that the patient was ready for discharge to rehabilitation on Coumadin , which would be monitored for six months to maintain an INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nThe patient will continue all of her pre-admission medications , though no nonsteroidal analgesics , e.g. , aspirin or ibuprofen , will be given while she is on Coumadin therapy .\\n1. Colace , 100 mg. PO t.i.d.\\n2. Percocet , one to two tablets PO q.3 to 4 hours p.r.n. pain .\\n3. Coumadin with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nPlease prescribe 2 mg. tablets .\\nThe patient will be on Coumadin for six months given her history of pulmonary embolus .\\nDISCHARGE PLAN :\\nCoumadin for six months postoperatively with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nCheck INR three times a week until stable .\\nPlease call the results to Dr. Viennee Ester , the patient 's primary-care physician , who has agreed to follow her INR levels for the remainder of the six months .\\nDr. Viennee Ester is located in Tlandcousti Lo Vuclark , where the patient is from originally .\\nThe patient will call Dr. Overall 's office to arrange a follow-up appointment six weeks from the day of surgery .\\nStaples can be removed 10 to 14 days postoperatively .\\nPlease hold removal if the wound is draining .\\nThe patient may shower once the incision is dry , and may bathe and / or swim after the staples have been removed and there is no wound drainage .\\nPartial weight-bearing with crutches or a walker with posterior hip dislocation precautions for three months following surgery .\\nThese precautions have been explained and demonstrated to the patient .\\nThe patient has been instructed to call Dr. Overall 's office or the orthopedist on call with any questions or concerns about increasing pain , swelling , redness , wound drainage , fevers or chills at 094-897-3231 .\\nKEMA ESTER ,\\nMD DICTATING FOR :\\nElectronically Signed ETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D. 02/22/2003 07:01\\n_____________________________ ETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D.\\nTR :\\npe\\nDD :\\n02/08/2003\\nTD :\\n02/08/2003 6:34 P 737058\\ncc :\\nETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D. ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY ALLMID HEALTH CENTER KEMA ESTER , MILD VIENNEE C.

initially diagnosed in 1978 with atypical small cell carcinoma of the lung and treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy until 1980 .\\nShe did well for approximately twelve years until she was diagnosed with carcinoid cancer of the same right upper lobe .\\nThis may have been the initial primary cancer although it is unclear at present .\\nBronchoscopy at that time showed an endobronchial tumor of the right upper lobe bronchus and it was felt to be unresectable .\\nShe underwent four treatments of brachytherapy in March through May of 1993 .\\nShe had been doing reasonably well until December of 1993 when she presented with persistent and worsening cough and near strangulation on attempts at eating solids or drinking liquids .\\nA bronchoscopy showed a tracheoesophageal fistula with an opening into the trachea above the carina and no tumor in the right upper lobe .\\nShe has been on total parenteral nutrition and has been nothing by mouth since then .\\nA barium swallow

patient was admitted on February 5 , 1994 and had a central venous line placed in her right subclavian .\\nThe patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 6 , 1994 where she underwent rigid and flexible bronchoscopy and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy .\\nFindings included necrotic debris in the distal trachea at the carina and right mainstem bronchus .\\nEsophageal mucosa was visible through the trachea .\\nHer steroids were weaned and the patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 10 , 1994 where she underwent once again flexible bronchoscopy and flexible esophagoscopy , as well as rigid bronchoscopy .\\nShe then had a transhiatal esophagectomy which was partial , and a substernal gastric interposition as well as a jejunostomy .\\nThe pathology report suggested that

Medical Center for angioplasty .\\nPRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :\\nUnstable angina .\\nASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :\\nHypertension .\\nPRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :\\nRight and circumflex angioplasty , cardiac catheterization on 12-6-93 .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThis 75 year old woman was previously admitted here in November 1993 for chronic angina .\\nShe had mild mitral regurgitation and a slightly diminished ejection fraction .\\nThere was a 90% right coronary stenosis which was reduced to 30 with a balloon angioplasty .\\nThere were three lesions in the circumflex , dilated successfully .\\nHowever , the low circumflex marginal vessel could not be crossed with the balloon .\\nShe did well in follow up , being treated for hypertension .\\nIn the end of 1992 , she was feeling well and was taken off Isordil .\\nDuring the winter and early parts of 1993 , the patient noticed increasing fatigue , symptoms of breathlessness and recurrent substernal chest pressure which finally led to admission to Xas Tupalmsmodral Hospital on 11-11-93 with documentation of a subendocardial myocardial infarction and a blood pressure of 210/108 .\\nCardiac catheterization towards the end of the hospitalization showed recurrent right coronary artery stenosis proximally and high grade new stenosis in the distal circumflex at the area of the origin of the previously untreated low circumflex marginal vessel .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\nMedications on transfer were Ecotrin , Vasotec 5 mg , Lopressor 25 bid , Isordil 20 tid , Procardia XL once per day , and Lasix 20 q3 days .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nOn physical examination , the blood pressure was 150 , heart rate 70 , bilateral carotid bruits , grade II systolic ejection murmur , good femoral pulses without bruits , good dorsalis pedis pulses with no posterior tibial pulses felt .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nThe electrocardiogram revealed left bundle branch block .\\nThe electrolytes were normal .\\nThe admission hematocrit was 34 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nOn 12-6-93 , angioplasty was performed of the right coronary artery using a 3 mm solo balloon reducing the stenosis from 80 to approximately 20% with a faint diagonal lucency which was not obstructive .\\nThe new distal circumflex lesion was dilated with a 2.0 mm balloon with a good result and minimal persistent stenosis .\\nBut the low circumflex marginal could not be entered with a wire .\\nThe first marginal had a 505 stenosis at its origin , which was not attempted .\\nThe patient did well post procedure .\\nHe developed a grape sized hematoma over the femoral artery with a loud bruit .\\nThe ultrasound on the day of discharge showed no evidence of pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula .\\nThe blood pressure was 150-170 systolic .\\nThe patient was ambulating without symptoms .\\nADDENDUM :\\nThe admission hematocrit was 34 .\\nThis fell to 25 after the cardiac catheterization without evidence of bleeding and rose to 29 by the time of discharge .\\nDOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :\\nShe was discharged with advice by Cardiac Rehabilitation for gradually increasing activity .\\nShe will be followed by her physician at Cean , Dr. Dieseld Pollejesc , for further pressure management and follow up of the femoral hematoma .\\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE :\\nStable , resolving anemia .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nEcotrin 160 mg per day , Vasotec 5 mg

Colace , 100 mg. PO t.i.d.\\n2. Percocet , one to two tablets PO q.3 to 4 hours p.r.n. pain .\\n3. Coumadin with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nPlease prescribe 2 mg. tablets .\\nThe patient will be on Coumadin for six months given her history of pulmonary embolus .\\nDISCHARGE PLAN :\\nCoumadin for six months postoperatively with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nCheck INR three times a week until stable .\\nPlease call the results to Dr. Viennee Ester , the patient 's primary-care physician , who has agreed to follow her INR levels for the remainder of the six months .\\nDr. Viennee Ester is located in Tlandcousti Lo Vuclark , where the patient is from originally .\\nThe patient will call Dr. Overall 's office to arrange a follow-up appointment six weeks from the day of surgery .\\nStaples can be removed 10 to 14 days postoperatively .\\nPlease hold removal if the wound is draining .\\nThe patient may shower once the incision is dry , and may bathe and / or swim after the staples have been removed and there is no wound drainage .\\nPartial weight-bearing with crutches or a walker with posterior hip dislocation precautions for three months following surgery .\\nThese precautions have been explained and demonstrated to the patient .\\nThe patient has been instructed to call Dr. Overall 's office or the orthopedist on call with any questions or concerns about increasing pain , swelling , redness , wound drainage , fevers or chills at 094-897-3231 .\\nKEMA ESTER ,\\nMD DICTATING FOR :\\nElectronically Signed ETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D. 02/22/2003 07:01\\n_____________________________ ETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D.\\nTR :\\npe\\nDD :\\n02/08/2003\\nTD :\\n02/08/2003 6:34 P 737058\\ncc :\\nETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D. ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY ALLMID HEALTH CENTER KEMA ESTER , MILD VIENNEE C.

initially diagnosed in 1978 with atypical small cell carcinoma of the lung and treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy until 1980 .\\nShe did well for approximately twelve years until she was diagnosed with carcinoid cancer of the same right upper lobe .\\nThis may have been the initial primary cancer although it is unclear at present .\\nBronchoscopy at that time showed an endobronchial tumor of the right upper lobe bronchus and it was felt to be unresectable .\\nShe underwent four treatments of brachytherapy in March through May of 1993 .\\nShe had been doing reasonably well until December of 1993 when she presented with persistent and worsening cough and near strangulation on attempts at eating solids or drinking liquids .\\nA bronchoscopy showed a tracheoesophageal fistula with an opening into the trachea above the carina and no tumor in the right upper lobe .\\nShe has been on total parenteral nutrition and has been nothing by mouth since then .\\nA barium swallow

abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended .\\nExtremities :\\nno clubbing , cyanosis or edema .\\nThe rectal examination is guaiac negative with a minimal amount of stool .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was admitted on February 5 , 1994 and had a central venous line placed in her right subclavian .\\nThe patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 6 , 1994 where she underwent rigid and flexible bronchoscopy and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy .\\nFindings included necrotic debris in the distal trachea at the carina and right mainstem bronchus .\\nEsophageal mucosa was visible through the trachea .\\nHer steroids were weaned and the patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 10 , 1994 where she underwent once again flexible bronchoscopy and flexible esophagoscopy , as well as rigid bronchoscopy .\\nShe then had a transhiatal esophagectomy which was partial , and a substernal gastric interposition as well as a jejunostomy .\\nThe pathology report suggested that the area was involved with radiation esophagitis and focal ulceration .\\nShe remained ventilator dependent postoperatively and was taken to the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit .\\nThe patient was maintained on triple antibiotics which included Vancomycin , ceftazidime and Gentamicin .\\nOn postoperative day two , she had an electroencephalogram which showed no evidence of seizure activity but

postoperative day two which showed clean anastomosis .\\nShe received multiple bronchoscopies for pulmonary toilet .\\nThe patient was maintained on tube feedings and the ventilator .\\nA repeat echocardiogram on February 18 showed no significant change of her previous echocardiogram on February 11 , which showed only a small pericardial effusion .\\nA pelvic and abdominal computerized tomography scan on February 18 also showed no evidence of a focal collection or abscess .\\nShe remained intermittently febrile despite numerous antibiotics .\\nHer chest X-ray showed bilateral air space disease , consistent with pneumonia or adult respiratory distress syndrome .\\nShe suffered an episode of renal failure which was felt attributable to aminoglycoside toxicity .\\nHer steroids

left chest tube .\\nHer sputum then grew out Klebsiella and she was treated with amikacin and imipenem .\\nShe developed a right pleural effusion and had a right chest tube placed .\\nOn March 13 , 1994 , she regained some level of consciousness .\\nShe was able to fix and follow with her eyes , respond to commands .\\nOn March 14 , 1994 , her right lung was pleurodesed .\\nAttempts were made to facilitate her wean by resting her overnight with a combination of propafol and Fentanyl .\\nThis was tried for approximately seven days with no real progress made toward facilitating her vent wean .\\nShe continued to require pressor support in the high 30 's .\\nShe also fell into a coma once again .\\nOn March 31 , 1994 , her pressor support requirement increased and she continued to have

regard to her previously expressed wishes not to be maintained on artificial life support for extended period of time with little or no hope for recovery .\\nShe had expressed these wishes in writing on several legal forms from the state of Jose Pineston , as well as in discussions with her loved ones .\\nDecision was made in conjunction with the family and Dr. Caslighlourdes to terminate artificial respiratory support .\\nThe patient was removed from the ventilator and placed on a T-piece in her trachea only and was made comfortable with narcotics .\\nHer respirations ceased and she died at 10:15 a.m. on April 2 , 1994 .\\nDISPOSITION / PLAN ON DISCHARGE :\\nThe family will return the body to Sa for burial .\\nThey have declined a post-mortem examination .\\nCA SHUFF ,

catheterization on 12-6-93 .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThis 75 year old woman was previously admitted here in November 1993 for chronic angina .\\nShe had mild mitral regurgitation and a slightly diminished ejection fraction .\\nThere was a 90% right coronary stenosis which was reduced to 30 with a balloon angioplasty .\\nThere were three lesions in the circumflex , dilated successfully .\\nHowever , the low circumflex marginal vessel could not be crossed with the balloon .\\nShe did well in follow up , being treated for hypertension .\\nIn the end of 1992 , she was feeling well and was taken off Isordil .\\nDuring the winter and early parts of 1993 , the patient noticed increasing fatigue , symptoms of breathlessness and recurrent substernal chest pressure which finally led to admission to Xas Tupalmsmodral Hospital on 11-11-93 with documentation of a subendocardial myocardial infarction and a blood pressure of 210/108 .\\nCardiac catheterization towards the end of the hospitalization showed recurrent right coronary artery stenosis proximally and high grade new stenosis in the distal circumflex at the area of the origin of the previously untreated low circumflex marginal vessel .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\nMedications on transfer were Ecotrin , Vasotec 5 mg , Lopressor 25 bid , Isordil 20 tid , Procardia XL once per day , and Lasix 20 q3 days .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nOn physical examination , the blood pressure was 150 , heart rate 70 , bilateral carotid bruits , grade II systolic ejection murmur , good femoral pulses without bruits , good dorsalis pedis pulses with no posterior tibial pulses felt .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nThe electrocardiogram revealed left bundle branch block .\\nThe electrolytes were normal .\\nThe admission hematocrit was 34 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nOn 12-6-93 , angioplasty was performed of the right coronary artery using a 3 mm solo balloon reducing the stenosis from 80 to approximately 20% with a faint diagonal lucency which was not obstructive .\\nThe new distal circumflex lesion was dilated with a 2.0 mm balloon with a good result and minimal persistent stenosis .\\nBut the low circumflex marginal could not be entered with a wire .\\nThe first marginal had a 505 stenosis at its origin , which was not attempted .\\nThe patient did well post procedure .\\nHe developed a grape sized hematoma over the femoral artery with a loud bruit .\\nThe ultrasound on the day of discharge showed no evidence of pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula .\\nThe blood pressure was 150-170 systolic .\\nThe patient was ambulating without symptoms .\\nADDENDUM :\\nThe admission hematocrit was 34 .\\nThis fell to 25 after the cardiac catheterization without evidence of bleeding and rose to 29 by the time of discharge .\\nDOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :\\nShe was discharged with advice by Cardiac Rehabilitation for gradually increasing activity .\\nShe will be followed by her physician at Cean , Dr. Dieseld Pollejesc , for further pressure management and follow up of the femoral hematoma .\\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE :\\nStable , resolving anemia .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nEcotrin 160 mg per day , Vasotec 5 mg per day , Lopressor 25 bid , Isordil 20 tid , Procardia XL 30 per day , Lasix 20 mg q3 days .\\nTELSHEY STUDY , M.D.\\nTR :\\nah / BMot\\nDD :\\n12-9-93\\nTD :\\n12/11/93\\nCC :\\nDr. Telshey Study

was seen by Dr. Overall in the office on Aug 22 , 2003 , for follow-up .\\nShe was scheduled to have a total hi p replacement because of progressively worsening pain in the left hip .\\nHer pain was 8/10 .\\nShe limped .\\nShe did not use a cane .\\nShe did require a bannister going up and down stairs .\\nShe had trouble doing shoes and socks .\\nShe could walk limited distances .\\nSince seen by Dr. Overall in August , she had had a brain aneurysm .\\nShe had a mastectomy and had recently developed Parkinson 's.\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\n1. Breast cancer in the right breast , diagnosed in 1995 with negative nodes , treated with excision , recurrence in June , 2001 , further reconstructive surgery .\\nAt the same time , she underwent reduction of t he left breast .\\n2.

Imodium , 2 mg. q.a.m.\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nExamination reveals that the patient is walking with a mild limp .\\nThe left hip is a bit stiff with flexion to 90 degrees .\\nShe has 10 degrees of internal rotation and external rotation .\\nPulses are fine .\\nIMAGING :\\nX-rays were reviewed .\\nThey showed advanced arthritis of the left hip .\\nRECOMMENDATIONS :\\nDr. Etteme Overall recommended that the patient have a total hip replacement on the left side on February 2 , 2003 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nPlease refer to the operative note by Dr. Etteme Overall for details of the procedure .\\nPostoperatively , the patient was transferred to the floor in stable condition for observation , pain control and mobilization .\\nInitially postoperatively , she was doing quite well , though she did require four liters of oxygen postoperatively to maintain her oxygen saturations .\\nIt was hoped that she would wean off the oxygen over the course of the next few hours .\\nHowever , she did require four liters of oxygen all the way through the night to maintain oxygen saturations of 93% .\\nWithout oxygen , she dropped down to the low 80s .\\nGiven the unusual nature of this oxygen requirement , the patient underwent work-up with a chest X-ray , which essentially was normal .\\nAn ABG revealed a normal PCO2 of 32 , but a decrease in PO2- at 62 .\\nTherefore , given her history of breast cancer , the patient was taken for a spiral CT scan and the Medicine Service was consulted at that time .\\nThey agreed with our plan .\\nOn spiral CT scan , a small pulmonary embolus was seen in the right upper lobe and the left low er lobe .\\nShe was started on heparin at that time to maintain a PTT of 60 t o 80 , and was given doses of Coumadin , in addition to the Coumadin she had been given for DVT prophylaxis .\\nWith the recommendation of the medicine te am , we decided to maintain an INR of 2 to 3 with an overlap of heparin when the patient was therapeutic for two to three days .\\nShe continued to do quite well even though we did keep her on bed rest for three days while she was heparinized .\\nHer oxygen saturations continued to improve to the point that she was on room air on postoperative day four with oxygen saturation of 95% .\\nShe was given perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis for 48 hours after surgery .\\nShe was mobilized on postoperative day four , getting out of bed , able to do quite well on her new hip with a minimal amount of pain .\\nShe was given posterior hip dislocation precautions at that time , which she understood quite well .\\nShe continued to be followed by the medical team and was watched very closely by the orthopedic team until we felt comfortable that she was breathing quite well and was mobilizing well with physical therapy .\\nTherefore , it was decided at that time that the patient was ready for discharge to rehabilitation on Coumadin , which would be monitored for six months to maintain an INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nThe patient will continue all of her pre-admission medications , though no nonsteroidal analgesics , e.g. , aspirin or ibuprofen , will be given while she is on Coumadin therapy .\\n1. Colace , 100 mg. PO t.i.d.\\n2. Percocet , one to two tablets PO q.3 to 4 hours p.r.n. pain .\\n3. Coumadin with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nPlease prescribe 2 mg. tablets .\\nThe patient will be on Coumadin for six months given her history of pulmonary embolus .\\nDISCHARGE PLAN :\\nCoumadin for six months postoperatively with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nCheck INR three times a week until stable .\\nPlease call the results to Dr. Viennee Ester , the patient 's primary-care physician , who has agreed to follow her INR levels for the remainder of the six months .\\nDr. Viennee Ester is located in Tlandcousti Lo Vuclark , where the patient is from originally .\\nThe patient will call Dr. Overall 's office to arrange a follow-up appointment six weeks from the day of surgery .\\nStaples can be removed 10 to 14 days postoperatively .\\nPlease hold removal if the wound is draining .\\nThe patient may shower once the incision is dry , and may bathe and / or swim after the staples have been removed and there is no wound drainage .\\nPartial weight-bearing with crutches or a walker with posterior hip dislocation precautions for three months following surgery .\\nThese precautions have been explained and demonstrated to the patient .\\nThe patient has been instructed to call Dr. Overall 's office or the orthopedist on call with any questions or concerns about increasing pain , swelling , redness , wound drainage , fevers or chills at 094-897-3231 .\\nKEMA ESTER ,\\nMD DICTATING FOR :\\nElectronically Signed ETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D. 02/22/2003 07:01\\n_____________________________ ETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D.\\nTR :\\npe\\nDD :\\n02/08/2003\\nTD :\\n02/08/2003 6:34 P 737058\\ncc :\\nETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D. ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY ALLMID HEALTH CENTER KEMA ESTER , MILD VIENNEE C.

and flexible bronchoscopy and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy .\\nFindings included necrotic debris in the distal trachea at the carina and right mainstem bronchus .\\nEsophageal mucosa was visible through the trachea .\\nHer steroids were weaned and the patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 10 , 1994 where she underwent once again flexible bronchoscopy and flexible esophagoscopy , as well as rigid bronchoscopy .\\nShe then had a transhiatal esophagectomy which was partial , and a substernal gastric interposition as well as a jejunostomy .\\nThe pathology report suggested that the area was involved with radiation esophagitis and focal ulceration .\\nShe remained ventilator dependent postoperatively and was taken to the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit .\\nThe patient was maintained on triple antibiotics which included Vancomycin , ceftazidime and Gentamicin .\\nOn postoperative day two , she had an electroencephalogram which showed no evidence of seizure activity but some generalized slowing .\\nThe patient was seen in consultation by the Neurology Service for her apparent postoperative encephalopathy and episodes of shaking .\\nAn endoscopy was also performed on postoperative day two which showed clean anastomosis .\\nShe received multiple bronchoscopies for pulmonary toilet .\\nThe patient was maintained on tube feedings and the ventilator .\\nA repeat echocardiogram on February 18 showed no significant change of her previous echocardiogram on February 11 , which showed only a small pericardial effusion .\\nA pelvic and abdominal computerized tomography scan on February 18 also showed no evidence of a focal collection or abscess .\\nShe remained intermittently febrile despite numerous antibiotics .\\nHer chest X-ray showed bilateral air space disease , consistent with pneumonia or adult respiratory distress syndrome .\\nShe suffered an episode of renal failure which was felt attributable to aminoglycoside toxicity .\\nHer steroids were weaned .\\nBecause of her prolonged intubation and inability to wean , on February 24 , 1994 , she had a tracheostomy placed .\\nShe remained in a coma .\\nThe blood cultures on February 26 ,

1994 , she regained some level of consciousness .\\nShe was able to fix and follow with her eyes , respond to commands .\\nOn March 14 , 1994 , her right lung was pleurodesed .\\nAttempts were made to facilitate her wean by resting her overnight with a combination of propafol and Fentanyl .\\nThis was tried for approximately seven days with no real progress made toward facilitating her vent wean .\\nShe continued to require pressor support in the high 30 's .\\nShe also fell into a coma once again .\\nOn March 31 , 1994 , her pressor support requirement increased and she continued to have tachypneic episodes .\\nOn April 2 , 1994 , she had several episodes of bradycardia and asystole , which responded only to manual ventilation .\\nDiscussions were held with the patient 's family with regard to her previously expressed wishes not to be maintained on artificial life support for extended period of time with little or no hope for recovery .\\nShe had expressed these wishes in writing

Medical Center for angioplasty .\\nPRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :\\nUnstable angina .\\nASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :\\nHypertension .\\nPRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :\\nRight and circumflex angioplasty , cardiac catheterization on 12-6-93 .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThis 75 year old woman was previously admitted here in November 1993 for chronic angina .\\nShe had mild mitral regurgitation and a slightly diminished ejection fraction .\\nThere was a 90% right coronary stenosis which was reduced to 30 with a balloon angioplasty .\\nThere were three lesions in the circumflex , dilated successfully .\\nHowever , the low circumflex marginal vessel could not be crossed with the balloon .\\nShe did well in follow up , being treated for hypertension .\\nIn the end of 1992 , she was feeling well and was taken off Isordil .\\nDuring the winter and early parts of 1993 , the patient noticed increasing fatigue , symptoms of breathlessness and recurrent substernal chest pressure which finally led to admission to Xas Tupalmsmodral Hospital on 11-11-93 with documentation of a subendocardial myocardial infarction and a blood pressure of 210/108 .\\nCardiac catheterization towards the end of the hospitalization showed recurrent right coronary artery stenosis proximally and high grade new stenosis in the distal circumflex at the area of the origin of the previously untreated low circumflex marginal vessel .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\nMedications on transfer were Ecotrin , Vasotec 5 mg , Lopressor 25 bid , Isordil 20 tid , Procardia XL once per day , and Lasix 20 q3 days .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nOn physical examination , the blood pressure was 150 , heart rate 70 , bilateral carotid bruits , grade II systolic ejection murmur , good femoral pulses without bruits , good dorsalis pedis pulses with no posterior tibial pulses felt .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nThe electrocardiogram revealed left bundle branch block .\\nThe electrolytes were normal .\\nThe admission hematocrit was 34 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nOn 12-6-93 , angioplasty was performed of the right coronary artery using a 3 mm solo balloon reducing the stenosis from 80 to approximately 20% with a faint diagonal lucency which was not obstructive .\\nThe new distal circumflex lesion was dilated with a 2.0 mm balloon with a good result and minimal persistent stenosis .\\nBut the low circumflex marginal could not be entered with a wire .\\nThe first marginal had a 505 stenosis at its origin , which was not attempted .\\nThe patient did well post procedure .\\nHe developed a grape sized hematoma over the femoral artery with a loud bruit .\\nThe ultrasound on the day of discharge showed no evidence of pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula .\\nThe blood pressure was 150-170 systolic .\\nThe patient was ambulating without symptoms .\\nADDENDUM :\\nThe admission hematocrit was 34 .\\nThis fell to 25 after the cardiac catheterization without evidence of bleeding and rose to 29 by the time of discharge .\\nDOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :\\nShe was discharged with advice by Cardiac Rehabilitation for gradually increasing activity .\\nShe will be followed by her physician at Cean , Dr. Dieseld Pollejesc , for further pressure management and follow up of the femoral hematoma .\\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE :\\nStable , resolving anemia .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nEcotrin 160 mg per day , Vasotec 5 mg per day , Lopressor 25 bid , Isordil 20 tid , Procardia XL 30 per day , Lasix 20 mg q3 days .\\nTELSHEY STUDY , M.D.\\nTR :\\nah / BMot\\nDD :\\n12-9-93\\nTD :\\n12/11/93\\nCC :\\nDr. Telshey Study

was seen by Dr. Overall in the office on Aug 22 , 2003 , for follow-up .\\nShe was scheduled to have a total hi p replacement because of progressively worsening pain in the left hip .\\nHer pain was 8/10 .\\nShe limped .\\nShe did not use a cane .\\nShe did require a bannister going up and down stairs .\\nShe had trouble doing shoes and socks .\\nShe could walk limited distances .\\nSince seen by Dr. Overall in August , she had had a brain aneurysm .\\nShe had a mastectomy and had recently developed Parkinson 's.\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\n1. Breast cancer in the right breast , diagnosed in 1995 with negative nodes , treated with excision , recurrence in June , 2001 , further reconstructive surgery .\\nAt the same time , she underwent reduction of t he left breast .\\n2. History of bipolar disorder , for which she sees Dr. Lettefriscbreun .\\nShe indicates this is stable at this time .\\n3. History of chronic anxiety .\\n4. Sleep apnea treated with UPP surgery in 1997 .\\nShe does not use CPAP .\\n5. History of diverticulitis .\\n6. Intermittent migraines .\\n7. History of prior cervical dysplasia , treated with LEEP procedure .\\n8. Osteoporosis .\\n9. Obsessive-compulsive disorder .\\n10. Panic disorder .\\n11. Aneurysm of the right internal auditory canal , treated with coil insertion .\\n12. Prior renal surgery .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\n1. Eskalith , 300 mg. twice at bedtime .\\n2. Femara , 2.5 mg. at bedtime .\\n3. Primidone , 50 mg. PO q.h.s.\\n4. Diazepam , 1 mg. PO q.h.s.\\n5. Paxil , 37.5 mg. q.a.m.\\n6. Synthroid , 100 mcg. q.a.m.\\n7. Ditropan XL , 10 mg.\\n8. Imodium , 2 mg. q.a.m.\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nExamination reveals that the patient is walking with a mild limp .\\nThe left hip is a bit stiff with flexion to 90 degrees .\\nShe has 10 degrees of internal rotation and external rotation .\\nPulses are fine .\\nIMAGING :\\nX-rays were reviewed .\\nThey showed advanced arthritis of the left hip .\\nRECOMMENDATIONS :\\nDr. Etteme Overall recommended that the patient have a total hip replacement on the left side on February 2 , 2003 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nPlease refer to the operative note by Dr. Etteme Overall for details of the procedure .\\nPostoperatively , the patient was transferred to the floor in stable condition for observation , pain control and mobilization .\\nInitially postoperatively , she was doing quite well , though she did require four liters of oxygen postoperatively to maintain her oxygen saturations .\\nIt was hoped that she would wean off the oxygen over the course of the next few hours .\\nHowever , she did require four liters of oxygen all the way through the night to maintain oxygen saturations of 93% .\\nWithout oxygen , she dropped down to the low 80s .\\nGiven the unusual nature of this oxygen requirement , the patient underwent work-up with a chest X-ray , which essentially was normal .\\nAn ABG revealed a normal PCO2 of 32 , but a decrease in PO2- at 62 .\\nTherefore , given her history of breast cancer , the patient was taken for a spiral CT scan and the Medicine Service was consulted at that time .\\nThey agreed with our plan .\\nOn spiral CT scan , a small pulmonary embolus was seen in the right upper lobe and the left low er lobe .\\nShe was started on heparin at that time to maintain a PTT of 60 t o 80 , and was given doses of Coumadin , in addition to the Coumadin she had been given for DVT prophylaxis .\\nWith the recommendation of the medicine te am , we decided to maintain an INR of 2 to 3 with an overlap of heparin when the patient was therapeutic for two to three days .\\nShe continued to do quite well even though we did keep her on bed rest for three days while she was heparinized .\\nHer oxygen saturations continued to improve to the point that she was on room air on postoperative day four with oxygen saturation of 95% .\\nShe was given perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis for 48 hours after surgery .\\nShe was mobilized on postoperative day four , getting out of bed , able to do quite well on her new hip with a minimal amount of pain .\\nShe was given posterior hip dislocation precautions at that time , which she understood quite well .\\nShe continued to be followed by the medical team and was watched very closely by the orthopedic team until we felt comfortable that she was breathing quite well and was mobilizing well with physical therapy .\\nTherefore , it was decided at that time that the patient was ready for discharge to rehabilitation on Coumadin , which would be monitored for six months to maintain an INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nThe patient will continue all of her pre-admission medications , though no nonsteroidal analgesics , e.g. , aspirin or ibuprofen , will be given while she is on Coumadin therapy .\\n1. Colace , 100 mg. PO t.i.d.\\n2. Percocet , one to two tablets PO q.3 to 4 hours p.r.n. pain .\\n3. Coumadin with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nPlease prescribe 2 mg. tablets .\\nThe patient will be on Coumadin for six months given her history of pulmonary embolus .\\nDISCHARGE PLAN :\\nCoumadin for six months postoperatively with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nCheck INR three times a week until stable .\\nPlease call the results to Dr. Viennee Ester , the patient 's primary-care physician , who has agreed to follow her INR levels for the remainder of the six months .\\nDr. Viennee Ester is located in Tlandcousti Lo Vuclark , where the patient is from originally .\\nThe patient will call Dr. Overall 's office to arrange a follow-up appointment six weeks from the day of surgery .\\nStaples can be removed 10 to 14 days postoperatively .\\nPlease hold removal if the wound is draining .\\nThe patient may shower once the incision is dry , and may bathe and / or swim after the staples have been removed and there is no wound drainage .\\nPartial weight-bearing with crutches or a walker with posterior hip dislocation precautions for three months following surgery .\\nThese precautions have been explained and demonstrated to the patient .\\nThe patient has been instructed to call Dr. Overall 's office or the orthopedist on call with any questions or concerns about increasing pain , swelling , redness , wound drainage , fevers or chills at 094-897-3231 .\\nKEMA ESTER ,\\nMD DICTATING FOR :\\nElectronically Signed ETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D. 02/22/2003 07:01\\n_____________________________ ETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D.\\nTR :\\npe\\nDD :\\n02/08/2003\\nTD :\\n02/08/2003 6:34 P 737058\\ncc :\\nETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D. ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY ALLMID HEALTH CENTER KEMA ESTER , MILD VIENNEE C.

initially diagnosed in 1978 with atypical small cell carcinoma of the lung and treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy until 1980 .\\nShe did well for approximately twelve years until she was diagnosed with carcinoid cancer of the same right upper lobe .\\nThis may have been the initial primary cancer although it is unclear at present .\\nBronchoscopy at that time showed an endobronchial tumor of the right upper lobe bronchus and it was felt to be unresectable .\\nShe underwent four treatments of brachytherapy in March through May of 1993 .\\nShe had been doing reasonably well until December of 1993 when she presented with persistent and worsening cough and near strangulation on attempts at eating solids or drinking liquids .\\nA bronchoscopy showed a tracheoesophageal fistula with an opening into the trachea above the carina and no tumor in the right upper lobe .\\nShe has been on total parenteral nutrition and has been nothing by mouth since then .\\nA barium swallow

patient was admitted on February 5 , 1994 and had a central venous line placed in her right subclavian .\\nThe patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 6 , 1994 where she underwent rigid and flexible bronchoscopy and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy .\\nFindings included necrotic debris in the distal trachea at the carina and right mainstem bronchus .\\nEsophageal mucosa was visible through the trachea .\\nHer steroids were weaned and the patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 10 , 1994 where she underwent once again flexible bronchoscopy and flexible esophagoscopy , as well as rigid bronchoscopy .\\nShe then had a transhiatal esophagectomy which was partial , and a substernal gastric interposition as well as a jejunostomy .\\nThe pathology report suggested that

catheterization on 12-6-93 .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThis 75 year old woman was previously admitted here in November 1993 for chronic angina .\\nShe had mild mitral regurgitation and a slightly diminished ejection fraction .\\nThere was a 90% right coronary stenosis which was reduced to 30 with a balloon angioplasty .\\nThere were three lesions in the circumflex , dilated successfully .\\nHowever , the low circumflex marginal vessel could not be crossed with the balloon .\\nShe did well in follow up , being treated for hypertension .\\nIn the end of 1992 , she was feeling well and was taken off Isordil .\\nDuring the winter and early parts of 1993 , the patient noticed increasing fatigue , symptoms of breathlessness and recurrent substernal chest pressure which finally led to admission to Xas Tupalmsmodral Hospital on 11-11-93 with documentation of a subendocardial myocardial infarction and a blood pressure of 210/108 .\\nCardiac catheterization towards the end of the hospitalization showed recurrent right coronary artery stenosis proximally and high grade new stenosis in the distal circumflex at the area of the origin of the previously untreated low circumflex marginal vessel .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\nMedications on transfer were Ecotrin , Vasotec 5 mg , Lopressor 25 bid , Isordil 20 tid , Procardia XL once per day , and Lasix 20 q3 days .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nOn physical examination , the blood pressure was 150 , heart rate 70 , bilateral carotid bruits , grade II systolic ejection murmur , good femoral pulses without bruits , good dorsalis pedis pulses with no posterior tibial pulses felt .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nThe electrocardiogram revealed left bundle branch block .\\nThe electrolytes were normal .\\nThe admission hematocrit was 34 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nOn 12-6-93 , angioplasty was performed of the right coronary artery using a 3 mm solo balloon reducing the stenosis from 80 to approximately 20% with a faint diagonal lucency which was not obstructive .\\nThe new distal circumflex lesion was dilated with a 2.0 mm balloon with a good result and minimal persistent stenosis .\\nBut the low circumflex marginal could not be entered with a wire .\\nThe first marginal had a 505 stenosis at its origin , which was not attempted .\\nThe patient did well post procedure .\\nHe developed a grape sized hematoma over the femoral artery with a loud bruit .\\nThe ultrasound on the day of discharge showed no evidence of pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula .\\nThe blood pressure was 150-170 systolic .\\nThe patient was ambulating without symptoms .\\nADDENDUM :\\nThe admission hematocrit was 34 .\\nThis fell to 25 after the cardiac catheterization without evidence of bleeding and rose to 29 by the time of discharge .\\nDOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :\\nShe was discharged with advice by Cardiac Rehabilitation for gradually increasing activity .\\nShe will be followed by her physician at Cean , Dr. Dieseld Pollejesc , for further pressure management and follow up of the femoral hematoma .\\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE :\\nStable , resolving anemia .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nEcotrin 160 mg per day , Vasotec 5 mg per day , Lopressor 25 bid , Isordil 20 tid , Procardia XL 30 per day , Lasix 20 mg q3 days .\\nTELSHEY STUDY , M.D.\\nTR :\\nah / BMot\\nDD :\\n12-9-93\\nTD :\\n12/11/93\\nCC :\\nDr. Telshey Study

was seen by Dr. Overall in the office on Aug 22 , 2003 , for follow-up .\\nShe was scheduled to have a total hi p replacement because of progressively worsening pain in the left hip .\\nHer pain was 8/10 .\\nShe limped .\\nShe did not use a cane .\\nShe did require a bannister going up and down stairs .\\nShe had trouble doing shoes and socks .\\nShe could walk limited distances .\\nSince seen by Dr. Overall in August , she had had a brain aneurysm .\\nShe had a mastectomy and had recently developed Parkinson 's.\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\n1. Breast cancer in the right breast , diagnosed in 1995 with negative nodes , treated with excision , recurrence in June , 2001 , further reconstructive surgery .\\nAt the same time , she underwent reduction of t he left breast .\\n2. History of bipolar disorder , for which she sees Dr. Lettefriscbreun .\\nShe indicates this is stable at this time .\\n3. History of chronic anxiety .\\n4.

Imodium , 2 mg. q.a.m.\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nExamination reveals that the patient is walking with a mild limp .\\nThe left hip is a bit stiff with flexion to 90 degrees .\\nShe has 10 degrees of internal rotation and external rotation .\\nPulses are fine .\\nIMAGING :\\nX-rays were reviewed .\\nThey showed advanced arthritis of the left hip .\\nRECOMMENDATIONS :\\nDr. Etteme Overall recommended that the patient have a total hip replacement on the left side on February 2 , 2003 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nPlease refer to the operative note by Dr. Etteme Overall for details of the procedure .\\nPostoperatively , the patient was transferred to the floor in stable condition for observation , pain control and mobilization .\\nInitially postoperatively , she was doing quite well , though she did require four liters of oxygen postoperatively to maintain her oxygen saturations .\\nIt was hoped that she would wean off the oxygen over the course of the next few hours .\\nHowever , she did require four liters of oxygen all the way through the night to maintain oxygen saturations of 93% .\\nWithout oxygen , she dropped down to the low 80s .\\nGiven the unusual nature of this oxygen requirement , the patient underwent work-up with a chest X-ray , which essentially was normal .\\nAn ABG revealed a normal PCO2 of 32 , but a decrease in PO2- at 62 .\\nTherefore , given her history of breast cancer , the patient was taken for a spiral CT scan and the Medicine Service was consulted at that time .\\nThey agreed with our plan .\\nOn spiral CT scan , a small pulmonary embolus was seen in the right upper lobe and the left low er lobe .\\nShe was started on heparin at that time to maintain a PTT of 60 t o 80 , and was given doses of Coumadin , in addition to the Coumadin she had been given for DVT prophylaxis .\\nWith the recommendation of the medicine te am , we decided to maintain an INR of 2 to 3 with an overlap of heparin when the patient was therapeutic for two to three days .\\nShe continued to do quite well even though we did keep her on bed rest for three days while she was heparinized .\\nHer oxygen saturations continued to improve to the point that she was on room air on postoperative day four with oxygen saturation of 95% .\\nShe was given perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis for 48 hours after surgery .\\nShe was mobilized on postoperative day four , getting out of bed , able to do quite well on her new hip with a minimal amount of pain .\\nShe was given posterior hip dislocation precautions at that time , which she understood quite well .\\nShe continued to be followed by the medical team and was watched very closely by the orthopedic team until we felt comfortable that she was breathing quite well and was mobilizing well with physical therapy .\\nTherefore , it was decided at that time that the patient was ready for discharge to rehabilitation on Coumadin , which would be monitored for six months to maintain an INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nThe patient will continue all of her pre-admission medications , though no nonsteroidal analgesics , e.g. , aspirin or ibuprofen , will be given while she is on Coumadin therapy .\\n1. Colace , 100 mg. PO t.i.d.\\n2. Percocet , one to two tablets PO q.3 to 4 hours p.r.n. pain .\\n3. Coumadin with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nPlease prescribe 2 mg. tablets .\\nThe patient will be on Coumadin for six months given her history of pulmonary embolus .\\nDISCHARGE PLAN :\\nCoumadin for six months postoperatively with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nCheck INR three times a week until stable .\\nPlease call the results to Dr. Viennee Ester , the patient 's primary-care physician , who has agreed to follow her INR levels for the remainder of the six months .\\nDr. Viennee Ester is located in Tlandcousti Lo Vuclark , where the patient is from originally .\\nThe patient will call Dr. Overall 's office to arrange a follow-up appointment six weeks from the day of surgery .\\nStaples can be removed 10 to 14 days postoperatively .\\nPlease hold removal if the wound is draining .\\nThe patient may shower once the incision is dry , and may bathe and / or swim after the staples have been removed and there is no wound drainage .\\nPartial weight-bearing with crutches or a walker with posterior hip dislocation precautions for three months following surgery .\\nThese precautions have been explained and demonstrated to the patient .\\nThe patient has been instructed to call Dr. Overall 's office or the orthopedist on call with any questions or concerns about increasing pain , swelling , redness , wound drainage , fevers or chills at 094-897-3231 .\\nKEMA ESTER ,\\nMD DICTATING FOR :\\nElectronically Signed ETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D. 02/22/2003 07:01\\n_____________________________ ETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D.\\nTR :\\npe\\nDD :\\n02/08/2003\\nTD :\\n02/08/2003 6:34 P 737058\\ncc :\\nETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D. ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY ALLMID HEALTH CENTER KEMA ESTER , MILD VIENNEE C.

through the trachea .\\nHer steroids were weaned and the patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 10 , 1994 where she underwent once again flexible bronchoscopy and flexible esophagoscopy , as well as rigid bronchoscopy .\\nShe then had a transhiatal esophagectomy which was partial , and a substernal gastric interposition as well as a jejunostomy .\\nThe pathology report suggested that the area was involved with radiation esophagitis and focal ulceration .\\nShe remained ventilator dependent postoperatively and was taken to the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit .\\nThe patient was maintained on triple antibiotics which included Vancomycin , ceftazidime and Gentamicin .\\nOn postoperative day two , she had an electroencephalogram which showed no evidence of seizure activity but some generalized slowing .\\nThe patient was seen in consultation by the Neurology Service for her apparent postoperative encephalopathy and episodes of shaking .\\nAn endoscopy was also performed on postoperative day two which showed clean anastomosis .\\nShe received multiple bronchoscopies for pulmonary toilet .\\nThe patient was maintained on tube feedings and the ventilator .\\nA repeat echocardiogram on February 18 showed no significant change of her previous echocardiogram on February 11 , which showed only a small pericardial effusion .\\nA pelvic and abdominal computerized tomography scan on February 18 also showed no evidence of a focal collection or abscess .\\nShe remained intermittently febrile despite numerous antibiotics .\\nHer chest X-ray showed bilateral air space disease , consistent with pneumonia or adult respiratory distress syndrome .\\nShe suffered an episode of renal failure which was felt attributable to aminoglycoside toxicity .\\nHer steroids were weaned .\\nBecause of her prolonged intubation and inability to wean , on February 24 , 1994 , she had a tracheostomy placed .\\nShe remained in a coma .\\nThe blood cultures on February 26 , 1994 grew out Staphylococcus and she was treated for septicemia .\\nHer sputum grew out Pseudomonas aeruginosa as well .\\nThe urine contained yeast and she was treated with amphotericin .\\nOn March 3 , 1994 , a repeat chest and abdominal and pelvis computerized tomography scan showed no evidence of fluid collections .\\nThere was a large left pleural effusion however .\\nThis was drained with a left chest tube .\\nHer sputum then grew out Klebsiella and she was treated with amikacin and imipenem .\\nShe developed a right pleural effusion and had a right chest tube placed .\\nOn March 13 , 1994 , she regained some level of consciousness .\\nShe was able to fix and follow with her eyes , respond to commands .\\nOn March 14 , 1994 , her right lung was pleurodesed .\\nAttempts were made to facilitate her wean by resting her overnight with a combination of propafol and Fentanyl .\\nThis was tried for approximately seven days with no real progress made toward facilitating her vent wean .\\nShe continued to require pressor support in the high 30 's .\\nShe also fell into a coma once again .\\nOn March 31 , 1994 , her pressor support requirement increased and she continued to have tachypneic episodes .\\nOn April 2 , 1994 , she had several episodes of bradycardia and asystole , which responded only to manual ventilation .\\nDiscussions were held with the patient 's family with regard to her previously expressed wishes not to be maintained on artificial life support for extended period of time with little or no hope for recovery .\\nShe had expressed these wishes in writing on several legal forms from the state of Jose Pineston , as well as in discussions with her loved ones .\\nDecision was made in conjunction with the family and Dr. Caslighlourdes to terminate artificial respiratory support .\\nThe patient was removed from the ventilator and placed on a T-piece in her trachea only and was made comfortable with narcotics .\\nHer respirations ceased and she died at 10:15 a.m. on April 2 , 1994 .\\nDISPOSITION / PLAN ON DISCHARGE :\\nThe family will return the body to Sa for burial .\\nThey have declined a post-mortem examination .\\nCA SHUFF ,

Medical Center for angioplasty .\\nPRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :\\nUnstable angina .\\nASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :\\nHypertension .\\nPRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :\\nRight and circumflex angioplasty , cardiac catheterization on 12-6-93 .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThis 75 year old woman was previously admitted here in November 1993 for chronic angina .\\nShe had mild mitral regurgitation and a slightly diminished ejection fraction .\\nThere was a 90% right coronary stenosis which was reduced to 30 with a balloon angioplasty .\\nThere were three lesions in the circumflex , dilated successfully .\\nHowever , the low circumflex marginal vessel could not be crossed with the balloon .\\nShe did well in follow up , being treated for hypertension .\\nIn the end of 1992 , she was feeling well and was taken off Isordil .\\nDuring the winter and early parts of 1993 , the patient noticed increasing fatigue , symptoms of breathlessness and recurrent substernal chest pressure which finally led to admission to Xas Tupalmsmodral Hospital on 11-11-93 with documentation of a subendocardial myocardial infarction and a blood pressure of 210/108 .\\nCardiac catheterization towards the end of the hospitalization showed recurrent right coronary artery stenosis proximally and high grade new stenosis in the distal circumflex at the area of the origin of the previously untreated low circumflex marginal vessel .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\nMedications on transfer were Ecotrin , Vasotec 5 mg , Lopressor 25 bid , Isordil 20 tid , Procardia XL once per day , and Lasix 20 q3 days .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nOn physical examination , the blood pressure was 150 , heart rate 70 , bilateral carotid bruits , grade II systolic ejection murmur , good femoral pulses without bruits , good dorsalis pedis pulses with no posterior tibial pulses felt .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nThe electrocardiogram revealed left bundle branch block .\\nThe electrolytes were normal .\\nThe admission hematocrit was 34 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nOn 12-6-93 , angioplasty was performed of the right coronary artery using a 3 mm solo balloon reducing the stenosis from 80 to approximately 20% with a faint diagonal lucency which was not obstructive .\\nThe new distal circumflex lesion was dilated with a 2.0 mm balloon with a good result and minimal persistent stenosis .\\nBut the low circumflex marginal could not be entered with a wire .\\nThe first marginal had a 505 stenosis at its origin , which was not attempted .\\nThe patient did well post procedure .\\nHe developed a grape sized hematoma over the femoral artery with a loud bruit .\\nThe ultrasound on the day of discharge showed no evidence of pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula .\\nThe blood pressure was 150-170 systolic .\\nThe patient was ambulating without symptoms .\\nADDENDUM :\\nThe admission hematocrit was 34 .\\nThis fell to 25 after the cardiac catheterization without evidence of bleeding and rose to 29 by the time of discharge .\\nDOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :\\nShe was discharged with advice by Cardiac Rehabilitation for gradually increasing activity .\\nShe will be followed by her physician at Cean , Dr. Dieseld Pollejesc , for further pressure management and follow up of the femoral hematoma .\\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE :\\nStable , resolving anemia .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nEcotrin 160 mg per day , Vasotec 5 mg per day , Lopressor 25 bid , Isordil 20 tid , Procardia XL 30 per day , Lasix 20 mg q3 days .\\nTELSHEY STUDY , M.D.\\nTR :\\nah / BMot\\nDD :\\n12-9-93\\nTD :\\n12/11/93\\nCC :\\nDr. Telshey Study

was seen by Dr. Overall in the office on Aug 22 , 2003 , for follow-up .\\nShe was scheduled to have a total hi p replacement because of progressively worsening pain in the left hip .\\nHer pain was 8/10 .\\nShe limped .\\nShe did not use a cane .\\nShe did require a bannister going up and down stairs .\\nShe had trouble doing shoes and socks .\\nShe could walk limited distances .\\nSince seen by Dr. Overall in August , she had had a brain aneurysm .\\nShe had a mastectomy and had recently developed Parkinson 's.\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\n1. Breast cancer in the right breast , diagnosed in 1995 with negative nodes , treated with excision , recurrence in June , 2001 , further reconstructive surgery .\\nAt the same time , she underwent reduction of t he left breast .\\n2. History of bipolar disorder , for which she sees Dr. Lettefriscbreun .\\nShe indicates this is stable at this time .\\n3. History of chronic anxiety .\\n4. Sleep apnea treated with UPP surgery in 1997 .\\nShe does not use CPAP .\\n5. History of diverticulitis .\\n6. Intermittent migraines .\\n7. History of prior cervical dysplasia , treated with LEEP procedure .\\n8. Osteoporosis .\\n9. Obsessive-compulsive disorder .\\n10. Panic disorder .\\n11. Aneurysm of the right internal auditory canal , treated with coil insertion .\\n12. Prior renal surgery .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\n1. Eskalith , 300 mg. twice at bedtime .\\n2. Femara , 2.5 mg. at bedtime .\\n3. Primidone , 50 mg. PO q.h.s.\\n4. Diazepam , 1 mg. PO q.h.s.\\n5. Paxil , 37.5 mg. q.a.m.\\n6. Synthroid , 100 mcg. q.a.m.\\n7. Ditropan XL , 10 mg.\\n8. Imodium , 2 mg. q.a.m.\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nExamination reveals that the patient is walking with a mild limp .\\nThe left hip is a bit stiff with flexion to 90 degrees .\\nShe has 10 degrees of internal rotation and external rotation .\\nPulses are fine .\\nIMAGING :\\nX-rays were reviewed .\\nThey showed advanced arthritis of the left hip .\\nRECOMMENDATIONS :\\nDr. Etteme Overall recommended that the patient have a total hip replacement on the left side on February 2 , 2003 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nPlease refer to the operative note by Dr. Etteme Overall for details of the procedure .\\nPostoperatively , the patient was transferred to the floor in stable condition for observation , pain control and mobilization .\\nInitially postoperatively , she was doing quite well , though she did require four liters of oxygen postoperatively to maintain her oxygen saturations .\\nIt was hoped that she would wean off the oxygen over the course of the next few hours .\\nHowever , she did require four liters of oxygen all the way through the night to maintain oxygen saturations of 93% .\\nWithout oxygen , she dropped down to the low 80s .\\nGiven the unusual nature of this oxygen requirement , the patient underwent work-up with a chest X-ray , which essentially was normal .\\nAn ABG revealed a normal PCO2 of 32 , but a decrease in PO2- at 62 .\\nTherefore , given her history of breast cancer , the patient was taken for a spiral CT scan and the Medicine Service was consulted at that time .\\nThey agreed with our plan .\\nOn spiral CT scan , a small pulmonary embolus was seen in the right upper lobe and the left low er lobe .\\nShe was started on heparin at that time to maintain a PTT of 60 t o 80 , and was given doses of Coumadin , in addition to the Coumadin she had been given for DVT prophylaxis .\\nWith the recommendation of the medicine te am , we decided to maintain an INR of 2 to 3 with an overlap of heparin when the patient was therapeutic for two to three days .\\nShe continued to do quite well even though we did keep her on bed rest for three days while she was heparinized .\\nHer oxygen saturations continued to improve to the point that she was on room air on postoperative day four with oxygen saturation of 95% .\\nShe was given perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis for 48 hours after surgery .\\nShe was mobilized on postoperative day four , getting out of bed , able to do quite well on her new hip with a minimal amount of pain .\\nShe was given posterior hip dislocation precautions at that time , which she understood quite well .\\nShe continued to be followed by the medical team and was watched very closely by the orthopedic team until we felt comfortable that she was breathing quite well and was mobilizing well with physical therapy .\\nTherefore , it was decided at that time that the patient was ready for discharge to rehabilitation on Coumadin , which would be monitored for six months to maintain an INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nThe patient will continue all of her pre-admission medications , though no nonsteroidal analgesics , e.g. , aspirin or ibuprofen , will be given while she is on Coumadin therapy .\\n1. Colace , 100 mg. PO t.i.d.\\n2. Percocet , one to two tablets PO q.3 to 4 hours p.r.n. pain .\\n3. Coumadin with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nPlease prescribe 2 mg. tablets .\\nThe patient will be on Coumadin for six months given her history of pulmonary embolus .\\nDISCHARGE PLAN :\\nCoumadin for six months postoperatively with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nCheck INR three times a week until stable .\\nPlease call the results to Dr. Viennee Ester , the patient 's primary-care physician , who has agreed to follow her INR levels for the remainder of the six months .\\nDr. Viennee Ester is located in Tlandcousti Lo Vuclark , where the patient is from originally .\\nThe patient will call Dr. Overall 's office to arrange a follow-up appointment six weeks from the day of surgery .\\nStaples can be removed 10 to 14 days postoperatively .\\nPlease hold removal if the wound is draining .\\nThe patient may shower once the incision is dry , and may bathe and / or swim after the staples have been removed and there is no wound drainage .\\nPartial weight-bearing with crutches or a walker with posterior hip dislocation precautions for three months following surgery .\\nThese precautions have been explained and demonstrated to the patient .\\nThe patient has been instructed to call Dr. Overall 's office or the orthopedist on call with any questions or concerns about increasing pain , swelling , redness , wound drainage , fevers or chills at 094-897-3231 .\\nKEMA ESTER ,\\nMD DICTATING FOR :\\nElectronically Signed ETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D. 02/22/2003 07:01\\n_____________________________ ETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D.\\nTR :\\npe\\nDD :\\n02/08/2003\\nTD :\\n02/08/2003 6:34 P 737058\\ncc :\\nETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D. ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY ALLMID HEALTH CENTER KEMA ESTER , MILD VIENNEE C.

initially diagnosed in 1978 with atypical small cell carcinoma of the lung and treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy until 1980 .\\nShe did well for approximately twelve years until she was diagnosed with carcinoid cancer of the same right upper lobe .\\nThis may have been the initial primary cancer although it is unclear at present .\\nBronchoscopy at that time showed an endobronchial tumor of the right upper lobe bronchus and it was felt to be unresectable .\\nShe underwent four treatments of brachytherapy in March through May of 1993 .\\nShe had been doing reasonably well until December of 1993 when she presented with persistent and worsening cough and near strangulation on attempts at eating solids or drinking liquids .\\nA bronchoscopy showed a tracheoesophageal fistula with an opening into the trachea above the carina and no tumor in the right upper lobe .\\nShe has been on total parenteral nutrition and has been nothing by mouth since then .\\nA barium swallow

patient was admitted on February 5 , 1994 and had a central venous line placed in her right subclavian .\\nThe patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 6 , 1994 where she underwent rigid and flexible bronchoscopy and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy .\\nFindings included necrotic debris in the distal trachea at the carina and right mainstem bronchus .\\nEsophageal mucosa was visible through the trachea .\\nHer steroids were weaned and the patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 10 , 1994 where she underwent once again flexible bronchoscopy and flexible esophagoscopy , as well as rigid bronchoscopy .\\nShe then had a transhiatal esophagectomy which was partial , and a substernal gastric interposition as well as a jejunostomy .\\nThe pathology report suggested that

Medical Center for angioplasty .\\nPRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :\\nUnstable angina .\\nASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :\\nHypertension .\\nPRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :\\nRight and circumflex angioplasty , cardiac catheterization on 12-6-93 .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThis 75 year old woman was previously admitted here in November 1993 for chronic angina .\\nShe had mild mitral regurgitation and a slightly diminished ejection fraction .\\nThere was a 90% right coronary stenosis which was reduced to 30 with a balloon angioplasty .\\nThere were three lesions in the circumflex , dilated successfully .\\nHowever , the low circumflex marginal vessel could not be crossed with the balloon .\\nShe did well in follow up , being treated for hypertension .\\nIn the end of 1992 , she was feeling well and was taken off Isordil .\\nDuring the winter and early parts of 1993 , the patient noticed increasing fatigue , symptoms of breathlessness and recurrent substernal chest pressure which finally led to admission to Xas Tupalmsmodral Hospital on 11-11-93 with documentation of a subendocardial myocardial infarction and a blood pressure of 210/108 .\\nCardiac catheterization towards the end of the hospitalization showed recurrent right coronary artery stenosis proximally and high grade new stenosis in the distal circumflex at the area of the origin of the previously untreated low circumflex marginal vessel .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\nMedications on transfer were Ecotrin , Vasotec 5 mg , Lopressor 25 bid , Isordil 20 tid , Procardia XL once per day , and Lasix 20 q3 days .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nOn physical examination , the blood pressure was 150 , heart rate 70 , bilateral carotid bruits , grade II systolic ejection murmur , good femoral pulses without bruits , good dorsalis pedis pulses with no posterior tibial pulses felt .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nThe electrocardiogram revealed left bundle branch block .\\nThe electrolytes were normal .\\nThe admission hematocrit was 34 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nOn 12-6-93 , angioplasty was performed of the right coronary artery using a 3 mm solo balloon reducing the stenosis from 80 to approximately 20% with a faint diagonal lucency which was not obstructive .\\nThe new distal circumflex lesion was dilated with a 2.0 mm balloon with a good result and minimal persistent stenosis .\\nBut the low circumflex marginal could not be entered with a wire .\\nThe first marginal had a 505 stenosis at its origin , which was not attempted .\\nThe patient did well post procedure .\\nHe developed a grape sized hematoma over the femoral artery with a loud bruit .\\nThe ultrasound on the day of discharge showed no evidence of pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula .\\nThe blood pressure was 150-170 systolic .\\nThe patient was ambulating without symptoms .\\nADDENDUM :\\nThe admission hematocrit was 34 .\\nThis fell to 25 after the cardiac catheterization without evidence of bleeding and rose to 29 by the time of discharge .\\nDOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :\\nShe was discharged with advice by Cardiac Rehabilitation for gradually increasing activity .\\nShe will be followed by her physician at Cean , Dr. Dieseld Pollejesc , for further pressure management and follow up of the femoral hematoma .\\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE :\\nStable , resolving anemia .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nEcotrin 160 mg per day , Vasotec 5 mg per day , Lopressor 25 bid , Isordil 20 tid , Procardia XL 30 per day , Lasix 20 mg q3 days .\\nTELSHEY STUDY , M.D.\\nTR :\\nah / BMot\\nDD :\\n12-9-93\\nTD :\\n12/11/93\\nCC :\\nDr. Telshey Study

Colace , 100 mg. PO t.i.d.\\n2. Percocet , one to two tablets PO q.3 to 4 hours p.r.n. pain .\\n3. Coumadin with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nPlease prescribe 2 mg. tablets .\\nThe patient will be on Coumadin for six months given her history of pulmonary embolus .\\nDISCHARGE PLAN :\\nCoumadin for six months postoperatively with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nCheck INR three times a week until stable .\\nPlease call the results to Dr. Viennee Ester , the patient 's primary-care physician , who has agreed to follow her INR levels for the remainder of the six months .\\nDr. Viennee Ester is located in Tlandcousti Lo Vuclark , where the patient is from originally .\\nThe patient will call Dr. Overall 's office to arrange a follow-up appointment six weeks from the day of surgery .\\nStaples can be removed 10 to 14 days postoperatively .\\nPlease hold removal if the wound is draining .\\nThe patient may shower once the incision is dry , and may bathe and / or swim after the staples have been removed and there is no wound drainage .\\nPartial weight-bearing with crutches or a walker with posterior hip dislocation precautions for three months following surgery .\\nThese precautions have been explained and demonstrated to the patient .\\nThe patient has been instructed to call Dr. Overall 's office or the orthopedist on call with any questions or concerns about increasing pain , swelling , redness , wound drainage , fevers or chills at 094-897-3231 .\\nKEMA ESTER ,\\nMD DICTATING FOR :\\nElectronically Signed ETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D. 02/22/2003 07:01\\n_____________________________ ETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D.\\nTR :\\npe\\nDD :\\n02/08/2003\\nTD :\\n02/08/2003 6:34 P 737058\\ncc :\\nETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D. ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY ALLMID HEALTH CENTER KEMA ESTER , MILD VIENNEE C.

initially diagnosed in 1978 with atypical small cell carcinoma of the lung and treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy until 1980 .\\nShe did well for approximately twelve years until she was diagnosed with carcinoid cancer of the same right upper lobe .\\nThis may have been the initial primary cancer although it is unclear at present .\\nBronchoscopy at that time showed an endobronchial tumor of the right upper lobe bronchus and it was felt to be unresectable .\\nShe underwent four treatments of brachytherapy in March through May of 1993 .\\nShe had been doing reasonably well until December of 1993 when she presented with persistent and worsening cough and near strangulation on attempts at eating solids or drinking liquids .\\nA bronchoscopy showed a tracheoesophageal fistula with an opening into the trachea above the carina and no tumor in the right upper lobe .\\nShe has been on total parenteral nutrition and has been nothing by mouth since then .\\nA barium swallow

abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended .\\nExtremities :\\nno clubbing , cyanosis or edema .\\nThe rectal examination is guaiac negative with a minimal amount of stool .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThe patient was admitted on February 5 , 1994 and had a central venous line placed in her right subclavian .\\nThe patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 6 , 1994 where she underwent rigid and flexible bronchoscopy and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy .\\nFindings included necrotic debris in the distal trachea at the carina and right mainstem bronchus .\\nEsophageal mucosa was visible through the trachea .\\nHer steroids were weaned and the patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 10 , 1994 where she underwent once again flexible bronchoscopy and flexible esophagoscopy , as well as rigid bronchoscopy .\\nShe then had a transhiatal esophagectomy which was partial , and a substernal gastric interposition as well as a jejunostomy .\\nThe pathology report suggested that the area was involved with radiation esophagitis and focal ulceration .\\nShe remained ventilator dependent postoperatively and was taken to the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit .\\nThe patient was maintained on triple antibiotics which included Vancomycin , ceftazidime and Gentamicin .\\nOn postoperative day two , she had an electroencephalogram which showed no evidence of seizure activity but

postoperative day two which showed clean anastomosis .\\nShe received multiple bronchoscopies for pulmonary toilet .\\nThe patient was maintained on tube feedings and the ventilator .\\nA repeat echocardiogram on February 18 showed no significant change of her previous echocardiogram on February 11 , which showed only a small pericardial effusion .\\nA pelvic and abdominal computerized tomography scan on February 18 also showed no evidence of a focal collection or abscess .\\nShe remained intermittently febrile despite numerous antibiotics .\\nHer chest X-ray showed bilateral air space disease , consistent with pneumonia or adult respiratory distress syndrome .\\nShe suffered an episode of renal failure which was felt attributable to aminoglycoside toxicity .\\nHer steroids

left chest tube .\\nHer sputum then grew out Klebsiella and she was treated with amikacin and imipenem .\\nShe developed a right pleural effusion and had a right chest tube placed .\\nOn March 13 , 1994 , she regained some level of consciousness .\\nShe was able to fix and follow with her eyes , respond to commands .\\nOn March 14 , 1994 , her right lung was pleurodesed .\\nAttempts were made to facilitate her wean by resting her overnight with a combination of propafol and Fentanyl .\\nThis was tried for approximately seven days with no real progress made toward facilitating her vent wean .\\nShe continued to require pressor support in the high 30 's .\\nShe also fell into a coma once again .\\nOn March 31 , 1994 , her pressor support requirement increased and she continued to have

catheterization on 12-6-93 .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThis 75 year old woman was previously admitted here in November 1993 for chronic angina .\\nShe had mild mitral regurgitation and a slightly diminished ejection fraction .\\nThere was a 90% right coronary stenosis which was reduced to 30 with a balloon angioplasty .\\nThere were three lesions in the circumflex , dilated successfully .\\nHowever , the low circumflex marginal vessel could not be crossed with the balloon .\\nShe did well in follow up , being treated for hypertension .\\nIn the end of 1992 , she was feeling well and was taken off Isordil .\\nDuring the winter and early parts of 1993 , the patient noticed increasing fatigue , symptoms of breathlessness and recurrent substernal chest pressure which finally led to admission to Xas Tupalmsmodral Hospital on 11-11-93 with documentation of a subendocardial myocardial infarction and a blood pressure of 210/108 .\\nCardiac catheterization towards the end of the hospitalization showed recurrent right coronary artery stenosis proximally and high grade new stenosis in the distal circumflex at the area of the origin of the previously untreated low circumflex marginal vessel .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\nMedications on transfer were Ecotrin , Vasotec 5 mg , Lopressor 25 bid , Isordil 20 tid , Procardia XL once per day , and Lasix 20 q3 days .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nOn physical examination , the blood pressure was 150 , heart rate 70 , bilateral carotid bruits , grade II systolic ejection murmur , good femoral pulses without bruits , good dorsalis pedis pulses with no posterior tibial pulses felt .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nThe electrocardiogram revealed left bundle branch block .\\nThe electrolytes were normal .\\nThe admission hematocrit was 34 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nOn 12-6-93 , angioplasty was performed of the right coronary artery using a 3 mm solo balloon reducing the stenosis from 80 to approximately 20% with a faint diagonal lucency which was not obstructive .\\nThe new distal circumflex lesion was dilated with a 2.0 mm balloon with a good result and minimal persistent stenosis .\\nBut the low circumflex marginal could not be entered with a wire .\\nThe first marginal had a 505 stenosis at its origin , which was not attempted .\\nThe patient did well post procedure .\\nHe developed a grape sized hematoma over the femoral artery with a loud bruit .\\nThe ultrasound on the day of discharge showed no evidence of pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula .\\nThe blood pressure was 150-170 systolic .\\nThe patient was ambulating without symptoms .\\nADDENDUM :\\nThe admission hematocrit was 34 .\\nThis fell to 25 after the cardiac catheterization without evidence of bleeding and rose to 29 by the time of discharge .\\nDOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :\\nShe was discharged with advice by Cardiac Rehabilitation for gradually increasing activity .\\nShe will be followed by her physician at Cean , Dr. Dieseld Pollejesc , for further pressure management and follow up of the femoral hematoma .\\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE :\\nStable , resolving anemia .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nEcotrin 160 mg per day , Vasotec 5 mg per day , Lopressor 25 bid , Isordil 20 tid , Procardia XL 30 per day , Lasix 20 mg q3 days .\\nTELSHEY STUDY , M.D.\\nTR :\\nah / BMot\\nDD :\\n12-9-93\\nTD :\\n12/11/93\\nCC :\\nDr. Telshey Study

was seen by Dr. Overall in the office on Aug 22 , 2003 , for follow-up .\\nShe was scheduled to have a total hi p replacement because of progressively worsening pain in the left hip .\\nHer pain was 8/10 .\\nShe limped .\\nShe did not use a cane .\\nShe did require a bannister going up and down stairs .\\nShe had trouble doing shoes and socks .\\nShe could walk limited distances .\\nSince seen by Dr. Overall in August , she had had a brain aneurysm .\\nShe had a mastectomy and had recently developed Parkinson 's.\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\n1. Breast cancer in the right breast , diagnosed in 1995 with negative nodes , treated with excision , recurrence in June , 2001 , further reconstructive surgery .\\nAt the same time , she underwent reduction of t he left breast .\\n2. History of bipolar disorder , for which she sees Dr. Lettefriscbreun .\\nShe indicates this is stable at this time .\\n3. History of chronic anxiety .\\n4.

Imodium , 2 mg. q.a.m.\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nExamination reveals that the patient is walking with a mild limp .\\nThe left hip is a bit stiff with flexion to 90 degrees .\\nShe has 10 degrees of internal rotation and external rotation .\\nPulses are fine .\\nIMAGING :\\nX-rays were reviewed .\\nThey showed advanced arthritis of the left hip .\\nRECOMMENDATIONS :\\nDr. Etteme Overall recommended that the patient have a total hip replacement on the left side on February 2 , 2003 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nPlease refer to the operative note by Dr. Etteme Overall for details of the procedure .\\nPostoperatively , the patient was transferred to the floor in stable condition for observation , pain control and mobilization .\\nInitially postoperatively , she was doing quite well , though she did require four liters of oxygen postoperatively to maintain her oxygen saturations .\\nIt was hoped that she would wean off the oxygen over the course of the next few hours .\\nHowever , she did require four liters of oxygen all the way through the night to maintain oxygen saturations of 93% .\\nWithout oxygen , she dropped down to the low 80s .\\nGiven the unusual nature of this oxygen requirement , the patient underwent work-up with a chest X-ray , which essentially was normal .\\nAn ABG revealed a normal PCO2 of 32 , but a decrease in PO2- at 62 .\\nTherefore , given her history of breast cancer , the patient was taken for a spiral CT scan and the Medicine Service was consulted at that time .\\nThey agreed with our plan .\\nOn spiral CT scan , a small pulmonary embolus was seen in the right upper lobe and the left low er lobe .\\nShe was started on heparin at that time to maintain a PTT of 60 t o 80 , and was given doses of Coumadin , in addition to the Coumadin she had been given for DVT prophylaxis .\\nWith the recommendation of the medicine te am , we decided to maintain an INR of 2 to 3 with an overlap of heparin when the patient was therapeutic for two to three days .\\nShe continued to do quite well even though we did keep her on bed rest for three days while she was heparinized .\\nHer oxygen saturations continued to improve to the point that she was on room air on postoperative day four with oxygen saturation of 95% .\\nShe was given perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis for 48 hours after surgery .\\nShe was mobilized on postoperative day four , getting out of bed , able to do quite well on her new hip with a minimal amount of pain .\\nShe was given posterior hip dislocation precautions at that time , which she understood quite well .\\nShe continued to be followed by the medical team and was watched very closely by the orthopedic team until we felt comfortable that she was breathing quite well and was mobilizing well with physical therapy .\\nTherefore , it was decided at that time that the patient was ready for discharge to rehabilitation on Coumadin , which would be monitored for six months to maintain an INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nThe patient will continue all of her pre-admission medications , though no nonsteroidal analgesics , e.g. , aspirin or ibuprofen , will be given while she is on Coumadin therapy .\\n1. Colace , 100 mg. PO t.i.d.\\n2. Percocet , one to two tablets PO q.3 to 4 hours p.r.n. pain .\\n3. Coumadin with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nPlease prescribe 2 mg. tablets .\\nThe patient will be on Coumadin for six months given her history of pulmonary embolus .\\nDISCHARGE PLAN :\\nCoumadin for six months postoperatively with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nCheck INR three times a week until stable .\\nPlease call the results to Dr. Viennee Ester , the patient 's primary-care physician , who has agreed to follow her INR levels for the remainder of the six months .\\nDr. Viennee Ester is located in Tlandcousti Lo Vuclark , where the patient is from originally .\\nThe patient will call Dr. Overall 's office to arrange a follow-up appointment six weeks from the day of surgery .\\nStaples can be removed 10 to 14 days postoperatively .\\nPlease hold removal if the wound is draining .\\nThe patient may shower once the incision is dry , and may bathe and / or swim after the staples have been removed and there is no wound drainage .\\nPartial weight-bearing with crutches or a walker with posterior hip dislocation precautions for three months following surgery .\\nThese precautions have been explained and demonstrated to the patient .\\nThe patient has been instructed to call Dr. Overall 's office or the orthopedist on call with any questions or concerns about increasing pain , swelling , redness , wound drainage , fevers or chills at 094-897-3231 .\\nKEMA ESTER ,\\nMD DICTATING FOR :\\nElectronically Signed ETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D. 02/22/2003 07:01\\n_____________________________ ETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D.\\nTR :\\npe\\nDD :\\n02/08/2003\\nTD :\\n02/08/2003 6:34 P 737058\\ncc :\\nETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D. ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY ALLMID HEALTH CENTER KEMA ESTER , MILD VIENNEE C.

through the trachea .\\nHer steroids were weaned and the patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 10 , 1994 where she underwent once again flexible bronchoscopy and flexible esophagoscopy , as well as rigid bronchoscopy .\\nShe then had a transhiatal esophagectomy which was partial , and a substernal gastric interposition as well as a jejunostomy .\\nThe pathology report suggested that the area was involved with radiation esophagitis and focal ulceration .\\nShe remained ventilator dependent postoperatively and was taken to the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit .\\nThe patient was maintained on triple antibiotics which included Vancomycin , ceftazidime and Gentamicin .\\nOn postoperative day two , she had an electroencephalogram which showed no evidence of seizure activity but some generalized slowing .\\nThe patient was seen in consultation by the Neurology Service for her apparent postoperative encephalopathy and episodes of shaking .\\nAn endoscopy was also performed on postoperative day two which showed clean anastomosis .\\nShe received multiple bronchoscopies for pulmonary toilet .\\nThe patient was maintained on tube feedings and the ventilator .\\nA repeat echocardiogram on February 18 showed no significant change of her previous echocardiogram on February 11 , which showed only a small pericardial effusion .\\nA pelvic and abdominal computerized tomography scan on February 18 also showed no evidence of a focal collection or abscess .\\nShe remained intermittently febrile despite numerous antibiotics .\\nHer chest X-ray showed bilateral air space disease , consistent with pneumonia or adult respiratory distress syndrome .\\nShe suffered an episode of renal failure which was felt attributable to aminoglycoside toxicity .\\nHer steroids were weaned .\\nBecause of her prolonged intubation and inability to wean , on February 24 , 1994 , she had a tracheostomy placed .\\nShe remained in a coma .\\nThe blood cultures on February 26 , 1994 grew out Staphylococcus and she was treated for septicemia .\\nHer sputum grew out Pseudomonas aeruginosa as well .\\nThe urine contained yeast and she was treated with amphotericin .\\nOn March 3 , 1994 , a repeat chest and abdominal and pelvis computerized tomography scan showed no evidence of fluid collections .\\nThere was a large left pleural effusion however .\\nThis was drained with a left chest tube .\\nHer sputum then grew out Klebsiella and she was treated with amikacin and imipenem .\\nShe developed a right pleural effusion and had a right chest tube placed .\\nOn March 13 , 1994 , she regained some level of consciousness .\\nShe was able to fix and follow with her eyes , respond to commands .\\nOn March 14 , 1994 , her right lung was pleurodesed .\\nAttempts were made to facilitate her wean by resting her overnight with a combination of propafol and Fentanyl .\\nThis was tried for approximately seven days with no real progress made toward facilitating her vent wean .\\nShe continued to require pressor support in the high 30 's .\\nShe also fell into a coma once again .\\nOn March 31 , 1994 , her pressor support requirement increased and she continued to have tachypneic episodes .\\nOn April 2 , 1994 , she had several episodes of bradycardia and asystole , which responded only to manual ventilation .\\nDiscussions were held with the patient 's family with regard to her previously expressed wishes not to be maintained on artificial life support for extended period of time with little or no hope for recovery .\\nShe had expressed these wishes in writing on several legal forms from the state of Jose Pineston , as well as in discussions with her loved ones .\\nDecision was made in conjunction with the family and Dr. Caslighlourdes to terminate artificial respiratory support .\\nThe patient was removed from the ventilator and placed on a T-piece in her trachea only and was made comfortable with narcotics .\\nHer respirations ceased and she died at 10:15 a.m. on April 2 , 1994 .\\nDISPOSITION / PLAN ON DISCHARGE :\\nThe family will return the body to Sa for burial .\\nThey have declined a post-mortem examination .\\nCA SHUFF ,

Medical Center for angioplasty .\\nPRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :\\nUnstable angina .\\nASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :\\nHypertension .\\nPRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :\\nRight and circumflex angioplasty , cardiac catheterization on 12-6-93 .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThis 75 year old woman was previously admitted here in November 1993 for chronic angina .\\nShe had mild mitral regurgitation and a slightly diminished ejection fraction .\\nThere was a 90% right coronary stenosis which was reduced to 30 with a balloon angioplasty .\\nThere were three lesions in the circumflex , dilated successfully .\\nHowever , the low circumflex marginal vessel could not be crossed with the balloon .\\nShe did well in follow up , being treated for hypertension .\\nIn the end of 1992 , she was feeling well and was taken off Isordil .\\nDuring the winter and early parts of 1993 , the patient noticed increasing fatigue , symptoms of breathlessness and recurrent substernal chest pressure which finally led to admission to Xas Tupalmsmodral Hospital on 11-11-93 with documentation of a subendocardial myocardial infarction and a blood pressure of 210/108 .\\nCardiac catheterization towards the end of the hospitalization showed recurrent right coronary artery stenosis proximally and high grade new stenosis in the distal circumflex at the area of the origin of the previously untreated low circumflex marginal vessel .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\nMedications on transfer were Ecotrin , Vasotec 5 mg , Lopressor 25 bid , Isordil 20 tid , Procardia XL once per day , and Lasix 20 q3 days .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nOn physical examination , the blood pressure was 150 , heart rate 70 , bilateral carotid bruits , grade II systolic ejection murmur , good femoral pulses without bruits , good dorsalis pedis pulses with no posterior tibial pulses felt .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nThe electrocardiogram revealed left bundle branch block .\\nThe electrolytes were normal .\\nThe admission hematocrit was 34 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nOn 12-6-93 , angioplasty was performed of the right coronary artery using a 3 mm solo balloon reducing the stenosis from 80 to approximately 20% with a faint diagonal lucency which was not obstructive .\\nThe new distal circumflex lesion was dilated with a 2.0 mm balloon with a good result and minimal persistent stenosis .\\nBut the low circumflex marginal could not be entered with a wire .\\nThe first marginal had a 505 stenosis at its origin , which was not attempted .\\nThe patient did well post procedure .\\nHe developed a grape sized hematoma over the femoral artery with a loud bruit .\\nThe ultrasound on the day of discharge showed no evidence of pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula .\\nThe blood pressure was 150-170 systolic .\\nThe patient was ambulating without symptoms .\\nADDENDUM :\\nThe admission hematocrit was 34 .\\nThis fell to 25 after the cardiac catheterization without evidence of bleeding and rose to 29 by the time of discharge .\\nDOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :\\nShe was discharged with advice by Cardiac Rehabilitation for gradually increasing activity .\\nShe will be followed by her physician at Cean , Dr. Dieseld Pollejesc , for further pressure management and follow up of the femoral hematoma .\\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE :\\nStable , resolving anemia .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nEcotrin 160 mg per day , Vasotec 5 mg per day , Lopressor 25 bid , Isordil 20 tid , Procardia XL 30 per day , Lasix 20 mg q3 days .\\nTELSHEY STUDY , M.D.\\nTR :\\nah / BMot\\nDD :\\n12-9-93\\nTD :\\n12/11/93\\nCC :\\nDr. Telshey Study

Imodium , 2 mg. q.a.m.\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nExamination reveals that the patient is walking with a mild limp .\\nThe left hip is a bit stiff with flexion to 90 degrees .\\nShe has 10 degrees of internal rotation and external rotation .\\nPulses are fine .\\nIMAGING :\\nX-rays were reviewed .\\nThey showed advanced arthritis of the left hip .\\nRECOMMENDATIONS :\\nDr. Etteme Overall recommended that the patient have a total hip replacement on the left side on February 2 , 2003 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nPlease refer to the operative note by Dr. Etteme Overall for details of the procedure .\\nPostoperatively , the patient was transferred to the floor in stable condition for observation , pain control and mobilization .\\nInitially postoperatively , she was doing quite well , though she did require four liters of oxygen postoperatively to maintain her oxygen saturations .\\nIt was hoped that she would wean off the oxygen over the course of the next few hours .\\nHowever , she did require four liters of oxygen all the way through the night to maintain oxygen saturations of 93% .\\nWithout oxygen , she dropped down to the low 80s .\\nGiven the unusual nature of this oxygen requirement , the patient underwent work-up with a chest X-ray , which essentially was normal .\\nAn ABG revealed a normal PCO2 of 32 , but a decrease in PO2- at 62 .\\nTherefore , given her history of breast cancer , the patient was taken for a spiral CT scan and the Medicine Service was consulted at that time .\\nThey agreed with our plan .\\nOn spiral CT scan , a small pulmonary embolus was seen in the right upper lobe and the left low er lobe .\\nShe was started on heparin at that time to maintain a PTT of 60 t o 80 , and was given doses of Coumadin , in addition to the Coumadin she had been given for DVT prophylaxis .\\nWith the recommendation of the medicine te am , we decided to maintain an INR of 2 to 3 with an overlap of heparin when the patient was therapeutic for two to three days .\\nShe continued to do quite well even though we did keep her on bed rest for three days while she was heparinized .\\nHer oxygen saturations continued to improve to the point that she was on room air on postoperative day four with oxygen saturation of 95% .\\nShe was given perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis for 48 hours after surgery .\\nShe was mobilized on postoperative day four , getting out of bed , able to do quite well on her new hip with a minimal amount of pain .\\nShe was given posterior hip dislocation precautions at that time , which she understood quite well .\\nShe continued to be followed by the medical team and was watched very closely by the orthopedic team until we felt comfortable that she was breathing quite well and was mobilizing well with physical therapy .\\nTherefore , it was decided at that time that the patient was ready for discharge to rehabilitation on Coumadin , which would be monitored for six months to maintain an INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nThe patient will continue all of her pre-admission medications , though no nonsteroidal analgesics , e.g. , aspirin or ibuprofen , will be given while she is on Coumadin therapy .\\n1. Colace , 100 mg. PO t.i.d.\\n2. Percocet , one to two tablets PO q.3 to 4 hours p.r.n. pain .\\n3. Coumadin with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nPlease prescribe 2 mg. tablets .\\nThe patient will be on Coumadin for six months given her history of pulmonary embolus .\\nDISCHARGE PLAN :\\nCoumadin for six months postoperatively with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nCheck INR three times a week until stable .\\nPlease call the results to Dr. Viennee Ester , the patient 's primary-care physician , who has agreed to follow her INR levels for the remainder of the six months .\\nDr. Viennee Ester is located in Tlandcousti Lo Vuclark , where the patient is from originally .\\nThe patient will call Dr. Overall 's office to arrange a follow-up appointment six weeks from the day of surgery .\\nStaples can be removed 10 to 14 days postoperatively .\\nPlease hold removal if the wound is draining .\\nThe patient may shower once the incision is dry , and may bathe and / or swim after the staples have been removed and there is no wound drainage .\\nPartial weight-bearing with crutches or a walker with posterior hip dislocation precautions for three months following surgery .\\nThese precautions have been explained and demonstrated to the patient .\\nThe patient has been instructed to call Dr. Overall 's office or the orthopedist on call with any questions or concerns about increasing pain , swelling , redness , wound drainage , fevers or chills at 094-897-3231 .\\nKEMA ESTER ,\\nMD DICTATING FOR :\\nElectronically Signed ETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D. 02/22/2003 07:01\\n_____________________________ ETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D.\\nTR :\\npe\\nDD :\\n02/08/2003\\nTD :\\n02/08/2003 6:34 P 737058\\ncc :\\nETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D. ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY ALLMID HEALTH CENTER KEMA ESTER , MILD VIENNEE C.

initially diagnosed in 1978 with atypical small cell carcinoma of the lung and treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy until 1980 .\\nShe did well for approximately twelve years until she was diagnosed with carcinoid cancer of the same right upper lobe .\\nThis may have been the initial primary cancer although it is unclear at present .\\nBronchoscopy at that time showed an endobronchial tumor of the right upper lobe bronchus and it was felt to be unresectable .\\nShe underwent four treatments of brachytherapy in March through May of 1993 .\\nShe had been doing reasonably well until December of 1993 when she presented with persistent and worsening cough and near strangulation on attempts at eating solids or drinking liquids .\\nA bronchoscopy showed a tracheoesophageal fistula with an opening into the trachea above the carina and no tumor in the right upper lobe .\\nShe has been on total parenteral nutrition and has been nothing by mouth since then .\\nA barium swallow

catheterization on 12-6-93 .\\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\\nThis 75 year old woman was previously admitted here in November 1993 for chronic angina .\\nShe had mild mitral regurgitation and a slightly diminished ejection fraction .\\nThere was a 90% right coronary stenosis which was reduced to 30 with a balloon angioplasty .\\nThere were three lesions in the circumflex , dilated successfully .\\nHowever , the low circumflex marginal vessel could not be crossed with the balloon .\\nShe did well in follow up , being treated for hypertension .\\nIn the end of 1992 , she was feeling well and was taken off Isordil .\\nDuring the winter and early parts of 1993 , the patient noticed increasing fatigue , symptoms of breathlessness and recurrent substernal chest pressure which finally led to admission to Xas Tupalmsmodral Hospital on 11-11-93 with documentation of a subendocardial myocardial infarction and a blood pressure of 210/108 .\\nCardiac catheterization towards the end of the hospitalization showed recurrent right coronary artery stenosis proximally and high grade new stenosis in the distal circumflex at the area of the origin of the previously untreated low circumflex marginal vessel .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\nMedications on transfer were Ecotrin , Vasotec 5 mg , Lopressor 25 bid , Isordil 20 tid , Procardia XL once per day , and Lasix 20 q3 days .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nOn physical examination , the blood pressure was 150 , heart rate 70 , bilateral carotid bruits , grade II systolic ejection murmur , good femoral pulses without bruits , good dorsalis pedis pulses with no posterior tibial pulses felt .\\nLABORATORY DATA :\\nThe electrocardiogram revealed left bundle branch block .\\nThe electrolytes were normal .\\nThe admission hematocrit was 34 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nOn 12-6-93 , angioplasty was performed of the right coronary artery using a 3 mm solo balloon reducing the stenosis from 80 to approximately 20% with a faint diagonal lucency which was not obstructive .\\nThe new distal circumflex lesion was dilated with a 2.0 mm balloon with a good result and minimal persistent stenosis .\\nBut the low circumflex marginal could not be entered with a wire .\\nThe first marginal had a 505 stenosis at its origin , which was not attempted .\\nThe patient did well post procedure .\\nHe developed a grape sized hematoma over the femoral artery with a loud bruit .\\nThe ultrasound on the day of discharge showed no evidence of pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula .\\nThe blood pressure was 150-170 systolic .\\nThe patient was ambulating without symptoms .\\nADDENDUM :\\nThe admission hematocrit was 34 .\\nThis fell to 25 after the cardiac catheterization without evidence of bleeding and rose to 29 by the time of discharge .\\nDOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :\\nShe was discharged with advice by Cardiac Rehabilitation for gradually increasing activity .\\nShe will be followed by her physician at Cean , Dr. Dieseld Pollejesc , for further pressure management and follow up of the femoral hematoma .\\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE :\\nStable , resolving anemia .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nEcotrin 160 mg per day , Vasotec 5 mg per day , Lopressor 25 bid , Isordil 20 tid , Procardia XL 30 per day , Lasix 20 mg q3 days .\\nTELSHEY STUDY , M.D.\\nTR :\\nah / BMot\\nDD :\\n12-9-93\\nTD :\\n12/11/93\\nCC :\\nDr. Telshey Study

was seen by Dr. Overall in the office on Aug 22 , 2003 , for follow-up .\\nShe was scheduled to have a total hi p replacement because of progressively worsening pain in the left hip .\\nHer pain was 8/10 .\\nShe limped .\\nShe did not use a cane .\\nShe did require a bannister going up and down stairs .\\nShe had trouble doing shoes and socks .\\nShe could walk limited distances .\\nSince seen by Dr. Overall in August , she had had a brain aneurysm .\\nShe had a mastectomy and had recently developed Parkinson 's.\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\n1. Breast cancer in the right breast , diagnosed in 1995 with negative nodes , treated with excision , recurrence in June , 2001 , further reconstructive surgery .\\nAt the same time , she underwent reduction of t he left breast .\\n2. History of bipolar disorder , for which she sees Dr. Lettefriscbreun .\\nShe indicates this is stable at this time .\\n3. History of chronic anxiety .\\n4.

Imodium , 2 mg. q.a.m.\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nExamination reveals that the patient is walking with a mild limp .\\nThe left hip is a bit stiff with flexion to 90 degrees .\\nShe has 10 degrees of internal rotation and external rotation .\\nPulses are fine .\\nIMAGING :\\nX-rays were reviewed .\\nThey showed advanced arthritis of the left hip .\\nRECOMMENDATIONS :\\nDr. Etteme Overall recommended that the patient have a total hip replacement on the left side on February 2 , 2003 .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nPlease refer to the operative note by Dr. Etteme Overall for details of the procedure .\\nPostoperatively , the patient was transferred to the floor in stable condition for observation , pain control and mobilization .\\nInitially postoperatively , she was doing quite well , though she did require four liters of oxygen postoperatively to maintain her oxygen saturations .\\nIt was hoped that she would wean off the oxygen over the course of the next few hours .\\nHowever , she did require four liters of oxygen all the way through the night to maintain oxygen saturations of 93% .\\nWithout oxygen , she dropped down to the low 80s .\\nGiven the unusual nature of this oxygen requirement , the patient underwent work-up with a chest X-ray , which essentially was normal .\\nAn ABG revealed a normal PCO2 of 32 , but a decrease in PO2- at 62 .\\nTherefore , given her history of breast cancer , the patient was taken for a spiral CT scan and the Medicine Service was consulted at that time .\\nThey agreed with our plan .\\nOn spiral CT scan , a small pulmonary embolus was seen in the right upper lobe and the left low er lobe .\\nShe was started on heparin at that time to maintain a PTT of 60 t o 80 , and was given doses of Coumadin , in addition to the Coumadin she had been given for DVT prophylaxis .\\nWith the recommendation of the medicine te am , we decided to maintain an INR of 2 to 3 with an overlap of heparin when the patient was therapeutic for two to three days .\\nShe continued to do quite well even though we did keep her on bed rest for three days while she was heparinized .\\nHer oxygen saturations continued to improve to the point that she was on room air on postoperative day four with oxygen saturation of 95% .\\nShe was given perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis for 48 hours after surgery .\\nShe was mobilized on postoperative day four , getting out of bed , able to do quite well on her new hip with a minimal amount of pain .\\nShe was given posterior hip dislocation precautions at that time , which she understood quite well .\\nShe continued to be followed by the medical team and was watched very closely by the orthopedic team until we felt comfortable that she was breathing quite well and was mobilizing well with physical therapy .\\nTherefore , it was decided at that time that the patient was ready for discharge to rehabilitation on Coumadin , which would be monitored for six months to maintain an INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\nThe patient will continue all of her pre-admission medications , though no nonsteroidal analgesics , e.g. , aspirin or ibuprofen , will be given while she is on Coumadin therapy .\\n1. Colace , 100 mg. PO t.i.d.\\n2. Percocet , one to two tablets PO q.3 to 4 hours p.r.n. pain .\\n3. Coumadin with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nPlease prescribe 2 mg. tablets .\\nThe patient will be on Coumadin for six months given her history of pulmonary embolus .\\nDISCHARGE PLAN :\\nCoumadin for six months postoperatively with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\\nCheck INR three times a week until stable .\\nPlease call the results to Dr. Viennee Ester , the patient 's primary-care physician , who has agreed to follow her INR levels for the remainder of the six months .\\nDr. Viennee Ester is located in Tlandcousti Lo Vuclark , where the patient is from originally .\\nThe patient will call Dr. Overall 's office to arrange a follow-up appointment six weeks from the day of surgery .\\nStaples can be removed 10 to 14 days postoperatively .\\nPlease hold removal if the wound is draining .\\nThe patient may shower once the incision is dry , and may bathe and / or swim after the staples have been removed and there is no wound drainage .\\nPartial weight-bearing with crutches or a walker with posterior hip dislocation precautions for three months following surgery .\\nThese precautions have been explained and demonstrated to the patient .\\nThe patient has been instructed to call Dr. Overall 's office or the orthopedist on call with any questions or concerns about increasing pain , swelling , redness , wound drainage , fevers or chills at 094-897-3231 .\\nKEMA ESTER ,\\nMD DICTATING FOR :\\nElectronically Signed ETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D. 02/22/2003 07:01\\n_____________________________ ETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D.\\nTR :\\npe\\nDD :\\n02/08/2003\\nTD :\\n02/08/2003 6:34 P 737058\\ncc :\\nETTEME ACIOUSLECIEN OVERALL , M.D. ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY ALLMID HEALTH CENTER KEMA ESTER , MILD VIENNEE C.

through the trachea .\\nHer steroids were weaned and the patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 10 , 1994 where she underwent once again flexible bronchoscopy and flexible esophagoscopy , as well as rigid bronchoscopy .\\nShe then had a transhiatal esophagectomy which was partial , and a substernal gastric interposition as well as a jejunostomy .\\nThe pathology report suggested that the area was involved with radiation esophagitis and focal ulceration .\\nShe remained ventilator dependent postoperatively and was taken to the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit .\\nThe patient was maintained on triple antibiotics which included Vancomycin , ceftazidime and Gentamicin .\\nOn postoperative day two , she had an electroencephalogram which showed no evidence of seizure activity but some generalized slowing .\\nThe patient was seen in consultation by the Neurology Service for her apparent postoperative encephalopathy and episodes of shaking .\\nAn endoscopy was also performed on postoperative day two which showed clean anastomosis .\\nShe received multiple bronchoscopies for pulmonary toilet .\\nThe patient was maintained on tube feedings and the ventilator .\\nA repeat echocardiogram on February 18 showed no significant change of her previous echocardiogram on February 11 , which showed only a small pericardial effusion .\\nA pelvic and abdominal computerized tomography scan on February 18 also showed no evidence of a focal collection or abscess .\\nShe remained intermittently febrile despite numerous antibiotics .\\nHer chest X-ray showed bilateral air space disease , consistent with pneumonia or adult respiratory distress syndrome .\\nShe suffered an episode of renal failure which was felt attributable to aminoglycoside toxicity .\\nHer steroids were weaned .\\nBecause of her prolonged intubation and inability to wean , on February 24 , 1994 , she had a tracheostomy placed .\\nShe remained in a coma .\\nThe blood cultures on February 26 , 1994 grew out Staphylococcus and she was treated for septicemia .\\nHer sputum grew out Pseudomonas aeruginosa as well .\\nThe urine contained yeast and she was treated with amphotericin .\\nOn March 3 , 1994 , a repeat chest and abdominal and pelvis computerized tomography scan showed no evidence of fluid collections .\\nThere was a large left pleural effusion however .\\nThis was drained with a left chest tube .\\nHer sputum then grew out Klebsiella and she was treated with amikacin and imipenem .\\nShe developed a right pleural effusion and had a right chest tube placed .\\nOn March 13 , 1994 , she regained some level of consciousness .\\nShe was able to fix and follow with her eyes , respond to commands .\\nOn March 14 , 1994 , her right lung was pleurodesed .\\nAttempts were made to facilitate her wean by resting her overnight with a combination of propafol and Fentanyl .\\nThis was tried for approximately seven days with no real progress made toward facilitating her vent wean .\\nShe continued to require pressor support in the high 30 's .\\nShe also fell into a coma once again .\\nOn March 31 , 1994 , her pressor support requirement increased and she continued to have tachypneic episodes .\\nOn April 2 , 1994 , she had several episodes of bradycardia and asystole , which responded only to manual ventilation .\\nDiscussions were held with the patient 's family with regard to her previously expressed wishes not to be maintained on artificial life support for extended period of time with little or no hope for recovery .\\nShe had expressed these wishes in writing on several legal forms from the state of Jose Pineston , as well as in discussions with her loved ones .\\nDecision was made in conjunction with the family and Dr. Caslighlourdes to terminate artificial respiratory support .\\nThe patient was removed from the ventilator and placed on a T-piece in her trachea only and was made comfortable with narcotics .\\nHer respirations ceased and she died at 10:15 a.m. on April 2 , 1994 .\\nDISPOSITION / PLAN ON DISCHARGE :\\nThe family will return the body to Sa for burial .\\nThey have declined a post-mortem examination .\\nCA SHUFF ,
