HOSPITAL COURSE:
The patient was admitted for a right-sided pleural effusion for thoracentesis on Monday by Dr. X. Her Coumadin was placed on hold. A repeat echocardiogram was checked. She was started on prophylaxis for DVT with Lovenox 40 mg subcutaneously. Her history dated back to March 2005 when she first sought medical attention for evidence of pericarditis, which was treated with pericardial window in an outside hospital, at that time she was also found to have mesenteric pain and thrombosis, is now anticoagulated. Her pericardial fluid was accumulated and she was seen by Dr. Y. At that time, she was recommended for pericardectomy, which was performed by Dr. Z. Review of her CT scan from March 2006 prior to her pericardectomy, already shows bilateral plural effusions. The patient improved clinically after the pericardectomy with resolution of her symptoms. Recently, she was readmitted to the hospital with chest pain and found to have bilateral pleural effusion, the right greater than the left. CT of the chest also revealed a large mediastinal lymph node. We reviewed the pathology obtained from the pericardectomy in March 2006, which was diagnostic of mesothelioma. At this time, chest tube placement for drainage of the fluid occurred and thoracoscopy with fluid biopsies, which were performed, which revealed epithelioid malignant mesothelioma. The patient was then stained with a PET CT, which showed extensive uptake in the chest, bilateral pleural pericardial effusions, and lymphadenopathy. She also had acidic fluid, pectoral and intramammary lymph nodes and uptake in L4 with SUV of 4. This was consistent with stage III disease. Her repeat echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 45% to 49%. She was transferred to Oncology service and started on chemotherapy on September 1, 2007 with cisplatin 75 mg/centimeter squared equaling 109 mg IV piggyback over 2 hours on September 1, 2007, Alimta 500 mg/ centimeter squared equaling 730 mg IV piggyback over 10 minutes. This was all initiated after a Port-A-Cath was placed. The chemotherapy was well tolerated and the patient was discharged the following day after discontinuing IV fluid and IV. Her Port-A-Cath was packed with heparin according to protocol.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
Zofran, Phenergan, Coumadin, and Lovenox, and Vicodin
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:
She was instructed to followup with Dr. XYZ in the office to check her INR on Tuesday. She was instructed to call if she had any other questions or concerns in the interim.

BCCa Excision - Lower Lid
Description:
Excision of large basal cell carcinoma, right lower lid, and repaired with used dorsal conjunctival flap in the upper lid and a large preauricular skin graft.
(Medical Transcription Sample Report)
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Extremely large basal cell carcinoma, right lower lid.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Extremely large basal cell carcinoma, right lower lid.
TITLE OF OPERATION:
Excision of large basal cell carcinoma, right lower lid, and repaired with used dorsal conjunctival flap in the upper lid and a large preauricular skin graft.
PROCEDURE:
The patient was brought into the operating room and prepped and draped in usual fashion. Xylocaine 2% with epinephrine was injected beneath the conjunctiva and skin of the lower lid and also beneath the conjunctiva and skin of the upper lid. A frontal nerve block was also given on the right upper lid. The anesthetic agent was also injected in the right preauricular region which would provide a donor graft for the right lower lid defect. The area was marked with a marking pen with margins of 3 to 4 mm, and a #15 Bard-Parker blade was used to make an incision at the nasal and temporal margins of the lesion.
The incision was carried inferiorly, and using a Steven scissors the normal skin, muscle, and conjunctiva was excised inferiorly. The specimen was then marked and sent to pathology for frozen section. Bleeding was controlled with a wet-field cautery, and the right upper lid was everted, and an incision was made 3 mm above the lid margin with the Bard-Parker blade in the entire length of the upper lid. The incision reached the orbicularis, and Steven scissors were used to separate the tarsus from the underlying orbicularis. Vertical cuts were made nasally and temporally, and a large dorsal conjunctival flap was fashioned with the conjunctiva attached superiorly. It was placed into the defect in the lower lid and sutured with multiple interrupted 6-0 Vicryl sutures nasally, temporally, and inferiorly.
The defect in the skin was measured and an appropriate large preauricular graft was excised from the right preauricular region. The defect was closed with interrupted 5-0 Prolene sutures, and the preauricular graft was sutured in place with multiple interrupted 6-0 silk sutures. The upper border of the graft was attached to the upper lid after incision was made in the gray line with a Superblade, and the superior portion of the skin graft was sutured to the upper lid through the anterior lamella created by the razor blade incision.
Cryotherapy was then used to treat the nasal and temporal margins of the area of excision because of positive margins, and following this an antibiotic steroid ointment was instilled and a light pressure dressing was applied. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was sent to recovery room in good condition.

Anemia - Consult
Description:
Refractory anemia that is transfusion dependent. At this time, he has been admitted for anemia with hemoglobin of 7.1 and requiring transfusion.
(Medical Transcription Sample Report)
DIAGNOSIS:
Refractory anemia that is transfusion dependent.
CHIEF COMPLAINT:
I needed a blood transfusion.
HISTORY:
The patient is a 78-year-old gentleman with no substantial past medical history except for diabetes. He denies any comorbid complications of the diabetes including kidney disease, heart disease, stroke, vision loss, or neuropathy. At this time, he has been admitted for anemia with hemoglobin of 7.1 and requiring transfusion. He reports that he has no signs or symptom of bleeding and had a blood transfusion approximately two months ago and actually several weeks before that blood transfusion, he had a transfusion for anemia. He has been placed on B12, oral iron, and Procrit. At this time, we are asked to evaluate him for further causes and treatment for his anemia. He denies any constitutional complaints except for fatigue, malaise, and some dyspnea. He has no adenopathy that he reports. No fevers, night sweats, bone pain, rash, arthralgias, or myalgias.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Diabetes.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
Hernia repair.
ALLERGIES:
He has no allergies.
MEDICATIONS:
Listed in the chart and include Coumadin, Lasix, metformin, folic acid, diltiazem, B12, Prevacid, and Feosol.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
He is a tobacco user. He does not drink. He lives alone, but has family and social support to look on him.
FAMILY HISTORY:
Negative for blood or cancer disorders according to the patient.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
GENERAL: He is an elderly gentleman in no acute distress. He is sitting up in bed eating his breakfast. He is alert and oriented and answering questions appropriately.
VITAL SIGNS: Blood pressure of 110/60, pulse of 99, respiratory rate of 14, and temperature of 97.4. He is 69 inches tall and weighs 174 pounds.
HEENT: Sclerae show mild arcus senilis in the right. Left is clear. Pupils are equally round and reactive to light. Extraocular movements are intact. Oropharynx is clear.
NECK: Supple. Trachea is midline. No jugular venous pressure distention is noted. No adenopathy in the cervical, supraclavicular, or axillary areas.
CHEST: Clear.
HEART: Regular rate and rhythm.
ABDOMEN: Soft and nontender. There may be some fullness in the left upper quadrant, although I do not appreciate a true spleen with inspiration.
EXTREMITIES: No clubbing, but there is some edema, but no cyanosis.
NEUROLOGIC: Noncontributory.
DERMATOLOGIC: Noncontributory.
CARDIOVASCULAR: Noncontributory.
IMPRESSION:
At this time is refractory anemia, which is transfusion dependent. He is on B12, iron, folic acid, and Procrit. There are no sign or symptom of blood loss and a recent esophagogastroduodenoscopy, which was negative. His creatinine was 1. My impression at this time is that he probably has an underlying myelodysplastic syndrome or bone marrow failure. His creatinine on this hospitalization was up slightly to 1.6 and this may contribute to his anemia.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
At this time, my recommendation for the patient is that he undergoes further serologic evaluation with reticulocyte count, serum protein, and electrophoresis, LDH, B12, folate, erythropoietin level, and he should undergo a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy. I have discussed the procedure in detail which the patient. I have discussed the risks, benefits, and successes of that treatment and usefulness of the bone marrow and predicting his cause of refractory anemia and further therapeutic interventions, which might be beneficial to him. He is willing to proceed with the studies I have described to him. We will order an ultrasound of his abdomen because of the possible fullness of the spleen, and I will probably see him in follow up after this hospitalization.
As always, we greatly appreciate being able to participate in the care of your patient. We appreciate the consultation of the patient.

Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy
Description:
Intensity-modulated radiation therapy is a complex set of procedures which requires appropriate positioning and immobilization typically with customized immobilization devices.
(Medical Transcription Sample Report)
INTENSITY-MODULATED RADIATION THERAPY
Intensity-modulated radiation therapy is a complex set of procedures which requires appropriate positioning and immobilization typically with customized immobilization devices. The treatment planning process requires at least 4 hours of physician time. The technology is appropriate in this patient's case due to the fact that the target volume is adjacent to significant radiosensitive structures. Sequential CT scans are obtained and transferred to the treatment planning software. Extensive analysis occurs. The target volumes, including margins for uncertainty, patient movement and occult tumor extension are selected. In addition, organs at risk are outlined. Doses are selected both for targets, as well as for organs at risk. Associated dose constraints are placed. Inverse treatment planning is then performed in conjunction with the physics staff. These are reviewed by the physician and ultimately performed only following approval by the physician. Multiple beam arrangements may be tested for appropriateness and optimal dose delivery in order to maximize the chance of controlling disease, while minimizing exposure to organs at risk. This is performed in hopes of minimizing associated complications. The physician delineates the treatment type, number of fractions and total volume. During the time of treatment, there is extensive physician intervention, monitoring the patient set up and tolerance. In addition, specific QA is performed by the physics staff under the physician's direction.
In view of the above, the special procedure code 77470 is deemed appropriate.

Neck Dissection
Description:
Left neck dissection. Metastatic papillary cancer, left neck. The patient had thyroid cancer, papillary cell type, removed with a total thyroidectomy and then subsequently recurrent disease was removed with a paratracheal dissection.
(Medical Transcription Sample Report)
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Metastatic papillary cancer, left neck.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Metastatic papillary cancer, left neck.
OPERATION PERFORMED:
Left neck dissection.
ANESTHESIA:
General endotracheal.
INDICATIONS:
The patient is a very nice gentleman, who has had thyroid cancer, papillary cell type, removed with a total thyroidectomy and then subsequently recurrent disease was removed with a paratracheal dissection. He now has evidence of lesion in the left mid neck and the left superior neck on ultrasound, which are suspicious for recurrent cancer. Left neck dissection is indicated.
DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:
The patient was placed on the operating room table in the supine position. After adequate general endotracheal anesthesia was administered, the table was then turned. A shoulder roll placed under the shoulders and the face was placed in an extended fashion. The left neck, chest, and face were prepped with Betadine and draped in a sterile fashion. A hockey stick skin incision was performed, extending a previous incision line superiorly towards the mastoid cortex through skin, subcutaneous tissue and platysma with Bovie electrocautery on cut mode. Subplatysmal superior and inferior flaps were raised. The dissection was left lateral neck dissection encompassing zones 1, 2A, 2B, 3, and the superior portion of 4. The sternocleidomastoid muscle was unwrapped at its fascial attachment and this was taken back posterior to the XI cranial nerve into the superior posterior most triangle of the neck. This was carried forward off of the deep rooted muscles including the splenius capitis and anterior and middle scalenes taken medially off of these muscles including the fascia of the muscles, stripped from the carotid artery, the X cranial nerve, the internal jugular vein and then carried anteriorly to the lateral most extent of the dissection previously done by Dr. X in the paratracheal region. The submandibular gland was removed as well. The X, XI, and XII cranial nerves were preserved. The internal jugular vein and carotid artery were preserved as well. Copious irrigation of the wound bed showed no identifiable bleeding at the termination of the procedure. There were two obviously positive nodes in this neck dissection. One was left medial neck just lateral to the previous tracheal dissection and one was in the mid region of zone 2. A #10 flat fluted Blake drain was placed through a separate stab incision and it was secured to the skin with a 2-0 silk ligature. The wound was closed in layers using a 3-0 Vicryl in a buried knot interrupted fashion for the subcutaneous tissue and the skin was closed with staples. A fluff and Kling pressure dressing was then applied. The patient was extubated in the operating room, brought to the recovery room in satisfactory condition. There were no intraoperative complications.

HDR BRACHYTHERAPY
The intracavitary brachytherapy applicator was placed appropriately and secured after the patient was identified. Simulation films were obtained, documenting its positioning. The 3-dimensional treatment planning process was accomplished utilizing the CT derived data. A treatment plan was selected utilizing sequential dwell positions within a single catheter. The patient was taken to the treatment area. The patient was appropriately positioned and the position of the intracavitary device was checked. Catheter length measurements were taken. Appropriate measurements of the probe dimensions and assembly were also performed. The applicator was attached to the HDR after-loader device. The device ran through its checking sequences appropriately and the brachytherapy was then delivered without difficulty or complication. The brachytherapy source was appropriately removed back to the brachytherapy safe within the device. Radiation screening was performed with the Geiger-Muller counter both prior to and after the brachytherapy procedure was completed and the results were deemed appropriate.
Following completion of the procedure, the intracavitary device was removed without difficulty. The patient was in no apparent distress and was discharged home.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Cervical lymphadenopathy.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Cervical lymphadenopathy.
PROCEDURE:
Excisional biopsy of right cervical lymph node.
ANESTHESIA:
General endotracheal anesthesia.
SPECIMEN:
Right cervical lymph node.
EBL:
10 cc.
COMPLICATIONS:
None.
FINDINGS:
Enlarged level 2 lymph node was identified and removed and sent for pathologic examination.
FLUIDS:
Please see anesthesia report.
URINE OUTPUT:
None recorded during the case.
INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE:
This is a 43-year-old female with a several-year history of persistent cervical lymphadenopathy. She reports that it is painful to palpation on the right and has had multiple CT scans as well as an FNA which were all nondiagnostic. After risks and benefits of surgery were discussed with the patient, an informed consent was obtained. She was scheduled for an excisional biopsy of the right cervical lymph node.
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
The patient was taken to the operating room and placed in the supine position. She was anesthetized with general endotracheal anesthesia. The neck was then prepped and draped in the sterile fashion. Again, noted on palpation there was an enlarged level 2 cervical lymph node.
A 3-cm horizontal incision was made over this lymph node. Dissection was carried down until the sternocleidomastoid muscle was identified. The enlarged lymph node that measured approximately 2 cm in diameter was identified and was removed and sent to Pathology for touch prep evaluation. The area was then explored for any other enlarged lymph nodes. None were identified, and hemostasis was achieved with electrocautery. A quarter-inch Penrose drain was placed in the wound.
The wound was then irrigated and closed with 3-0 interrupted Vicryl sutures for a deep closure followed by a running 4-0 Prolene subcuticular suture. Mastisol and Steri-Strip were placed over the incision, and sterile bandage was applied. The patient tolerated this procedure well and was extubated without complications and transported to the recovery room in stable condition. She will return to the office tomorrow in followup to have the Penrose drain removed.

Metastatic Ovarian Cancer - Consult
Description:
A very pleasant 66-year-old woman with recurrent metastatic ovarian cancer.
(Medical Transcription Sample Report)
REASON FOR CONSULTATION:
Metastatic ovarian cancer.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Mrs. ABCD is a very nice 66-year-old woman who is followed in clinic by Dr. X for history of renal cell cancer, breast cancer, as well as ovarian cancer, which was initially diagnosed 10 years ago, but over the last several months has recurred and is now metastatic. She last saw Dr. X in clinic towards the beginning of this month. She has been receiving gemcitabine and carboplatin, and she receives three cycles of this with the last one being given on 12/15/08. She was last seen in clinic on 12/22/08 by Dr. Y. At that point, her white count was 0.9 with the hemoglobin of 10.3, hematocrit of 30%, and platelets of 81,000. Her ANC was 0.5. She was started on prophylactic Augmentin as well as Neupogen shots. She has also had history of recurrent pleural effusions with the knee for thoracentesis. She had two of these performed in November and the last one was done about a week ago.
Over the last 2 or 3 days, she states she has been getting more short of breath. Her history is somewhat limited today as she is very tired and falls asleep readily. Her history comes from herself but also from the review of the records. Overall, her shortness of breath has been going on for the past few weeks related to her pleural effusions. She was seen in the emergency room this time and on chest x-ray was found to have a new right-sided pulmonic consolidative infiltrate, which was felt to be possibly related to pneumonia. She specifically denied any fevers or chills. However, she was complaining of chest pain. She states that the chest pain was located in the substernal area, described as aching, coming and going and associated with shortness of breath and cough. When she did cough, it was nonproductive. While in the emergency room on examination, her vital signs were stable except that she required 5 liters nasal cannula to maintain oxygen saturations. An EKG was performed, which showed sinus rhythm without any evidence of Q waves or other ischemic changes. The chest x-ray described above showed a right lower lobe infiltrate. A V/Q scan was done, which showed a small mismatched defect in the left upper lobe and a mass defect in the right upper lobe. The findings were compatible with an indeterminate study for a pulmonary embolism. Apparently, an ultrasound of the lower extremities was done and was negative for DVT. There was apparently still some concern that this might be pulmonary embolism and she was started on Lovenox. There was also concern for pneumonia and she was started on Zosyn as well as vancomycin and admitted to the hospital.
At this point, we have been consulted to help follow along with this patient who is well known to our clinic.

FAMILY HISTORY:
Both her mother and father had a history of lung cancer and both were smokers.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
GENERAL/CONSTITUTIONAL: She has not had any fever, chills, night sweats, but has had fatigue and weight loss of unspecified amount. HEENT: She has not had trouble with headaches; mouth, jaw, or teeth pain; change in vision; double vision; or loss of hearing or ringing in her ears. CHEST: Per the HPI, she has had some increasing dyspnea, shortness of breath with exertion, cough, but no sputum production or hemoptysis.

GU: No dysuria, burning with urination, kidney stones, and difficulty voiding. MUSCULOSKELETAL: No new back pain, hip pain, rib pain, swollen joints, history of gout, or muscle weakness. NEUROLOGIC: She has been diffusely weak but no lateralizing loss of strength or feeling. She has some chronic neuropathic pain and numbness as described above in the past medical history. She is fatigued and tired today and falls asleep while talking but is easily arousable. Some of this is related to her lack of sleep over the admission thus far.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
VITAL SIGNS: Her T-max is 99.3. Her pulse is 54, her respirations is 12, and blood pressure 118/61.
GENERAL: Somewhat fatigued appearing but in no acute distress.
HEENT: NC/AT. Sclerae anicteric. Conjunctiva clear. Oropharynx is clear without any erythema, exudate, or discharge.
NECK: Supple. Nontender. No elevated JVP. No thyromegaly. No thyroid nodules.
CHEST: Clear to auscultation and percussion bilaterally with decreased breath sounds on the right.
CVS: Regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs, gallops or rubs. Normal S1 and S2. No S3 or S4.
ABDOMEN: Soft, nontender, nondistended. Normoactive bowel sounds. No guarding or rebound. No hepatosplenomegaly. No masses.
MUSCULOSKELETAL: Generalized muscle weakness but no joint swelling or other abnormalities.
SKIN: No rashes, bruising, or petechia. No non-healing wounds or ulcerations.
NEUROLOGIC: She is oriented x3 but she falls asleep readily. On exam and conversation, her cranial nerves are intact. She has no sensory loss. Her strength is symmetric.
LABORATORY DATA:
Her white blood cell count is 8.0, hemoglobin 11.1, hematocrit 33.2%, and platelets 29,000. Her differential shows 2% metamyelocytes, 57% neutrophils, 29% bands, 6% lymphocytes, 5% monocytes, and 1% eosinophils. Her sodium is 138, potassium 4.0, chloride 101, CO2 of 23, BUN 21, creatinine 1.4, glucose 107, and calcium 8.7. Her INR is 1.0, PT of 12, and PTT 24. Urinalysis negative for nitrite and leukocyte esterase with moderate epithelial cells, bacteria, white blood cells, and yeast suggesting of contamination. Her troponins have been negative x3.
IMAGINING DATA:
CT scan of her chest on 12/25/08 shows bilateral pleural effusions, larger on the right than the left but these are somewhat decreased in size compared to the prior CT scan at the end of November. There is some consolidative atelectasis at the bilateral basis. There is some peripheral interstitial opacifications noted in the right lung and to a lesser extent in the left lung possibly consistent with pneumonitis. There are small peripheral nodular densities in both lungs unchanged compared to prior scan. There is an enlarged right adrenal gland again noted without change.
ASSESSMENT:
ABCD is a very pleasant 66-year-old woman with recurrent metastatic ovarian cancer known to our clinic. At this point, she has been admitted for shortness of breath with possible presumed pneumonia. The possibility of a PE also remains and the plan has been to do a CTA once her kidney function improves. Currently, she is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and Lovenox prophylactically.
At this point, it does not appear that her pleural effusions have increased and this would not be the etiology behind her worsening symptoms. Her blood counts appear to be recovering from chemotherapy except for the fact that her platelets have gone lower. It is unclear as to the etiology behind this but may still be related to chemotherapy effect. This also could be related to consumptive process such as DIC in the face of infections or medication effect. We will keep track of her blood counts over this admission.
We will continue to follow along through the course of her admission. She has requested being full code. I went back and looked at Dr. X's chart after our clinic chart and at the last visit with Dr. X and Dr. Y, she confirmed that she wanted to be DNR/DNI. I am not sure why this is changed and I will address this issue with her once she is more alert.
Thank you very much for this consult.

Lymph Node Excisional Biopsy
Description:
Left axillary lymph node excisional biopsy. Left axillary adenopathy.
(Medical Transcription Sample Report)
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Left axillary adenopathy.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Left axillary adenopathy.
PROCEDURE:
Left axillary lymph node excisional biopsy.
ANESTHESIA:
LMA.
INDICATIONS:
Patient is a very pleasant woman who in 2006 had breast conservation therapy with radiation only. Note, she refused her CMF adjuvant therapy and this was for a triple-negative infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the breast. Patient has been following with Dr. Diener and Dr. Wilmot. I believe that genetic counseling had been recommended to her and obviously the CMF was recommended, but she declined both. She presented to the office with left axillary adenopathy in view of the high-risk nature of her lesion. I recommended that she have this lymph node removed. The procedure, purpose, risk, expected benefits, potential complications, alternative forms of therapy were discussed with her and she was agreeable to surgery.
TECHNIQUE:
Patient was identified, then taken into the operating room where after induction of appropriate anesthesia, her left chest, neck, axilla, and arm were prepped with Betadine solution, draped in a sterile fashion. An incision was made at the hairline, carried down by sharp dissection through the clavipectoral fascia. I was able to easily palpate the lymph node and grasp it with a figure-of-eight 2-0 silk suture and by sharp dissection, was carried to hemoclip all attached structures. The lymph node was excised in its entirety. The wound was irrigated. The lymph node sent to pathology. The wound was then closed. Hemostasis was assured and the patient was taken to recovery room in stable condition.

Cholangiocarcinoma Consult
Description:
Newly diagnosed cholangiocarcinoma. The patient is noted to have an increase in her liver function tests on routine blood work. Ultrasound of the abdomen showed gallbladder sludge and gallbladder findings consistent with adenomyomatosis.
(Medical Transcription Sample Report)
REASON FOR CONSULTATION:
Newly diagnosed cholangiocarcinoma.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is a very pleasant 77-year-old female who is noted to have an increase in her liver function tests on routine blood work in December 2009. Ultrasound of the abdomen showed gallbladder sludge and gallbladder findings consistent with adenomyomatosis. Common bile duct was noted to be 10 mm in size on that ultrasound. She then underwent a CT scan of the abdomen in July 2010, which showed intrahepatic ductal dilatation with the common bile duct size being 12.7 mm. She then underwent an MRI MRCP, which was notable for stricture of the distal common bile duct. She was then referred to gastroenterology and underwent an ERCP. On August 24, 2010, she underwent the endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. She was noted to have a stricturing mass of the mid-to-proximal common bile duct consistent with cholangiocarcinoma. A temporary biliary stent was placed across the biliary stricture. Blood work was obtained during the hospitalization. She was also noted to have an elevated CA99. She comes in to clinic today for initial Medical Oncology consultation. After she sees me this morning, she has a follow-up consultation with a surgeon.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia. In July, she had eye surgery on her left eye for a muscle repair. Other surgeries include left ankle surgery for a fractured ankle in 2000.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS:
Diovan 80/12.5 mg daily, Lipitor 10 mg daily, Lutein 20 mg daily, folic acid 0.8 mg daily and multivitamin daily.

No known drug allergies.
FAMILY HISTORY:
Notable for heart disease. She had three brothers that died of complications from open heart surgery. Her parents and brothers all had hypertension. Her younger brother died at the age of 18 of infection from a butcher's shop. He was cutting Argentinean beef and contracted an infection and died within 24 hours. She has one brother that is living who has angina and a sister who is 84 with dementia. She has two adult sons who are in good health.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
The patient has been married to her second husband for the past ten years. Her first husband died in 1995. She does not have a smoking history and does not drink alcohol.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
The patient reports a change in her bowels ever since she had the stent placed. She has noted some weight loss, but she notes that that is due to not eating very well. She has had some mild fatigue, but prior to her diagnosis she had absolutely no symptoms. As mentioned above, she was noted to have abnormal alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin, AST and ALT, which prompted the followup. She has had some difficulty with her vision that has improved with her recent surgical procedure. She denies any fevers, chills, night sweats. She has had loose stools. The rest of her review of systems is negative.
PHYSICAL EXAM:
VITALS: BP: 108/60. HEART RATE: 80. TEMP: 98.5. Weight: 75 kg.
GEN: She is a very pleasant female, in no acute distress.
HEENT: She has obvious strabismus of the left eye with medial deviation. Her pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. Oropharynx is clear.
NECK: Supple. She has no cervical or supraclavicular adenopathy.
LUNGS: Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
CV: Regular rate; normal S1, S2, no murmurs.
ABDOMEN: Soft, nontender, and nondistended. No palpable masses. No hepatosplenomegaly.
EXT: Lower extremities are without edema.
LABORATORY STUDIES:
Sodium 141, glucose 111, total bilirubin 2.3, alkaline phosphatase 941, AST 161, and ALT 220. White blood cell count 4.3, hemoglobin 11.6, hematocrit 35, and platelets 156,000. Total bilirubin from August 25, 2010 was 1.6, alkaline phosphatase 735, AST 123, ALT 184, CA99 is 109. Bile duct brushings are notable for atypical cell clusters present, highly suspicious for carcinoma.
ASSESSMENT/PLAN:
This is a very pleasant 77-year-old female who has findings suspicious for a cholangiocarcinoma. The patient was referred to our office to discuss this diagnosis. I spent greater than an hour with the patient and her husband discussing this potential diagnosis, reviewing the anatomy and answering questions. She is yet to have a surgical consultation, and we discussed the difficulty that we sometimes have with patients meeting surgical criteria to manage cholangiocarcinoma. The patient also had questions about the Medical University and possibly seeking a second opinion. She will contact our office after her surgical consultation if she needs assistance with obtaining a second opinion. We also talked about our clinical research program here. Currently, we do have a Phase II Study for advanced gallbladder carcinoma or cholangiocarcinoma for patients that are unresectable. We will go ahead and provide her with a consent form so that she can look that over and it will give her some more information about the malignancy and treatment approaches. We will schedule her for followup in three weeks. We will also schedule her for PET/CT scan for staging.

Hematology Consult
Description:
Leukocytosis, acute deep venous thrombosis, right lower extremity with bilateral pulmonary embolism, on intravenous heparin complicated with acute renal failure for evaluation.
(Medical Transcription Sample Report)
REASON FOR CONSULTATION:
Acute deep venous thrombosis, right lower extremity with bilateral pulmonary embolism, on intravenous heparin complicated with acute renal failure for evaluation.
HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS:
Briefly, this is a 36-year-old robust Caucasian gentleman with no significant past medical or surgical history, who works as a sales representative, doing a lot of traveling by plane and car and attending several sales shows, developed acute shortness of breath with an episode of syncope this weekend and was brought in by paramedics to Hospital. A V/Q scan revealed multiple pulmonary perfusion defects consistent with high probability pulmonary embolism. A Doppler venous study of the lower extremity also revealed nonocclusive right popliteal vein thrombosis. A CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed normal-appearing liver, spleen, and pancreas; however, the right kidney appeared smaller compared to left and suggesting possibility of renal infarct. Renal function on admission was within normal range; however, serial renal function showed rapid increase in creatinine to 5 today. He has been on intravenous heparin and hemodialysis is being planned for tomorrow. Reviewing his history, there is no family members with hypercoagulable state or prior history of any thrombotic complication. He denies any recent injury to his lower extremity and in fact denied any calf pain or swelling.
PAST MEDICAL AND SURGICAL HISTORY:
Unremarkable.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
He is married and has 1 son. He has a brother who is healthy. There is no history of tobacco use or alcohol use.
FAMILY HISTORY:
No family history of hypercoagulable condition.
MEDICATIONS:
Advil p.r.n.
ALLERGIES:
NONE.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
Essentially unremarkable except for sudden onset dyspnea on easy exertion complicated with episode of syncope. He denied any hemoptysis. He denied any calf swelling or pain. Lately, he has been traveling and has been sitting behind a desk for a long period of time.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
GENERAL: He is a robust young gentleman, awake, alert, and hemodynamically stable.
HEENT: Sclerae anicteric. Conjunctivae normal. Oropharynx normal.
NECK: No adenopathy or thyromegaly. No jugular venous distention.
HEART: Regular.
LUNGS: Bilateral air entry.
ABDOMEN: Obese and benign.
EXTREMITIES: No calf swelling or calf tenderness appreciated.
SKIN: No petechiae or ecchymosis.
NEUROLOGIC: Nonfocal.
LABORATORY FINDINGS:
Blood count obtained showed a white count of 16.8, hemoglobin 14.8 g percent, hematocrit 44.6%, MCV 94, and platelet count 209,000. Liver profile normal. Thyroid study revealed a TSH of 1.3. Prothrombin time/INR 1.5, partial thromboplastin time 78.6 seconds. Renal function, BUN 44 and creatinine 5.7. Echocardiogram revealed left ventricular hypertrophy with ejection fraction of 65%, no intramural thrombus noted.
IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral pulmonary embolism, most consistent with emboli from right lower extremity, on intravenous heparin, rule out hereditary hypercoagulable state.
2. Leukocytosis, most likely leukemoid reaction secondary to acute pulmonary embolism/renal infarction, doubt presence of myeloproliferative disorder.
3. Acute renal failure secondary to embolic right renal infarction.
4. Obesity.
PLAN:
From hematologic standpoint, we will await hypercoagulable studies, which have all been sent on admission to see if a hereditary component is at play. For now, we will continue intravenous heparin and subsequent oral anticoagulation with Coumadin. In view of worsening renal function, may need temporary hemodialysis until renal function improves. I discussed at length with the patient's wife at the bedside.

Parathyroid Adenoma Excision
Description:
Excision of right superior parathyroid adenoma, seen on sestamibi parathyroid scan and an ultrasound.
(Medical Transcription Sample Report)
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Right superior parathyroid adenoma.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Right superior parathyroid adenoma.
PROCEDURE:
Excision of right superior parathyroid adenoma.
ANESTHESIA:
Local with 1% Xylocaine and anesthesia standby with sedation.
CLINICAL HISTORY:
This 80-year-old woman has had some mild dementia. She was begun on Aricept but could not tolerate that because of strange thoughts and hallucinations. She was found to be hypercalcemic. Intact PTH was mildly elevated. A sestamibi parathyroid scan and an ultrasound showed evidence of a right superior parathyroid adenoma.
FINDINGS AND PROCEDURE:
The patient was placed on the operating table in the supine position. A time out was taken so that the anesthesia personnel, nursing personnel, surgical team, and patient could confirm the patient's identity, operative site and operative plan. The electronic medical record was reviewed as was the ultrasound. The patient was sedated. A small roll was placed behind the shoulders to moderately hyperextend the neck. The head was supported in a foam head cradle. The neck and chest were prepped with chlorhexidine and isolated with sterile drapes. After infiltration with 1% Xylocaine with epinephrine along the planned incision, a transverse incision was made in the skin crease a couple of centimeters above the clavicular heads and carried down through the skin, subcutaneous tissue, and platysma. The larger anterior neck veins were divided between 4-0 silk ligatures. Superior and inferior flaps were developed in the subplatysmal plane using electrocautery and blunt dissection. The sternohyoid muscles were separated in the midline, and the right sternohyoid muscle was retracted laterally. The right sternothyroid muscle was divided transversely with the cautery. The right middle thyroid vein was divided between 4-0 silk ligatures. The right thyroid lobe was rotated leftward. Posterior to the mid portion of the left thyroid lobe, a right superior parathyroid adenoma of moderate size was identified. This was freed up and its pedicle was ligated with small Hemoclips and divided and the gland was removed. It was sent for weight and frozen section. It weighed 960 mg and on frozen section was consistent with a parathyroid adenoma.
Prior to the procedure, a peripheral blood sample had been obtained and placed in a purple top tube labeled ""pre-excision."" It was our intention to monitor intraoperative intact parathyroid hormone 10 minutes after removal of this parathyroid adenoma. However, we could not obtain 3 cc of blood from either the left foot or the left arm after multiple attempts, and therefore, we decided that the chance of cure of hyperparathyroidism by removal of this parathyroid adenoma was high enough and the improvement in that chance of cure marginal enough that we would terminate the procedure without monitoring PTH. The neck was irrigated with saline and hemostasis found to be satisfactory. The sternohyoid muscles were reapproximated with interrupted 4-0 Vicryl. The platysma was closed with interrupted 4-0 Vicryl, and the skin was closed with subcuticular 5-0 Monocryl and Dermabond. The patient was awakened and taken to the recovery area in satisfactory condition having tolerated the procedure well.

2. Immunosuppression. The patient will continue on his Bactrim twice a day on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. Additionally, we will tentatively plan to have him continue fluconazole since this is his second episode of thrush.
3. Mucosal candidiasis. We will continue fluconazole for thrush. I am pleased that the clinical evidence of disease appears to have resolved. For resolving neutropenia, I advised Gregory's mother about it is okay to discontinue the G-CSF at this time. We will plan for him to resume G-CSF after his next chemotherapy and prescription has been sent to the patient's pharmacy.
PEDIATRIC ONCOLOGY ATTENDING:
I have reviewed the history of the patient. This is an 11-month-old with neuroblastoma who received chemotherapy with carboplatin, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin on 05/21/07 for cycle 2 of POG-9641 due to his prior history of neutropenia, he has been on G-CSF. His ANC is nicely recovered. He will have a restaging CT prior to his next cycle of chemotherapy and then return for cycle 3 chemotherapy on 06/13/07 to 06/15/07. He continues on fluconazole for recent history of thrush. Plans are otherwise documented above.

His mother moved out to Colorado eight years ago and he has been out here for seven years. He currently is self employed and does antiquing. He has also worked as nurses' aide and worked in group home for the state of New York for the developmentally delayed. He is homosexual, currently not sexually active. He does have smoking history as about a thirteen and a half pack year history of smoking, currently smoking about a quarter of a pack per day. He does not use alcohol or illicit drugs.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
As mentioned above his weight has been fairly stable. Although, he suffered from obesity as a young teenager, but through a period of anorexia, but his weight has been stable now for about 20 years. He has had night sweats, chest pain, and is also suffering from some depression as well as overwhelming fatigue, stabbing, short-lived headaches and occasional shortness of breath. He has noted some stool irregularity with occasional loose stools and new onset of pain predominantly in left neck. He has had fevers as well. The rest of his review of systems is negative.
PHYSICAL EXAM:
VITALS: BP: 100/64. HEART RATE: 72. TEMP: 97. Weight: 61.4 kg.
GEN: He is a very pleasant gentleman, in no acute distress.
HEENT: He has obvious mass in submandibular region on the left. His pupils are equal, round and reactive to light. He has a nevus just below his orbit on the right hand side that has some irregularity. His pupils are equal, round and reactive to light. Sclerae anicteric. His oropharynx is clear. He has several missing teeth.
NECK: Supple. He has large palpable mass in the submandibular region and firm. He has some shotty lymphadenopathy in the posterior cervical chain bilaterally.
LUNGS: Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
CV: Regular rate, normal S1, S2, no murmurs.
ABDOMEN: Soft. He has positive bowel sounds. No hepatosplenomegaly. He has shotty axillary adenopathy and shotty inguinal adenopathy.
EXT: Lower extremity is without edema.
His CT scan of the chest showed prominent axillary lymph nodes bilaterally, largest on the left measuring 12 x 29 mm. He has borderline enlarge right superior hilar lymph node measuring 9 x 11 mm. His lungs are benign appearing by apical pleural parenchymal scarring and very mild peri-septal emphysema. Bones shows mild disk degenerative changes in the inferior thoracic spine.
IMPRESSION:
1. Borderline enlarged right superior hilar and left axillary lymph nodes, otherwise it unremarkable CT of the chest. CT of the neck shows 4.1 x 3.0 x 3.9 cm heterogenously enhancing lesion in the left submandibular space with central necrosis. The lesion appears to be separate from the submandibular gland with displacement of the glands superiorly and posteriorly. This lesion is most suspicious for an enlarged lymph node. Also, numerous other enlarged enhancing lymph nodes in the anterior and posterior cervical chains and left supraclavicular region.
2. Prominent palatine tonsils and lingular tonsillar tissue bilaterally which may be reactive or could indicate lymphomatous involvement if the patient does have lymphoma.
3. Rim-enhancing lesions in the right parotid gland. These could be Warthin tumors or potentially necrotic intraparotid lymph nodes related to the previously described process in the neck. Pathology for fine needle aspiration of the left mandible shows an atypical cell population, the atypical cell population is difficult to define. A neoplastic process is favored. While they are fairly large, they are still within the realm of being lymphoid in nature, and they are also discohesive, which also favours of lymphoid neoplasm. He then had a biopsy of the right maxillary alveolar ridge. This was positive for high grade lymphoma most consistent with peripheral T-cell lymphoma.
ASSESSMENT/PLAN:
This is a very pleasant 40-year-old gentleman with certain onset of swelling in his left neck, biopsies consistent with T-cell lymphoma. I plan at this point time is to complete the staging. He will check HTLV-1 serology. We will also send pro for blood for flow cytometry and analysis for atypical cells. We will obtain a CBC, comprehensive metabolic panel and LDH. We will also send his stool for parasites and obtain a PET CT scan. We were to preliminarily stage this he is at least stage 2 lymph nodes in the neck and the axilla seen on skin. On physical exam lymph nodes are palpable in inguinal region. He does have these symptoms with the drenching night sweats and fever. We will also check viral load and hepatitis B and C panel. The patient has not established care with infectious disease physician. We will need to reformed ID as if he true he has HIV positive, we can do some help in coordinating HIV treatment as well as treatment for what appears to be a T-cell lymphoma. Once we get these preliminary labs back then we will discuss the need for bone marrow biopsy and lumbar puncture.

(Medical Transcription Sample Report)
DIAGNOSIS:
Polycythemia vera with secondary myelofibrosis.
REASON FOR VISIT:
Followup of the above condition.
CHIEF COMPLAINT:
Left shin pain.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
A 55-year-old white male who carries a diagnosis of polycythemia vera with secondary myelofibrosis. Diagnosis was made some time in 2005/2006. Initially, he underwent phlebotomy. He subsequently transferred his care here. In the past, he has been on hydroxyurea and interferon but did not tolerate both of them. He is JAK-2 positive. He does not have any siblings for a match-related transplant. He was seen for consideration of a MUD transplant, but was deemed not to be a candidate because of the social support as well as his reasonably good health.
At our institution, the patient received a trial of lenalidomide and prednisone for a short period. He did well with the combination. Subsequently, he developed intolerance to lenalidomide. He complained of severe fatigue and diarrhea. This was subsequently stopped.
The patient reports some injury to his left leg last week. His left leg apparently was swollen. He took steroids for about 3 days and stopped. Left leg swelling has disappeared. The patient denies any other complaints at this point in time. He admits to smoking marijuana. He says this gives him a great appetite and he has actually gained some weight. Performance status in the ECOG scale is 1.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
VITAL SIGNS: He is afebrile. Blood pressure 144/85, pulse 86, weight 61.8 kg, and respiratory rate 18 per minute. GENERAL: He is in no acute distress. HEENT: There is no pallor, icterus or cervical adenopathy that is noted. Oral cavity is normal to exam. CHEST: Clear to auscultation. CARDIOVASCULAR: S1 and S2 normal with regular rate and rhythm. ABDOMEN: Soft and nontender with no hepatomegaly. Spleen is palpable 4 fingerbreadths below the left costal margin. There is no guarding, tenderness, rebound or rigidity noted. Bowel sounds are present. EXTREMITIES: Reveal no edema. Palpation of the left tibia revealed some mild tenderness. However, I do not palpate any bony abnormalities. There is no history of deep venous thrombosis.
LABORATORY DATA:
CBC from today is significant for a white count of 41,900 with an absolute neutrophil count of 34,400, hemoglobin 14.8 with an MCV of 56.7, and platelet count 235,000.
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
1. JAK-2 positive myeloproliferative disorder. The patient has failed pretty much all available options. He is not a candidate for chlorambucil or radioactive phosphorus because of his young age and the concern for secondary malignancy. I have e-mailed Dr. X to see whether he will be a candidate for the LBH trial. Hopefully, we can get a JAK-2 inhibitor trial quickly on board.
2. I am concerned about the risk of thrombosis with his elevated white count. He is on aspirin prophylaxis. The patient has been told to call me with any complaints.
3. Left shin pain. I have ordered x-rays of the left tibia and knee today. The patient will return to the clinic in 3 weeks. He is to call me in the interim for any problems.

Right lung mass invading diaphragm and liver.
FINDINGS:
Right lower lobe lung mass invading diaphragm and liver.

FLUIDS:
Crystalloid 2.7 L and 1 unit packed red blood cells.
ANESTHESIA:
Double-lumen endotracheal tube.
CONDITION:
Stable, extubated, to PACU.
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
Briefly, this is a gentleman who was diagnosed with a B-cell lymphoma and then subsequently on workup noted to have a right-sided mass seeming to arise from the right diaphragm. He was presented at Tumor Board where it was thought upon review that day that he had a right nodular malignant mesothelioma. Thus, he was offered a right thoracotomy and excision of mass with possible reconstruction of the diaphragm. He was explained the risks, benefits, and alternatives to this procedure. He wished to proceed, so he was brought to the operating room.
An epidural catheter was placed. He was put in a supine position where SCDs and Foley catheter were placed. He was put under general endotracheal anesthesia with a double-lumen endotracheal tube. He was given preoperative antibiotics, then he was placed in the left decubitus position, and the area was prepped and draped in the usual fashion.
A low thoracotomy in the 7th interspace was made using the skin knife and then Bovie cautery onto the middle of the rib and then with the Alexander instrument, the chest was entered. Upon entering the chest, the chest wall retractor was inserted and the cavity inspected. It appeared that the mass actually arose more from the right lower lobe and was involving the diaphragm. He also had some marked lymphadenopathy. With these findings, which were thought at that time to be more consistent with a bronchogenic carcinoma, we proceeded with the intent to perform a right lower lobectomy and en bloc diaphragmatic resection. Thus, we mobilized the inferior pulmonary ligament and made our way around the hilum anteriorly and posteriorly. We also worked to open the fissure and tried to identify the arteries going to the superior portion of the right lower lobe and basilar arteries as well as the artery going to the right middle lobe. The posterior portion of the fissure ultimately divided with the single firing of a GIA stapler with a blue load and with the final portion being divided between 2-0 ties. Once we had clearly delineated the arterial anatomy, we were able to pass a right angle around the artery going to the superior segment. This was ligated in continuity with an additional stick tie in the proximal portion of 3-0 silk. This was divided thus revealing a branched artery going to the basilar portion of the right lower lobe. This was also ligated in continuity and actually doubly ligated. Care was taken to preserve the artery to the right and middle lobe.
We then turned our attention once again to the hilum to dissect out the inferior pulmonary vein. The superior pulmonary vein was visualized as well. The right angle was passed around the inferior pulmonary vein, and this was ligated in continuity with 2-0 silk and a 3-0 stick tie. Upon division of this portion, the specimen site had some bleeding, which was eventually controlled using several 3-0 silk sutures. The bronchial anatomy was defined. Next, we identified the bronchus going to the right lower lobe as well as the right middle lobe. A TA-30 4.8 stapler was then closed. The lung insufflated. The right middle lobe and right upper lobe were noted to inflate well. The stapler was fired, and the bronchus was cut with a 10-blade.
We then turned our attention to the diaphragm. There was a small portion of the diaphragm of approximately 4 to 5 cm has involved with tumor, and we bovied around this with at least 1 cm margin. Upon going through the diaphragm, it became clear that the tumor was also involving the dome of the liver, so after going around the diaphragm in its entirety, we proceeded to wedge out the portion of liver that was involved. It seemed that it would be a mucoid shallow portion. The Bovie was set to high cautery. The capsule was entered, and then using Bovie cautery, we wedged out the remaining portion of the tumor with a margin of normal liver. It did leave quite a shallow defect in the liver. Hemostasis was achieved with Bovie cautery and gentle pressure. The specimen was then taken off the table and sent to Pathology for permanent. The area was inspected for hemostasis. A 10-flat JP was placed in the abdomen at the portion of the wedge resection, and 0 Prolene was used to close the diaphragmatic defect, which was under very little tension. A single 32 straight chest tube was also placed. The lung was seen to expand. We also noted that the incomplete fissure between the middle and upper lobes would prevent torsion of the right middle lobe. Hemostasis was observed at the end of the case. The chest tube was irrigated with sterile water, and there was no air leak observed from the bronchial stump. The chest was then closed with Vicryl at the level of the intercostal muscles, staying above the ribs. The 2-0 Vicryl was used for the latissimus dorsi layer and the subcutaneous layer, and 4-0 Monocryl was used to close the skin. The patient was then brought to supine position, extubated, and brought to the recovery room in stable condition.
Dr. X was present for the entirety of the procedure, which was a right thoracotomy, right lower lobectomy with en bloc resection of diaphragm and a portion of liver.

Thyroid mass diagnosed as papillary carcinoma. The patient is a 16-year-old young lady with a history of thyroid mass that is now biopsy proven as papillary. The pattern of miliary metastatic lesions in the chest is consistent with this diagnosis.
(Medical Transcription Sample Report)
REASON FOR CONSULTATION:
Thyroid mass diagnosed as papillary carcinoma.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is a 16-year-old young lady, who was referred from the Pediatric Endocrinology Department by Dr. X for evaluation and surgical recommendations regarding treatment of a mass in her thyroid, which has now been proven to be papillary carcinoma on fine needle aspiration biopsy. The patient's parents relayed that they first noted a relatively small but noticeable mass in the middle portion of her thyroid gland about 2004. An ultrasound examination had reportedly been done in the past and the mass is being observed. When it began to enlarge recently, she was referred to the Pediatric Endocrinology Department and had an evaluation there. The patient was referred for fine needle aspiration and the reports recently returned a diagnosis of papillary thyroid carcinoma. The patient has not had any hoarseness, difficulty swallowing, or any symptoms of endocrine dysfunction. She has no weight changes consistent with either hyper or hypothyroidism. There is no family history of thyroid cancer in her family. She has no notable discomfort with this lesion. There have been no skin changes. Historically, she does not have a history of any prior head and neck radiation or treatment of any unusual endocrinopathy.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
Essentially unremarkable. The patient has never been hospitalized in the past for any major illnesses. She has had no prior surgical procedures.
IMMUNIZATIONS:
Current and up to date.
ALLERGIES:
She has no known drug allergies.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS:
Currently taking no routine medications. She describes her pain level currently as zero.
FAMILY HISTORY:
There is no significant family history, although the patient's father does note that his mother had a thyroid surgery at some point in life, but it was not known whether this was for cancer, but he suspects it might have been for goiter. This was done in Tijuana. His mom is from central portion of Mexico. There is no family history of multiple endocrine neoplasia syndromes.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
The patient is a junior at Hoover High School. She lives with her mom in Fresno.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
A careful 12-system review was completely normal except for the problems related to the thyroid mass.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
GENERAL: The patient is a 55.7 kg, nondysmorphic, quiet, and perhaps slightly apprehensive young lady, who was in no acute distress. She was alert and oriented x3 and had an appropriate affect.
HEENT: The head and neck examination is most significant. There is mild amount of facial acne. The patient's head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat appeared to be grossly normal.
NECK: There is a slightly visible midline bulge in the region of the thyroid isthmus. A firm nodule is present there, and there is also some nodularity in the right lobe of the thyroid. This mass is relatively hard, slightly fixed, but not tethered to surrounding tissues, skin, or muscles that I can determine. There are some shotty adenopathy in the area. No supraclavicular nodes were noted.
CHEST: Excursions are symmetric with good air entry.
LUNGS: Clear.
CARDIOVASCULAR: Normal. There is no tachycardia or murmur noted.
ABDOMEN: Benign.
EXTREMITIES: Extremities are anatomically correct with full range of motion.
GENITOURINARY: External genitourinary exam was deferred at this time and can be performed later during anesthesia. This is same as too for her rectal examination.
SKIN: There is no acute rash, purpura, or petechiae.
NEUROLOGIC: Normal and no focal deficits. Her voice is strong and clear. There is no evidence of dysphonia or vocal cord malfunction.
DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES:
I reviewed laboratory data from the Diagnostics Lab, which included a mild abnormality in the AST at 11, which is slightly lower than the normal range. T4 and TSH levels were recorded as normal. Free thyroxine was normal, and the serum pregnancy test was negative. There was no level of thyroglobulin recorded on this. A urinalysis and comprehensive metabolic panel was unremarkable. A chest x-ray was obtained, which I personally reviewed. There is a diffuse pattern of tiny nodules in both lungs typical of miliary metastatic disease that is often seen in patients with metastatic thyroid carcinoma.
IMPRESSION/PLAN:
The patient is a 16-year-old young lady with a history of thyroid mass that is now biopsy proven as papillary. The pattern of miliary metastatic lesions in the chest is consistent with this diagnosis and is unfortunate in that it generally means a more advanced stage of disease. I spent approximately 30 minutes with the patient and her family today discussing the surgical aspects of the treatment of this disease. During this time, we talked about performing a total thyroidectomy to eradicate as much of the native thyroid tissue and remove the primary source of the cancer in anticipation of radioactive iodine therapy. We talked about sentinel node dissection, and we spent significant amount of time talking about the possibility of hypoparathyroidism if all four of the parathyroid glands were damaged during this operation. We also discussed the recurrent laryngeal and external laryngeal branches of the nerve supplying the vocal cord function and how they cane be damaged during the thyroidectomy as well. I answered as many of the family's questions as they could mount during this stressful time with this recent information supplied to them. I also did talk to them about the chest x-ray pattern, which was complete __________ as the film was just on the day prior to my clinic visit. This will have some impact on the postoperative adjunctive therapy. The radiologist commented about the risk of pulmonary fibrosis and the use of radioactive iodine in this situation, but it seems likely that is going to be necessary to attempt to treat this disease in the patient's case. I did discuss with them the possibility of having to take large doses of calcium and vitamin D in the event of hypoparathyroidism if that does happen, and we also talked about possibly sparing parathyroid tissue and reimplanting it in a muscle belly either in the neck or forearm if that becomes a necessity. All of the family's questions have been answered. This is a very anxious and anxiety provoking time in the family. I have made every effort to get the patient under schedule within the next 48 hours to have this operation done. We are tentatively planning on proceeding this upcoming Friday afternoon with total thyroidectomy.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
She is a very pleasant 59-year-old nurse with a history of breast cancer. She was initially diagnosed in June 1994. Her previous treatments included Zometa, Faslodex, and Aromasin. She was found to have disease progression first noted by rising tumor markers. PET/CT scan revealed metastatic disease and she was enrolled in clinical trial of CTSU/C40502. She was randomized to the ixabepilone plus Avastin. She experienced dose-limiting toxicity with the fourth cycle. The Ixempra was skipped on day 1 and day 8. She then had a dose reduction and has been tolerating treatment well with the exception of progressive neuropathy. Early in the month she had concerned about possible perforated septum. She was seen by ENT urgently. She was found to have nasal septum intact. She comes into clinic today for day eight Ixempra.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS:
Zometa monthly, calcium with Vitamin D q.d., multivitamin q.d., Ambien 5 mg q.h.s., Pepcid AC 20 mg q.d., Effexor 112 mg q.d., Lyrica 100 mg at bedtime, Tylenol p.r.n., Ultram p.r.n., Mucinex one to two tablets b.i.d., Neosporin applied to the nasal mucosa b.i.d. nasal rinse daily.
ALLERGIES:
Compazine.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
The patient is comfort in knowing that she does not have a septal perforation. She has progressive neuropathy and decreased sensation in her fingertips. She makes many errors when keyboarding. I would rate her neuropathy as grade 2. She continues to have headaches respond to Ultram which she takes as needed. She occasionally reports pain in her right upper quadrant as well as right sternum. He denies any fevers, chills, or night sweats. Her diarrhea has finally resolved and her bowels are back to normal. The rest of her review of systems is negative.
PHYSICAL EXAM:
VITALS: BP: 113/63. HEART RATE: 84. TEMP: 99. Weight: 67.8 kg. Her performance status is 1.
GEN: She looks well, in no acute distress.
HEENT: Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. Sclerae are anicteric. Her oropharynx is clear.
NECK: Supple. She has no cervical or supraclavicular adenopathy.
LUNGS: Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
CV: Regular rate; normal S1, S2, no murmurs.
ABDOMEN: Soft. She has positive bowel sounds. No hepatosplenomegaly.
EXT: Lower extremities are without edema.
LABORATORY DATA:
White blood cell count is 7.6, hemoglobin 12.6, hematocrit 37.5, and platelets 287,000.
ASSESSMENT/PLAN:
This is a very pleasant 59-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer. She is enrolled in clinical trial C40502. She has completed nine cycles of chemotherapy with Ixempra plus Avastin. First we thought she might suffered a perforated septum which would bring up concerns with the Avastin. There have been isolated cases reported of nasal septum perforation that is thought to be related to the Avastin. She was noted to have a thin septum but it is intact. We will continue her treatment as planned. I will see her clinic in four weeks.

PROSTATE BRACHYTHERAPY - PROSTATE I-125 IMPLANTATION
This patient will be treated to the prostate with ultrasound-guided I-125 seed implantation. The original consultation and treatment planning will be separately performed. At the time of the implantation, special coordination will be required. Stepping ultrasound will be performed and utilized in the pre-planning process. Some discrepancies are frequently identified, based on the positioning, edema, and/or change in the tumor since the pre-planning process. Re-assessment is required at the time of surgery, evaluating the pre-plan and comparing to the stepping ultrasound. Modifications will be made in real time to add or subtract needles and seeds as required. This may be integrated with the loading of the seeds performed by the brachytherapist, as well as coordinated with the urologist, dosimetrist or physicist.
The brachytherapy must be customized to fit the individual's tumor and prostate. Attention is given both preoperatively and intraoperatively to avoid overdosage of rectum and bladder.

Axillary Dissection & Mass Excision
Description:
Left axillary dissection with incision and drainage of left axillary mass. Right axillary mass excision and incision and drainage. Bilateral axillary masses, rule out recurrent Hodgkin's disease.
(Medical Transcription Sample Report)
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Bilateral axillary masses, rule out recurrent Hodgkin's disease.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Bilateral axillary masses, rule out recurrent Hodgkin's disease.
PROCEDURE PERFORMED:
1. Left axillary dissection with incision and drainage of left axillary mass.
2. Right axillary mass excision and incision and drainage.
ANESTHESIA:
LMA.
SPECIMENS:
Left axillary mass with nodes and right axillary mass.
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:
Less than 30 cc.
INDICATION:
This 56-year-old male presents to surgical office with history of bilateral axillary masses. Upon evaluation, it was noted that the patient has draining bilateral masses with the left mass being approximately 8 cm in diameter upon palpation and the right being approximately 4 cm in diameter. The patient had been continued on antibiotics preoperatively. The patient with history of Hodgkin's lymphoma approximately 18 years ago and underwent therapy at that time and he was declared free of disease since that time. Consent for possible recurrence of Hodgkin's lymphoma warranted exploration and excision of these masses. The patient was explained the risks and benefits of the procedure and informed consent was obtained.
GROSS FINDINGS:
Upon dissection of the left axillary mass, the mass was removed in toto and noted to have a cavity within it consistent with an abscess.
No loose structures were identified and sent for frozen section, which upon intraoperative consultation with Pathology Department revealed no obvious evidence of lymphoma, however, the confirmed pathology report is pending at this time. The right axillary mass was excised without difficulty without requiring full axillary dissection.
PROCEDURE:
The patient was placed in supine position after appropriate anesthesia was obtained and a sterile prep and drape complete. A #10 blade scalpel was used to make an elliptical incision about the mass itself extending this incision further to aid in the mobilization of the mass. Sharp dissection was utilized with Metzenbaum scissors about the mass to maintain the injury to the skin structure and upon showing out the mass, Bovie electrocautery was utilized adjacent to the wall structure to maintain hemostasis. Identification of the axillary anatomy was made and care was made to avoid injury to nerve, vessel or musculature. Once this mass was removed in toto, lymph node structures were as well delivered with this mass and sent to frozen section as well the specimen was sent to gram stain and culture. Upon revaluation of the incisional site, it was noted to be hemostatic. Warm lap sponge was then left in place at this site. Next, attention was turned to the right axilla where a #10 blade scalpel was used to make a 4 cm incision about the mass including the cutaneous structures involved with the erythematous reaction. This was as well removed in toto and sent to Pathology for gram stain and culture as well as pathologic evaluation. This site was then made hemostatic as well with the aid of Bovie electrocautery and approximation of the deep dermal tissues after irrigation with warm saline was then done with #3-0 Vicryl suture followed by #4-0 Vicryl running subcuticular stitch. Steri-Strips were applied. Attention was returned back left axilla, which upon re-exploration was noted to be hemostatic and a #7 mm JP was then introduced making a skin stab inferior to the incision and bringing the end of the drain through this incision. This was placed within the incision site, ________ drainage of the axillary potential space. Approximation of the deep dermal tissues were then done with #3-0 Vicryl in an interrupted technique followed by #4-0 Vicryl with running subcuticular technique. Steri-Strips and sterile dressings were applied. JP bulb was then placed to suction and sterile dressings were applied to both axilla. The patient tolerated the procedure well and sent to postanesthesia care unit in a stable condition. He will be discharged to home upon ability of the patient to have pain tolerance with Vicodin 1-2 as needed every six hours for pain and continue on Keflex antibiotics until gram stain culture proves otherwise.

Lymphoblastic Leukemia - Consult
Description:
Newly diagnosed high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia; extensive deep vein thrombosis, and pharmacologic thrombolysis following placement of a vena caval filter.
(Medical Transcription Sample Report)
CHIEF COMPLAINT:
Newly diagnosed high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia; extensive deep vein thrombosis, right iliac vein and inferior vena cava (IVC), status post balloon angioplasty, and mechanical and pharmacologic thrombolysis following placement of a vena caval filter.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient was transferred here the evening of 02/23/2007 from Hospital with a new diagnosis of high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia based on confirmation by flow cytometry of peripheral blood lymphoblasts that afternoon. History related to this illness probably dates back to October of 2006 when he had onset of swelling and discomfort in the left testicle with what he described as a residual ""lump"" posteriorly. The left testicle has continued to be painful off and on since. In early November, he developed pain in the posterior part of his upper right leg, which he initially thought was related to skateboarding and muscle strain. Physical therapy was prescribed and the discomfort temporarily improved. In December, he noted onset of increasing fatigue. He used to work out regularly, lifting lifts, doing abdominal exercises, and playing basketball and found he did not have energy to pursue these activities. He has lost 10 pounds since December and feels his appetite has decreased. Night sweats and cough began in December, for which he was treated with a course of Augmentin. However, both of these problems have continued. He also began taking Accutane for persistent acne in December (this agent was stopped on 02/19/2007). Despite increasing fatigue and lethargy, he continues his studies at University of Denver, has a biology major (he aspires to be an ophthalmologist).
The morning of 02/19/2007, he awakened with severe right inguinal and right lower quadrant pain. He was seen in Emergency Room where it was noted that he had an elevated WBC of 18,000. CT scan of the abdomen was obtained to rule out possible appendicitis and on that CT, a large clot in the inferior vena cava extending to the right iliac and femoral veins was found. He promptly underwent appropriate treatment in interventional radiology with the above-noted angioplasty and placement of a vena caval filter followed by mechanical and pharmacologic thrombolysis. Repeat ultrasound there on 02/20/2007 showed no evidence of deep venous thrombosis (DVT). Continuous intravenous unfractionated heparin infusion was continued. Because there was no obvious cause of this extensive thrombosis, occult malignancy was suspected. Appropriate blood studies were obtained and he underwent a PET/CT scan as part of his diagnostic evaluation. This study showed moderately increased diffuse bone marrow metabolic activity. Because the WBC continued to rise and showed a preponderance of lymphocytes, the smear was reviewed by pathologist, Sheryl Asplund, M.D., and flow cytometry was performed on the peripheral blood. These studies became available the afternoon of 02/23/2007, and confirmed the diagnosis of precursor-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The patient was transferred here after stopping of the continuous infusion heparin and receiving a dose of Lovenox 60 mg subcutaneously for further diagnostic evaluation and management of the acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).
ALLERGIES:
NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES. HE DOES SEEM TO REACT TO CERTAIN ADHESIVES.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS:
1. Lovenox 60 mg subcutaneously q.12h. initiated.
2. Coumadin 5 mg p.o., was administered on 02/19/2007 and 02/22/2007.
3. Protonix 40 mg intravenous (IV) daily.
4. Vicodin p.r.n.
5. Levaquin 750 mg IV on 02/23/2007.

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:
1. Mass, left second toe.
2. Tumor.
3. Left hallux with bone invasion of the distal phalanx.
PROCEDURE PERFORMED:
1. Excision of mass, left second toe.
2. Distal Syme's amputation, left hallux with excisional biopsy.
HISTORY:
This 47-year-old Caucasian male presents to ABCD General Hospital with a history of tissue mass on his left foot. The patient states that the mass has been present for approximately two weeks and has been rapidly growing in size. The patient also has history of shave biopsy in the past. The patient does state that he desires surgical excision at this time.
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:
An IV was instituted by the Department of Anesthesia in the preoperative holding area. The patient was transported from the operating room and placed on the operating room table in the supine position with the safety belt across his lap. Copious amount of Webril was placed around the left ankle followed by a blood pressure cuff. After adequate sedation by the Department of Anesthesia, a total of 6 cc mixed with 1% lidocaine plain with 0.5% Marcaine plain was injected in a digital block fashion at the base of the left hallux as well as the left second toe.
The foot was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile orthopedic fashion. The foot was elevated from the operating table and exsanguinated with an Esmarch bandage. Care was taken with the exsanguination to perform exsanguination below the level of the digits so as not to rupture the masses. The foot was lowered to the operating table. The stockinet was reflected and the foot was cleansed with wet and dry sponge. A distal Syme's incision was planned over the distal aspect of the left hallux. The incision was performed with a #10 blade and deepened with #15 down to the level of bone. The dorsal skin flap was removed and dissected in toto off of the distal phalanx. There was noted to be in growth of the soft tissue mass into the dorsal cortex with erosion in the dorsal cortex and exposure of cortical bone at the distal phalanx. The tissue was sent to Pathology where Dr. Green stated that a frozen sample would be of less use for examining for cancer. Dr. Green did state that he felt that there was an adequate incomplete excision of the soft tissue for specimen. At this time, a sagittal saw was then used to resect all ends of bone of the distal phalanx. The area was inspected for any remaining suspicious tissues. Any suspicious tissue was removed. The area was then flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline. The skin was then reapproximated with #4-0 nylon with a combination of simple and vertical mattress sutures.
Attention was then directed to the left second toe. There was noted to be a dorsolateral mass over the dorsal distal aspect of the left second toe. A linear incision was made just medial to the tissue mass. The mass was then dissected from the overlying skin and off of the underlying capsule. This tissue mass was hard, round, and pearly-gray in appearance. It does not invade into any other surrounding tissues. The area was then flushed with copious amounts of sterile saline and the skin was closed with #4-0 nylon. Dressings consisted of Owen silk soaked in Betadine, 4x4s, Kling, Kerlix, and an Ace wrap. The pneumatic ankle tourniquet was released and immediate hyperemic flush was noted to all five digits of the left foot. The patient tolerated the above procedure and anesthesia well without complications. The patient was transported to PACU with vital signs stable and vascular status intact. The patient was given postoperative pain prescription for Vicodin and instructed to follow up with Dr. Bonnani in his office as directed. The patient will be contacted immediately pending the results of pathology. Cultures obtained in the case were aerobic and anaerobic gram stain, Silver stain, and a CBC.

She would like to go slightly smaller than her current size as she has ptosis going with a smaller implant combined with capsulectomy will result in worsening of her ptosis. She may require a lift. She is not consenting to lift due to the surgical scars.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY
Significant for deep venous thrombosis and acid reflux.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY
Significant for appendectomy, colonoscopy and BAM.
MEDICATIONS
1. Coumadin. She stopped her Coumadin five days prior to the procedures.
2. Lipitor
3. Effexor.
4. Klonopin.
ALLERGIES
None.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS
Negative for dyspnea on exertion, palpitations, chest pain, and phlebitis.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
VITAL SIGNS: Height 5'8"", weight 155 pounds.
FACE: Examination of the face demonstrates basal cell carcinoma, right and left cheek. No lesions are noted in the regional lymph node base and no mass is appreciated.
BREAST: Examination of the breast demonstrates bilateral grade IV capsular contracture. She has asymmetry in distortion of the breast. No masses are appreciated in the breast or the axilla. The implants appear to be subglandular.
CHEST: Clear to auscultation and percussion.
CARDIOVASCULAR: Regular rate and rhythm.
EXTREMITIES: Show full range of motion. No clubbing, cyanosis or edema.
SKIN: Significant environmental actinic skin damage.
I recommended excision of basal cell cancers with frozen section control of the margin, closure will require local tissue flaps. I recommended exchange of the implants with reaugmentation. No final size is guaranteed or implied. We will decrease the size of the implants based on the intraoperative findings as the size is not known. Several options are available. Sizer implants will be placed to best estimate postoperative size. Ptosis will be worse following capsulectomy and going with a smaller implant. She may require a lift in the future. We have obtained preoperative clearance from the patient's cardiologist, Dr. K. The patient has been taken off Coumadin for five days and will be placed back on Coumadin the day after the surgery. The risk of deep venous thrombosis is discussed. Other risk including bleeding, infection, allergic reaction, pain, scarring, hypertrophic scarring and poor cosmetic resolve, worsening of ptosis, exposure, extrusion, the rupture of the implants, numbness of the nipple-areolar complex, hematoma, need for additional surgery, recurrent capsular contracture and recurrence of the skin cancer was all discussed, which she understands and informed consent is obtained.
PROCEDURE IN DETAIL
After appropriate informed consent was obtained, the patient was placed in the preoperative holding area with **** input. She was then taken to the major operating room with ABCD Surgery Center, placed in a supine position. Intravenous antibiotics were given. TED hose and SCDs were placed. After the induction of adequate general endotracheal anesthesia, she was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. Sites for excision and skin cancers were carefully marked with 5 mm margin. These were injected with 1% lidocaine with epinephrine.
After allowing adequate time for basal constriction hemostasis, excision was performed, full thickness of the skin. They were tagged at the 12 o'clock position and sent for frozen section. Hemostasis was achieved using electrocautery. Once margins were determined to be free of involvement, local tissue flaps were designed for advancement. Undermining was performed. Hemostasis was achieved using electrocautery. Closure was performed under moderate tension with interrupted 5-0 Vicryl. Skin was closed under loop magnification paying meticulous attention and cosmetic details with 6-0 Prolene. Attention was then turned to the breast, clothes were changed, gloves were changed, incision was planned and the previous inframammary incision beginning on the right incision was made. Dissection was carried down to the capsule. It was extremely calcified. Dissection of the anterior surface of the capsule was performed. The implant was subglandular, the capsule was entered, implant was noted to be grossly intact; however, there was free silicone. Implant was removed and noted to be ruptured. No marking as to the size of the implant was found.
Capsulectomy was performed leaving a small portion in the axilla in the inframammary fold. Pocket was modified to medialize the implant by placing 2-0 Prolene laterally in mattress sutures to restrict the pocket. In identical fashion, capsulectomy was performed on the left. Implant was noted to be grossly ruptured. No marking was found for the size of the implant. The entire content was weighed and found to be 350 grams. Right side was weighed and noted to be 338 grams, although some silicone was lost in the transfer and most likely was identical 350 grams. The implants appeared to be double lumen with the saline portion deflated. Completion of the capsulectomy was performed on the left.
The pocket was again fashioned to improve symmetry with the right with Prolene. Pockets were thoroughly irrigated. Hemostasis was achieved using electrocautery, checked for symmetry, which is determined to be excellent. Several liters of normal saline were utilized to irrigate the pocket. Hemostasis was determined to be excellent. Drains were placed. 2-0 Vicryl sutures were preplaced. Pockets were checked for hemostasis, irrigated with normal saline, sizing was performed with placement of 275 cc implants. She was placed in a sitting position. This significantly worsened ptosis and for this reason, 325 cc implants were chosen. She is placed back in a supine position. Pockets were irrigated with antibiotic solution, 2-0 Vicryl sutures were preplaced and gloves were changed. The patient was reprepped with Betadine, towels were changed.
These were soaked in antibiotic solution. Gloves were changed, gowns were changed, the patient was reprepped, towels were changed and implants were placed. The patient was placed in a sitting position. Symmetry was excellent. There was noted to be a decrease of volume of approximately 40 cc from the capsulectomy as well as the additional reduction of 25 cc. Ptosis was slightly worse; however, excellent shape of the breast. She was placed back in a supine position, preplaced 2-0 Vicryl sutures were tied; a second layer subcutaneous of 3-0 Vicryl was placed followed by a third of 4-0 Vicryl. The skin was closed with a running 4-0 Prolene. Drains were secured. All sponge and needle counts were correct. Dressing was applied.
COMPLICATIONS
None.

(Medical Transcription Sample Report)
CHIEF COMPLAINT:
1. Extensive stage small cell lung cancer.
2. Chemotherapy with carboplatin and etoposide.
3. Left scapular pain status post CT scan of the thorax.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with extensive stage small cell lung cancer. She is currently receiving treatment with carboplatin and etoposide. She completed her fifth cycle on 08/12/10. She has had ongoing back pain and was sent for a CT scan of the thorax. She comes into clinic today accompanied by her daughters to review the results.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS:
Levothyroxine 88 mcg daily, Soriatane 25 mg daily, Timoptic 0.5% solution b.i.d., Vicodin 5/500 mg one to two tablets q.6 hours p.r.n.
ALLERGIES:
No known drug allergies.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
The patient continues to have back pain some time she also take two pain pill. She received platelet transfusion the other day and reported mild fever. She denies any chills, night sweats, chest pain, or shortness of breath. The rest of her review of systems is negative.
PHYSICAL EXAM:
VITALS: BP: 118/60. HEART RATE: 76. TEMP: 97.8. Weight: 65.5 kg.
GEN: She looks well, in no acute distress.
HEENT: Her pupils were noted for surgical changes bilaterally. Oropharynx is clear.
NECK: Supple. She has no cervical or supraclavicular adenopathy.
LUNGS: Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
CV: Regular rate; normal S1, S2, no murmurs.
ABDOMEN: Soft. He has positive bowel sounds.
EXT: Lower extremities are without edema.
IMAGING:
Her CT scan shows a pleural base mass in the left apex appears to have some growth along the medial margin comparing with PET/CT assessment 07/08/10. While this extends to the pleural surface it does not clearly invade directly into the chest wall or the adjacent posterior lateral left third rib. Left suprahilar and mediastinal adenopathy appears to be essentially stable since 07/08/10. Multilevel thoracic bony metastatic disease is present. Hypodense liver metastasis appears slightly improved comparing with July, more substantially improved comparing with chest CT of 04/21/10.
ASSESSMENT/PLAN:
This is a very pleasant female 67-year-old female with extensive stage small cell lung cancer. She had one treatment postponed due to counts. She had low blood counts this week requiring platelet transfusion, so we are going to dose reduce for six treatments by 10%. As far as the back pain, she clearly has evidence of progressive bone metastasis in T3, T11, T12, and T1 and questions about the soft tissue mass pleural base mass in the lateral left apex. I am going to refer back to Dr. X to see if there might be some palliative radiation to deal with the left back and scapular region.

Neck Mass Biopsy
Description:
Malignant mass of the left neck, squamous cell carcinoma. Left neck mass biopsy and selective surgical neck dissection, left.
(Medical Transcription Sample Report)
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Malignant mass of the left neck.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Malignant mass of the left neck, squamous cell carcinoma.
PROCEDURES
1. Left neck mass biopsy.
2. Selective surgical neck dissection, left.
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:
After obtaining an informed, the patient was taken to the operating room where a time-out process was followed. Preoperative antibiotic was given and Dr. X proceeded to intubate the patient after a detailed anesthetic preparation that started in the Same Day Surgery and followed in the operating room. Finally, a 5.5-French endotracheal tube was inserted and the patient was able to tolerate that and did have stable vital signs and a proper oxygenation.
Then, the patient was positioned with the neck slightly distended and turned toward the opposite side of the operation. The neck was prepped and draped in the usual fashion. I proceeded to mark the site of the mass and then also to mark the proposed site for the creation of a flap. Then, I performed an extensive anesthetic block of the area.
Then, an incision was made along the area marked for development of the flap, but in a very limited extent, just to expose the cervical mass. The cervical mass, which was about 4 cm in diameter and very firm and rubbery, was found lodged between the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the internal jugular vein in the area III of the neck. A wedge sample was sent to Pathology for frozen section. At the same time, we waited for the result and the initial report was not clear in the sense that a lot of lymphoepithelial reaction was seen. Therefore, a larger sample was sent to Pathology and at that particular time, the fresh frozen was reported as having squamous elements. This was not totally clear in my mind and therefore I proceeded to excise the full mass, which luckily was not attached to any structures except in the very deep surface. There, there were some attachments to branches of the external carotid artery, which had to be suture ligated. At any rate, the whole specimen was to the lab and finally the diagnosis was that of a metastatic squamous cell carcinoma.
With that information in hand, we proceeded to continue with a neck dissection and proceeded to make an incision along the previously marked sites of the flap, which basically involved a reverse U shape on the left neck. This worked out quite nicely. The external jugular vein was out of the way, so initially we did not deal with it. We proceeded to tackle the area III and extended into II-A. When we excised the mass, the upper end was in intimate relationship with the parotid gland, which was relatively large in this patient, but it looked normal otherwise. Also, I felt that the submaxillary gland was enlarged. At any rate, we decided to clean up the areas III and IV and a few nodes from II-A that were removed, and then we went into the posterior triangle where we identified the spinal accessory nerve, which we protected, actually did not even dissect close to it.
The same nerve had been already identified anterior to the internal jugular vein, very proximally behind the digastric and the sternocleidomastoid muscle. At any rate, there were large nodes in the posterior triangle, in areas V-A and V-B, which were excised and sent to Pathology for examination. Also, there was a remnant of a capsule of the main mass that we proceeded to excise and sent to Pathology as an extra specimen. Hemostasis was revised and found to be adequate. The flaps had been protected by folding it to the chest and protected by wet sponges on both sides of the flap. The flap was replaced in its position. A soft Jackson-Pratt catheter was left in the area, and then we proceeded to approximate the flap with a number of subcutaneous sutures of Vicryl and then running sutures of subcuticular Monocryl to the skin. I would like to mention that also the facial vein was excised and the external jugular vein was ligated. It was in very lateral location and it was on the site of the drain, so we ligated that but did not excise it. A pressure dressing was applied.
The patient tolerated the procedure well. Estimated blood loss was no more than 100 mL. The patient was extubated in the operating room and sent for recovery.

Description:
Newly diagnosed mantle cell lymphoma, admitted now to start chemotherapy. She will start treatment with hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, dexamethasone.
(Medical Transcription Sample Report)
CHIEF COMPLAINT:
Newly diagnosed mantle cell lymphoma.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is a 47-year-old woman who presented with abdominal pain in September 2006. On chest x-ray, she had a possible infiltrate and it was thought she might have pneumonia and she was treated with antibiotics and prednisone. Symptoms improved temporarily, but did not completely resolve. By the end of September, her pain had worsened and she was seen in the emergency room at ABC. Chest x-ray was compatible with pleurisy and she was treated with Percocet. Few days later, she was seen and given a prescription for Ultram because Percocet was causing nausea. Eventually, she was seen by Dr. X and noted to have splenomegaly. Repeat ultrasound was done and showed the spleen enlarged at 19 cm. In retrospect, this was not changed in comparison to an ultrasound that was done in September. She underwent positron emission tomography (PET) scanning, which showed diffuse hypermetabolic lymph nodes measuring 1 to 2 cm in diameter, as well as a hypermetabolic spleen that was enlarged.
The patient underwent lymph node biopsy on the right neck on 10/27/2006. Pathology is consistent with mantle cell lymphoma.
On 10/31/2006, she had a bone marrow biopsy. This does show involvement of bone marrow with lymphoma.
She was noted to have circulating lymphoma cells on peripheral smear as well.
Although CBC was normal, MCV was low and the ferritin was assessed and was low at 8, consistent with iron deficiency.
ALLERGIES:
NONE.
MEDICATIONS:
1. Estradiol/Prometrium.
2. Ultram p.r.n.
3. Baby aspirin.
4. Lunesta for sleep.
5. She has been started on iron supplements.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Tubal ligation in 1986.
2. Possible cyst removed from the left neck in 1991.
3. Tonsillectomy.
4. Migraines, which are rare.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
She does not smoke cigarettes and drinks alcohol only occasionally. She is married and has two children, ages 24 and 20. She works as a project administrator.
FAMILY HISTORY:
Father is deceased. He had emphysema and colon cancer at age 68. Mother has arrhythmia and hypertension. Her sister has hypertension and her brother is healthy.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
GENERAL: She is in no acute distress.
VITAL SIGNS: Her weight is 168 pounds, and she is afebrile with a normal blood pressure and pulse.
HEENT: The oropharynx is benign.
SKIN: The skin is warm and dry and shows no jaundice.
NECK: There is shotty adenopathy in the neck.
CARDIAC: Regular rate without murmur.
LUNGS: Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
ABDOMEN: Soft and nontender and shows the spleen palpable about 10 cm below the right costal margin.
EXTREMITIES: No peripheral edema is noted.
LABORATORY DATA:
CBC and chemistry panel are pending. CBC was normal last week. PT/INR was normal as well.
IMPRESSION:
Newly diagnosed mantle cell lymphoma, admitted now to start chemotherapy. She will start treatment with hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, dexamethasone. Toxicities have already been discussed with her including myelosuppression, mucositis, diarrhea, nausea, alopecia, the low risk for cardiac toxicity, bladder toxicity, neuropathy, constipation, etc. Written materials were provided to her last week.
PLAN:
Plan will be to add Rituxan a little later in her course because she has circulating lymphoma cells. She will be started on allopurinol today as well as hydration further to avoid the possibility of tumor lysis syndrome.
Plan will be to have her evaluated for bone marrow transplant in first remission. I will have Dr. Y see her while she is in the hospital.
The patient is anxious, and will be given Ativan as needed. We will discontinue aspirin for now, but continue estradiol/Prometrium.
Iron deficiency will be treated with oral iron supplements and we will follow her counts. She may well have gastrointestinal (GI) involvement, which is not uncommon with mantle cell lymphoma. After she undergoes remission, we will consider colonoscopy for biopsies prior to proceeding to transplant.

CONCOMITANT CHEMORADIOTHERAPY FOR CURATIVE INTENT PATIENTS
This patient is receiving combined radiotherapy and chemotherapy in an effort to maximize the chance of control of this cancer. The chemotherapy is given in addition to the radiotherapy, not only to act as a cytotoxic agent on its own, but also to potentiate and enhance the effect of radiotherapy on tumor cells. It has been shown in the literature that this will maximize the chance of control.
During the course of the treatment, the patient's therapy must be closely monitored by the attending physician to be sure that the proper chemotherapy drugs are given at the proper time during the radiotherapy course. It is also important to closely monitor the patient to know when treatment with either chemotherapy or radiotherapy needs to be held. This combined treatment usually produces greater side effects than either treatment alone, and these need to be constantly monitored and treatment initiated on a timely basis to minimize these effects. In accordance, this requires more frequency consultation and coordination with the medical oncologist. Therefore, this becomes a very time intensive treatment and justifies CPT Code 77470.

Colon Cancer Consult
Description:
Newly diagnosed stage II colon cancer, with a stage T3c, N0, M0 colon cancer, grade 1. Although, the tumor was near obstructing, she was not having symptoms and in fact was having normal bowel movements.
(Medical Transcription Sample Report)
REASON FOR CONSULTATION:
I was asked by Dr. X to see the patient in consultation for a new diagnosis of colon cancer.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient presented to medical attention after she noticed mild abdominal cramping in February 2007. At that time, she was pregnant and was unsure if her symptoms might have been due to the pregnancy. Unfortunately, she had miscarriage at about seven weeks. She again had abdominal cramping, severe, in late March 2007. She underwent colonoscopy on 04/30/2007 by Dr. Y. Of note, she is with a family history of early colon cancers and had her first colonoscopy at age 35 and no polyps were seen at that time.
On colonoscopy, she was found to have a near-obstructing lesion at the splenic flexure. She was not able to have the scope passed past this lesion. Pathology showed a colon cancer, although I do not have a copy of that report at this time.
She had surgical resection done yesterday. The surgery was laparoscopic assisted with anastomosis. At the time of surgery, lymph nodes were palpable.
Pathology showed colon adenocarcinoma, low grade, measuring 3.8 x 1.7 cm, circumferential and invading in to the subserosal mucosa greater than 5 mm, 13 lymph nodes were negative for metastasis. There was no angiolymphatic invasion noted. Radial margin was 0.1 mm. Other margins were 5 and 6 mm. Testing for microsatellite instability is still pending.
Staging has already been done with a CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. This showed a mass at the splenic flexure, mildly enlarged lymph nodes there, and no evidence of metastasis to liver, lungs, or other organs. The degenerative changes were noted at L5-S1. The ovaries were normal. An intrauterine device (IUD) was present in the uterus.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:
She has otherwise been feeling well. She has not had fevers, night sweats, or noticed lymphadenopathy. She has not had cough, shortness of breath, back pain, bone pain, blood in her stool, melena, or change in stool caliber. She was eating well up until the time of her surgery. She is up-to-date on mammography, which will be due again in June. She has no history of pulmonary, cardiac, renal, hepatic, thyroid, or central nervous system (CNS) disease.
ALLERGIES:
PENICILLIN, WHICH CAUSED HIVES WHEN SHE WAS A CHILD.
MEDICATIONS PRIOR TO ADMISSION:
None.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
No significant medical problem. She has had three miscarriages, all of them at about seven weeks. She has no prior surgeries.
SOCIAL HISTORY:
She smoked cigarettes socially while in her 20s. A pack of cigarettes would last for more than a week. She does not smoke now. She has two glasses of wine per day, both red and white wine. She is married and has no children. An IUD was recently placed. She works as an esthetician.
FAMILY HISTORY:
Father died of stage IV colon cancer at age 45. This occurred when the patient was young and she is not sure of the rest of the paternal family history. She does believe that aunts and uncles on that side may have died early. Her brother died of pancreas cancer at age 44. Another brother is aged 52 and he had polyps on colonoscopy a couple of years ago. Otherwise, he has no medical problem. Mother is aged 82 and healthy. She was recently diagnosed with hemochromatosis.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
GENERAL: She is in no acute distress.
VITAL SIGNS: The patient is afebrile with a pulse of 78, respirations 16, blood pressure 124/70, and pulse oximetry is 93% on 3 L of oxygen by nasal cannula.
SKIN: Warm and dry. She has no jaundice.
LYMPHATICS: No cervical or supraclavicular lymph nodes are palpable.
LUNGS: There is no respiratory distress.
CARDIAC: Regular rate.
ABDOMEN: Soft and mildly tender. Dressings are clean and dry.
EXTREMITIES: No peripheral edema is noted. Sequential compression devices (SCDs) are in place.
LABORATORY DATA:
White blood count of 11.7, hemoglobin 12.8, hematocrit 37.8, platelets 408, differential shows left shift, MCV is 99.6. Sodium is 136, potassium 4.1, bicarb 25, chloride 104, BUN 5, creatinine 0.7, and glucose is 133. Calcium is 8.8 and magnesium is 1.8.
IMPRESSION AND PLAN:
Newly diagnosed stage II colon cancer, with a stage T3c, N0, M0 colon cancer, grade 1. She does not have high-risk factors such as high grade or angiolymphatic invasion, and adequate number of lymph nodes were sampled. Although, the tumor was near obstructing, she was not having symptoms and in fact was having normal bowel movements.
A lengthy discussion was held with the patient regarding her diagnosis and prognosis. Firstly, she has a good prognosis for being cured without adjuvant therapy. I would consider her borderline for chemotherapy given her young age. Referring to the database that had been online, she has a 13% chance of relapse in the next five years, and with aggressive chemotherapy (X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) platinum-based), this would be reduced to an 8% risk of relapse with a 5% benefit. Chemotherapy with 5-FU based regimen would have a smaller benefit of around 2.5%.
Plan was made to allow her to recuperate and then meet with her and her husband to discuss the pros and cons of adjuvant chemotherapy including what regimen she could consider including the side effects. We did not review all that information today.
She has a family history of early colon cancer. Her mother will be visiting in the weekend and plan is to obtain the rest of the paternal family history if we can. Tumor is being tested for microsatellite instability and we will discuss this when those results are available. She has one sibling and he is up-to-date on colonoscopy. She does report multiple tubes of blood were drawn prior to her admission. I will check with Dr. Y's office whether she has had a CEA and liver-associated enzymes assessed. If not, those can be drawn tomorrow.

Radical Mastectomy
Description:
Invasive carcinoma of left breast. Left modified radical mastectomy.
(Medical Transcription Sample Report)
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Invasive carcinoma of left breast.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:
Invasive carcinoma of left breast.
OPERATION PERFORMED:
Left modified radical mastectomy.
ANESTHESIA:
General endotracheal.
INDICATION FOR THE PROCEDURE:
The patient is a 52-year-old female who recently underwent a left breast biopsy and was found to have invasive carcinoma of the left breast. The patient was elected to have a left modified radical mastectomy, she was not interested in a partial mastectomy. She is aware of the risks and complications of surgery, and wished to proceed.
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:
The patient was taken to the operating room. She underwent general endotracheal anesthetic. The TED stockings and venous compression devices were placed on both lower extremities and they were functioning well. The patient's left anterior chest wall, neck, axilla, and left arm were prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner. The recent biopsy site was located in the upper and outer quadrant of left breast. The plain incision was marked along the skin. Tissues and the flaps were injected with 0.25% Marcaine with epinephrine solution and then a transverse elliptical incision was made in the breast of the skin to include nipple areolar complex as well as the recent biopsy site. The flaps were raised superiorly and just below the clavicle medially to the sternum, laterally towards the latissimus dorsi, rectus abdominus fascia. Following this, the breast tissue along with the pectoralis major fascia were dissected off the pectoralis major muscle. The dissection was started medially and extended laterally towards the left axilla. The breast was removed and then the axillary contents were dissected out. Left axillary vein and artery were identified and preserved as well as the lung _____. The patient had several clinically palpable lymph nodes, they were removed with the axillary dissection. Care was taken to avoid injury to any of the above mentioned neurovascular structures. After the tissues were irrigated, we made sure there were no signs of bleeding. Hemostasis had been achieved with Hemoclips. Hemovac drains x2 were then brought in and placed under the left axilla as well as in the superior and inferior breast flaps. The subcu was then approximated with interrupted 4-0 Vicryl sutures and skin with clips. The drains were sutured to the chest wall with 3-0 nylon sutures. Dressing was applied and the procedure was completed. The patient went to the recovery room in stable condition.

Thrombocytopenia - SOAP Note
Description:
Patient with immune thrombocytopenia
(Medical Transcription Sample Report)
SUBJECTIVE:
I am following the patient today for immune thrombocytopenia. Her platelets fell to 10 on 01/09/07 and shortly after learning of that result, I increased her prednisone to 60 mg a day. Repeat on 01/16/07 revealed platelets up at 43. No bleeding problems have been noted. I have spoken with her hematologist who recommends at this point we decrease her prednisone to 40 mg for 3 days and then go down to 20 mg a day. The patient had been on 20 mg every other day at least for a while, and her platelets hovered at least above 20 or so.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Vitals: As in chart. The patient is alert, pleasant, and cooperative. She is in no apparent distress. The petechial areas on her legs have resolved.
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
Patient with improvement of her platelet count on burst of prednisone. We will decrease her prednisone to 40 mg for 3 days, then go down to 20 mg a day. Basically thereafter, over time, I may try to sneak it back a little bit further. She is on medicines for osteoporosis including bisphosphonate and calcium with vitamin D. We will arrange to have a CBC drawn weekly.

Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer - Consult
Description:
New diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer stage IV metastatic disease. At this point, he and his wife ask about whether this is curable disease and it was difficult to inform that this was not curable disease but would be treatable.
(Medical Transcription Sample Report)
REASON FOR CONSULTATION:
New diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
ABCD is a very nice 47-year-old gentleman without much past medical history who has now been diagnosed with a new non-small cell lung cancer stage IV metastatic disease. We are consulted at this time to discuss further treatment options.
ABCD and his wife state that his history goes back to approximately 2-2-1/2 weeks ago when he developed some left-sided flank pain. Initially, he did not think much of this and tried to go about doing work and everything else but the pain gradually worsened. Eventually this prompted him to present to the emergency room. A CT scan was done there, and he was found to have a large left adrenal mass worrisome for metastatic disease. At that point, he was transferred to XYZ Hospital for further evaluation. On admission on 12/19/08, a CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was done for full staging purposes. The CT scan of the chest showed an abnormal soft tissue mass in the right paratracheal region, extending into the precarinal region, the subcarinal region, and the right hilum. This was causing some compression on the inferior aspect of the SVC and also some narrowing of the right upper lobe pulmonary artery. There was an abnormal lymph node noted in the AP window and left hilar region. There was another spiculated mass within the right upper lobe measuring 2.0 x 1.5 cm. There was also an 8 mm non-calcified nodule noted in the posterior-inferior aspect of the left upper lobe suspicious for metastatic disease. There were areas of atelectasis particularly in the right base. There was also some mild ground glass opacity within the right upper lobe adjacent to the right hilum potentially representing focal area of pulmonary edema versus small infarction related to the right upper lobe pulmonary artery narrowing. There was a small lucency adjacent to the medial aspect of the left upper lobe compatible with a small pneumothorax. In the abdomen, there was a mass involved in the left adrenal gland as well as a nodule involving the right adrenal gland both of which appeared necrotic compatible with metastatic tumor. All other structures appeared normal. On 12/22/08, a CT-guided biopsy of the left adrenal mass was performed. Pathology from this returned showing metastatic poorly differentiated non-small cell carcinoma. At this point, we have been consulted to discuss further treatment options.
On further review, ABCD states that he has may be had a 20 pound weight loss over the last couple of months which he relates to anorexia or decreased appetite. He has not ever had a chronic smoker's cough and still does not have a cough. He has no sputum production or hemoptysis. He and his wife are very anxious about this diagnosis.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
He denies any history of heart disease, lung disease, kidney disease, liver disease, hepatitis major infection, seizure disorders or other problems.
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:

Since that time he has worked with printing press. He is married and has two children, both of whom are grown in their 20s, but are now living at home.
FAMILY HISTORY:
His mother died for alcohol-related complications. He otherwise denies any history of cancers, bleeding disorders, clotting disorders, or other problems.

NEUROLOGIC: Cranial nerves II through XII are intact. He has intact sensation to light touch throughout. He has 2+ deep tendon reflexes bilaterally in the biceps, triceps, brachioradialis, patellar and ankle reflexes. He is alert and oriented x3.
LABORATORY DATA:
His white blood cell count is 9.4, hemoglobin 13.0, hematocrit 38%, and platelets 365,000. The differential shows 73% neutrophils, 17% lymphocytes, 7.6% monocytes, 1.9% eosinophils, and 0.7% basophils. Chemistry shows sodium 138, potassium 3.8, chloride 104, CO2 of 31, BUN 9, creatinine 1.0, glucose 104, calcium 12.3, alkaline phosphatase 104, AST 16, ALT 12, total protein 7.6, albumin 3.5, total bilirubin 0.5, ionized calcium 1.7. His INR is 1.0 with the PT of 11.4 and a PTT of 31.3.
IMAGINING DATA:
MRI of the brain on 12/23/08 - this shows some mild white matter disease, question of minimal pontine ischemic gliosis as well as a small incidental venous angioma in the left posterior frontal deep white matter. There is no evidence of cerebral metastasis, hemorrhage, or acute infarction.
ASSESSMENT/PLAN:
ABCD is a very nice 47-year-old gentleman without much past medical history, who now presents with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. At this point, he and his wife ask about whether this is curable disease and it was difficult to inform that this was not curable disease but would be treatable. His wife particularly had a very hard time with this prognosis. They preferred not to know the exact average as to how long someone lives with this disease. I did offer chemotherapy as a way to treat this disease. Chemotherapy has been associated both with palliation of symptoms as well as prolong survival. At this point, he has an excellent functional status and I think he would tolerate chemotherapy quite well.
In terms of chemotherapy, I talked briefly about the side affects including but not limited to GI upset, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, mucositis, fatigue, loss of appetite, low blood counts including the possible need for transfusion as well as the risk of infections, which in some rare cases can be fatal. I would likely use carboplatin and gemcitabine. This would be both medications given on day 1 with a dose of gemcitabine on day 8. This cycle will be repeated after 1-week break so that the cycle lasts 21 days. The goal will be to complete 6 cycles of this as long as he is responding and tolerating the medication.
In terms of staging Mr. ABCD'S had all the appropriate staging. A PET-CT scan could be done, but at this point would not provide much mean full information beyond the CT scans that we have.
At this point, his biggest issue is pain and he is getting a pain consult to help control his pain. He will be ready to be discharged from the hospital once his pain is under better control. As this is the holiday weekend, I do not have a way of scheduling a followup appointment with them, but I did give he and his wife my card and instructed them to call on Monday. At that point, we will get him in and I will also begin working on making arrangements for his chemotherapy.
Thank you very much for this interesting consult.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:
Iron deficiency anemia.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
This is a very pleasant 19-year-old woman, who was recently hospitalized with iron deficiency anemia. She was seen in consultation by Dr. X. She underwent a bone marrow biopsy on 07/21/10, which showed a normal cellular marrow with trilineage hematopoiesis. On 07/22/10, her hemoglobin was 6.5 and therefore she was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells. Her iron levels were 5 and her percent transferrin was 2. There was no evidence of hemolysis. Of note, she had a baby 5 months ago; however she does not describe excessive bleeding at the time of birth. She currently has an IUD, so she is not menstruating. She was discharged from the hospital on iron supplements. She denies any fevers, chills, or night sweats. No lymphadenopathy. No nausea or vomiting. No change in bowel or bladder habits. She specifically denies melena or hematochezia.

ASSESSMENT/PLAN:
Iron deficiency anemia. At this point, I am going to schedule her for an EGD and a colonscopy. I am also going to repeat her iron studies. She had a CBC from yesterday, which showed hemoglobin of 10.4. Her MCV was still low at 74.2 and the mean cell hemoglobin was 25.0. I would also like to check her fecal occult blood test x3. I believe with her low iron levels it is going to be very difficult for her to replace it orally. I believe she may need intravenous iron infusions. If that is case, we can arrange for her to find a doctor who can give the iron infusions. She will follow up with Dr. X.
