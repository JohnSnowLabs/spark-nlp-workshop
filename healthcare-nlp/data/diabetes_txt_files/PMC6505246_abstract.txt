The rising prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) is a serious global health concern. The world is experiencing type 2 diabetes epidemics and prevalence differs by gender, regions, and level of socioeconomic development. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in men increased at a faster rate and numbers are continuing to rise in some regions of the world. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of T2DM among men in the Middle East countries. Seventy-four research articles were identified through search engines including Web of Science, Medline, PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and Ovid databases by using keywords “epidemiology,” “prevalence,” “diabetes mellitus,” and individual names of the Middle East states. Finally, 17 studies were included for the assessment of prevalence of T2DM among men in the Middle East. In the Middle East, high prevalence of T2DM among men was identified in Bahrain (33.60%), Saudi Arabia (29.10%), United Arab Emirates (UAE; 25.83%), and Kuwait (25.40%), whereas low prevalence was reported in Iran (9.90%) and Yemen (9.80%). The random pooled prevalence in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states was (24.0%) compared to non-GCC states (16.0%), and in both GCC and non-GCC countries combined, it was 19%. The prevalence was significantly associated with the gross domestic product of these states (p = .0005). Despite different socioeconomic and cultural settings in the Middle East, the rising T2DM prevalence among men was identified in Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Kuwait. These states must incorporate future diabetes defensive strategies targeting the Middle East population to minimize the burden of DM from the region.
