Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) is a highly prevalent maternal pathology characterized by maternal glucose intolerance during pregnancy that is, associated with severe complications for both mother and offspring. Several risk factors have been related to GDM; one of the most important among them is genetic predisposition. Numerous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes that act at different levels on various tissues, could cause changes in the expression levels and activity of proteins, which result in glucose and insulin metabolism dysfunction. In this review, we describe various SNPs; which according to literature, increase the risk of developing GDM. These SNPs include: (1) those associated with transcription factors that regulate insulin production and excretion, such as rs7903146 (TCF7L2) and rs5015480 (HHEX); (2) others that cause a decrease in protective hormones against insulin resistance such as rs2241766 (ADIPOQ) and rs6257 (SHBG); (3) SNPs that cause modifications in membrane proteins, generating dysfunction in insulin signaling or cell transport in the case of rs5443 (GNB3) and rs2237892 (KCNQ1); (4) those associated with enzymes such as rs225014 (DIO2) and rs9939609 (FTO) which cause an impaired metabolism, resulting in an insulin resistance state; and (5) other polymorphisms, those are associated with growth factors such as rs2146323 (VEGFA) and rs755622 (MIF) which could cause changes in the expression levels of these proteins, producing endothelial dysfunction and an increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines, characteristic on GDM. While the pathophysiological mechanism is unclear, this review describes various potential effects of these polymorphisms on the predisposition to develop GDM.
