In patients with relapsed or refractory lymphoma, high-dose chemoimmunotherapy with subsequent autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is a standard of care. Bendamustine, an alkylating agent, is used in the BeEAM (bendamustine, etoposide, cytarabine, melphalan) protocol for conditioning therapy before autologous HCT in patients with relapsed or refractory lymphoma who are eligible for transplant. There is no consensus regarding an optimal salvage regimen and the approach varies according to toxicity. 
We present a case of partial nephrogenic diabetes insipidus after receiving bendamustine, as part of the BeEAM protocol.
Management and outcome: The patient was managed with parenteral fluid administration and intranasal desmopressin before the condition resolved on its own.
We summarize published reports of bendamustine-induced diabetes insipidus.
