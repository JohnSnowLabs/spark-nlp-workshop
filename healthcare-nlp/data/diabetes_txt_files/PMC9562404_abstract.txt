Decreased pancreatic volume, increased pancreatic fat mass, and serrated pancreatic margins are characteristic morphological changes of the pancreas in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus. This retrospective study aimed to clarify the clinical significance of pancreatic morphological changes in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus who underwent abdominal magnetic resonance imaging. The mean age and HbA1c value were 59.1 ± 16.3 years old and 8.9 ± 2.3%, respectively. Pancreatic body mass corrected for body surface area (BSA) in subjects with diabetes mellitus was lower compared to those in normal glucose tolerance (49.4 ± 15.3 cm3 vs. 60.9 ± 7.8 cm3), although it did not reach a statistic significance. There was a negative correlation between BSA-corrected pancreatic volume and age, duration of diabetes, glycoalbumin, mean and max IMT, and there was a positive correlation between BSA-corrected pancreatic volume and HOMA2-β. Serration of the pancreatic limbus was more often observed in subjects with diabetes mellitus compared to those in normal glucose tolerance (74.1% vs. 14.3%). Subjects with serrated changes were older and had higher HbA1c, and visceral fat area was significantly larger in subjects with serrated changes. BSA-corrected pancreatic volume in subjects with serrated changes was significantly smaller, and mean IMT was significantly thicker in subjects with serrulation. Furthermore, advanced diabetic retinopathy and diabetic nephropathy were more often observed in subjects with serrated changes. Taken together, decreased BSA-corrected pancreatic volume and serrated changes were associated with the progression of vascular complications in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
