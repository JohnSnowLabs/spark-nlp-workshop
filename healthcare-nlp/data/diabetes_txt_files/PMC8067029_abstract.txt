Dipsogenic diabetes insipidus (DDI) is a subtype of primary polydipsia (PP), which occurs mostly in healthy people without psychiatric disease. In contrast, PP is characterized by a polyuria polydipsia syndrome (PPS) associated with psychiatric illness. However, the pathogenesis of DDI is not well established and remains unexplored. In order to diagnose DDI, the patient should exhibit excessive thirst as the main symptom, in addition to no history of psychiatric illness, polyuria with low urine osmolality, and intact urine concentrating ability. Treatment options for DDI remain scarce. On this front, there have been two published case reports with successful attempts at treating DDI patients. The noteworthy commonalities in these reports are that the patient was diagnosed with frequent excessive intake of water due to a belief that drinking excess water would have pathologic benefits. It could therefore be hypothesized that the increasing trend of excessive fluid intake in people who are health conscious could also contribute to DDI. Hence, this review provides an overview of the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment, with a special emphasis on habitual polydipsia and DDI.
