Autoimmune hypothalamitis (AHT) is a rare inflammatory disorder that involves the hypothalamus. It remains unclear whether autoimmune hypophysitis (AH) and AHT represent different diseases or different aspects of the same disease. Thus, further investigation of AHT is required.
A retrospective review of medical and pathological records of AHT patients from the Chinese PLA General Hospital were examined from January 1, 2005 to May 1, 2017. Clinical data, treatments, and outcomes were investigated.
Five female patients were identified (median age, 42.6 years). Symptoms included central diabetes insipidus, hypopituitarism, hyperprolactinemia, headache, and hypothalamic syndrome. The following hormonal deficits were noted: follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, adrenocorticotropic hormone, thyroid stimulating hormone, and growth hormone. One patient underwent high-dose methylprednisolone pulse treatment (HDMPT) and azathioprine plus intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), and two patients underwent HDMPT and two rounds of replacement therapy. During follow-up, one patient died because of non-compliance with therapy and the others were in remission or they recovered.
AHT had similar MRI results, pathology, and treatment compared with AH. Thus, it may be a subtype of AH, and AHT patients may also show hypothalamic syndrome.
