Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) mainly affects the lungs, but can involve several other organs. The diagnosis of acute and chronic sequelae is one of the challenges of COVID-19. The current literature proposes that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may involve the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. In this case report, we present a unique case of new-onset central diabetes insipidus secondary to the COVID-19 disease in a 54-year-old woman.
A 54-year-old woman presented with the history of excessive thirst, polyuria, and polydipsia, six weeks after being infected by COVID-19. Laboratory tests revealed low urine osmolarity and increased serum osmolarity, and the patient was diagnosed with central diabetes insipidus. After administration of nasal desmopressin, urinary osmolarity increased, and the patient's symptoms improved. However, to stabilize her condition, desmopressin treatment was required.
We reported a unique case of diabetes insipidus in a COVID-19 patient. Central diabetes insipidus may be included in clinical manifestations of the COVID-19, in case of new-onset polyuria and polydipsia following COVID-19 disease. Nevertheless, a causal relationship has not been established between the symptoms of the patient and the SARS-CoV-2 infection.
