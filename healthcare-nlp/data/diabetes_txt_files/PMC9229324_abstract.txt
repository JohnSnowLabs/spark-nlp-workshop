Background: This study assessed the predictive performance of inflammatory, hepatic, coagulation, and cardiac biomarkers in patients with prediabetes and diabetes mellitus hospitalized for COVID-19 in Austria. Methods: This was an analysis of a multicenter cohort study of 747 patients with diabetes mellitus or prediabetes hospitalized for COVID-19 in 11 hospitals in Austria. The primary outcome of this study was in-hospital mortality. The predictor variables included demographic characteristics, clinical parameters, comorbidities, use of medication, disease severity, and laboratory measurements of biomarkers. The association between biomarkers and in-hospital mortality was assessed using simple and multiple logistic regression analyses. The predictive performance of biomarkers was assessed using discrimination and calibration. Results: In our analysis, 70.8% had type 2 diabetes mellitus, 5.8% had type 1 diabetes mellitus, 14.9% had prediabetes, and 8.6% had other types of diabetes mellitus. The mean age was 70.3 Â± 13.3 years, and 69.3% of patients were men. A total of 19.0% of patients died in the hospital. In multiple logistic regression analysis, LDH, CRP, IL-6, PCT, AST-ALT ratio, NT-proBNP, and Troponin T were significantly associated with in-hospital mortality. The discrimination of NT-proBNP was 74%, and that of Troponin T was 81%. The calibration of NT-proBNP was adequate (p = 0.302), while it was inadequate for Troponin T (p = 0.010). Conclusion: Troponin T showed excellent predictive performance, while NT-proBNP showed good predictive performance for assessing in-hospital mortality in patients with diabetes mellitus hospitalized with COVID-19. Therefore, these cardiac biomarkers may be used for prognostication of COVID-19 patients.
