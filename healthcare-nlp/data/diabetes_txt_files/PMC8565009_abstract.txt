This study aimed to explore the association between diabetes mellitus and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of older people in Shanghai, China, especially regarding the differences in each aspect of the EQ-5D and how large the score gaps are between older people with and without diabetes.
A total of 11,103 people of either sex older than 60 years were enrolled from 17 districts of Shanghai. The EQ-5D-3L was used to assess the HRQoL of older people. The Wilcoxon rank sum test and t-test were used to compare the difference in HRQoL between people with or without diabetes. After univariate regression, multiple linear regression and ordinal logistic regression were conducted to evaluate the influence of diabetes mellitus and other confounding variables on the EQ VAS scores and on the five dimensions of the EQ-5D.
Twelve percent of all participants had diabetes mellitus, and the proportion was almost the same between men and women. The EQ VAS scores of people with diabetes mellitus were approximately 3.70 points lower than those of people without diabetes (95% CI = -4.40,  -2.99, p < 0.001) after adjusting for confounding variables. People with diabetes mellitus had increased problems with mobility (OR = 1.57, 95% CI = 1.33, 1.85), self-care (OR = 1.65, 95% CI = 1.35, 2.01), usual activities (OR = 1.78, 95% CI = 1.51, 2.11), pain/discomfort (OR = 1.42, 95% CI = 1.24, 1.64), and anxiety/depression (OR = 1.33, 95% CI = 1.07, 1.64).
This study showed that diabetes mellitus was associated with the HRQoL of older people and that older people with diabetes had poorer performance in every aspect of EQ-5D measurements.
