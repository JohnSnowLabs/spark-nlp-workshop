The recent increase in life expectancy has resulted in an increase in the number of older adults with diabetes mellitus. In addition to type 2 diabetes, in which aging is a well‐known risk factor, individuals with type 1 and other types of diabetes are also increasing owing to longevity in the general population and improved prognosis of the disease and comorbidities. Insulin‐dependent state in type 1 diabetes and other types of diabetes, such as diabetes after pancreatectomy, inevitably requires insulin treatment for survival; however, daily injection of insulin is often hampered in older adults due to impaired cognitive function or limited activities of daily living. In this review, we aimed to discuss the current situation of insulin‐dependent diabetes mellitus in older adults and highlight future prospects. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2022; 22: 549–553.
