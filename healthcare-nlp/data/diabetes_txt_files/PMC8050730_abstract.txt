Diabetes is the leading cause of severe health complications and one of the top 10 causes of death worldwide. To date, diabetes has no cure, and therefore, it is necessary to take precautionary measures to avoid its occurrence. The main aim of this systematic review is to identify the majority of the risk factors for the incidence/prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus on one hand, and to give a critical analysis of the cohort/cross-sectional studies which examine the impact of the association of risk factors on diabetes. Consequently, we provide insights on risk factors whose interactions are major players in developing diabetes. We conclude with recommendations to allied health professionals, individuals and government institutions to support better diagnosis and prognosis of the disease.
