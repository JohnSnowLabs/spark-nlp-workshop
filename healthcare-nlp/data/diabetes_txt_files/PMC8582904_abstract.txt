In Myanmar, the escalating prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and impaired glucose tolerance among adults was recently reported, with the highest prevalence in the Yangon Region. The aim of the present study was to identify the risk factors in dietary habits and their relationship with T2DM in urban Myanmar residents. We conducted a case–control study recruiting 300 individuals aged 25–74 years living in the Yangon Region, consisting of 150 newly diagnosed cases attending a diabetes clinic, and 150 controls, who were community residents and free of diabetes. The case group had a significantly higher consumption of noodles, fish, beans, fermented food and pickles, dried food, topping seasonings, and non-dairy milk products than the control group, whereas they had a lower vegetable intake (more than three servings/day) and fruit intake (more than three servings/day) than the control group. Furthermore, the case group exhibited a higher frequency of some dietary behaviors than the control group, such as (1) having meals with family, (2) skipping breakfast, and (3) eating out. The final model showed that topping seasonings (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 11.23, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.08–40.90), more than three servings/day of vegetable intake (aOR 0.18, 95% CI 0.05–0.67), and having meals with family (aOR 2.23, 95% CI 1.05–4.71) were associated with diabetes. The study suggests that Myanmar’s characteristic dietary culture of topping their meals with salty seasonings and sauces and eating multiple dishes together as a family are risk factors associated with T2DM. Our findings may contribute recommendations and opportunities for the primary prevention of T2DM in urban Myanmar.
