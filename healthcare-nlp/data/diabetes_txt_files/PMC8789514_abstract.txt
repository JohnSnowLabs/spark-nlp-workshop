Diabetes is a widespread metabolic disease with various complications, including diabetic nephropathy, retinopathy, cardiomyopathy, and other cardiovascular or cerebrovascular diseases. As the prevalence of diabetes increases in all age groups worldwide, diabetes and its complications cause an emerging public health burden. NLRP3 inflammasome is a complex of several proteins that play a critical role in inflammatory response and various diseases, including diabetes and its complications. Accumulating evidences indicate that NLRP3 inflammasome contributes to the development of diabetes and diabetic complications and that NLRP3 inflammation inactivation is beneficial in treating these illnesses. Emerging evidences suggest the critical role of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in regulating NLRP3 inflammasome activity in various diseases. LncRNAs are non-coding RNAs exceeding 200 nucleotides in length. Its dysregulation has been linked to the development of diseases, including diabetes. Recently, growing evidences hint that regulating lncRNAs on NLRP3 inflammasome is critical in developing and progressing diabetes and diabetic complications. Here, we discuss the role of lncRNAs in regulating NLRP3 inflammasome as well as its participation in diabetes and diabetic complications, providing novel insights into developing future therapeutic approaches for diabetes.
