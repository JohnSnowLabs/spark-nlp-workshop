Sexual dysfunction, which is defined as ‘difficulty during any stage of the sexual encounter that prevents or impairs the individual or couple from enjoying sexual activity’, is globally prevalent in males with prediabetes and diabetes. It is an early harbinger of cardiovascular diseases and has a profound impact on one's physical, mental, and social health. Among patients with either prediabetes or diabetes, the most common male sexual dysfunctions are hypogonadism, erectile dysfunction, and premature ejaculation. In Asia, although sexual health is an important factor of men's health, it is rarely discussed freely in real‐life practice. Addressing sexual health in Asian males has always been challenging with multiple barriers at the levels of patients and health care providers. Therefore, the assessment and management of sexual dysfunction in routine clinical practice should involve a holistic approach with effective patient–provider communication. In this review, we discuss the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and the management of hypogonadism, erectile dysfunction, and premature ejaculation among males with either prediabetes or diabetes (type 1 and type 2), as well as the evidence gaps across Asia.
