One of the most common complications during pregnancy is gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), hyperglycemia that occurs for the first time during pregnancy. The condition is multifactorial, caused by an interaction between genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors. However, the underlying mechanisms responsible for its pathogenesis remain elusive. Moreover, in contrast to several common metabolic disorders, molecular research in GDM is lagging. It is important to recognize that GDM is still commonly diagnosed during the second trimester of pregnancy using the oral glucose tolerance test (OGGT), at a time when both a fetal and maternal pathophysiology is already present, demonstrating the increased blood glucose levels associated with exacerbated insulin resistance. Therefore, early detection of metabolic changes and associated epigenetic and genetic factors that can lead to an improved prediction of adverse pregnancy outcomes and future cardio-metabolic pathologies in GDM women and their children is imperative. Several genomic and epigenetic approaches have been used to identify the genes, genetic variants, metabolic pathways, and epigenetic modifications involved in GDM to determine its etiology. In this article, we explore these factors as well as how their functional effects may contribute to immediate and future pathologies in women with GDM and their offspring from birth to adulthood. We also discuss how these approaches contribute to the changes in different molecular pathways that contribute to the GDM pathogenesis, with a special focus on the development of insulin resistance.
