For decades, self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) has been considered a cornerstone of adequate diabetes management. Structured SMBG can follow different monitoring patterns, and it results in improved glycemic control, reduced hypoglycemia, and a better quality of life of people with diabetes. The technology, usability, and accuracy of SMBG systems have advanced markedly since their introduction a few decades ago. Current SMBG systems are small and easy to use, require small (capillary) blood sample volumes, and provide measurement results within seconds. In addition, devices are increasingly equipped with features such as connectivity to other devices and/or digital diaries and diabetes management tools. Although measurement quality can come close to or equal that of the glucose monitoring systems used by healthcare professionals, several available SMBG systems still do not meet internationally accepted accuracy standards, such as the International Organization for Standardization 15197 standard. Reports from China, India, and Brazil based on local experience suggest that in addition of the accuracy issues of SMBG systems, other obstacles also need to be overcome to optimize SMBG usage. Nonetheless, adequate usage of SMBG data is of high relevance for the management of people with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
