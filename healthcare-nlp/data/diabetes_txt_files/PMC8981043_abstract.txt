Congenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) is a rare disease that causes polydipsia and polyuria, and there are currently no effective treatments for most cases, particularly severe ones. The present report describes the case of a 1-yr-5-mo-old male patient with partial congenital NDI who was successfully treated with oral disintegrating 1-deamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin (DDAVP). The patient presented with poor weight gain and polydipsia (fluid, 1.5 L/d) and received a diagnosis of NDI after genetic analysis revealed an AVPR2 mutation (c.383A>C, p.Y128S). His water-restricted urine osmolality increased from 360 mOsm/kg/H2O to 667 mOsm/kg/H2O after subcutaneous AVP injection, indicating that he had some urine concentrating ability. Oral disintegrating DDAVP therapy was started at 360 µg/d with hydrochlorothiazide and increased to 720 µg/d without any adverse effects. A 30% decrease in urine output and water intake was followed by an increase in body weight. The present study is the first to report the effectiveness and safety of oral disintegrating DDAVP in a patient with partial congenital NDI due to an AVPR2 gene mutation. The severity of NDI at which DDAVP therapy is the most effective remains to be determined.
