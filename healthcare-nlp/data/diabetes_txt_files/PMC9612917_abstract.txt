Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) entails a complex underlying pathogenesis, with a specific genetic background and the effect of environmental factors. This study examines the link between a set of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with diabetes and the development of GDM in pregnant women with different ethnicities, and evaluates its potential modulation with a clinical intervention based on a Mediterranean diet.
2418 women from our hospital-based cohort of pregnant women screened for GDM from January 2015 to November 2017 (the San Carlos Cohort, randomized controlled trial for the prevention of GDM ISRCTN84389045 and real-world study ISRCTN13389832) were assessed for evaluation. Diagnosis of GDM was made according to the International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG) criteria. Genotyping was performed by IPLEX MassARRAY PCR using the Agena platform (Agena Bioscience, SanDiego, CA). 110 SNPs were selected for analysis based on selected literature references. Statistical analyses regarding patientsâ€™ characteristics were performed in SPSS (Chicago, IL, USA) version 24.0. Genetic association tests were performed using PLINK v.1.9 and 2.0 software. Bioinformatics analysis, with mapping of SNPs was performed using STRING, version 11.5.
Quality controls retrieved a total 98 SNPs and 1573 samples, 272 (17.3%) with GDM and 1301 (82.7%) without GDM. 1104 (70.2%) were Caucasian (CAU) and 469 (29.8%) Hispanic (HIS). 415 (26.4%) were from the control group (CG), 418 (26.6%) from the nutritional intervention group (IG) and 740 (47.0%) from the real-world group (RW). 40 SNPs (40.8%) presented some kind of significant association with GDM in at least one of the genetic tests considered. The nutritional intervention presented a significant association with GDM, regardless of the variant considered. In CAU, variants rs4402960, rs7651090, IGF2BP2; rs1387153, rs10830963, MTNR1B; rs17676067, GLP2R; rs1371614, DPYSL5; rs5215, KCNJ1; and rs2293941, PDX1 were significantly associated with an increased risk of GDM, whilst rs780094, GCKR; rs7607980, COBLL1; rs3746750, SLC17A9; rs6048205, FOXA2; rs7041847, rs7034200, rs10814916, GLIS3; rs3783347, WARS; and rs1805087, MTR, were significantly associated with a decreased risk of GDM, In HIS, variants significantly associated with increased risk of GDM were rs9368222, CDKAL1; rs2302593, GIPR; rs10885122, ADRA2A; rs1387153, MTNR1B; rs737288, BACE2; rs1371614, DPYSL5; and rs2293941, PDX1, whilst rs340874, PROX1; rs2943634, IRS1; rs7041847, GLIS3; rs780094, GCKR; rs563694, G6PC2; and rs11605924, CRY2 were significantly associated with decreased risk for GDM.
We identify a core set of SNPs in their association with diabetes and GDM in a large cohort of patients from two main ethnicities from a single center. Identification of these genetic variants, even in the setting of a nutritional intervention, deems useful to design preventive and therapeutic strategies.
