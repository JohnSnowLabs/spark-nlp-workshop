SARS-COV2 infection has swiftly become a pandemic disease of historic relevance and widely variable outcomes. This variable prognosis is related both to uneven damage, among others, to lungs, heart and kidneys, and to a multisystemic inflammatory reaction. All these factors are known to disrupt water balance and potentially induce hyponatraemia or hypernatraemia. Water balance disorders are known mortality and morbidity risk factors in several clinical scenarios and their proper management, though often complex and hazardous, can reduce mortality and length of hospitalization. Clinical uncertainty over COVID-19 outcome, the variety of organs involved in both the infection and water balance and difficulties in clinical examination due to risk of contagion might obstruct proper management of dysnatremic disorders. Thus, the Acqua Neuroendocrinology Group of the Spanish Society for Endocrinology (SEEN) has endeavoured to provide evidence and expert based recommendations on the management of hyponatraemia and hypernatraemia in COVID-19 patients.
