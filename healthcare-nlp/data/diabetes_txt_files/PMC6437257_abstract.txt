The current diabetes management strategies not only aim at controlling glycaemic parameters but also necessitate continuous medical care along with multifactorial risk reduction through a comprehensive management concept. The sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) are a group of evolving antidiabetic agents that have the potential to play a pivotal role in the comprehensive management of patients with diabetes due to their diverse beneficial effects. SGLT2i provide moderate glycaemic control, considerable body weight and blood pressure reduction, and thus have the ability to lower the risk of macrovascular and microvascular complications. Some of the unique characteristics associated with SGLT2i, such as reduction in body weight (more visceral fat mass loss than subcutaneous fat loss), reduction in insulin resistance and improvement in β-cell function, as measured by homeostatic model assessment-β (HOMA-β) could be potentially beneficial and help in overcoming some of the challenges faced by Indian patients with diabetes. In addition, a patient-centric approach with individualised treatment during SGLT2i therapy is inevitable in order to reduce diabetic complications and improve quality of life. Despite their broad benefits profile, the risk of genital tract infections, volume depletion, amputations and diabetic ketoacidosis associated with SGLT2i should be carefully monitored. In this compendium, we systematically reviewed the literature from Medline, Cochrane Library, and other relevant databases and attempted to provide evidence-based recommendations for the positioning of SGLT2i in the management of diabetes in the Indian population.
