Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) affects an increasing number of pregnant women globally. Although studies have identified psychosocial ramifications associated with GDM, stigma in the form of experienced discrimination and self-blame and its consequences have received limited attention. Our objective was to examine the current evidence on stigma, as experienced among women with GDM, including the potential adverse consequences hereof.
A scoping review was conducted with citations retrieved from the databases MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE and, PsycINFO. Studies published before 15 June 2022, when the search was conducted, were included.
We identified 1388 citations and included 44 in the review. We found that women with GDM may experience stigma in the form of overt discrimination from healthcare personnel and relatives, and in the form of internalised stigma, such as guilt and shame. Identified consequences include avoidance of screening, not following dietary recommendations nor reporting blood glucose readings, social isolation, and poor mental wellbeing. No estimates of stigma prevalence were identified.
Existing evidence shows that women with GDM report stigma, which may affect both their mental and physical health. Further investigations into the prevalence of stigma and long-term consequences of stigma are much needed.
