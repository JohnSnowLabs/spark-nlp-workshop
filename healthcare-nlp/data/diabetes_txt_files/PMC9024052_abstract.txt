To perform a comprehensive and integrative review of the available literature on the potential changes in the microbiome of healthy and individuals with diabetes under periodontal health and disease.
The review was conducted by two independent reviewers. Indexed electronic databases (PubMed/Medline, Cochrane Library, Web of Science and Scopus) were searched, including articles published in English and dated from 5 years ago until December 2021. A manual search also was performed to identify co-related articles. Following the removal of duplicates and eligibility criteria, the articles were included in tables for analysis and described in the manuscript.
According to this review, diabetes mellitus was associated with significant changes in the subgingival and salivary microbiome, either in its association with periodontitis or in cases of periodontal health. In addition to affecting microbial diversity in terms of taxonomy, metagenomic studies have shown that this endocrine disorder may also be directly related to increased pathogenicity in the oral microbiome.
Although the reviewed studies demonstrate important differences in the subgingival and salivary microbiome composition because of diabetes mellitus, further studies are needed to clarify the real effects of hyperglycemia on oral microbial profiles and support new diagnostic approaches and innovative treatments.
