Introduction: Brain tumors are the second most frequent type of all pediatric malignancies. Depending on their localization, patients with brain tumors may present neurological or ophthalmological symptoms, but also weight anomalies and endocrine disorders ranging from growth hormone deficiency, anomalies of puberty, diabetes insipidus to panhypopituitarism. Immediately at diagnosis, all patients with brain tumors require a complete assessment of the hypothalamic–pituitary function in order to address eventual endocrine disorders. Moreover, children and adolescents undergoing brain surgery must receive peri- and postoperative hydrocortisone stress therapy. Post-operative disorders of water homeostasis are frequent, ranging from transient diabetes insipidus, as well as syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion to persistent diabetes insipidus. Late endocrine disorders may result from surgery near or within the hypothalamic–pituitary region. Pituitary deficits are frequent after radiotherapy, especially growth hormone deficiency. Thyroid nodules or secondary thyroid cancers may arise years after radiotherapy. Gonadal dysfunction is frequent after chemotherapy especially with alkylating agents. Conclusion: Early detection and treatment of specific endocrine disorders at diagnosis, perioperatively, and during long-term follow-up result in improved general and metabolic health and quality of life.
