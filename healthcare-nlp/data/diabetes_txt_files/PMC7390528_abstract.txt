The goal of this review was to summarize current biochemical mechanisms of and risk factors for diabetic brain injury. We mainly summarized mechanisms published in the past three years and focused on diabetes induced cognitive impairment, diabetes-linked Alzheimerâ€™s disease, and diabetic stroke. We think there is a need to conduct further studies with increased sample sizes and prolonged period of follow-ups to clarify the effect of DM on brain dysfunction. Additionally, we also think that enhancing experimental reproducibility using animal models in conjunction with application of advanced devices should be considered when new experiments are designed. It is expected that further investigation of the underlying mechanisms of diabetic cognitive impairment will provide novel insights into therapeutic approaches for ameliorating diabetes-associated injury in the brain.
