A 44-year-old man with a history of traumatic brain injury (TBI) presented to the emergency room (ER) with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). After resolution of DKA, the patient had persistent polyuria (up to 5.5 L/24 h) associated with low specific gravity (1.002-1.005) and severe hypernatremia (up to 186 mmol/L) that led us to consider the possibility of central diabetes insipidus (DI). Due to the lack of desmopressin availability in our country, we managed the patient using indapamide. Polydipsia and polyuria in a patient with controlled diabetes mellitus (DM) should raise suspicion for alternative etiologies, including DI. Appropriate fluid management during hospitalization is critical to avoid life-threatening complications. TBI is an important cause of central DI and should be treated with desmopressin, an arginine-vasopressin (AVP) analog. In the absence of desmopressin, alternative options can help patients with central DI, including thiazides, carbamazepine, chlorpropamide, among others less studied.
