Lymphocytic hypophysitis (LYH) is an important condition to consider in the differential diagnosis of patients with a pituitary mass. The main clinical manifestations of LYH include headache, symptoms related to sellar compression, hypopituitarism, diabetes insipidus and hyperprolactinemia. Headache, which is a frequent complaint of patients with LYH, is thought to be related to the occupying effect of the pituitary mass and is rapidly resolved with a good outcome after timely and adequate glucocorticoid treatment or surgery.
Here, we report a patient with LYH whose initial symptom was headache and whose pituitary function assessment showed the presence of secondary hypoadrenalism, central hypothyroidism and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Pituitary magnetic resonance imaging showed symmetrical enlargement of the pituitary gland with suprasellar extension in a dumbbell shape with significant homogeneous enhancement after gadolinium enhancement. The size of the gland was approximately 17.7 mm × 14.3 mm × 13.8 mm. The pituitary stalk was thickened without deviation, and there was an elevation of the optimal crossing. The lesion grew bilaterally toward the cavernous sinuses, and the parasternal dural caudal sign was visible. The patient presented with repeatedly worsening and prolonged headaches three times even though the hypopituitarism had fully resolved after glucocorticoid treatment during this course.
This rare headache regression suggests that patients with chronic headaches should also be alerted to the possibility of LYH.
