Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder that majorly affects the endocrine gland, and it is symbolized by hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance owing to deficient insulin secretory responses and beta cell dysfunction. This ailment affects as many as 451 million people worldwide, and it is also one of the leading causes of death. In spite of the immense advances made in the development of orthodox antidiabetic drugs, these drugs are often considered not successful for the management and treatment of T2DM due to the myriad side effects associated with them. Thus, the exploration of medicinal herbs and natural products as therapeutic sources for the treatment of T2DM is promoted because they have little or no side effects. Bioactive molecules isolated from natural sources have been proven to lower blood glucose levels via regulating one or more of the following mechanisms: improvement of beta cell function, insulin resistance, glucose (re)absorption, and glucagon-like peptide-1 homeostasis. In recent times, the mechanisms of action of different bioactive molecules with antidiabetic properties and phytochemistry are gaining a lot of attention in the area of drug discovery. This review article presents an update of the findings from clinical research into medicinal plant therapy for T2DM.
