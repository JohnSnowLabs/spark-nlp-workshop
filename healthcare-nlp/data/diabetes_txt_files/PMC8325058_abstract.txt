To study the occurrence of major congenital abnormalities in children of women with type 1 and type 2 diabetes and investigate the association between glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and major congenital malformations according to type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes separately.
In this register-based study, all singletons born alive from January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2015 in the North Denmark and Central Denmark regions of Denmark and their mothers were included. We used data from Danish health registers and the LABKA database. Logistic regression models were used to compute crude and adjusted prevalence odds ratios (cORs and aORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for major congenital malformations overall and for subtypes, by type of maternal pre-existing diabetes and HbA1c levels.
Among 314,245 infants included, 2020 (0.64%) had mothers with type 1 diabetes and 498 (0.16%) had mothers with type 2 diabetes. We found an aOR of 2.9 (95% CI: 2.5, 3.5) and 1.9 (95% CI: 1.3; 2.8) for major malformations for type 1 and type 2 diabetes, respectively. The highest occurrence was seen for major congenital heart diseases, but we also observed higher occurrence of several other non-cardiac malformations. For both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, the prevalence of major congenital malformations increased with higher levels of maternal HbA1c with no safe threshold level. Mothers with type 1 diabetes had higher risks than those without diabetes irrespective of HbA1c, and women with HbA1c levels â‰¥9.5% had 8 times the odds of major congenital malformations [aOR 8.7 (95% CI: 5.4; 14.5)].
The prevalence of major congenital malformations progressively increased with poorer glycemic control during pregnancy, with no obvious safe threshold level, for both type 1 and type 2 diabetes.
