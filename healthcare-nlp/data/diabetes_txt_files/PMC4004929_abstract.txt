We have identified a novel mutation of the arginine vasopressin receptor 2 (AVPR2) gene in a case of congenital X-linked nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI). The patient was a 2-mo-old Japanese boy with persistent fever and failure to thrive. He was diagnosed as having congenital NDI by clinical and laboratory findings. Molecular analysis demonstrated that he was hemizygous for a G to C transversion in exon 2 of the AVPR2 gene which resulted in a glycine to arginine substitution (G107R) at the 107th codon of the first extracellular loop. His mother was heterozygous for the same mutation. We speculated that the G107R mutation would interfere with the binding capacity of the AVPR2, since G107R is located near F105 and R106, both of which are crucial for ligand binding. In cases of X-linked NDI, mutations in the AVPR2 gene are distributed widely. Thus, DNA analysis throughout the gene is of clinical value for the identification of female carriers, and it also gives precise information for genetic counseling.
