We describe a paediatric case of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) with a novel mutation in the arginine vasopressin receptor 2 gene (AVPR2) in the absence of a family history of congenital polyuria. The patient, a 5-month-old Caucasian boy, had failure to thrive and hypernatraemia. On admission to hospital, he had a plasma sodium of 171 mEq/L with a concomittant urine osmolality of 131 mOsm/kg. Molecular genetic analysis demonstrated that the patient had an AVPR2 mutation (c.861C > G) resulting in a substitution of tryptophan for serine at amino acid position 167 (p.Ser167Trp). His mother was heterozygous for the same Ser167Trp mutation which was found to be de novo from the DNA analysis of the maternal grandparents.
