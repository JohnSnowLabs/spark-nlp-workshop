To assess the factors influencing the development of diabetes insipidus after transsphenoidal surgery for pituitary adenomas.
We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of patients with pituitary adenoma who underwent transsphenoidal surgery. The pituitary gland was assessed using a 3.0Â T magnetic resonance imaging, and the predictors of postoperative diabetes insipidus were determined through univariate and multivariate analyses.
A total of 212 eligible patients with pituitary adenomas were included; 82 (38.7%) cases developed postoperative diabetes insipidus while 130 cases (61.3%) did not. Diabetes insipidus was transient in 80 (37.7%) patients and permanent in 2 (0.9%) patients. The results of logistic regression analyses showed that the change in cephalocaudal tumor cavity diameter after transsphenoidal surgery was associated with the occurrence of postoperative diabetes insipidus.
Change in cephalocaudal tumor cavity diameter after transsphenoidal surgery may play an important role in predicting diabetes insipidus onset in patients with a pituitary adenoma.
