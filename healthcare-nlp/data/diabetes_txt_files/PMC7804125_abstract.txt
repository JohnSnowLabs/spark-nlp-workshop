Based on questionnaires from 197,825 non-diabetic participants in a large Japanese cohort, we determined impact of (1) habit of exercise, (2) habit of active physical activity (PA) and (3) walking pace on new-onset of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Unadjusted and multivariable-adjusted logistic regression models were used to determine the odds ratio of new-onset diabetes mellitus incidence in a 3-year follow-up. There were two major findings. First, habits of exercise and active PA were positively associated with incidence of diabetes mellitus. Second, fast walking, even after adjusting for multiple covariates, was associated with low incidence of diabetes mellitus. In the subgroup analysis, the association was also observed in participants aged ≥ 65 years, in men, and in those with a body mass index ≥ 25. Results suggest that fast walking is a simple and independent preventive factor for new-onset of diabetes mellitus in the health check-up and guidance system in Japan. Future studies may be warranted to verify whether interventions involving walking pace can reduce the onset of diabetes in a nation-wide scale.
