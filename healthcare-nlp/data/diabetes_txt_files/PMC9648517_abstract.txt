Snakebite is a preventable yet often-neglected public health hazard with high chronic disability and mortality, mainly faced by rural communities in the tropics/subtropics. Endocrinological disorders following snakebite (especially Russell’s viper in India) are notably underrecognized and can lead to remarkable morbidity, poor quality of life, and cardiovascular mortality. Anterior pituitary insufficiency has been the most common ailment following Russell’s viper envenomation amid those endocrinological dysfunctions. On the contrary, the posterior pituitary and nearby hypothalamus mostly remain unharmed, so central diabetes insipidus is extremely rare following a viperid snakebite envenomation.
The authors present a patient developing panhypopituitarism with evident spontaneous central diabetes insipidus 29 years after Russell’s viper envenomation. Relevant investigations ruled out other possible etiologies, and he responded well to hormonal replacement therapy.
Panhypopituitarism with concurrent central diabetes insipidus may occur following snakebite (especially in Russell’s viper envenomation). Early recognition and proper management of these complications are quintessential to preventing further misdiagnosis, under-recognition, morbidity, impaired quality of life, and mortality.
