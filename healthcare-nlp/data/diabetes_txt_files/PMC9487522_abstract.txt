More than 10% of the worldâ€™s population already suffers from varying degrees of diabetes mellitus (DM), but there is still no cure for the disease. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is one of the most common and dangerous of the many health complications that can be brought on by DM, and has become the leading cause of death in people with diabetes. While research on DM and associated CVD is advancing, the specific mechanisms of their development are still unclear. Given the threat of DM and CVD to humans, the search for new predictive markers and therapeutic ideas is imminent. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) have been a popular subject of research in recent years. Although they do not encode proteins, they play an important role in living organisms, and they can cause disease when their expression is abnormal. Numerous studies have observed aberrant ncRNAs in patients with DM complications, suggesting that they may play an important role in the development of DM and CVD and could potentially act as biomarkers for diagnosis. There is additional evidence that treatment with existing drugs for DM, such as metformin, alters ncRNA expression levels, suggesting that regulation of ncRNA expression may be a key mechanism in future DM treatment. In this review, we assess the role of ncRNAs in the development of DM and CVD, as well as the evidence for ncRNAs as potential therapeutic targets, and make use of bioinformatics to analyze differential ncRNAs with potential functions in DM.
