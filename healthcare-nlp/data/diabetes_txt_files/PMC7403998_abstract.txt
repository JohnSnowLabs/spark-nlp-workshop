The prevalence of diabetes mellitus is rising among children and adolescents worldwide. Cardiovascular diseases are the main cause of morbidity and mortality in diabetic patients. We review the impact of diabetes on establishing, during childhood and adolescence, the premises for cardiovascular diseases later in life. Interestingly, it seems that hyperglycemia is not the only factor that establishes an increased cardiovascular risk in adolescence. Other factors have been recognized to play a role in triggering the onset of latent cardiovascular diseases in the pediatric population. Among these cardiovascular risk factors, some are modifiable: glucose variability, hypoglycemia, obesity, insulin resistance, waist circumference, hypertension, dyslipidemia, smoking alcohol, microalbuminuria and smoking. Others are unmodifiable, such as diabetes duration and family history. Among the etiological factors, subclinical endothelial dysfunction represents one of the earliest key players of atherosclerosis and it can be detected during early ages in patients with diabetes. A better assessment of cardiovascular risk in pediatric population still represents a challenge for clinicians, and thus further efforts are required to properly identify and treat pediatric patients who may suffer from cardiovascular disease later in early adulthood.
