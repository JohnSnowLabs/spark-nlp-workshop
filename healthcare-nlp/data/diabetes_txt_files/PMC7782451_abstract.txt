In recent years, a more stable AVP surrogate, called copeptin, has been used as an adjuvant diagnostic tool for dysnatremia in adults and appears to be promising even in the pediatric age. The aim of this study is to present the distribution of plasma copeptin in a large pediatric cohort and to observe the influence of fluid consumption and obesity on its values. A cohort of 128 children and adolescents was divided into two groups on the basis of nocturnal deprivation (group A) or free access to oral fluids in the 6–8 h before blood collection (group B). At all distribution percentiles, copeptin levels were higher (p < 0.0001) in group A, as were plasma sodium levels and osmolality (p = 0.02 and p = 0.008, respectively). The influence of BMI on copeptin levels was investigated by dividing the cohort into nonobese (group C) and obese children and adolescents (group D). Copeptin levels were higher in group D (p = 0.04).
Conclusion: The measurement of copeptin could represent a useful tool for the diagnostic pathway of dysnatremic conditions, but its interpretation should take into consideration the state of hydration. Furthermore, it could also be a promising marker for obesity and metabolic syndrome, although this hypothesis needs further studies to be confirmed.
