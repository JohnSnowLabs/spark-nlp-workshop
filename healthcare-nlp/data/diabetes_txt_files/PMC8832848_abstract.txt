COVID-19 affects multiple endocrine organ systems during the disease course. However, follow-up data post-COVID-19 is scarce; hitherto available limited data suggest that most of the biochemical endocrine dysfunctions observed during acute phase of COVID-19 tend to improve after recovery. Hence, we aim to provide a rational approach toward endocrine follow-up of patients during post-acute COVID-19.
We performed a literature review across PubMed/MEDLINE databaseÂ looking into the effects of COVID-19 on endocrine system and subsequent long-term endocrine sequelae. Accordingly, we have presented a practical set of recommendations regarding endocrine follow-up post-acute COVID-19.
COVID-19 can lead to new-onset hyperglycemia/diabetes mellitus or worsening of dysglycemia in patients with preexisting diabetes mellitus. Hence, those with preexisting diabetes mellitus should ensure optimum glycemic control in the post-COVID-19 period. New-onset diabetes mellitus has been described post-acute COVID-19; hence, a selected group of patients (aged <70 years and those requiring intensive care unit admission) may be screened for the same at 3 months. Thyroid dysfunction (euthyroid sick syndrome and atypical thyroiditis) and adrenal insufficiency have been described in COVID-19; however, thyroid/adrenal functions usually normalize on follow-up; hence, widespread screening post-acute COVID-19 should not be recommended. Pituitary apoplexy and male hypogonadism have rarely been documented in COVID-19; therefore, appropriate follow-up may be undertaken as per clinical context. Hypocalcemia during COVID-19 is not uncommon; however, routine estimation of serum calcium post-COVID-19 is not warranted.
The recommendations herein provide a rational approach that would be expected to guide physicians to better delineate and manage the endocrine sequelae during post-acute COVID-19.
