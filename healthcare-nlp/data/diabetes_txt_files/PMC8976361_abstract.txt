Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder that leads to the dysfunction of various tissues and organs, including eyes, kidneys, and cardiovascular system. According to the World Health Organization, diabetes prevalence is 8.8% globally among whom about 90% of cases are type 2 diabetes. There are not any significant clinical manifestations in the primary stages of diabetes. Therefore, screening can be an efficient way to reduce the diabetic complications. Over the recent decades, the prevalence of diabetes has increased alarmingly among the Middle East population, which has imposed exorbitant costs on the health care system in this region. Given that the genetic changes are among the important risk factors associated with predisposing people to diabetes, we examined the role of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the pathogenesis of diabetes among Middle East population. In the present review, we assessed the molecular pathology of diabetes in the Middle East population that paves the way for introducing an efficient SNP-based diagnostic panel for diabetes screening among the Middle East population. Since, the Middle East has a population of 370 million people; the current review can be a reliable model for the introduction of SNP-based diagnostic panels in other populations and countries around the world.
