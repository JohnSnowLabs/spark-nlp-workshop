Diabetes mellitus is a public health problem that affects millions of people worldwide regardless of age, sex, and ethnicity. Electrolyte disturbances may occur as a consequence of disease progression or its treatment, in particular potassium disorders. The prevalence of hypokalemia in diabetic individuals over 55 years of age is up to 1.2%. In patients with acute complications of diabetes, such as diabetic ketoacidosis, this prevalence is even higher. Potassium disorders, either hypokalemia or hyperkalemia, have been associated with increased all-cause mortality in diabetic individuals, especially in those with associated comorbidities, such as heart failure and chronic kidney disease. In this article, we discuss the main conditions for the onset of hypokalemia in diabetic individuals, briefly review the pathophysiology of acute complications of diabetes mellitus and their association with hypokalemia, the main signs, symptoms, and laboratory parameters for the diagnosis of hypokalemia, and the management of one of the most common electrolyte disturbances in clinical practice.
