The year 2020 witnessed a largely unprecedented pandemic of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by SARS COV-2. Many people with COVID-19 have comorbidities, including diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular diseases, which are significantly associated with worse outcomes. Moreover, COVID-19 itself is allied with deteriorating hyperglycemia. Therefore, Bangladesh Endocrine Society has formulated some practical recommendations for management of diabetes and other endocrine diseases in patients with COVID-19 for use in both primary and specialist care settings.
The objective of the article is to develop a guideline to protect the vulnerable group with utmost preference – the elderly and those with comorbid conditions. Therefore, to ensure the adequate protective measures and timely treatment for COVID-19 patients with diabetes, other endocrine diseases or any other comorbidities.
The risk of a fatal outcome from COVID-19 may be up to 50% higher in patients with diabetes than in non-diabetics.
Patients with diabetes and COVID had CFR 7.3–9.2%, compared with 0.9–1.4% in patients without comorbidities.
Diabetic ketoacidosis may be one of the causes of mortality in COVID-19.
There is wide fluctuation of blood glucose in these patients, probably due to irregular diet, reduced exercise, increased glucocorticoids secretion, and use of glucocorticoids.
HbA1c should be <7.0% for the majority of the patients, this target may be relaxed in appropriate clinical settings.
More emphasis should be given on day-to-day blood glucose levels. Hypoglycemia (<3.9 mmol/l) must be avoided.
Frequent monitoring of blood glucose is needed in critically ill patients.
The fight against COVID-19 has been proven to be a challenging one. Therefore, all healthcare personnel should make the best use of updated knowledge and skills to ensure adequate protective measures and timely treatment for COVID-19 patients with diabetes, other endocrine diseases or any other comorbidities.
