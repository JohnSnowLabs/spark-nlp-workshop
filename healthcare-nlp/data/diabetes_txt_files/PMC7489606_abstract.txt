Diabetes insipidus can be a common cause of polyuria and hydronephrosis in the kidneys. However, there is few reported case of urinary obstruction induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.
A 60-year-old Chinese man came to our hospital with the complaints of polydipsia and polyuria for 1 month. His examination showed chronic kidney disease stage III with eGFR of 48.274 ml/min, and the plasma osmolality was 338.00 mOsm/(kg·H2O) with a urinary osmolality of 163.00 mOsm/(kg·H2O). Moreover, imagological examination of the urinary system showed benign prostatic hyperplasia and hydronephrosis.
He was considered with benign prostatic hyperplasia induced ureter hydronephrosis and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.
He got the transurethral resection of the prostate to alleviate urinary retention.
After that, the urine output gradually decreased, and the administered hydrochlorothiazide was stopped due to the improved renal function.
Our study presents a case of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus caused by urinary obstruction. Differential diagnoses for diabetes insipidus as well as the relationship between nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and urinary obstruction are also considered in this study.
