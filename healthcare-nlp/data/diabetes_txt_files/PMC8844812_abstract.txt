This review addresses the role of the essential trace element, selenium, in type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and its metabolic co-morbidities, i.e., metabolic syndrome, obesity and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. We refer to the dietary requirements of selenium and the key physiological roles of selenoproteins. We explore the dysregulated fuel metabolism in T2DM and its co-morbidities, emphasizing the relevance of inflammation and oxidative stress. We describe the epidemiology of observational and experimental studies of selenium in diabetes and related conditions, explaining that the interaction between selenium status and glucose control is not limited to hyperglycemia but extends to hypoglycemia. We propose that the association between high plasma/serum selenium and T2DM/fasting plasma glucose observed in many cross-sectional studies may rely on the upregulation of hepatic selenoprotein-P biosynthesis in conditions of hyperglycemia and insulin resistance. While animal studies have revealed potential molecular mechanisms underlying adverse effects of severe selenium/selenoprotein excess and deficiency in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance and Î²-cell dysfunction, their translational significance is rather limited. Importantly, dietary selenium supplementation does not appear to be a major causal factor for the development of T2DM in humans though we cannot currently exclude a small contribution of selenium on top of other risk factors, in particular if it is ingested at high (supranutritional) doses. Elevated selenium biomarkers that are often measured in T2DM patients are more likely to be a consequence, rather than a cause, of diabetes.
