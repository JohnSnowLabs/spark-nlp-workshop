During the recent COVID-19 pandemic, the rapidly progressive shortage of intravenous sedative drugs led numerous intensive care units to look for potential alternatives in patients requiring mechanical ventilation for severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Inhalational sedation using the AnaConDa® device for sevoflurane administration is a possible option. In a 54-year-old COVID-19 patient with severe ARDS requiring extracorporeal membranous oxygenation (ECMO), sevoflurane on AnaConDa® device was administered for 8 days but was complicated by the development of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI). Other causes of NDI or central diabetes insipidus were reasonably excluded, as in other previously published cases of NDI in ICU patients receiving prolonged sevoflurane-based sedation. In addition, the postmortem examination suggested a lower expression of aquaporin-2 in renal tubules. This observation should prompt further investigations to elucidate the role of aquaporin-2 in sevoflurane-related NDI. Inhaled isoflurane sedation is a possible alternative.
