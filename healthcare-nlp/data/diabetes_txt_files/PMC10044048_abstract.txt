The elderly population with diabetes is diverse with the majority experiencing a decline in physical and mental capabilities, impacting the entire diabetes management process. Therefore, a need for geriatric-specific guidelines, especially for the Asian population, was identified and subsequently developed by an expert panel across government and private institutions from several Asian countries. The panel considered clinical evidence (landmark trials, position papers, expert opinions), recommendations from several important societies along with their decades of clinical experience and expertise, while meticulously devising thorough geriatric-specific tailored management strategies. The creation of the ABCDE best practices document underscores and explores the gaps and challenges and determines optimal methods for diabetes management of the elderly population in the Asian region.
