Background: Stroke remains a leading cause of death and disability throughout the world. It is well established that Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is a risk factor for stroke, while other risk factors include dyslipidaemia and hypertension. Given that the global prevalence of diabetes steadily increases, the need for adequate glycaemic control and prevention of DM-related cardiovascular events remains a challenge for the medical community. Therefore, a re-examination of the latest data related to this issue is of particular importance. Objective: This review aims to summarise the latest data on the relationship between DM and stroke, including epidemiology, risk factors, pathogenesis, prevention and biomarkers. Methods: For this purpose, comprehensive research was performed on the platforms PubMed, Google Scholar and EMBASE with a combination of the following keywords: diabetes mellitus, stroke, macrovascular complications, diabetic stroke, cardiovascular disease. Conclusions: Much progress has been made in stroke in people with DM in terms of prevention and early diagnosis. In the field of prevention, the adaptation of the daily habits and the regulation of co-morbidity of individuals play a particularly important role. Simultaneously, the most significant revolution has been brought by the relatively new treatment options that offer protection to the cardiovascular system. Moreover, many prognostic and diagnostic biomarkers have been identified, paving the way for early and accurate diagnoses. However, to date, there are crucial points that remain controversial and need further clarification.
