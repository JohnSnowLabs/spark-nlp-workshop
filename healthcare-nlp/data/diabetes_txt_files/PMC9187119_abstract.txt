Nowadays, diabetes mellitus is a serious public health problem in Ethiopia that has a profound impact on the health care system. However, no systematic synthesis and meta-analysis has been performed to depict the national prevalence. Hence, we authors aimed to assess the pooled prevalence of diabetes mellitus and its association with central obesity, overweight/obesity among adults in Ethiopia.
We did a systematic review and meta-analysis of 15 eligible studies on the national prevalence of DM and its association with central obesity, and overweight/obesity among adults in Ethiopia. We searched PubMed/Medline, Science Direct, Embase, and Google Scholar, from August 01 up to October 28, 2021, in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal tool was used to assess the quality of studies. Analysis was done using STATA version 14 software. Heterogeneity was checked using the I-squared test, and the publication bias was examined by funnel plot and eggers test. Moreover, Sensitivity analysis was done to check the influence of small studies on the outcome. The trim and fill analysis was performed to estimate the potentially missing articles because of publication bias.
Total of 15 studies that met the inclusion criteria were included and the pooled prevalence of diabetes mellitus of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia was 6.26 (95%CI: 4.74–7.78). In the subgroup analysis, the prevalence of diabetes mellitus among the studies conducted in 2017 and before was 4.56 (95%CI: 2.98–6.14) but in studies done after 2017 was 7.55(95%CI: 4.69–10.41). The burden of diabetes mellitus was 5.79 times higher among those adults who had central obesity (OR = 5.79; 95%CI; 3.14–10.70), 5.70 times higher among adults who had overweight/obesity (OR = 5.70, 95%CI: 3.35–9.70).
The national prevalence of diabetes mellitus among adults in Ethiopia was higher and associated with central obesity, and overweight/obesity. Hence, the government of Ethiopia and stakeholders should give attention to strengthen the current health system regarding non-communicable diseases like diabetes mellitus and obesity/overweight.
