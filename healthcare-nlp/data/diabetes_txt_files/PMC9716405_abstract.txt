Sarcoidosis is an inflammatory, multisystem disease with an undetermined etiology. The presence of noncaseating granulomas in involved organs is a characteristic pathomorphological feature. Sarcoidosis, like a chameleon, can mimic different medical conditions. Although the lungs are most commonly involved, extrapulmonary manifestations can influence any system. The clinical course of the disease may differ. Immediate initiation of glucocorticosteroid therapy is important when critical organs are impaired. A case of a patient with sarcoidosis whose first clinical symptoms were related to diabetes insipidus (DI) was presented. The diagnosis of multiple organ sarcoidosis was delayed because of an adequate response to treatment with vasopressin. The multidisciplinary diagnostic approach validated the involvement of the pituitary gland, lungs, lymph nodes, bones, and subcutaneous tissue. The presented case emphasizes the critical importance of the multifaceted differential diagnosis of patients with DI.
Sarcoidosis usually affects the lung but can also be a multisystemic disease.
The assessment of the extension of sarcoidosis remains complex.
A multidisciplinary approach must identify all-organ involvement and initiate appropriate sarcoidosis treatment.
Diabetes insipidus (DI) can be the first symptom of a systemic granulomatous disorder.
In the differential diagnosis of DI, a comprehensive assessment of rare causes of endocrine disorders, including extrapulmonary sarcoidosis, should be considered.
