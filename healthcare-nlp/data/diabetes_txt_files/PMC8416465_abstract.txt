The presence of hypertension (HTN) in type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) is a common phenomenon in more than half of the diabetic patients. Since HTN constitutes a predictor of vascular complications and cardiovascular disease in type 2 DM patients, it is of significance to understand the molecular and cellular mechanisms of type 2 DM binding to HTN. This review attempts to understand the mechanism via the perspective of the metabolites. It reviewed the metabolic perturbations, the biological function of perturbated metabolites in two diseases, and the mechanism underlying metabolic perturbation that contributed to the connection of type 2 DM and HTN. DM-associated metabolic perturbations may be involved in the pathogenesis of HTN potentially in insulin, angiotensin II, sympathetic nervous system, and the energy reprogramming to address how perturbated metabolites in type 2 DM affect the pathogenesis of HTN. The recent integration of the metabolism field with microbiology and immunology may provide a wider perspective. Metabolism affects immune function and supports immune cell differentiation by the switch of energy. The diverse metabolites produced by bacteria modified the biological process in the inflammatory response of chronic metabolic diseases either. The rapidly evolving metabolomics has enabled to have a better understanding of the process of diseases, which is an important tool for providing some insight into the investigation of diseases mechanism. Metabolites served as direct modulators of biological processes were believed to assess the pathological mechanisms involved in diseases.
