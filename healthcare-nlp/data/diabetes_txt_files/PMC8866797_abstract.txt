A 21-year-old Japanese man without known diabetes mellitus had abdominal pain. The diagnosis was ketoacidosis and hypertriglyceridemia-induced acute pancreatitis. He had polydipsia and polyuria and had habitually drunk several soft drinks every day for two years. After hospitalization, despite adequate liquid intake, dehydration remained with hypotonic polyuria. Further examinations revealed the coexistence of central diabetes insipidus (CDI), possibly caused by lymphocytic infundibulo-neurohypophysitis, based on anti-rabphilin-3A antibody positivity. Although CDI had been undiagnosed for two years, over-consumption of sugar-rich soft drinks to ease thirst caused ketoacidosis, hypertriglyceridemia, and acute pancreatitis. There are no previous reports of this three-part combination of symptoms caused by CDI.
