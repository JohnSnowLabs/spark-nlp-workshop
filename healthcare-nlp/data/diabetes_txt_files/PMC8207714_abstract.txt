Treatment of diabetes mellitus has majorly improved over the past century, however, the disease burden is high and its prevalence still expanding. Further insight in the diabetes population is imperative to improve the quality of diabetes care by enhancement of knowledge-based diabetes management strategies. To this end, in 2017 a Dutch nationwide consortium of diabetologists, paediatric endocrinologists, and diabetes patients has founded a national outpatient diabetes care registry named Dutch Pediatric and Adult Registry of Diabetes (DPARD). We aim to describe the implementation of DPARD and to provide an overview of the characteristics of patients included during the first 2 years.
For the DPARD cohort with long-term follow-up of observational nature, hospital data are gathered directly from electronic health records and securely transferred and stored. DPARD provides weekly updated clinical information on the diabetes population care on a hospital-level benchmarked against the national average.
Between November 2017 and January 2020, 20,857 patients were included from 8 (11%) Dutch hospitals with a level of care distribution representative of all diabetic outpatients in the Netherlands. Among patients with known diabetes type, 41% had type 1 diabetes, 51% type 2 diabetes, and 8% had diabetes due to other causes. Characteristics of the total patient population were similar to patients with unknown diabetes classification. HbA1c levels decreased over the years, while BMI levels showed an increase over time.
The national DPARD registry aims to facilitate investigation of prevalence and long-term outcomes of Dutch outpatients with diabetes mellitus and their treatment, thus allowing for quality improvement of diabetes care as well as allowing for comparison of diabetes care on an international level.
