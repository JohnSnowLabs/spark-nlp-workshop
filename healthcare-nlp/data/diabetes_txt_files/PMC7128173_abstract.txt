A 6-year-old male neutered cat presented with blindness, lethargy, polydipsia, hyposthenuria and severe hypernatraemia. Central diabetes insipidus was demonstrated by means of a low measured anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) concentration in the face of hypernatraemia, and clinical response to supplementation with desmopressin. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed a discrete mass in the region of the hypothalamus. The cat was euthanased and post-mortem histological examination demonstrated B cell lymphoma involving the brain, optic nerves, urinary bladder wall and diaphragm. To the authors’ knowledge, this case report is the first to describe central diabetes insipidus caused by central nervous system lymphoma in the cat.
