Diabetes mellitus is common and growing in prevalence, and an increasing proportion of people with diabetes are living to older age. Frailty is, therefore, becoming an important concept in diabetes. Frailty is associated with older age and describes a state of increased susceptibility to decompensation in response to physiological stress. A range of measures have been used to quantify frailty. This systematic review aims to identify measures used to quantify frailty in people with diabetes (any type); to summarise the prevalence of frailty in diabetes; and to describe the relationship between frailty and adverse clinical outcomes in people with diabetes.
Three electronic databases (Medline, Embase and Web of Science) will be searched from 2000 to November 2019 and supplemented by citation searching of relevant articles and hand searching of reference lists. Two reviewers will independently review titles, abstracts and full texts. Inclusion criteria include: (1) adults with any type of diabetes mellitus; (2) quantify frailty using any validated frailty measure; (3) report the prevalence of frailty and/or the association between frailty and clinical outcomes in people with diabetes; (4) studies that assess generic (eg, mortality, hospital admission and falls) or diabetes-specific outcomes (eg, hypoglycaemic episodes, cardiovascular events, diabetic nephropathy and diabetic retinopathy); (5) cross-sectional and longitudinal observational studies. Study quality will be assessed using the Newcastleâ€“Ottawa Scale for observational studies. Clinical and methodological heterogeneity will be assessed, and a random effects meta-analysis performed if appropriate. Otherwise, a narrative synthesis will be performed.
This manuscript describes the protocol for a systematic review of observational studies and does not require ethical approval.
