A 60-year-old man presented to our hospital because of febrile neutropenia due to chemotherapy for his metastasized colon cancer. During hospital stay, polyuria and polydipsia were noted. He reported that his thirst had become increasingly intolerable over the last weeks. Diabetes mellitus was diagnosed. Polyuria and polydipsia persisted despite euglycemia under insulin treatment. Because of thirst and high urine volumes during the night, diabetes insipidus was suspected. Endocrinological work up revealed complete panhypopituitarism with impairment of all anterior and posterior axes. After substitution with hydrocortisone, levothyroxine and desmopressin symptoms resolved. MRI of the brain revealed one round, contrast enhancing lesion in the pituitary stalk and one in the pineal gland. Because of extensive extracerebral metastasis and poor performance status, the patient opted for radiation therapy only. He died 2.5Â months later due to non-cerebral manifestations of his cancer before cerebral radiotherapy could be initiated.
