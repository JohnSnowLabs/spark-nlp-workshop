Impaired digital reactive hyperaemia and flicker-stimulated retinal vascular response are commonly reported risk markers of cardiovascular disease. This is the first study to determine the correlation of these risk markers with diabetes mellitus by comparing our novel flicker-modulated ECG-gated fundoscope with the EndoPAT2000 system.
In total, 119 controls and 120 participants with diabetes mellitus partook in this cross-sectional study. The EndoPAT2000 system assessed digital reactive hyperaemia under fasting conditions. A mydriatic ECG-gated fundoscope with a novel flicker module acquired digital retinal images of the left eye before, during and after flicker stimulation. An inhouse semi-automated software measured retinal vessel diameters using a validated protocol with two observers repeating measurements in a subset of 10 controls and 10 participants with diabetes mellitus. Intra- and inter-observer reliability analyses occurred by the interclass correlation coefficient. A receiver operating characteristic curve established associations of variables with diabetes mellitus.
Diabetes mellitus was more strongly associated with flicker-stimulated retinal arteriolar calibre change from baseline (AUC 0.81, 95% CI 0.75–0.87, p < 0.0001) than reactive hyperaemia index. Median flicker-stimulated arteriolar calibre change from baseline (controls: 2.74%, IQR 1.07 vs diabetes mellitus: 1.64%, IQR 1.25, p < 0.0001) and reactive hyperaemia index (controls: 1.87, IQR 0.81 vs diabetes mellitus: 1.60, IQR 0.81, p = 0.003) were lower in diabetes mellitus than controls. Intra- and inter-observer reliability coefficients were high from 0.87 to 0.93.
Impaired flicker-stimulated retinal arteriolar calibre change from baseline is more highly correlated with diabetes mellitus in this study than a reduced reactive hyperaemia index.
