Periodontitis has been associated with many systemic diseases and conditions, including metabolic syndrome. Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of conditions that occur concomitantly and together they increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and double the risk of type 2 diabetes. In this review, we focus on the association between metabolic syndrome and periodontitis; however, we also include information on diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease, since these two conditions are significantly intertwined with metabolic syndrome. With regard to periodontitis and metabolic syndrome, to date, the vast majority of studies point to an association between these two conditions and also demonstrate that periodontitis can contribute to the development of, or can worsen, metabolic syndrome. Evaluating the effect of metabolic syndrome on the salivary microbiome, data presented herein support the hypothesis that the salivary bacterial profile is altered in metabolic syndrome patients compared with healthy patients. Considering periodontitis and these three conditions, the vast majority of human and animal studies point to an association between periodontitis and metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Moreover, there is evidence to suggest that metabolic syndrome and diabetes can alter the oral microbiome. However, more studies are needed to fully understand the influence these conditions have on each other.
