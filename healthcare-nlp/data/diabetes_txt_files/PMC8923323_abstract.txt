In recent years, numerous studies have explored the quality of life (QoL) in those with diabetes mellitus. The aim of this scoping review was to explore the current state of knowledge on QoL and its various associated factors among people with diabetes in India. Three databases were searched (PubMed, Scopus, and Medline) and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed. A total of 41 articles were included in the review. The included studies were largely conducted in the Southern states and mainly investigated individuals with type 2 diabetes. The World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL-BREF) and Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) were the instruments used most often. In general, the studies showed that people with diabetes had poorer QoL than those without diabetes, and women with diabetes reported poorer QoL than men, consistent with findings across the world. However, the studies had significant methodological flaws which limit the validity and generalizability of the findings. Therefore, there is an urgent need to conduct high-quality QoL studies which are representative of all states of India as well as different types of diabetes in India in order to address this gap in the evidence.
