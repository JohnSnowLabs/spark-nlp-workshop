Our aim was to identify serum microRNAs (miRNAs) in healthy humans which associate with future onset of both diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease. We performed global profiling of 753 mature human miRNAs in serum of 12 pilot subjects followed by measurement of 47 consistently expressed miRNAs in fasting serum of 553 healthy subjects from the baseline exam (1991–1994) of the population based Malmö Diet and Cancer Study Cardiovascular Cohort (MDC-CC), of whom 140 developed diabetes, and 169 cardiovascular diseases during follow-up. We used multivariate logistic regression to test individual miRNAs for association with incident diabetes and cardiovascular disease as compared to control subjects (n = 259). After Bonferroni correction and adjustment for age and sex, each SD increment of log-transformed miR-483-5p was significantly associated with both incident diabetes (OR = 1.48; 95% CI 1.18–1.84, P = 0.001) and cardiovascular disease (OR = 1.40; 95% CI 1.15, 1.72, P = 0.001). In cross sectional analysis, miR-483-5p was correlated with BMI (r = 0.162, P = 0.0001), fasting insulin (r = 0.156, P = 0.0002), HDL (r = -0.099, P = 0.02) and triglycerides (r = 0.11, P = 0.01). Adjustment for these metabolic risk factors, as well as traditional risk factors attenuated the miR-483-5p association with incident diabetes (OR = 1.28 95% CI 1.00–1.64, P = 0.049) whereas its association with incident cardiovascular disease remained virtually unchanged (OR = 1.46 95% CI, 1.18–1.81, P = 0.0005). In conclusion, miR-483-5p associates with both diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The association with diabetes seems partly mediated by obesity and insulin resistance, whereas the association with incident cardiovascular disease is independent of these metabolic factors and traditional cardiovascular disease risk factors.
