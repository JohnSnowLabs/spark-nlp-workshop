Lymphocytic hypophysitis is a rare inflammatory disorder in the pituitary gland. The lesion is usually confined to the adenohypophysis. Although the involvement of the posterior pituitary gland or the stalk is rare, such patients with diabetes insipidus have been reported. Surgery has been used to make the definitive diagnosis. Recent studies suggest, however, that the pathologic diagnosis may not be necessary always. We reported a case of Lymphocytic hypophysitis managed by methylprednisolone pulse therapy. A 50-year-old premenopausal woman with Lymphocytic hypophysitis and diabetes insipidus was treated with methylprednisolone pulse therapy. Her adenopituitary lesion disappeared and the diabetes insipidus resolved. The optimal management for patients with lymphocytic hypophysitis may be the high index of the suspicion prior to the extensive surgical resection. In addition, methylprednisolone pulse therapy may improve the clinical and MRI findings.
