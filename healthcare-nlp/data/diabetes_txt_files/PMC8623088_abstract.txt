Wolfram syndrome (WS), also known as a DIDMOAD (diabetes insipidus, early-onset diabetes mellitus, optic nerve atrophy and deafness) is a rare autosomal disorder caused by mutations in the Wolframin1 (WFS1) gene. Previous studies have revealed that glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP1 RA) are effective in delaying and restoring blood glucose control in WS animal models and patients. The GLP1 RA liraglutide has also been shown to have neuroprotective properties in aged WS rats. WS is an early-onset, chronic condition. Therefore, early diagnosis and lifelong pharmacological treatment is the best solution to control disease progression. Hence, the aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the long-term liraglutide treatment on the progression of WS symptoms. For this purpose, 2-month-old WS rats were treated with liraglutide up to the age of 18 months and changes in diabetes markers, visual acuity, and hearing sensitivity were monitored over the course of the treatment period. We found that treatment with liraglutide delayed the onset of diabetes and protected against vision loss in a rat model of WS. Therefore, early diagnosis and prophylactic treatment with the liraglutide may also prove to be a promising treatment option for WS patients by increasing the quality of life.
