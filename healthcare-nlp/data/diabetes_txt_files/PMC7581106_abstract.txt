Some diseases contribute to hypopituitarism without clinical manifestations and the glucocorticoid therapy may unveil central diabetes insipidus. The condition is rare and usually causes problems for clinical physicians.
A 59-year-old woman presented to our hospital due to facial numbness and persistent eyelid heaviness.
Physical examination and cerebrospinal fluid examination supported a diagnosis of Guillain–Barré syndrome. Magnetic resonance imaging showed an empty sella. Hormone test indicated hypopituitarism.
The patient received intravenous immunoglobulin and glucocorticoid. Central diabetes insipidus appeared after 20 days. Subsequently, the patient was prescribed 1-desamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin and prednisone.
During 6 months’ follow-up, the patient's urine output was gradually reduced to normal level.
This case indicated that hypopituitarism may be caused by an empty sella and be masked by adrenal insufficiency. Central diabetes insipidus may present after glucocorticoid therapy.
