We report a case of a 17-year-old male who presented with pain in his right first toe. His pain and swelling had worsened and x-rays of his foot revealed erosive changes of the great toe distal phalanx suggesting possible osteomyelitis. His co-morbidities were morbid obesity and diabetes insipidus. He was admitted to the hospital, blood cultures were drawn, and he was started on vancomycin for presumed bacterial osteomyelitis. He underwent incision and drainage of the fluctuant abscess of the toe, where a culture of the wound was taken. Preliminary results grew fungi. Being located in an endemic area, he was started on anti-fungal treatment for presumed disseminated coccidioidomycosis; culture was positive for Coccidiodes immitis. He also had serology positive for coccidioidomycosis titers. He had uneventful hospital stay and was discharged on long-term oral antifungal therapy.
