The research has correlated the risk factors of herpes zoster with some chronic diseases. This meta-analysis aimed to assess the incidence of herpes zoster in patients with diabetes mellitus.
We conducted a literature search using Web of Science and PubMed for articles published from January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2019. The incidence rate ratio and 95% confidence interval for herpes zoster associated with diabetes mellitus was calculated.
We included 5 cohort studies for a meta-analysis. The pooled incidences of herpes zoster in patients with diabetes mellitus and in patients without diabetes mellitus were 7.22 and 4.12 per 1000 person-years. The overall risk of developing herpes zoster was significantly higher in patients with diabetes mellitus when compared to those with no diabetes mellitus (incidence rate ratio = 1.60, 95% confidence interval = 1.33–1.93).
Patients with diabetes mellitus are substantially at increased risk for the development of herpes zoster. Patients with diabetes mellitus should take into consideration the vaccination to prevent herpes zoster.
