Diabetes mellitus is closely related to oral health. We aimed to determine the relationship between diabetes mellitus and tooth extraction due to periodontal disease and dental caries. Japanâ€™s second nationwide survey data collected from 4 June to 10 June 2018 was used to identify reasons for tooth extraction among patients aged > 40 years. General dentists collected information on patients who underwent tooth extraction procedures, and the presence of diabetes mellitus was determined through interviews. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to investigate the relationship between diabetes mellitus and the reasons for tooth extraction, including periodontal disease and dental caries. In total, 2345 dentists responded to the survey (response rate 44.8%). We analyzed data on 4625 extracted teeth from 3750 patients (1815 males and 1935 females). Among patients with self-reported diabetes mellitus, 55.4% had extractions due to periodontal disease compared to 46.7% of such extractions among those without self-reported diabetes mellitus. Self-reported diabetes mellitus was significantly associated with tooth extraction due to periodontal disease. No significant differences were observed in dental caries according to self-reported diabetes mellitus status. This study provides further evidence of a significant association between diabetes mellitus and tooth extraction due to periodontal disease.
