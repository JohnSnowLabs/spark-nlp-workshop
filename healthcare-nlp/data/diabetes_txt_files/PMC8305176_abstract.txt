Many approaches have been used in the effective management of type 2 diabetes mellitus. A recent paradigm shift has focused on the role of adipose tissues in the development and treatment of the disease. Brown adipose tissues (BAT) and white adipose tissues (WAT) are the two main types of adipose tissues with beige subsets more recently identified. They play key roles in communication and insulin sensitivity. However, WAT has been shown to contribute significantly to endocrine function. WAT produces hormones and cytokines, collectively called adipocytokines, such as leptin and adiponectin. These adipocytokines have been proven to vary in conditions, such as metabolic dysfunction, type 2 diabetes, or inflammation. The regulation of fat storage, energy metabolism, satiety, and insulin release are all features of adipose tissues. As such, they are indicators that may provide insights on the development of metabolic dysfunction or type 2 diabetes and can be considered routes for therapeutic considerations. The essential roles of adipocytokines vis-a-vis satiety, appetite, regulation of fat storage and energy, glucose tolerance, and insulin release, solidifies adipose tissue role in the development and pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus and the complications associated with the disease.
