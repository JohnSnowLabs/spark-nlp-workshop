The global management of diabetes mellitus (DM) involves the administration of recommended anti-diabetic drugs in addition to a non-sedentary lifestyle upon diagnosis. Despite the success recorded from these synthetic drugs, the traditional method of treatment using medicinal plants is increasingly accepted by the locals due to its low cost and the perceived no side effects. Helichrysum species are used in folk medicine and are documented for the treatment of DM in different regions of the world. This study reviews Helichrysum species and its compoundsâ€™ activities in the management of DM. An extensive literature search was carried out, utilizing several scientific databases, ethnobotanical books, theses, and dissertations. About twenty-two Helichrysum species were reported for the treatment of diabetes in different regions of the world. Among these Helichrysum species, only fifteen have been scientifically investigated for their antidiabetic activities, and twelve compounds were identified as bioactive constituents for diabetes. This present review study will be a useful tool for scientists and health professionals working in the field of pharmacology and therapeutics to develop potent antidiabetic drugs that are devoid of side effects.
