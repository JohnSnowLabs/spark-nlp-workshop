Aquaporins (AQPs) are among the best structural-characterized membrane proteins, fulfilling the role of allowing water flux across cellular membranes. Thus far, 34 single amino acid polymorphisms have been reported in HUMSAVAR for human aquaporins as disease-related. They affect AQP2, AQP5 and AQP8, where they are associated with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, keratoderma and colorectal cancer, respectively. For half of these mutations, although they are mostly experimentally characterized in their dysfunctional phenotypes, a structural characterization at a molecular level is still missing. In this work, we focus on such mutations and discuss what the structural defects are that they appear to cause. To achieve this aim, we built a 3D molecular model for each mutant and explored the effect of the mutation on all of their structural features. Based on these analyses, we could collect the structural defects of all the pathogenic mutations (here or previously analysed) under few main categories, that we found to nicely correlate with the experimental phenotypes reported for several of the analysed mutants. Some of the structural analyses we present here provide a rationale for previously experimentally observed phenotypes. Furthermore, our comprehensive overview can be used as a reference frame for the interpretation, on a structural basis, of defective phenotypes of other aquaporin pathogenic mutants.
