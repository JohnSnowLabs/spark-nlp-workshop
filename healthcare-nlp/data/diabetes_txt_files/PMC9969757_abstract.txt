There is increased interest related to the impact of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) on the endocrine system and in particular on the pituitary gland. Over the course of the severe infection with acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), there are both acute and delayed effects on the pituitary, related to infection and/or treatment. Hypopituitarism, pituitary apoplexy and hypophysitis have been all reported, as well as arginine vasopressin deficiency (diabetes insipidus) and syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion. Furthermore, patients with acromegaly, Cushingâ€™s disease and hypopituitarism are theoretically at increased risk of complications with COVID-19 and require close monitoring. Evidence regarding pituitary dysfunction in patients with COVID-19 continues to be gathered, as the breadth and depth of knowledge also continues to rapidly evolve. This review summarizes data analysis to date on the possible effects of COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccination on patients with normal pituitary function and patients with known pituitary pathology. Though clinical systems were significantly affected, it seems there is no overall loss of biochemical control in patients with certain pituitary pathologies.
