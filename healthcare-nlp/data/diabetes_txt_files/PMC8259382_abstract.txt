Type 2 diabetes mellitus and breast cancer are complex, chronic, heterogeneous, and multi-factorial diseases; with common risk factors including but not limited to diet, obesity, and age. They also share mutually inclusive phenotypic features such as the metabolic deregulations resulting from hyperglycemia, hypoxic conditions and hormonal imbalances. Although, the association between diabetes and cancer has long been speculated; however, the exact molecular nature of this link remains to be fully elucidated. Both the diseases are leading causes of death worldwide and a causal relationship between the two if not addressed, may translate into a major global health concern. Previous studies have hypothesized hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, hormonal imbalances and chronic inflammation, as some of the possible grounds for explaining how diabetes may lead to cancer initiation, yet further research still needs to be done to validate these proposed mechanisms. At the crux of this dilemma, hyperglycemia and hypoxia are two intimately related states involving an intricate level of crosstalk and hypoxia inducible factor 1, at the center of this, plays a key role in mediating an aggressive disease state, particularly in solid tumors such as breast cancer. Subsequently, elucidating the role of HIF1 in establishing the diabetes-breast cancer link on hypoxia-hyperglycemia axis may not only provide an insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the association but also, illuminate on the prognostic outcome of the therapeutic targeting of HIF1 signaling in diabetic patients with breast cancer or vice versa. Hence, this review highlights the critical role of HIF1 signaling in patients with both T2DM and breast cancer, potentiates its significance as a prognostic marker in comorbid patients, and further discusses the potential prognostic outcome of targeting HIF1, subsequently establishing the pressing need for HIF1 molecular profiling-based patient selection leading to more effective therapeutic strategies emerging from personalized medicine.
