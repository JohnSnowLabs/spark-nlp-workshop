The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus has increased in the past decades. We investigated the prevalence of diabetes and its awareness, treatment, and control among adult residents of Tehran.
We used the recruitment phase data of the Tehran Cohort study, enrolling a random sample of adult residents of Tehran aged ≥35 years. Diabetes was defined as self-report, current use of glucose-lowering medications, and/or fasting plasma glucose (FPG) ≥126mg/dl. Impaired fasting glucose (IFG) was defined as an FPG of 100-125mg/dl. Awareness was defined as diabetes self-report, treatment as receiving glucose-lowering medications, and glycemic control as FPG <126mg/dl. The age- and sex-weighted estimates were calculated using the 2016 national census. Logistic regression models were used to determine the factors associated with diabetes awareness, treatment, and control.
A total of 8151 participants were included. Age- and sex-weighted prevalence of diabetes mellitus and IFG were 16.7% (95% CI: 15.1–18.4) and 25.1% (95% CI: 23.1–27.1), respectively. Diabetes was more prevalent in the eastern and central districts of Tehran. Advanced age (OR per 1-year increase: 1.026, 95% CI: 1.021-1.030), male sex (OR: 1.716, 95% CI: 1.543-1.909), higher BMI levels (OR for BMI ≥35 vs. <20 kg/m2: 4.852, 95% CI: 3.365-6.998), pre-existing hypertension (OR: 1.552, 95% CI: 1.378-1.747), dyslipidemia (OR: 1.692, 95% CI: 1.521-1.883), and chronic kidney disease (OR: 1.650, 95% CI: 1.019-2.673) were associated with an increased odds of diabetes mellitus. On the contrary, diabetes mellitus was less likely in current tobacco (OR: 0.872, 95% CI: 0.765-0.994) and alcohol users (OR: 0.836, 95% CI: 0.703-0.994) compared to non-users. Among diabetic individuals, 82.8% were aware of their condition, 71.9% received treatment, and 31.7% of treated patients had adequate glycemic control. Advanced age and pre-existing comorbidities, including hypertension and dyslipidemia, were associated with higher diabetes awareness and treatment. Furthermore, advanced age, higher levels of education, and female sex were determinants of better glycemic control among treated diabetic participants.
There is a high prevalence of diabetes and IFG among adult residents of Tehran. Additionally, more than two-thirds of treated diabetics living in Tehran remain uncontrolled.
