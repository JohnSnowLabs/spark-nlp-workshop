The Asian-Indian phenotype of type 2 diabetes mellitus is uniquely characterized for cardio-metabolic risk. In the context of implementing patient-centric holistic cardio-metabolic risk management as a priority, the choice of various combinations of antidiabetic agents should be individualized. Combined therapy with two classes of antidiabetic agents, namely, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors and sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors, target several pathophysiological pathways. The wide-ranging clinical outcomes associated with this combination, including improvement of glycemia and adiposity, reduction of metabolic and vascular risk, safety, and simplicity for sustainable compliance, are extremely relevant to the Asian Indian patient population living with T2DM. In this review we describe the available evidence in detail and present a rational practical guidance for the optimum clinical use of this combination in this patient population.
