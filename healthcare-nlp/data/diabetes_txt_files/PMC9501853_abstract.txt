The main characteristic feature of diabetes mellitus is the disturbance of carbohydrate, lipid, and protein metabolism, which results in insulin insufficiency and can also lead to insulin resistance. Both the acute and chronic diabetic cases are increasing at an exponential rate, which is also flagged by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Diabetes Federation (IDF). Treatment of diabetes mellitus with synthetic drugs often fails to provide desired results and limits its use to symptomatic treatment only. This has resulted in the exploration of alternative medicine, of which herbal treatment is gaining popularity these days. Owing to their safety benefits, treatment compliance, and ability to exhibit effects without disturbing internal homeostasis, research in the field of herbal and ayurvedic treatments has gained importance. Medicinal phytoconstituents include micronutrients, amino acids, proteins, mucilage, critical oils, triterpenoids, saponins, carotenoids, alkaloids, flavonoids, phenolic acids, tannins, and coumarins, which play a dynamic function in the prevention and treatment of diabetes mellitus. Alkaloids found in medicinal plants represent an intriguing potential for the inception of novel approaches to diabetes mellitus therapies. Thus, this review article highlights detailed information on alkaloidal phytoconstituents, which includes sources and structures of alkaloids along with the associated mechanism involved in the management of diabetes mellitus. From the available literature and data presented, it can be concluded that these compounds hold tremendous potential for use as monotherapies or in combination with current treatments, which can result in the development of better efficacy and safety profiles.
