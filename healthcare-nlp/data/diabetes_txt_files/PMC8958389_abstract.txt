Peptide drugs play an important role in diabetes mellitus treatment. Oral administration of peptide drugs is a promising strategy for diabetes mellitus because of its convenience and high patient compliance compared to parenteral administration routes. However, there are a series of formidable unfavorable conditions present in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract after oral administration, which result in the low oral bioavailability of these peptide drugs. To overcome these challenges, various nanoparticles (NPs) have been developed to improve the oral absorption of peptide drugs due to their unique in vivo properties and high design flexibility. This review discusses the unfavorable conditions present in the GI tract and provides the corresponding strategies to overcome these challenges. The review provides a comprehensive overview on the NPs that have been constructed for oral peptide drug delivery in diabetes mellitus treatment. Finally, we will discuss the rational application and give some suggestions that can be utilized for the development of oral peptide drug NPs. Our aim is to provide a systemic and comprehensive review of oral peptide drug NPs that can overcome the challenges in GI tract for efficient treatment of diabetes mellitus.
