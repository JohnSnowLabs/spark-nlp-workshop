Copeptin derives from the same precursor peptide preprovasopressin as arginine vasopressin (AVP). The secretion of both peptides is stimulated by similar physiological processes, such as osmotic stimulation, hypovolemia, or stress. AVP is difficult to measure due to complex preanalytical requirements and due to technical difficulties. In the last years, copeptin was found to be a stable, sensitive, and simple to measure surrogate marker of AVP release. Different immunoassays exist to measure copeptin. The 2 assays which have most often be used in clinical studies are the original sandwich immunoluminometric assay and its automated immunofluorescent successor. In addition, various enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay have been developed. With the availability of the copeptin assay, the differential diagnosis of diabetes insipidus was recently revisited. The goal for this article is therefore to first review the physiology of copeptin, and second to describe its use as marker for the differential diagnosis of vasopressin-dependent fluid disorders, mainly diabetes insipidus but also hyper- and hyponatremia. Furthermore, we highlight the role of copeptin as prognostic marker in other acute and chronic diseases.
