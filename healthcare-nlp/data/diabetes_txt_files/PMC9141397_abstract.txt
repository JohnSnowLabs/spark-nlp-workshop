Indonesia is currently undergoing an epidemiological transition, with the double burden of disease due to increasing industrialization and urbanization leading to an increase in the prevalence of non-communicable diseases such as obesity and diabetes. On the other hand, the prevalence of infectious diseases such as tuberculosis remains high. Several factors were considered as risk factors in tuberculosis coincidence with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The purpose of this study was to develop a predictive index for tuberculosis in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients based on their biological, social, and environmental factors, and their psychological well-being as well. This case-control study involved 492 respondents consisting of 246 type 2 diabetes mellitus patients The variables studied were biological and social factors, the quality of their housing, and psychological well-being. Data analysis was conducted using a logistic regression test. The results showed that the predictive index formula was as follows: −3.218 + 0.867 × age + 1.339 × sex + 1.493 × history of contact with previous patient + 1.089 × glycemic control + 1.622 × tuberculosis clinical symptoms + 1.183 × body mass index + 0.891 × duration of diabetes mellitus + 0.454 × area of ventilation + 0.583 × psychological well-being. It is suggested that health workers, especially in primary health care facilities, will be able to increase the awareness of the risk of the coincidence of diabetes mellitus with tuberculosis.
