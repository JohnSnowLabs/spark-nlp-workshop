Dickkopf-1 (DKK-1) is a major inhibitor of Wingless protein signaling pathway, which is involved in glucose metabolism and cardiovascular diseases. The aim of the study was to investigate the changes of serum DKK-1 levels after hypoglycemic treatments and the relationship between DKK-1 and clinical parameters.
The study was a sub-study of a previously published clinical trial (the effect of Acarbose on glycemic variability in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus using premixed insulin compared to metformin). All subjects underwent anthropometric and biochemical assessments at baseline and endpoint. Serum DKK-1 levels of 92 subjects were measured at baseline and after 12-week hypoglycemic treatment.
DKK-1 levels were significantly decreased after hypoglycemic treatment for 12 weeks (P < 0.001). ΔDKK-1 levels were not correlated with improvement of metabolic parameters (all P > 0.05) but were negatively correlated with baseline DKK-1 levels (r = −0.263, P = 0.011). Spearman correlation showed that baseline DKK-1 levels were positively related to baseline total cholesterol (r = 0.226, P = 0.030) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (r = 0.277, P = 0.007). Compared with the higher baseline DKK-1 group (≥3700 pg/mL), subjects in the lower baseline DKK-1 group (<3700 pg/mL) had significantly lower baseline glycated hemoglobin A1c levels (P = 0.008) and LDL-C levels (P = 0.048). Systolic and diastolic pressure were decreased more significantly in the lower baseline DKK-1 group than that in the higher baseline DKK-1 group (both P < 0.05).
Serum DKK-1 levels were decreased after hypoglycemic treatments. Patients with lower baseline DKK-1 levels were featured by more favorable cardiometabolic factors.
