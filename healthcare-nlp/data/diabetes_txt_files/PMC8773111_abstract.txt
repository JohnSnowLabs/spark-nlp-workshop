Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is characterized by a set of metabolic complications arising from adaptive failures to the pregnancy period. Estimates point to a prevalence of 3 to 15% of pregnancies. Its etiology includes intrinsic and extrinsic aspects of the progenitress, which may contribute to the pathophysiogenesis of GDM. Recently, researchers have identified that inflammation, oxidative stress, and the gut microbiota participate in the development of the disease, with potentially harmful effects on the health of the maternal-fetal binomial, in the short and long terms. In this context, alternative therapies were investigated from two perspectives: the modulation of the intestinal microbiota, with probiotics and prebiotics, and the use of natural products with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, which may mitigate the endogenous processes of the GDM, favoring the health of the mother and her offspring, and in a future perspective, alleviating this critical public health problem.
