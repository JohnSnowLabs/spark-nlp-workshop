Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) is rarely considered against more common differentials such as diabetes mellitus in patients presenting with polydipsia and polyuria. Hypokalemia and hypercalcemia are known to induce NDI, but not much is known about hypomagnesemia. Hypokalemia refractory to therapy should prompt consideration of hypomagnesemia.
