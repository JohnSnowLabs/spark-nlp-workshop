Universal screening of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in women with no risk factors (RF) for GDM remains controversial. This study identified the impact of the presence of RF on perinatal and postpartum outcomes.
This prospective cohort study included 780 women with GDM. GDM RF included previous GDM, first grade family history of type 2 diabetes, high-risk ethnicity and pre-pregnancy overweight/obesity (OW/OB). Outcomes included obstetrical, neonatal and maternal metabolic parameters during pregnancy and up to 1 year postpartum.
Out of 780 patients, 24% had no RF for GDM. Despite this, 40% of them needed medical treatment and they had a high prevalence of glucose intolerance of 21 and 27% at 6-8 weeks and 1-year postpartum, respectively. Despite similar treatment, women with RF had more neonatal and obstetrical complications, but they had especially more frequent adverse metabolic outcomes in the short- and long-term. The most important RF for poor perinatal outcome were previous GDM and pre-pregnancy OW/OB, whereas high-risk ethnicity and pre-pregnancy OW/OB were RF for adverse postpartum metabolic outcomes. Increasing number of RF were associated with worsened perinatal and long-term postpartum outcomes except for pregnancy-induced hypertension, C-section delivery and neonatal hypoglycaemia.
Women with no RF had a high prevalence of adverse perinatal and postpartum outcomes, while the presence of RF particularly increased the risk for postpartum adverse metabolic outcomes. This calls for a RF-based long-term follow-up of women with GDM.
