Organophosphate is a commonly used pesticide in the agricultural sector. The main action of organophosphate focuses on acetylcholinesterase inhibition, and it therefore contributes to acute cholinergic crisis, intermediate syndrome and delayed neurotoxicity. From sporadic case series to epidemiologic studies, organophosphate has been linked to hyperglycemia and the occurrence of new-onset diabetes mellitus. Organophosphate-mediated direct damage to pancreatic beta cells, insulin resistance related to systemic inflammation and excessive hepatic gluconeogenesis and polymorphisms of the enzyme governing organophosphate elimination are all possible contributors to the development of new-onset diabetes mellitus. To date, a preventive strategy for organophosphate-mediated new-onset diabetes mellitus is still lacking. However, lowering reactive oxygen species levels may be a practical method to reduce the risk of developing hyperglycemia.
