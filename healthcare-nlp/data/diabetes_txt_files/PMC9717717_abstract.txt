Aim
The objective of this study is to assess the level of awareness of the effect of diabetes and diabetic retinopathy (DR) on the eye among a sample of the Jeddah community.
Methods
A cross-sectional study was conducted among those attending a diabetes awareness camp in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, in November 2021. Participants were asked to answer questions in a structured questionnaire that was already used in a previous study. Responses were analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 25 (IBM SPSS Statistics, Armonk, NY, USA).
Results
A total of 352 participants were included in this study, 184 (52.3%) of them were females. Of the participants, only 74 (21%) had diabetes mellitus (DM). The vast majority (94%) of the participants believed that diabetes could affect the eyes, and 94.3% believed that maintaining the level of blood sugar could maintain the eye and the level of vision. Moreover, 77.3% were aware that diabetes could lead to visual impairment and blindness. Around one-third of the total participants and less than half of the diabetic group were found familiar with DR. Although 96% of diabetic participants reported the need for diabetics to get their eyes checked annually, only 70% did so. Lack of awareness of the effect of diabetes on the retina was the main barrier preventing diabetic groups from getting their eye checked.
Conclusion
Despite the good level of awareness among the community and diabetics about diabetes and its effect on the eyes, there is less awareness that DR is one of the most dangerous complications that lead to visual impairments. These findings assure the importance to raise awareness of DR among the community and diabetics and increase awareness of the importance of annual eye examinations.
