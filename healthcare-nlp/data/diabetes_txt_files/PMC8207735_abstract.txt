Central Diabetes Insipidus (CDI) results from decreased production of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) leading to an inability to concentrate urine. CDI is treated with desmopressin (DDAVP). Rarely reported in the literature, opioids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) can induce hyponatremia in individuals treated for CDI.
A 10-year-old boy with septo-optic dysplasia and CDI was treated with DDAVP 1.6 mg orally TID maintaining normal sodium levels. Post admission for a femur fracture, he was discharged on ibuprofen and hydromorphone. Sodium was 136 mmol/l two days before discharge.
He returned to the ED after having a seizure at home. He was euvolemic and mildly lethargic. Sodium was low at 108 mmol/l. DDAVP and hydromorphone were held and he was fluid restricted, but the sodium remained low. Sodium began to rise when Ibuprofen was stopped. Intermittent small doses of DDAVP were given to facilitate gradual correction of hyponatremia. At discharge, sodium had normalized.
Hyponatremia has occasionally been described as a side effect of opioids and rarely of NSAIDs in patients with CDI. Stimulation of the thirst centre may play a role with opioids while a decrease in urine output may be the mechanism with NSAIDs.
