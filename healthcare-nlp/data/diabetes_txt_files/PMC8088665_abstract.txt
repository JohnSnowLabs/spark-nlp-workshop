The prevalence of diabetes is increasing worldwide. Our study aimed to estimate the changing trends in the prevalence and incidence of diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) among Xiamen residents and the floating population using real-world data.
We used real-world data from the System of Xiamen Citizens Health Information from 2014 to 2019 to estimate the changing trends in the prevalence and incidence of diagnosed T2DM. The System included the diagnosis of diabetes and the prescription of hypoglycemic drugs. Prevalent cases of T2DM were individuals who were diagnosed with T2DM and/or using hypoglycemic drugs. Incident cases were individuals with diagnosed T2DM and/or using hypoglycemic drugs in 2014 or 2019 who had not been diagnosed and/or did not use hypoglycemic drugs in the past.
In 2014 and 2019, the prevalence of T2DM in Xiamen was 4.04 and 4.84%, respectively. In 2014 and 2019, the incidence rate of T2DM in Xiamen was 14.1 per 1000 person-year and 15.0 per 1000 person-year, respectively. There was a significant increase in both the prevalence (Prevalence difference: 0.80, 95%CI 0.76–0.83%, P < 0.001) and the incidence of T2DM (Incidence difference: 0.9, 95%CI 0.7–1.1, P < 0.001). in Xiamen. The prevalence and incidence of T2DM in people aged 18–39 increased significantly (P < 0.001), while the prevalence and incidence of T2DM in people aged 40–69 reduced significantly (P < 0.001).
There was a significant increase in the prevalence and incidence of T2DM in Xiamen from 2014 to 2019 especially among those with younger age.
