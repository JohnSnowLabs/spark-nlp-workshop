Autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1 (APS-1) is a rare monogenic inherited disease caused by mutations of the autoimmune regulator gene (AIRE). The three major components of this syndrome are chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis, hypoparathyroidism and adrenocortical insufficiency.
We report a 20-year-old male who was clinically diagnosed with APS-1 at the age of 15. He was admitted to our department this time for suffering from polyuria and polydipsia for 6 months and was finally diagnosed with diabetes insipidus. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) revealed a novel compound heterozygous mutation of the AIRE gene —the c.239 T > G (p.Val80Gly) variant on one allele and the copy number variant (CNV) of 21q22.3(chr21:45,670,150–45,706,528)*1 on the other.
This case suggests that diabetes insipidus is a rare component of APS-1 and expands the variety of mutations on AIRE gene.
