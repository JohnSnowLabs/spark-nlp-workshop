We sought to investigate whether individuals with diabetes have a higher likelihood of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, as a proxy for infection risk, than individuals without diabetes.
We conducted a cross-sectional study of publicly available data among a Mexican population, totaling 2,314,022 adults ≥ 18 years who underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing between March 1 and December 20, 2020. We used 1:1 nearest neighborhood propensity score matching by diabetes status to account for confounding among those with and without diabetes.
In the overall study population, 1,057,779 (45.7%) individuals tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 270,486 (11.7%) self-reported diabetes. After propensity score matching, patient characteristics were well-balanced, with 150,487 patients in the diabetes group (mean [SD] age 55.9 [12.7] years; 51.3% women) and 150,487 patients in the no diabetes group (55.5 [13.3] years; 50.3% women). The strictest matching algorithm (1:1 nearest neighbor) showed that compared to individuals without diabetes, having diabetes was associated with 9.0% higher odds of having a positive SARS-CoV-2 test (OR 1.09 [95% CI: 1.08–1.10]).
Presence of diabetes was associated with higher odds of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, which could have important implications for risk mitigation efforts for people with diabetes at risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
