Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) was previously considered a common disease in middle-aged and older people, but the age of diagnosis of T2DM is advancing every year, and the trend toward a younger age is obvious. Early-onset T2DM is a clinical syndrome caused by genetic and environmental factors. This study aimed to investigate the association between diabetic family history and gender with the diagnosed age of T2DM.
The newly diagnosed T2DM patients admitted to the diabetes identification center of Tianjin 4th Central Hospital (TJ4thch) from October 2017 to June 2020 were registered. According to whether the diagnosis age is over 40 years old, patients were divided into 2 groups (early-onset T2DM group and late-onset T2DM group). In the study, the T2DM family history was divided into 5 types: (a) Father T2DM: father with T2DM, but not the mother; (b) Mother T2DM: mother with T2DM, but not the father; (c) Both parents with T2DM; (d) Another relative(s) (other than the parents) with a history of T2DM; and (e) Without a family history of T2DM. The diagnosed age with different genders and diabetic family history was compared. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to investigate the association factors of early-onset T2DM.
A total of 3725 patients completed the survey. There were 589 patients (15.8%) with early-onset T2DM, and 2469 patients (66.3%) had a diabetic family history. The T2DM-diagnosed age in males was lower than in females (51.7 ± 11.2 vs 54.0 ± 10.2, P = .000). The result was also reflected in the different T2DM family histories (with Both parents T2DM, 46.7 ± 11.1 vs 48.5 ± 10.3, P = .271; with Father T2DM, 46.8 ± 10.8 vs 49.8 ± 11.3, P = .005; with Mother T2DM, 50.4 ± 10.6 vs 52.3 ± 10.2, P = .019; with Other T2DM family history, 54.0 ± 10.8 vs 55.7 ± 9.5, P = .008; with no T2DM family history, 53.0 ± 11.0 vs 55.9 ± 9.3, P = .000). The order of the T2DM-diagnosed age in the different groups was Both parents T2DM (47.5 ± 11.0) and Father T2DM (47.9 ± 11.1) family history < that with Mother T2DM family history (51.1 ± 10.5) < that with Other T2DM family history (54.7 ± 10.3) and no T2DM family history (54.1 ± 10.5). Logistic regression analysis indicated that gender (OR, 1.733; P = .000), Father T2DM history (OR, 2.738; P = .000), Mother T2DM history (OR, 1.536; P = .001), Both parents T2DM (OR, 2.866; P = .000) and body mass index (OR, 1.108, P = .000) were correlated with early-onset T2DM.
Patients with early-onset T2DM tend to have a more obvious T2DM family history in China. This survey shows that when a parent has a T2DM family history, especially the father with T2DM, male patients are diagnosed with T2DM earlier. We need more intensive screening for diabetes in children with a family history of diabetes, especially in male children.
