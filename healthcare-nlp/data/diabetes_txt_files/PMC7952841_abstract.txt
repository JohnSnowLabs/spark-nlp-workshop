Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has become a global pandemic. Apart from the mild features of the disease, long-term complications involve many systems including both endocrine and cardiovascular systems. Myocarditis, secondary to COVID-19, has become a well-known complication of the disease. However, endocrine complications are generally not common, particularly isolated pituitary abnormalities. There is one other report of diabetes insipidus developing as a late sequela of COVID-19. In this article, we report a case of a young male who presented with features of myocarditis but developed diabetes insipidus on day 7 of admission as a long-term complication after recovery from COVID-19 infection. His laboratory test results at the time of developing the complication revealed a high serum sodium level and low urine osmolality. The patient recovered on administration of desmopressin and was discharged after 16 days of hospitalization.
