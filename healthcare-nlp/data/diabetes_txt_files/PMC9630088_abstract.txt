Nontargeted metabolomics methods have increased potential to identify new disease biomarkers, but assessments of the additive information provided in large human cohorts by these less biased techniques are limited. To diversify our knowledge of diabetes-associated metabolites, we leveraged a method that measures 305 targeted or “known” and 2,342 nontargeted or “unknown” compounds in fasting plasma samples from 2,750 participants (315 incident cases) in the Jackson Heart Study (JHS)—a community cohort of self-identified African Americans—who are underrepresented in omics studies. We found 307 unique compounds (82 known) associated with diabetes after adjusting for age and sex at a false discovery rate of <0.05 and 124 compounds (35 known, including 11 not previously associated) after further adjustments for BMI and fasting plasma glucose. Of these, 144 and 68 associations, respectively, replicated in a multiethnic cohort. Among these is an apparently novel isomer of the 1-deoxyceramide Cer(m18:1/24:0) with functional geonomics and high-resolution mass spectrometry. Overall, known and unknown metabolites provided complementary information (median correlation ρ = 0.29), and their inclusion with clinical risk factors improved diabetes prediction modeling. Our findings highlight the importance of including nontargeted metabolomics methods to provide new insights into diabetes development in ethnically diverse cohorts.
