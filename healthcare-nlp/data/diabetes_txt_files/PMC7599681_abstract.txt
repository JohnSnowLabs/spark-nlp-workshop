Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) among pregnant women increases the risk of both short-term and long-term complications, such as birth complications, babies large for gestational age (LGA), and type 2 diabetes in both mother and offspring. Lifestyle changes are essential in the management of GDM. In this review, we seek to provide an overview of the lifestyle changes which can be recommended in the management of GDM. The diet recommended for women with GDM should contain sufficient macronutrients and micronutrients to support the growth of the foetus and, at the same time, limit postprandial glucose excursions and encourage appropriate maternal gestational weight gain. Blood glucose excursions and hyperglycaemic episodes depend on carbohydrate-intake. Therefore, nutritional counselling should focus on the type, amount, and distribution of carbohydrates in the diet. Further, physical activity has beneficial effects on glucose and insulin levels and it can contribute to a better glycaemic control.
