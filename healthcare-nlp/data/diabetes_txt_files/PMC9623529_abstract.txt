Though poor glycemic control and insulin treatment are reported to be associated with sarcopenia in type 2 diabetes, type 1 diabetes may be a stronger risk for sarcopenia. We therefore studied the effect of the type of diabetes, glycemic control, and insulin therapy on the prevalence and characteristics of sarcopenia.
A total of 812 Japanese patients with diabetes (type 1: n = 57; type 2: n = 755) were enrolled in this study. Sarcopenia was defined as low handgrip strength or slow gait speed and low appendicular skeletal muscle mass.
Among participants aged ≥65 years, the sarcopenia prevalence rate was higher among patients with type 1 diabetes (20.0%) than among those with type 2 diabetes (8.1%). The prevalence rate of low handgrip strength was higher in type 1 diabetes (50.0%) than in type 2 diabetes (28.7%). In logistic regression analysis, type 1 diabetes was significantly associated with the prevalence of low handgrip strength. In logistic regression analysis, medication with insulin was significantly associated with the prevalence of sarcopenia; this association was not retained after adjusting for HbA1c.
The prevalence of sarcopenia in older adult patients was higher in those with type 1 diabetes than in those with type 2 diabetes. Among the components of sarcopenia, the difference was most prominent in the frequency of low handgrip strength. Poor glycemic control rather than type of diabetes or insulin treatment was revealed to be a primary risk factor for sarcopenia in diabetes mellitus.
We found higher prevalence of sarcopenia in older adults with type 1 diabetes than in type 2 diabetes. Poor glycemic control rather than types of diabetes or insulin treatment was revealed to be a primary risk factor for sarcopenia in diabetes mellitus. A longitudinal study is needed to clarify whether type 1 diabetes mellitus remains as a risk factor for sarcopenia in patients with adequate glycemic control.
