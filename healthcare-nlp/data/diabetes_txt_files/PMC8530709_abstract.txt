The prevalence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is increasing, and intrauterine hyperglycemia is suspected to affect offspring cognitive function.
We assessed academic performance by grade point average (GPA) in children aged 15 to 16 years at compulsory school graduation, comparing offspring exposed to GDM (O-GDM) with offspring from the background population (O-BP).
This register-based, cohort study comprised all singletons born in Denmark between 1994 and 2001 (O-GDM: n = 4286; O-BP: n = 501 045). Standardized and internationally comparable GPAs were compared in univariate and multivariable linear models. Main outcome measures included the adjusted mean difference in GPA. We also analyzed the probability of having a high GPA, a GPA below passing, and no GPA registered.
O-GDM had a GPA of 6.29 (SD 2.52), whereas O-BP had a GPA of 6.78 (SD 2.50). The adjusted mean difference was –0.36 (95% CI, –0.44 to –0.29), corresponding to a Cohen’s D of 0.14. O-GDM had a lower probability of obtaining a high GPA (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.68; 95% CI, 0.59 to 0.79), while their risk of obtaining a GPA below passing was similar to O-BP (aOR 1.20; 95% CI, 0.96 to 1.50). O-GDM had a higher risk of not having a GPA registered (aOR 1.38; 95% CI, 1.24 to 1.53).
Academic performance in O-GDM was marginally lower than in O-BP. However, this difference is unlikely to be of clinical importance.
