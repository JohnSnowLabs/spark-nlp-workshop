Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder resulting from either loss of insulin producing cells, insufficient insulin action, or both. Knowledge can play an important role in preventing diabetes mellitus and its complications. There is limited information regarding knowledge and related factors regarding diabetes mellitus among non-diabetic adult community members in the study area. Therefore, the current study aimed to determine knowledge and associated factors towards diabetes mellitus among non-diabetes community members of Gondar city.
Community-based cross-sectional study was conducted on non-diabetic community members from July 1–29, 2019 in Gondar city. The participants were selected randomly from each households. A structured questionnaire was used to collect the data. EpiData version 3.1 was used for data entry and SPSS version 20 was used for data processing and analysis. Descriptive statistics were calculated for most variables. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify the associated factors. A variable was considered significantly associated at p-value<0.05.
A total of 633 study subjects participated in this study with a mean age of 36.12 (± 12.87) years. Of these study participants, 572 had awareness about diabetes mellitus and 51.4% (95% CI: 47.4%, 55.8%) had good knowledge. Being male [Adjusted odds ratio = 1.62 (95% CI: 1.05, 2.48)], monthly income of 3000–5000 birr [Adjusted odds ratio = 1.88 (95% CI: 1.03, 3.41)], monthly income of ≥5001 birr [Adjusted odds ratio = 2.37 (95% CI: 1.17, 4.78)], previous training on diabetes mellitus [Adjusted odds ratio = 4.37 (95% CI; 3.04, 7.37)], being grade 9–12 [Adjusted odds ratio = 3.1 (95% CI: 1.09, 8.66)], having college and above educational qualification [Adjusted odds ratio = 3.70 (95% CI: 1.26, 10.85)] were significantly associated with good knowledge towards diabetes mellitus.
