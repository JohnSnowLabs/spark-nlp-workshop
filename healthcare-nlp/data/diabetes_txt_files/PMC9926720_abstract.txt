Future targets are a promising prospect to overcome the limitation of conventional and current approaches by providing secure and effective treatment without compromising patient compliance. Diabetes mellitus is a fast-growing problem that has been raised worldwide, from 4% to 6.4% (around 285 million people) in past 30 years. This number may increase to 430 million people in the coming years if there is no better treatment or cure is available. Ageing, obesity and sedentary lifestyle are the key reasons for the worsening of this disease. It always had been a vital challenge, to explore new treatment which could safely and effectively manage diabetes mellitus without compromising patient compliance. Researchers are regularly trying to find out the permanent treatment of this chronic and life threatening disease. In this journey, there are various treatments available in market to manage diabetes mellitus such as insulin, GLP-1 agonist, biguanides, sulphonyl ureas, glinides, thiazolidinediones targeting the receptors which are discovered decade before. PPAR, GIP, FFA1, melatonin are the recent targets that already in the focus for developing new therapies in the treatment of diabetes. Inspite of numerous preclinical studies very few clinical data available due to which this process is in its initial phase. The review also focuses on the receptors like GPCR 119, GPER, Vaspin, Metrnl, Fetuin-A that have role in insulin regulation and have potential to become future targets in treatment for diabetes that may be effective and safer as compared to the conventional and current treatment approaches.
