Globally, tuberculosis and diabetes mellitus co-morbidity is higher than tuberculosis and human immunodeficiency virus comorbidity. Considering this, the World Health Organization and the International Union against tuberculosis and lung disease recommend bi-directional screening of the two diseases. However, in Ethiopia, bi-directional screening has not been started yet.
The objective of this study was to assess the prevalence of diabetes mellitus and tuberculosis comorbidity and its predictors among adult tuberculosis patients in Bale Zone Health Institutions, Southeastern Ethiopia.
Institutional-based cross-sectional study carried out using interviewer administered questionnaire, registration review, anthropometric and blood glucose level measurement from March, 30, 2019 to April, 30, 2019. Three hundred twenty-one tuberculosis patients were selected from tuberculosis registration log book using lottery methods. The collected data were checked for completeness, coded and entered in to EpiData3.0.2 and exported to SPSS version 20. Independent variables that had p value less 0.25 were used as candidates for multiple logistic regressions to control confounders. Variables that had significant association were identified by calculating odds ratio, with 95% confidence interval, and p value less than 0.05 used to declare statistical significance.
Diabetes mellitus and tuberculosis comorbidity among adult tuberculosis patients was 5.1% (95% CI: 2.7%, 7.5%). Age with ≥50 years (AOR=3.98, 95% CI: 1.13, 14.36), having extra pulmonary tuberculosis (AOR=3.31, 95% CI: 1.16, 9.44) and being females (AOR=3.8, 95% CI: 1.17, 12.33) were significantly associated with the comorbidity of the two diseases.
The prevalence of diabetes mellitus and tuberculosis comorbidity was high. Female tuberculosis patients, tuberculosis patients with age ≥50 years and those having extra pulmonary tuberculosis patients should be screened for diabetes mellitus.
