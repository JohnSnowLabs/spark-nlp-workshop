Diabetes mellitus is a complex and chronic metabolic disorder that is associated with multiple complications and disabilities. This contributes to increased mortality and poor quality of life among affected individuals. The study explored the lived experience of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus at a Teaching Hospital in Ekiti State, Nigeria. A mixed method of qualitative and quantitative design was adopted. For the quantitative aspect, a convenience sampling technique was employed while the instrument used was an adapted questionnaire. For the qualitative aspect, focus-group discussion involving twenty-four participants was conducted, and the sample size was determined by data saturation. Qualitative data was analyzed using thematic transcription. Findings revealed that 55.6% of the participants were females while 63.5% had tertiary education. Majority (18 of 24) of the respondents experienced body weakness, frequent urination and excessive thirst when diagnosed of diabetes mellitus and later experienced occasional body weakness, burning sensation, tingling and numbness of the feet, fatigue, loss of libido, and occasional visual disturbance. Two-third of the participants reported being indifferent when they were informed about their condition. However, majority of the participants perceived that the cause of diabetes mellitus was heredity. More than two-third of the participants did not experience reduction in their normal daily activities but rather experienced occasional emotional disturbances, anxiety and challenges with self-management of diabetes and this was associated with maintaining a normo-glycemic state due to the financial implications of drugs and dietary modifications.
