The growing diabetic epidemic has created a substantial burden, not only on the people with diabetes but also on society at large. This mini-review discussed the limitations and patterns of disability in type 2 diabetes mellitus and put forward a case for the moderating effects of physical activity (PA) in the management of diabetes. The limitations and impairments associated with diabetes include vascular, neurological, cardiac, and renal impairments. Moreover, individuals participate less in their daily lives and in their instrumental activities of daily living, which negatively impacts the quality of life of individuals with diabetes. This often leads to a loss of quality of life due to disabilities, resulting in an increased rate of disability-adjusted life years among people with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Moreover, there are psychosocial sequelae of diabetes mellitus. This necessitates looking for moderating factors that may reduce the burden of the disease. PA has been shown to be one of the factors that can mitigate these burdens. PA does this in several ways, including through the benefits it confers, such as a reduction of hemoglobin A1c, a reduction of excess fat in the liver and pancreas, and the reduction of cardiovascular risk factors, all of which favorably affect glycemic parameters. Specifically, PA regulates or moderates diabetes disability through two mechanisms: The regulation of glucolipid metabolism disorders and the optimization of body mass index and systemic conditions. Therefore, efforts should be directed at PA uptake through identified strategies. This will not only prevent diabetes or diabetes complications but will reduce its burden.
