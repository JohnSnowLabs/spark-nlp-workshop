The kidney plays a central role in the regulation of the body water balance. The process of targeting the water channel aquaporin-2 (AQP2) on the apical plasma membrane of the collecting duct (CD) principal cells is mainly regulated by the antidiuretic peptide hormone arginine vasopressin (AVP), which is responsible for the maintenance of water homeostasis. Recently, much attention has been focused on the local factors modulating renal water reabsorption by AQP2 in the collecting ducts, especially prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). PGE2 is a lipid mediator involved in a variety of physiological and pathophysiological processes in the kidney. The biological function of PGE2 is mainly mediated by four G-protein-coupled receptors, namely EP1-4, which couple to drive separate intracellular signaling pathways. Increasing evidence demonstrates that PGE2 is essential for renal water transport regulation via multiple mechanisms. Each EP receptor plays a unique role in regulating water reabsorption in renal collecting ducts. This brief review highlights the role of PGE2 in the regulation of water reabsorption and discusses the involvement of each EP receptor subtype in renal collecting duct. A better understanding of the role of PGE2 in renal water transport process may improve disease management strategies for water balance disorders, including nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.
