Epidemiologic evidence indicates that periodontitis is more frequent in patients with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus than in healthy controls, suggesting that it could be considered the “sixth complication” of diabetes. Actually, diabetes mellitus and periodontitis are two extraordinarily prevalent chronic diseases that share a number of comorbidities all converging toward an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Periodontal treatment has recently been shown to have the potential to improve the metabolic control of diabetes, although long‐term studies are lacking. Uncontrolled diabetes also seems to affect the response to periodontal treatment, as well as the risk to develop peri‐implant diseases. Mechanisms of associations between diabetes mellitus and periodontal disease include the release of advanced glycation end products as a result of hyperglycemia and a range of shared predisposing factors of genetic, microbial, and lifestyle nature. This review discusses the evidence for the risk of periodontal and peri‐implant disease in diabetic patients and the potential role of the dental professional in the diabetes‐periodontal interface.
