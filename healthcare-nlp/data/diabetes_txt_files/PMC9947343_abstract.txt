Poor glycemic control is one of the most determinant factors for type 2 diabetes-related morbidity and mortality. The proportion of type 2 diabetes mellitus patients with poor glycemic control remains high. Yet evidence on factors contributing to poor glycemic control remains scarce. The aim of this study is to identify determinants of poor glycemic control among type 2 diabetes mellitus patients at a diabetes mellitus clinic in University of Gondar Comprehensive Specialized Hospital, Northwest Ethiopia Determinants of Poor Glycemic Control among Type 2 Diabetes mellitus Patients at University of Gondar Comprehensive Specialized Hospital, Northwest Ethiopia: Unmatched Case-Control Study
A hospital-based case-control study was conducted from June to September 2020. Using convenience sampling techniques, a total of 90 cases and 90 controls with type 2 diabetes were recruited. The data were entered into Epidata version 4.6.0.2 and analyzed by Stata version 14. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the association between independent variables and glycemic control. Both 95% CI and p-value<0.05 were used to determine the level and significance, respectively.
The mean age ( ± standard deviations) for the cases and controls were 57.55± 10.42 and 61.03± 8.93% respectively. The determinants of poor glycemic control were age (Adjusted odd ratio (AOR)= 0.08; 95% CI= 0.02-0.33), inadequate physical exercise (AOR = 5.05; 95% CI = 1.99-11.98), presence of comorbidities (AOR = 5.50; 95% CI = 2.06-14.66), non-adherence to anti-diabetes medications (AOR= 2.76; 95% CI= 1.19-6.40), persistent proteinuria (AOR=4.95; 95% CI=1.83-13.36) and high-density lipoprotein less than 40 mg/dl (AOR=3.08; 95% CI= 1.30-7.31).
Age less than 65 years, inadequate physical exercise, presence of comorbidities, non-adherence to anti-diabetes medications, persistent proteinuria, and high-density lipoprotein less than 40 mg/dl were the determinants of poor glycemic control. Therefore, targeted educational and behavioral modification programs on adequate exercise and medication adherence should be routinely practiced. Furthermore, early guideline-based screening and treatment of comorbidities and complications is required to effectively manage diabetes mellitus.
