Aquaporins (AQPs) are a family of highly selective transmembrane channels that mainly transport water across the cell and some facilitate low-molecular-weight solutes. Eight AQPs, including AQP1, AQP2, AQP3, AQP4, AQP5, AQP6, AQP7, and AQP11, are expressed in different segments and various cells in the kidney to maintain normal urine concentration function. AQP2 is critical in regulating urine concentrating ability. The expression and function of AQP2 are regulated by a series of transcriptional factors and post-transcriptional phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and glycosylation. Mutation or functional deficiency of AQP2 leads to severe nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Studies with animal models show AQPs are related to acute kidney injury and various chronic kidney diseases, such as diabetic nephropathy, polycystic kidney disease, and renal cell carcinoma. Experimental data suggest ideal prospects for AQPs as biomarkers and therapeutic targets in clinic. This review article mainly focuses on recent advances in studying AQPs in renal diseases.
