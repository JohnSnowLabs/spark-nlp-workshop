Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the seventh coronavirus to be linked to human disease. The SARS-CoV-2 virus may have several pathophysiologic interactions with endocrine systems, resulting in disruptions in glucose metabolism, hypothalamus and pituitary function, adrenal function, and mineral metabolism. An increasing amount of evidence demonstrates both the influence of underlying endocrine abnormalities on the outcome of COVID-19 and the effect of the SARS-CoV-2 virus on endocrine systems. However, a systematic examination of the link to pediatric endocrine diseases has been missing.
The purpose of this review is to discuss the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on endocrine systems and to summarize the available knowledge on COVID-19 consequences in children with underlying endocrine abnormalities. For this purpose, a literature search was conducted in EMBASE, and data that were discussed about the effects of COVID-19 on endocrine systems were used in the current study.
Treatment suggestions were provided for endocrinopathies associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.
With the global outbreak of COVID-19, it is critical for pediatric endocrinologists to understand how SARS-CoV-2 interacts with the endocrine system and the therapeutic concerns for children with underlying problems who develop COVID-19. While children and adults share certain risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection sequelae, it is becoming obvious that pediatric responses are different and that adult study results cannot be generalized. While pediatric research gives some insight, it also shows the need for more study in this area.
