Aquaporin‐2 (AQP2) is a homotetrameric water channel responsible for the final water reuptake in the kidney. Disease‐causing AQP2 mutations induce nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI), a condition that challenges the bodily water balance by producing large urinary volumes. In this study, we characterize three new AQP2 mutations identified in our lab from NDI patients (A120D, A130V, T179N) along the previously reported A47V variant. Using Xenopus oocytes, we compared the key functional and biochemical features of these mutations against classical recessive (R187C) and dominant (R254Q) forms, and once again found clear functional recovery features (increased protein stability and function) for all mutations under study. This behaviour, attributed to heteromerization to wt‐AQP2, challenge the classical model to NDI which often depicts recessive mutations as ill‐structured proteins unable to oligomerize. Consequently, we propose a revised model to the cell pathophysiology of AQP2‐related NDI which accounts for the functional recovery of recessive AQP2 mutations.
Mutations to AQP2 induce nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI), where low/inactive water channels cause large urinary waste of possible fatal outcome. Our past studies have shown that several AQP2 mutations could be functionally recovered by associating to wild‐type AQP2 (wt‐AQP2) into the protein complex (tetramer). This study presents the characterization of three new AQP2 mutations from actual case‐studies in regard to recovery capacities, and conclude by proposing a revised pathophysiological model to NDI, one where AQP2 mutations are now presented as mostly recoverable through wt‐AQP2 association into functional water channels.
