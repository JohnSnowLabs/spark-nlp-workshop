Diabetes insipidus (DI) can be a common cause of polydipsia and polyuria. Here, we present a case of congenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (CNDI) accompanied with central diabetes insipidus (CDI) secondary to pituitary surgery.
A 24-year-old Chinese woman came to our hospital with the complaints of polydipsia and polyuria for 6 months. Six months ago, she was detected with pituitary apoplexy, and thereby getting pituitary surgery. However, the water deprivation test demonstrated no significant changes in urine volume and urine gravity in response to fluid depression or AVP administration. In addition, the genetic results confirmed a heterozygous mutation in arginine vasopressin receptor type 2 (AVPR2) genes.
She was considered with CNDI as well as acquired CDI secondary to pituitary surgery. She was given with hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 25 mg twice a day as well as desmopressin (DDAVP, Minirin) 0.1 mg three times a day. There is no recurrence of polyuria or polydipsia observed for more than 6 months. It can be hard to consider AVPR2 mutation in female carriers, especially in those with subtle clinical presentation. Hence, direct detection of DNA sequencing with AVPR2 is a convenient and accurate method in CNDI diagnosis.
