Diabetes mellitus constitutes a major disease burden globally, and the prevalence of diabetes continues to increase worldwide. We aimed to estimate the burden of cancer associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus in Japan between 2010 and 2030. In this study, we estimated the population attributable fraction of cancer risk associated with type 2 diabetes in 2010 and 2030 using the prevalence estimates of type 2 diabetes in Japan from 1990 to 2030, summary hazard ratios of diabetes and cancer risk from a pooled analysis of eight large‐scale Japanese cohort studies, observed incidence/mortality of cancer in 2010 and predicted incidence/mortality for 2030 derived from the age–period–cohort model. Our results showed that between 2010 and 2030, the total numbers of cancer incidence and mortality were predicted to increase by 38.9% and 10.5% in adults aged above 20 years, respectively. In the number of excess incident cancer cases associated with type 2 diabetes, an increase of 26.5% in men and 53.2% in women is expected between 2010 and 2030. The age‐specific analysis showed that the population attributable fraction of cancer will increase in adults aged >60 years over time, but will not change in adults aged 20–59 years. In conclusion, this study suggests a modest but steady increase in cancers associated with type 2 diabetes.
This study provides the first comprehensive evidence on the current and future burden of cancer associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Between 2010 and 2030, the incident cancer cases associated with type 2 diabetes were found to increase constantly over time, particularly in liver, pancreas and colon in Japan. Given the prolonged life expectancy in Japan, increase in people living with type 2 diabetes and subsequent cancer will be a public health issue in the years to come.
