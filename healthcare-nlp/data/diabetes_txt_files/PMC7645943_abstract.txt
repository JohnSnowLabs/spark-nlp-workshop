The emergence of continuous glucose monitoring has driven improvements in glycaemic control and quality of life for people with diabetes. Recent changes in access to continuous glucose monitoring systems within UK health services have increased the number of people able to benefit from these technologies. The COVID‐19 pandemic has created an opportunity for diabetes healthcare professionals to use continuous glucose monitoring technology to remotely deliver diabetes services to support people with diabetes. This opportunity can be maximized with improved application and interpretation of continuous glucose monitoring‐generated data. Amongst the diverse measures of glycaemic control, time in range is considered to be of high value in routine clinical care because it is actionable and is visibly responsive to changes in diabetes management. Importantly, it is also been linked to the risk of developing complications associated with diabetes and can be understood by people with diabetes and healthcare professionals alike. The 2019 International Consensus on Time in Range has established a series of target glucose ranges and recommendations for time spent within these ranges that is consistent with optimal glycaemic control. The recommendations cover people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, with separate targets indicated for elderly people or those at higher risk from hypoglycaemia, as well as for women with type 1 diabetes during pregnancy. The aim of this best practice guide was to clarify the intent and purpose of these international consensus recommendations and to provide practical insights into their implementation in UK diabetes care.
