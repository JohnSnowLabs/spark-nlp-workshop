Very little research has been undertaken into what people in Germany know about diabetes, the information they may require about the condition, where they look for such information and how they rate the information currently available. In 2017, the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) carried out a nationwide telephone survey aimed at answering these questions. The study entitled ‘Disease knowledge and information needs - Diabetes mellitus (2017)’ focused on people aged at least 18 years. A total of 2,327 people without diabetes and 1,479 people with diagnosed diabetes were interviewed for the study. First results show that 56.7% of people without diabetes and 92.8% of those with diabetes rate their knowledge about the condition as ‘very good’ or ‘good’. People without diabetes were found to have the strongest need for information in terms of ‘lifestyle changes, health promotion and disease prevention’, whereas respondents with diabetes stressed the strongest need for information about ‘treatment and therapy’. Almost a third of respondents without diabetes have actively sought information about diabetes at least once, mostly via print media. Patients with diabetes stated that their general practitioner was their most frequent source of information about the condition. In both groups, about half of respondents reported that they found it difficult to judge the trustworthiness of the information published in the media about diabetes. The results of the study form part of the German National Diabetes Surveillance, which is coordinated by the RKI. The data are also intended to be used by the Federal Centre for Health Education to develop a strategy to improve the information provided about diabetes.
