Over the last few decades, several definitions of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) have been described. There is currently not enough research to show which way is the best to diagnose GDM. Opinions differ in terms of the optimal screening and diagnostic measures, in part due to the differences in the population risks, the cost-effectiveness considerations, and the lack of an evidence base to support large national screening programs. The basic method for identifying the disease is the measurement of glucose plasma levels which may be determined when fasting, two hours after a meal, or simply at any random time. The currently increasing incidence of diabetes in the whole population, the altering demographics and the presence of lifestyle changes still require better methods of screening for hyperglycemia, especially during pregnancy. The main aim of this review is to focus on the prevalence and modifications to the screening criteria for GDM across all continents in the 21st century. We would like to show the differences in the above issues and correlate them with the geographical situation. Looking at the history of diabetes, we are sure that more than one evolution in GDM diagnosis will occur, due to the development of medicine, appearance of modern technologies, and the dynamic continuation of research.
