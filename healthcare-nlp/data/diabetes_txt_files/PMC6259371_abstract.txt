The prevalence of juvenile-onset gout has been increasing. Hereditary factors and secondary diseases should be considered in these patients. Adipsic diabetes insipidus (ADI) is characterized by arginine vasopressin (AVP) deficiency, which results in hypotonic polyuria, and dysfunction of thirst osmoreceptors, which results in failure to generate a thirst sensation in response to hypernatremia. We herein report a case of a boy with gouty arthritis, refractory hyperuricemia, prominent hypernatremia, a high creatinine concentration, and a history of surgery for a hypothalamic hamartoma. The patient was diagnosed with central diabetes insipidus after endocrine evaluation. Because he never had symptoms of thirst, the final diagnosis was corrected to ADI. This is the first report of gout due to chronic ADI in an adolescent. Volume contraction due to ADI might be one cause of hyperuricemia and renal impairment in such patients. Moreover, AVP deficiency might directly lead to low urate clearance due to the lack of vasopressin receptor 1 stimulation. Lack of polydipsia and polyuria may delay the diagnosis of ADI and lead to severe complications of a chronic hyperosmolar status. Sufficient and effective establishment of normovolemia is critical for these patients.
