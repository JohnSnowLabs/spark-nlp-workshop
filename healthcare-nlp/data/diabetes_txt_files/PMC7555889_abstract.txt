Diabetes mellitus is one of the most common metabolic diseases in the developed world, and is associated either with the impaired secretion of insulin or with the resistance of cells to the actions of this hormone (type I and type II diabetes, respectively). In both cases, a common pathological change is an increase in blood glucoseâ€”hyperglycemia, which eventually can lead to serious damage to the organs and tissues of the organism. Mitochondria are one of the main targets of diabetes at the intracellular level. This review is dedicated to the analysis of recent data regarding the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in the development of diabetes mellitus. Specific areas of focus include the involvement of mitochondrial calcium transport systems and a pathophysiological phenomenon called the permeability transition pore in the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus. The important contribution of these systems and their potential relevance as therapeutic targets in the pathology are discussed.
