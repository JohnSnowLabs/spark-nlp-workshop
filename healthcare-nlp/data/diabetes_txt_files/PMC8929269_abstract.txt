Postoperative polyuria due to diabetes insipidus (DI) is commonly reported complication of pituitary surgery. However, central DI postabdominal surgery is rare and related to unmasking of pre‚Äêexisting DI or prolonged surgery with significant intraoperative blood loss. A thorough workup needs to be performed to exclude central DI in such patients.
Diabetes insipidus due to posterior pituitary insufficiency should be a crucial differential diagnosis in postoperative polyuria. Although commonly reported in pituitary surgeries, it can occur in prolonged abdominal surgeries as well.
