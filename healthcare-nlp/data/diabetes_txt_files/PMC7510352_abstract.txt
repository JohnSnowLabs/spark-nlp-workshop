Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a type of metabolic disorder characterized by hyperglycaemia with multiple serious complications, such as diabetic neuropathies, diabetic nephropathy, diabetic retinopathy, and diabetic foot. Platelet-derived growth factors are growth factors that regulate cell growth and division, playing a critical role in diabetes and its harmful complications. This review focused on the cellular mechanism of platelet-derived growth factors and their receptors on diabetes development. Furthermore, we raise some proper therapeutic molecular targets for the treatment of diabetes and its complications.
