A 6-year-old girl presented acutely with worsening frontal headaches. She had a 3-month history of lethargy, reduced appetite, weight loss, cough and intermittent fevers. A chest X-ray showed a left upper lobe consolidation, and a CT head showed multiple enhancing lesions with significant surrounding oedema in both cerebral hemispheres. Due to the strong suspicion of tuberculosis (TB), she was admitted and treated with anti-TB therapy and steroids. Following this, pulmonary infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis was confirmed by a positive PCR from induced sputum. Cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) analysis was normal and tested negative for M. tuberculosis on PCR. During her first week of treatment, she developed polyuria, nocturia and polydipsia and was diagnosed with central diabetes insipidus. She was started on desmopressin which rapidly improved her symptoms, and she was continued on desmopressin for 3 months. Currently, she remains well and has shown a good response to TB treatment.
