Diabetes has been classified mainly into types 1 and 2. Some type 2 diabetes patients, when developing ketosis, have been labeled as having atypical diabetes. Lately, syndromes of ketosis-prone diabetes, primarily in patients who we previously classified as type 2 diabetics, have emerged, and calls are being made to even reclassify diabetes. This mini-review will extensively deal with the historical, molecular, phenotypical, and clinical basis of why ketosis-prone diabetes is different than the traditional principles of type 1 and 2 diabetes and should be classified as such. Clinicians, especially those who are not diabetologists or endocrinologists, as well as hospitalists, intensivists, and primary care providers, will greatly benefit from this review.
