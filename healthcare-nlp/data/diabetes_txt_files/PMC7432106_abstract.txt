The majority of patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) have hypertension (HTN). A specific mechanism for the development of HTN in DM has not been described. In the Zucker, Endothel, und Salz (sugar, endothelium, and salt) study (ZEuS), indices of glucose metabolism and of volume regulation are recorded. An analysis of these parameters shows that glucose concentrations interfere with plasma osmolality and that changes in glycemic control have a significant impact on fluid status and blood pressure. The results of this study are discussed against the background of the striking similarities between the regulation of sugar and salt blood concentrations, introducing the view that DM is probably a sodium-retention disorder that leads to a state of hypervolemia.
