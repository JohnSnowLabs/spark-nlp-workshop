Metabolic diseases including type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and metabolic syndrome (MetS) are alarming health burdens around the world, while therapies for these diseases are far from satisfying as their etiologies are not completely clear yet. T2DM, NAFLD, and MetS are all complex and multifactorial metabolic disorders based on the interactions between genetics and environment. Omics studies such as genetics, transcriptomics, epigenetics, proteomics, and metabolomics are all promising approaches in accurately characterizing these diseases. And the most effective treatments for individuals can be achieved via omics pathways, which is the theme of precision medicine. In this review, we summarized the multi-omics studies of T2DM, NAFLD, and MetS in recent years, provided a theoretical basis for their pathogenesis and the effective prevention and treatment, and highlighted the biomarkers and future strategies for precision medicine.
