Polyuria in perioperative coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery is common and mostly benign. Diabetes insipidus (DI) post-CABG is however very rare and mostly have been related with use of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) pump. The patient recovered completely with transient requirement of exogenous vasopressin. The central DI may be considered as a differential diagnosis in case of polyuria in the perioperative period of CABG surgery.
