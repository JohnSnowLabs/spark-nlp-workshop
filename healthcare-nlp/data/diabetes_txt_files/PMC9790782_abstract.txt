Pituitary inflammation due to IgG4-related disease is a rare condition and is sometimes accompanied by central diabetes insipidus. Central diabetes insipidus produces a strong thirst sensation, which may be difficult to distinguish when complicated by salivary insufficiency. A 45-year-old man was admitted to our department for a thorough examination of his thirst and polyuria. He had suddenly developed these symptoms more than one year earlier and visited an oral surgeon. Swelling of the left submandibular gland, right parotid gland, and cervical lymph nodes had been observed. Since his IgG4 level was relatively high at 792 mg/dL and a lip biopsy showed high plasmacytoid infiltration around the gland ducts, he had been diagnosed with IgG4-related disease. He had started taking 0.4 mg/kg/day of prednisolone, and his chief complaint temporarily improved. However, since the symptom recurred, he was referred to our institution. After admission, to examine the cause of his thirst and polyuria, we performed a water restriction test, vasopressin loading test, hypertonic saline loading test and pituitary magnetic resonance imaging. Based on the findings, we diagnosed him with central diabetes insipidus due to IgG4-related hypophysitis. We increased the dose of prednisolone to 0.6 mg/kg/day and started 10 Î¼g/day of intranasal desmopressin. His symptoms were subsequently alleviated, and his serum IgG4 level finally normalized. We should remember that IgG4-related disease can be accompanied by hypophysitis and that central diabetes insipidus is brought about by IgG4-related hypophysitis. This case report should remind physicians of the fact that pituitary inflammation due to IgG4-related disease is very rare and can be masked by symptoms due to salivary gland inflammation, which can lead to pitfalls in the diagnosis in clinical practice.
