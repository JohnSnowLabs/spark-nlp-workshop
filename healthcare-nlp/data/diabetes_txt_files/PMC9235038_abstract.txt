The first meta-analysis to comprehensively evaluate the effects of taurine supplementation on diabetic patients.
Statistical significance in HbA1C, Fasting Blood Sugar, HOMA-IR after oral supplemental of taurine by diabetic patients than that of placebo.
Taurine is expected to be a new option for the management of diabetes.
The ameliorative effect of taurine on diabetes has received extensive attention in recent years. Despite promising data from animal studies, the efficacy of taurine supplementation in human studies has been inconsistent. We thus did a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to assess the effect of taurine supplement on glycemic indices, serum lipids, blood pressure, body composition in patients with diabetes.
We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, Web of Science, FDA.gov, and ClinicalTrials.gov for randomized controlled trials (published from inception to January 15, 2022; no language restrictions) about the effect of taurine supplement on diabetes. Values of Standardized Mean Differences (SMD) were determined for continuous outcomes.
Of 2206 identified studies, 5 randomized controlled trials were eligible and were included in our analysis (N = 209 participants). Compared with the control group, taurine could significantly reduce HbA1c (SMD −0.41[95% CI: −0.74, −0.09], p = 0.01), Fasting Blood Sugar (SMD − 1.28[95% CI: −2.42, −0.14], p = 0.03) and HOMA-IR (SMD − 0.64[95% CI: −1.22, −0.06], p = 0.03). In addition, taurine also reduced Insulin (SMD −0.48 [95% CI: −0.99, 0.03], p = 0.06) and TG (SMD −0.26 [95% CI: −0.55, 0.02], p = 0.07), but did not reach statistical significance.
Taurine supplementation is beneficial in reducing glycemic indices, such as HbA1c, Fasting Blood Sugar, HOMA-IR in diabetic patients, but has no significant effect on serum lipids, blood pressure and body composition in diabetic patients. Taurine emerges as a new option for the management of patients with diabetes. Further studies are needed to understand the potential effect of taurine in diabetic patients.
