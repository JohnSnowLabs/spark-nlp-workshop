Water homeostasis disorders, such as syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), diabetes insipidus (DI), and cerebral salt-wasting syndrome (CSWS), can develop after neurosurgery. Additionally, DI, SIADH, and CSWS have been reported concurrently in association with some neurosurgical conditions, in particular after pituitary gland surgery or as sequelae of post-traumatic brain injury. Therefore, neurosurgeons should expect water homeostasis disorders after the removal of tumors of the sellar/suprasellar region and be prepared to aggressively manage them.
