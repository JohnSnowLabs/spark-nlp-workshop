The exponentially growing frequency of diagnosing diabetes mellitus means that a verification of the previous dietetic approach to treating the disease seems justified. The simultaneous growth of interest in the ketogenic diet and the development of knowledge in this field have contributed to the increasingly frequent application of the ketogenic diet in diabetes treatment. This paper also deals with that issue; its aim includes an extensive analysis of the influence of the ketogenic diet on the prophylaxis and treatment of diabetes. The paper has been prepared based on a wide, meticulous analysis of the available literature on the subject. Among other findings, a favorable effect of that nutrition model has been demonstrated on the values of glycated hemoglobin, glucose, insulin, or other metabolic parameters in diabetes patients. The effect of the ketogenic diet on the pharmacotherapy of type 1 and type 2 diabetes has been presented and compared with the standard nutritional management plan recommended for that disease. Further research is needed in this field, especially studies with a long follow-up period. The discussed articles report interesting therapeutic advantages to the ketogenic diet in comparison with standard diets.
