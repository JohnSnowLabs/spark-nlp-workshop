Genoa syndrome was first described by Camera et al in 1993 in two patients with semilobar holoprosencephaly (HPE), craniosynostosis and abnormal small hands with coneâˆ’shaped epiphyses and hypoplastic terminal phalanges of fingers (OMIM: 601370). In 2001, Lapunzina et al reported a case of craniosynostosis and HPE associated with several other malformations and suggested that these findings could be attributed to a severe form of Genoa syndrome or to a newly recognized syndrome. Endocrinopathies in association with HPE are frequently reported in the literature. Diabetes insipidus, hypothyroidism, hypocortisolism, and growth hormone deficiency are frequently associated with HPE. We here report a case of semilobar HPE, craniosynostosis and cleft lip/palate, possibly a case of Genoa syndrome, associated with central diabetes insipidus.
