Congenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (CNDI) is a rare hereditary renal disorder that is caused by mutations in AVPR2 or aquaporin 2 (AQP2). Up to now, there are few reports about CNDI in neonates. Early clinical manifestations of CNDI in neonates are atypical. A lack of understanding of the disease by clinicians causes frequent misdiagnoses or missed diagnoses, which may result in failure to administer treatments in time and ultimately leads to severe complications. In this study, clinical data of a case of AVPR2 gene mutation-induced CNDI, which was confirmed by genetic testing, were retrospectively analyzed to improve our understanding of this disease.
On February 1, 2020, a male neonate was hospitalized 17 d after birth due to a 7 d period of pyrexia. The patient’s symptoms included recurrent pyrexia, hypernatremia and hyperchloremia, which were difficult to treat. The patient was fed on demand, and water was additionally provided between milk intakes. A combination treatment of hydrochlorothiazide and amiloride was administered. After the treatment, body temperature and electrolyte levels returned to normal, the volume of urine was significantly reduced and the patient was subsequently discharged. Genetic tests confirmed that the patient carried the AVPR2 gene missense mutation c.541C>T (P.R181C), and the patient’s mother carried a heterozygous mutation at the same locus. After clinical treatment with a combination of hydrochlorothiazide and amiloride, the body temperature and electrolyte levels returned to normal. Up until the most recent follow-up examination, normal body temperature, electrolyte levels and growth and development were observed.
CNDI in the neonatal period is rare, and its clinical manifestations are unspecific with some patients merely showing recurrent fever and electrolyte disturbance. Genetic testing of AVPR2 and AQP2 can be used for screening and genetic diagnosis of CNDI.
