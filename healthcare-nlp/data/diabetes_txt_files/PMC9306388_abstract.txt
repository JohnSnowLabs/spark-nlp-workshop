To implement a community-based screening and awareness-raising project for gestational diabetes in Ahmedabad, India.
The project took place between April 2016 and August 2019 in Ahmedabad. Medical college faculty members and medical officers trained 3582 paramedical staff on screening for gestational diabetes. These paramedical staff tested all pregnant women 24–28 weeks gestation, who were attending village health and nutrition days – also called mamta days – in urban and rural health centres for routine antenatal care, for gestational diabetes. An oral glucose tolerance test was used and blood sugar ≥ 7.8 mmol/L was the cut-off for gestational diabetes. Women with gestational diabetes were referred for counselling and treatment and all women were followed until 6 weeks after delivery.
Of 53 522 pregnant women screened, 6786 (12.7%) had gestational diabetes and were referred for nutritional therapy or medication; 836 (12.3%) of these women started medication. There was no significant difference in the prevalence of stillbirths between women with gestational diabetes (0.8%; 54/6786) and women without (0.7%; 338/46 736; P-value: 0.51). Of the women on treatment, 38 had abnormal blood glucose after delivery and continued with the medication. Two women with gestational diabetes died; they had other associated co-morbidities – pre-eclampsia and anaemia.
We found a high prevalence of gestational diabetes, indicating the need for gestational diabetes screening and implementation of this project on a larger scale. Gestational diabetes screening at the community level is operationally feasible using the existing human resources and infrastructure of the reproductive health programmes.
