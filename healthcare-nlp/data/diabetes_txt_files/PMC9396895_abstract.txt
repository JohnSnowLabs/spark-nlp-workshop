It is well known that diabetes is a prominent risk factor for cardiovascular (CV) events. The level of CV risk depends on the type and duration of diabetes, age and additional co-morbidities. Diabetes is an independent risk factor for atrial fibrillation (AF) and is frequently observed in patients with AF, which further increases their risk of stroke associated with this cardiac arrhythmia. Nearly one third of patients with diabetes globally have CV disease (CVD). Additionally, co-morbid AF and coronary artery disease are more frequently observed in patients with diabetes than the general population, further increasing the already high CV risk of these patients. To protect against thromboembolic events in patients with diabetes and AF or established CVD, guidelines recommend optimal CV risk factor control, including oral anticoagulation treatment. However, patients with diabetes exist in a prothrombotic and inflammatory state. Greater clinical benefit may therefore be seen with the use of stronger antithrombotic agents or innovative drug combinations in high-risk patients with diabetes, such as those who have concomitant AF or established CVD. In this review, we discuss CV risk management strategies in patients with diabetes and concomitant vascular disease, stroke prevention regimens in patients with diabetes and AF and how worsening renal function in these patients may complicate these approaches. Accumulating evidence from clinical trials and real-world evidence show a benefit to the administration of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants for stroke prevention in patients with diabetes and AF.
