The development of an effective vaccine is a powerful tool to contain the global spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Still, it raises potential safety concerns about the subsequent enhancement of associated immunopathology. Increasing evidence shows that the endocrine system, including the hypophysis, may be involved in COVID-19. Moreover, occasional but increasing reports of endocrine disorders involving the thyroid have been reported after the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine. Among them, a few cases encompass the pituitary. Here we report a rare case of central diabetes insipidus following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.
We report a 59-year-old femaleÂ patient with a 25-year history of Crohn's disease in long-term remission, who presented with sudden onset of polyuria eight weeks after administration of an mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Laboratory evaluation was consistent with isolated central diabetes insipidus. Magnetic resonance imaging displayed involvement of the infundibulum and the posterior hypophysis. Eighteen months after the vaccination, she is still under desmopressin treatment and had stable pituitary stalk thickening on magnetic resonance imaging. Although Crohn's disease-associated hypophysitis has been reported, it is scarce. In the absence of other recognizable causes of hypophysitis, we believe the involvement of the hypophysis in our patient may have been triggered by the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.
We report a rare case of central diabetes insipidus potentially associated with SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination. Further studies are needed to understand better the mechanisms underlying autoimmune endocrinopathies development in the context of COVID-19 infection and SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.
