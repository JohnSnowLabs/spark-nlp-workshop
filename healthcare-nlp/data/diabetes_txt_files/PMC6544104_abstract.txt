SUMMARY â€“ A rare case of necrotizing hypophysitis (NH) in a 52-year-old man presenting with pituitary apoplexy and sterile meningitis is described. This case indicates that the diagnosis of NH could be made without biopsy, based on concomitant presence of diabetes insipidus, hypopituitarism and radiologic features of ischemic pituitary apoplexy. Conservative management of pituitary apoplexy should be advised in NH. Additionally, this is the first report of a case of sterile meningitis caused by ischemic pituitary apoplexy.
