A multicentric cross-sectional observational survey was conducted to understand the patient, physician, nurse, caregiver, and diabetes counselor/educator-related factors that define the “glycemic happiness” of persons with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Five sets of questionnaires based on a five-point Likert scale were used. A total of 167 persons with T2DM, 167 caregivers, and 34 each of physicians, nurses, and diabetes counselors/educators participated. For persons with T2DM, an adequate understanding of diabetes (mean score ± standard deviation: 4.2 ± 0.9), happiness and satisfaction with life (4.1 ± 0.8), flexibility (4.2 ± 0.8) and convenience (4.2 ± 0.7) of treatment, and confidence to handle hypo/hyperglycemic episodes (4.0 ± 0.9) were the factors positively associated with glycemic happiness. Caregivers’ factors included information from physicians on patient care (4.5 ± 0.6), constructive conversations with persons with T2DM (4.2 ± 0.8), helping them with regular glucose monitoring (4.2 ± 0.9), and caregivers’ life satisfaction (4.2 ± 0.8). Factors for physicians, nurses, and diabetes counselors/educators were belief in their ability to make a difference in the life of persons with T2DM (4.8 ± 0.4, 4.4 ± 0.5, and 4.5 ± 0.5), satisfaction from being able to help them (4.9 ± 0.3, 4.6 ± 0.5, and 4.6 ± 0.5), and professional satisfaction (4.9 ± 0.4, 4.4 ± 0.6, and 4.7 ± 0.4). Our survey identified the key factors pertaining to different stakeholders in diabetes care, which cumulatively define the glycemic happiness of persons with T2DM.
