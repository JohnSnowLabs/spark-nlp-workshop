Treatment-related quality of life (QOL) is an important aspect of diabetes management. We evaluated the influence of a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, tofogliflozin, on treatment-related QOL in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
This is the prespecified subanalysis study of the “Using TOfogliflozin for Possible better Intervention against Atherosclerosis for type 2 diabetes patients (UTOPIA)” trial. Treatment-related QOL was evaluated at baseline, week 26, week 52, and week 104 after the initiation of the study using the Diabetes Therapy-Related QOL questionnaire (DTR-QOL). Among the 340 patients in the original UTOPIA study, a total of 252 patients (127, tofogliflozin group; 125, conventional treatment group) who completed the DTR-QOL questionnaire at baseline were the study subjects of the current subanalysis.
The tofogliflozin and conventional treatment groups exhibited almost comparable baseline clinical characteristics, while the use of antihypertensive drugs and lipid-lowering agents was significantly lower in the tofogliflozin treatment group than in the conventional treatment group. Tofogliflozin treatment increased the total score of DTR-QOL7 from baseline (P < 0.001), while conventional treatment did not change it. There were statistically significant differences in delta change in the total DTR-QOL7 score and DTR-QOL7 Q4, Q5, Q6, and Q7 scores from the baseline to week 104 between the treatment groups. Delta changes in HbA1c (Spearman’s correlation coefficient, ρ =  − 0.30, P < 0.001), fasting blood glucose (ρ =  − 0.16, P = 0.031), BMI (ρ =  − 0.19, P = 0.008), and waist circumference (ρ =  − 0.17, P = 0.024) at week 104 were negatively associated with delta change in the total QOL7 score.
Our data indicated that tofogliflozin treatment improved treatment-related QOL compared to conventional treatment in Japanese patients with T2DM, in accordance with the improvement of major cardiovascular risk factors.
