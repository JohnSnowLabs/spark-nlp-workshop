Central diabetes insipidus (CDI) is an uncommon condition resulting from lack of vasopressin secretion from the posterior pituitary gland typically caused by some form of destruction of the gland. Here we present a case of transient CDI after discontinuation of vasopressin used for septic shock without evidence of overt pituitary damage. Serum sodium concentration peaked at 160â€‰mmol/L in the setting of polyuria within days of vasopressin discontinuation without identified alternative etiologies. Sodium levels and urine output normalized with administration of desmopressin with continued stability after desmopressin was discontinued. This is one of few reported cases of diabetes insipidus occurring after discontinuation of vasopressin and the rapid and profound response to desmopressin in this case proves a central etiology. This case allows for speculation into predisposing risk factors for this phenomenon including preexisting neurological disease.
