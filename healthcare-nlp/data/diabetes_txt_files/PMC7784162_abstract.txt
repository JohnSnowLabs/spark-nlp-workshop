This study assessed whether short message service (SMS) reminders would improve follow-up rate among gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) patients by 12 weeks postpartum.
In this single-center, single-blind randomized controlled trial, we assigned 308 patients with GDM to either of 2 arms, usual care alone versus usual care with SMS reminders. In the usual care group, 154 patients received a 10-minute short lecture on GDM and a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) request prior to discharge. In the SMS group, 154 patients received twice a week SMS reminders at 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 10 weeks after delivery in addition to usual care. The primary outcome was clinic visit within 6 to 12 weeks postpartum with a 75 g OGTT result.
In our population, the overall follow-up rate was 19.8% (61/308). Follow up rates were 20.1% (31/154) for the usual care group and 19.5% (30/154) for the SMS. The addition of SMS reminders was not associated with an increase in follow-up rate at 12 weeks postpartum (adjusted RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.63-1.52; p=0.932). The use of insulin or metformin for GDM control was associated with increased follow-up (adjusted RR 1.92, 95% CI 1.20-3.07; p=0.006).
SMS reminders did not improve postpartum follow-up rate among GDM patients at 12 weeks postpartum.
