Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a common disorder that occurs in pregnant women, leading to many maternal and neonatal complications. The pathogenesis of GDM is complex and includes risk factors, such as: age, obesity, and family history of diabetes. Studies have shown that genetic factors also play a role in the pathogenesis of GDM. The present study investigated whether polymorphisms in the PPARG (rs1801282), TMEM163 (rs6723108 and rs998451), UBE2E2 (rs6780569), and WFS1 (rs4689388) genes are risk factors for the development of GDM and whether they affect selected clinical parameters in women with GDM. This study included 204 pregnant women with GDM and 207 pregnant women with normal glucose tolerance (NGT). The diagnosis of GDM was based on a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) at 24â€“28 weeks gestation, according to the International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG) criteria. There were no statistically significant differences in the distribution of polymorphisms studied between women with GDM and pregnant women with normal carbohydrate tolerance, which suggests that these polymorphisms are not risk factors for GDM. We also examined the associations between studied gene polymorphisms and clinical parameters: fasting glucose, daily insulin requirement, body mass before pregnancy, body mass at birth, body mass increase during pregnancy, BMI before pregnancy, BMI at birth, BMI increase during pregnancy, new-born body mass, and APGAR score in women with GDM. We observed lower BMI values before pregnancy and at birth in women with PPARG rs17036160 TT genotype. The results of this study suggest that the PPARG (rs1801282), TMEM163 (rs6723108 and rs998451), UBE2E2 (rs6780569), and WFS1 (rs4689388) gene polymorphisms are not significant risk factors for GDM development in the Polish population and do not affect the clinical parameters in women with GDM; only rs1801282 of the PPARG gene may influence BMI values in women with GDM.
