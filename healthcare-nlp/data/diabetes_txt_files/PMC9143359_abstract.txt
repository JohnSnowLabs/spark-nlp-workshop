Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a major public health issue of our century due to its increasing prevalence, affecting 5% to 20% of all pregnancies. The pathogenesis of GDM has not been completely elucidated to date. Increasing evidence suggests the association of environmental factors with genetic and epigenetic factors in the development of GDM. So far, several metabolomics studies have investigated metabolic disruptions associated with GDM. The aim of this review is to highlight the usefulness of maternal metabolites as diagnosis markers of GDM as well as the importance of both maternal and fetal metabolites as prognosis biomarkers for GDM and GDMâ€™s transition to type 2 diabetes mellitus T2DM.
