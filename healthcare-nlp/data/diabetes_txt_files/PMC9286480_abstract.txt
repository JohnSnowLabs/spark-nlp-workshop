Diabetes mellitus (DM), a chronic metabolic disease characterised by elevated levels of blood glucose, is among the most common chronic diseases. The incidence and prevalence of DM have been increasing over the years. The complications of DM represent a serious health problem. The long‐term complications include macroangiopathy, microangiopathy and neuropathy as well as sexual dysfunction (SD) in both men and women. Erectile dysfunction (ED) has been considered the most important SD in men with DM. The prevalence of ED is approximately 3.5‐fold higher in men with DM than in those without DM. Common risk factors for the development of DM and its complications include sedentary lifestyle, overweight/obesity and increased caloric consumption. Although lifestyle changes may help improve sexual function, specific treatments are often needed. This study aims to review the definition and prevalence of ED in DM, the impact of DM complications and DM treatment on ED and, finally, the current and emerging therapies for ED in patients with DM.
