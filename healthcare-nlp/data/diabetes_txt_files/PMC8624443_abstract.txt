Wolfram Syndrome (WS) is a rare neurodegenerative disease with autosomal recessive inheritance and characterized by juvenile onset, non-autoimmune diabetes mellitus and later followed by optic atrophy leading to blindness, diabetes insipidus, hearing loss, and other neurological and endocrine dysfunctions. A wide spectrum of neurodegenerative abnormalities affecting the central nervous system has been described. Among these complications, neurogenic bladder and urodynamic abnormalities also deserve attention. Urinary tract dysfunctions (UTD) up to end stage renal disease are a life-threatening complication of WS patients. Notably, end stage renal disease is reported as one of the most common causes of death among WS patients. UTD have been also reported in affected adolescents. Involvement of the urinary tract occurs in about 90% of affected patients, at a median age of 20 years and with peaks at 13, 21 and 33 years. The aim of our narrative review was to provide an overview of the most important papers regarding urological impairment in Wolfram Syndrome. A comprehensive search on PubMed including Wolfram Syndrome and one or more of the following terms: chronic renal failure, bladder dysfunction, urological aspects, and urinary tract dysfunction, was done. The exclusion criteria were studies not written in English and not including urinary tract dysfunction deep evaluation and description. Studies mentioning general urologic abnormalities without deep description and/or follow-up were not considered. Due to the rarity of the condition, we considered not only papers including pediatric patients, but also papers with pediatric and adult case reports
