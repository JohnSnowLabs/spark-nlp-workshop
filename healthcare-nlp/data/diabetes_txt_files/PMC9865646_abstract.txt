We previously reported the novel finding that β3-AR is functionally expressed in the renal tubule and shares its cellular localization with the vasopressin receptor AVPR2, whose physiological stimulation triggers antidiuresis by increasing the plasma membrane expression of the water channel AQP2 and the NKCC2 symporter in renal cells. We also showed that pharmacologic stimulation of β3-AR is capable of triggering antidiuresis and correcting polyuria, in the knockout mice for the AVPR2 receptor, the animal model of human X-linked nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (XNDI), a rare genetic disease still missing a cure. Here, to demonstrate that the same response can be evoked in humans, we evaluated the effect of treatment with the β3-AR agonist mirabegron on AQP2 and NKCC2 trafficking, by evaluating their urinary excretion in a cohort of patients with overactive bladder syndrome, for the treatment of which the drug is already approved. Compared to baseline, treatment with mirabegron significantly increased AQP2 and NKCC2 excretion for the 12 weeks of treatment. This data is a step forward in corroborating the hypothesis that in patients with XNDI, treatment with mirabegron could bypass the inactivation of AVPR2, trigger antidiuresis and correct the dramatic polyuria which is the main hallmark of this disease.
