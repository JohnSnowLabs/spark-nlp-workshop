To compare metabolic profiles and the long-term risk of metabolic dysfunction between women with previous gestational diabetes mellitus (pGDM) and women without pGDM (non-GDM) matched on age, prepregnancy body mass index (BMI), and parity. 
 In total, 128 women with pGDM (median follow-up: 7.8 years) and 70 non-GDM controls (median follow-up: 10.0 years) completed a 2â€‰h oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) with assessment of glucose, C-peptide, insulin, and other metabolic measures. Additionally, anthropometrics, fat mass, and blood pressure were assessed and indices of insulin sensitivity and beta cell function were calculated. 
 The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) was significantly higher in the pGDM group compared to the non-GDM group (26% vs. 0%). For women with pGDM, the prevalence of prediabetes (38%) and the metabolic syndrome (MetS) (59%) were approximately 3-fold higher than in non-GDM women (p's < 0.001). Both insulin sensitivity and beta cell function were significantly reduced in pGDM women compared to non-GDM women. 
 Despite similar BMI, women with pGDM had a substantially higher risk of developing T2DM, prediabetes, and the MetS compared to controls. Both beta cell dysfunction and reduced insulin sensitivity seem to contribute to this increased risk.
