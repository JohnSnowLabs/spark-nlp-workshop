Diabetes insipidus (DI) is a disorder of water balance characterized by polyuria and polydipsia. It can occur due to genetic and acquired causes that affect the secretion or action of arginine vasopressin (AVP) or antidiuretic hormone (ADH).Markedly increased thirst and urination are not only quite distressing but also increases the risk of volume depletion and hypernatremia in severe situations. A careful diagnosis of the type of DI and its etiology is based on careful clinical evaluation, measurement of urine and serum osmolality, and water deprivation test. Management includes the correction of any water deficit and the use of specific pharmacological agents, including desmopressin, thiazides, and amiloride.
