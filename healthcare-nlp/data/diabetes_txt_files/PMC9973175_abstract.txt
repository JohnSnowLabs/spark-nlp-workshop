The objective of this study is to synthesize the current literature about the relationship between the occurrence of diabetes insipidus (DI), its diagnosis criteria, and management after withdrawal of vasopressin (VP) in critically ill.
This scoping review followed the recommendations of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses for Scoping Review (PRISMA-ScR). The search literature was conducted in MEDLINE and EMBASE databases, until March 2022. A manual search was also conducted in order to include articles that were not identified in the initial search performed in the databases.
The selection of studies and extraction of data were carried out in a paired and independent manner. There was no restriction regarding the language of publication of the included manuscripts.
The analysis included 17 studies (16 case reports and one retrospective cohort). All studies used VP, with a median time of drug infusion of 48 hours (IQR: 16–72) and DI incidence of 1.53%. The diagnosis of DI was based on diuresis output and concomitant hypernatremia or changes in serum sodium concentration, with median time to symptoms onset after discontinuation of VP of 5 hours (IQR: 3–10). The treatment of DI consisted mainly of fluid management and the use of desmopressin.
DI after VP withdrawal was present in 51 patients described in 17 studies, but diagnosis and management varied among each report. Using the available data, we propose a diagnosis suggestion and a flowchart for managing patients with DI after withdrawal of VP in the Intensive Care Unit. Multicentric collaborative research is urgently needed to obtain more quality data on this topic.
