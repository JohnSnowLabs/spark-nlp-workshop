Many adults diagnosed with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) also have other known or unknown comorbid conditions. The rising prevalence of GDM and T2DM within a broader context of multimorbidity can best be addressed through an integrated management response, instead of stand-alone programs targeting specific infectious and/or chronic diseases.
To describe GDM and T2DM screening, care and cost-effectiveness outcomes in the context of multimorbidity through integrated interventions in Africa.
A systematic review of all published studies was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Risk Of Bias in Non-randomised Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-I) was used to assess risk of bias. Data synthesis was conducted using narrative synthesis of included studies.
A total of 9 out of 13 included studies reported integrated diabetes mellitus (DM) screening, 7 included integrated care and 9 studies addressed cases of newly detected DM who were asymptomatic in pre-diabetes stage. Only 1 study clearly analysed cost-effectiveness in home-based care; another 5 did not evaluate cost-effectiveness but discussed potential cost benefits of an integrated approach to DM screening and care. Compared to partial integration, only 2 fully integrated interventions yielded tangible results regarding DM screening, care and early detection of cases despite many that reported barriers to its sustainability.
Though few, integrated interventions for screening and/or care of DM in the context of multimorbidity within available resources in health systems throughout Africa exist and suggest that this approach is possible and could improve health outcomes.
