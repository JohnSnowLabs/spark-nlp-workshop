Evidence suggests a major contribution of postprandial glucose (PPG) excursions to the increased risk of micro- and macro-vascular complications in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Administration of bolus insulin remains a very effective therapeutic option for PPG control. The aim of this expert group recommendation document was to provide practical and easy-to-execute guidelines for physicians on the appropriate use of bolus insulin in the management of T2DM. A panel of key opinion leaders from India reviewed and discussed the available clinical evidence and guideline recommendations on the following topics: (1) optimum control of PPG; (2) choice of bolus insulin; and (3) special situations and practical considerations. The expert panel critically analyzed the current literature and clinical practice guidelines and factored their rich clinical experience to develop a set of nine expert group recommendations for the effective use of bolus insulin. These recommendations will not only result in a more evidence-based application of bolus insulin in the clinical setting but also trigger further research and provide a valuable base for the development of future guidelines on the use of bolus insulin in the management of individuals with T2DM.
