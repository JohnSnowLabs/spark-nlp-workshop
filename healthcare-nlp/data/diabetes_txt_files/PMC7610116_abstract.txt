Gut dysbiosis is generally associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, the effect of habitual dietary intake on gut dysbiosis in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus has not yet been explicated. This study investigated whether alteration of the gut microbiota was influenced by dietary intake of sucrose in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
In this cross‐sectional study, 97 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and 97 healthy individuals were matched by age and sex, and then, fecal samples were obtained. Next‐generation sequencing of the 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid gene was carried out, and functional profiles for the gut microbiota were analyzed. We selected the top 30 gut microbial genera and top 20 functional profiles for the gut microbiota specified by the weighted average difference method. The association between gut microbial genera or functional profiles and habitual dietary intake was investigated by Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient, and then, clustering analysis was carried out to clarify the impact of habitual dietary intake.
The Actinobacteria phylum was highly abundant in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whereas the Bacteroidetes phylum was less abundant. Diabetic‐type gut microbes, specifically Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium, were altered by sucrose intake at the genus level. Furthermore, sucrose intake was associated with glycolysis/gluconeogenesis in the diabetic‐type functional profiles of the gut microbiota.
The gut microbiota and functional profiles for the gut microbiota in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were significantly different from those in healthy individuals. Furthermore, we showed that sucrose intake was closely associated with these differences.
Gut dysbiosis and change of functional profiles of the gut microbiota exist in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Diet habit, especially sucrose intake, has a close association with these changes.
