We presented the late magnetic resonance imaging characteristics in a 47-year-old male who diagnosed with a permanent trauma-induced diabetes insipidus. The patient developed polyuria following a deceleration injury which has been diagnosed as central diabetes insipidus based on the water deprivation test. Computed tomography or magnetic resonance evaluation of the pituitary gland is usually normal in such cases. Therefore, negative imaging studies do not exclude the diagnosis. However, MRI is more sensitive and can depict subtle injuries of the hypothalamus-pituitary axis in acute and late phases. The late MR imaging findings are not well established. To the best of our knowledge, this will be the first report to describe the late MR imaging features in a permanent case of trauma-induced diabetes insipidus.
