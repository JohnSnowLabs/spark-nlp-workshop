Incident diabetes risk is inversely proportional to 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels among non-Hispanic white but is unclear among African American (AA) populations. Serum 25(OH)D2 may be an important component of total 25(OH)D among AA populations due to higher levels of melanin.
To assess the association of serum 25(OH)D with incident diabetes among AAs and stratify by detectable 25(OH)D2.
Serum 25(OH)D2 and 25(OH)D3 were collected from 2000 to 2004 among AA participants in the Jackson Heart Study. A cosinor model was used to adjust for the seasonality of 25(OH)D3; 25(OH)D3 and 25(OH)D2 were combined to ascertain total 25(OH)D. Incident diabetes (fasting glucose ≥126 mg/dl, use of diabetes drugs, or HbA1c ≥6.5%) was assessed over 12 years among adults without diabetes at baseline. Participants with missing baseline covariates or diabetes follow-up were excluded. Hazard ratios (HR) were estimated using Cox modeling, adjusting for age, sex, education, occupation, smoking, physical activity, alcohol use, aldosterone, and body-mass index.
Among 3311 adults (mean age 53.3 years, 63% female) 584 participants developed diabetes over a median of 7.7 years. After adjustment, 25(OH)D ≥20 compared to <12 ng/ml was associated with a HR 0.78 (95% CI: 0.61, 1.00). Among participants with detectable 25(OH)D2 and 25(OH)D3 (n = 1671), 25(OH)D ≥ 20 ng/ml compared to <12 ng/ml was associated with a 35% (HR 0.65, 95% CI: 0.46, 0.91) lower risk of diabetes.
Higher levels of 25(OH)D may be protective against the development of diabetes among AA individuals, particularly among those with detectable 25(OH)D2 and 25(OH)D3.
