Knowledge of the impact of in utero exposure to lithium during the postnatal period is limited. Besides a possible teratogenic effect during the first trimester, exposure during the second and third trimesters might lead to neonatal effects. Uniform guidelines for postnatal management of these neonates are lacking. The aim was to retrospectively describe all neonates admitted to the University Hospitals Leuven after in utero exposure to lithium (January 2010 to April 2020), and to propose a postnatal care protocol. Descriptive statistics were performed. For continuous parameters with serial measurements, median population values were calculated. In total, 10 mother-neonate pairs were included. The median gestational age was 37 (interquartile range, IQR, 36–39) weeks. Neonatal plasma lithium concentration at birth was 0.65 (IQR 0.56–0.83) mmol/L with a median neonate/mother ratio of 1.02 (IQR 0.87–1.08). Three neonates needed respiratory support, 7/10 started full enteral (formula) feeding on day 1. The median length of neonatal stay was 8.5 (IQR 8–12) days. One neonate developed nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. This study reported in detail the postnatal characteristics and short-term neonatal outcomes. A postnatal care protocol was proposed, to enhance the quality of care for future neonates, and to guide parental counselling. Future prospective protocol evaluation is needed.
