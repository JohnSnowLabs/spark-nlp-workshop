To map evidence on the implementation of the WHO’s collaborative framework for the management of tuberculosis (TB) and diabetes mellitus (DM) comorbidity, globally.
Scoping review.
Guided by Arksey and O’Malley’s scoping review framework, this review mapped literature on the global implementation of the framework for the management of TB and DM comorbidity, globally. An extensive literature search for peer-reviewed studies, theses, studies in the press and a list of references from the selected studies was conducted to source-eligible studies. PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science, Science Direct, the EBSCOhost platform (academic search complete, health source: nursing/academic edition, CINAHL with full text), Scopus and the WHO library were used to source the literature. We performed title screening of articles using keywords in the databases, after which two independent reviewers (RS and PV) screened abstracts and full articles. Studies from August 2011 to May 2021 were included in this review and the screening was guided by the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Findings were analysed using the thematic content analysis approach and results presented in the form of a narrative report. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis extension was used as a checklist and for explaining the scoping review process.
This review found evidence of the WHO TB-DM collaborative framework’s implementation in 35 countries across the globe. TB-DM comorbidity was identified in patients through bidirectional screening of both patients with TB and patients with DM in rural and urban settings.
Due to the paucity of evidence on mechanisms of collaboration, we recommend further research in other implementing countries to identify techniques used for diagnosis and integration of TB and DM services, in order to ensure that effective and joint management of TB-DM comorbidity in populations is achieved.
