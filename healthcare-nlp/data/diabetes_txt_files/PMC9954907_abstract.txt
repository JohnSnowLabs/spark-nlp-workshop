Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease caused by the presence of a bacterial biofilm known as dental plaque. This biofilm affects the supporting apparatus of the teeth, especially the periodontal ligaments and the bone surrounding the teeth. Periodontal disease and diabetes seem to be interrelated and in a bidirectional relationship, and have been increasingly studied in recent decades. For example, diabetes mellitus has a detrimental effect on periodontal disease, increasing its prevalence, extent, and severity. In turn, periodontitis negatively affects glycemic control and the course of diabetes. This review aims to present the most recently discovered factors that contribute to the pathogenesis, therapy, and prophylaxis of these two diseases. Specifically, the article focuses on microvascular complications, oral microbiota, pro- and anti-inflammatory factors in diabetes, and periodontal disease. As presented in this review, these two diseases require specific/ complementary therapeutic solutions when they occur in association, with new clinical trials and epidemiological research being necessary for better control of this interdependent pathogenic topic.
