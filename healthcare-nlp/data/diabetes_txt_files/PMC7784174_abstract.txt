The study aims to determine the association of diabetes-related emotional distress with reported diabetes self-care, and glycemic control of adult Filipinos with type 2 diabetes mellitus at The Medical City using 2 psychometric tests.
This is a cross-sectional study conducted among 94 Filipinos diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus, who answered 2 validated English questionnaires: Problem areas in diabetes (PAID-20) and Diabetes self-management questionnaire (DSMQ) that screen for diabetes-related emotional distress and diabetes reported self-care, respectively. Data were encoded and analyzed using Stata SE v.13.
42.6% of Filipinos with type 2 diabetes mellitus had emotional distress showing moderate to severe distress in factor 1 (diabetes-related emotional distress) and factor 3 (food related problems). 51.1% had suboptimal self-care, poorly scoring in areas of health-care use and dietary control. Majority of those who had diabetes-related distress and poor self-care where young, pre-obese and had diabetes duration of Â±5 years. There was no significant association between diabetes-related emotional distress with diabetes self-care and emotional distress with glycated hemoglobin, but majority of those who had diabetes distress had higher glycated hemoglobin. There was significant association between diabetes self-care and glycemic outcomes (p=0.006) with relative risk of 1.51 (95% CI 1.10-2.07). There was linear inverse weak correlation between all subdomains of DSMQ with glycated hemoglobin except Dietary Control.
Diabetes-related emotional distress and sub-optimal self-care are prevalent among Filipinos with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Those who had poor self-care were 1.5 times more likely to have poor glycemic outcomes.
