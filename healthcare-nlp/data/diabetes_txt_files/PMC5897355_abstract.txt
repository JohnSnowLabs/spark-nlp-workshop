Congenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) is characterized by the inability of the kidney to concentrate urine. Congenital NDI is mainly caused by loss-of-function mutations in the vasopressin type 2 receptor (V2R), leading to impaired aquaporin-2 (AQP2) water channel activity. So far, treatment options of congenital NDI either by rescuing mutant V2R with chemical chaperones or by elevating cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels have failed to yield effective therapies. Here we show that inhibition of A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs) binding to PKA increases PKA activity and activates AQP2 channels in cortical collecting duct cells. In vivo, the low molecular weight compound 3,3′-diamino-4,4′-dihydroxydiphenylmethane (FMP-API-1) and its derivatives increase AQP2 activity to the same extent as vasopressin, and increase urine osmolality in the context of V2R inhibition. We therefore suggest that FMP-API-1 may constitute a promising lead compound for the treatment of congenital NDI caused by V2R mutations.
Patients suffering from congenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) fail to concentrate urine due to mutations in vasopressin type 2 receptor (V2R). Here Ando et al. show that agents disrupting the interaction between PKA and AKAPs restore aquaporin-2 activity downstream of V2R, offering a therapeutic approach for the treatment of NDI.
