In recent years, vasopressin has been increasingly used as an early treatment of vasopressor-refractory septic shock. In this article, we describe 2 episodes of transient diabetes insipidus after vasopressin for the treatment of septic shock was discontinued, which adds to a modest number of case studies reporting the same phenomenon. With the anticipated continued use of vasopressin in intensive care units, it can be expected that this adverse effect will occur with some frequency. Awareness and early recognition of this phenomenon can lead to prompt diagnosis and treatment.
