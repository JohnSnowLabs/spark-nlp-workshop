Diabetes mellitus is a common disease that affects 3–5% of the general population in Italy. In some countries of northern Europe or in North America, it can even affect 6–8% of the population. Of great concern is that the number of cases of diabetes is constantly increasing, probably due to the increase in obesity and the sedentary nature of the population. According to the World Health Organization, in the year 2030 there will be 360 million people with diabetes, compared to 170 million in 2000. This has important repercussions on the lives of patients and their families, and on health systems that offer assistance to patients. In this review, we try to describe in an organized way the pathophysiological continuity between diabetes mellitus, endothelial dysfunction, and platelet hyperaggregation, highlighting the main molecular mechanisms involved and the interconnections.
