We sought to ascertain the clinical characteristics and control rate of acromegaly in the UAE.
We conducted a multicenter retrospective analysis of all patients presenting with acromegaly to six endocrine centers in the UAE between November 2010 and December 2018. Demographic, clinical, biochemical, and radiologic data were collected. Patients were considered controlled if normal insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) level and growth hormone < 1 mcg/L were achieved at their last visit.
A total of 75 patients were included in the study (60.0% males, 33.3% native UAE nationals). The mean age at diagnosis was 37.2 (range: 12–69) years. Common clinical features at diagnosis were headache (82.4%), coarse facial features (82.4%), acral enlargement (79.7%), and sweating (31.3%). Diabetes mellitus/prediabetes and hypertension were present in 45.2% and 35.5% of patients, respectively. About 82.2% had pituitary macroadenoma on pituitary magnetic resonance imaging. At presentation, 27.0% and 3.2% of the patients had secondary hypogonadism and diabetes insipidus, respectively. Overall, 76.7% of the patients underwent surgery, 20.8% received radiotherapy, and 50.7% received medical therapy. At their last clinic visit, only 43.7% of all patients achieved disease control.
Our study shows a high prevalence of pituitary macroadenoma in our acromegalic population, suggesting a delayed diagnosis. Also, a significant proportion of patients remained uncontrolled. Efforts to increase physician’s awareness of acromegaly and to improve disease control are underway.
