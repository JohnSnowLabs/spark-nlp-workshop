A six-year-old boy was referred with a one-and-a-half months history of polyuria and polydipsia. At the age of two, he had a single lytic bone lesion in his femoral head, diagnosed as Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) by biopsy at another hospital. As no other affected organs were detected and the affected bone lesion was self-limited, he was not followed up afterward and was doing well. He was diagnosed with diabetes insipidus (DI) by confirming hypernatremia (Na: 148 mEq/l) with hyperosmolar serum (s-Osm 298 mOSM/kg) and inappropriately diluted urine (u-Osm 205 mOSM/kg). His polyuria and polydipsia improved dramatically using the perioral diuretic hormone, and other pituitary functions were not impaired. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed an enlarged pituitary stalk. Sensitive and specific biomarkers of germ cell tumors, including alpha-fetoprotein, placental alkaline phosphatase, and Î²-hCG in the cerebrospinal fluid, were not detected, indicating relapse of LCH. Genetic analysis revealed a BRAF V600E mutation in the primary bone lesion. We recommend systematic follow-up of patients with a history of LCH, even non-CNS single-system single-site disease, especially with BRAF V600E mutation.
