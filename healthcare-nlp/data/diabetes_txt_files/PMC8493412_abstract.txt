The risk of major amputation is higher after urgently planned endovascular therapy for chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). The aim of this nationwide cohort study was to compare outcomes between patients with and without DM following urgently planned open revascularization for CLTI from 2010 to 2014. Out of 1537 individuals registered in the Swedish Vascular Registry, 569 were registered in the National Diabetes Register. A propensity score adjusted Cox regression analysis was conducted to compare outcome between the groups with and without DM. Median follow-up was 4.3 years and 4.5 years for patients with and without DM, respectively. Patients with DM more often had foot ulcers (p = 0.034) and had undergone more previous amputations (p = 0.001) at baseline. No differences in mortality, cardiovascular death, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), or major amputation were observed between groups. The incidence rate of stroke was 70% higher (95% CI: 1.11–2.59; p = 0.0137) and the incidence rate of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) 39% higher (95% CI: 1.00–1.92; p = 0.0472) among patients with DM in comparison to those without. Open vascular surgery remains a first-line option for a substantial number of patients with CLTI, especially for limb salvage in patients with DM. The higher incidence rates of stroke and AMI among patients with DM following open vascular surgery for infrainguinal CLTI require specific consideration preoperatively with the aim of optimizing medical treatment to improve cardiovascular outcome postoperatively.
