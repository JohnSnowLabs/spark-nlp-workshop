To explore the application value of medical intelligent electronic system under the background of Internet of Things in the clinical study of the treatment of overweight/obesity in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with empagliflozin combined with liraglutide; 50 overweight and obese adult T2DM patients in our hospital were randomly divided into the combined group and the control group, 25 cases in each group. The control group was treated with liraglutide alone, while the combined group was treated with empagliflozin on the basis of liraglutide. Based on the Internet of Things technology, with diabetes management as the core, the functions of information collection, transmission, and storage of T2DM patients are realized. Doctors pass the diabetes management plan to T2DM patients through the platform, supervise the implementation, and finally compare the clinical efficacy of the two groups. 
 Compared with before treatment, the body mass index (BMI), fasting blood glucose (FPG), postprandial blood glucose (2hPG), glycosylated hemoglobin (HbAlc), islet beta cell secretion function index (HOMA-β), islet resistance index (HOMA-IR), total cholesterol (TC), and triglyceride (TG) in both groups decreased significantly after treatment. After combined treatment, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), FPG, 2hPG, HbA1c, and HOMA-IR in the combined group were significantly lower than those in the control group (P < 0.05). Hypoglycemia occurred in both groups, with 2 cases in the control group and 4 cases in the combined group. 
 The telemedicine management system based on Internet of Things technology can improve patients' self-management ability and provide a new choice for individualized treatment of overweight/obesity T2DM patients. The combination therapy of empagliflozin and liraglutide can effectively reduce blood sugar, weight, blood pressure, blood lipid, and hypoglycemia and effectively improve insulin resistance and secretion function of islet β cells in T2DM patients.
