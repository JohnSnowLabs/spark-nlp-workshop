The phenotype of type 1 diabetes in Africa, especially sub-Saharan Africa, is poorly understood. Most previously conducted studies have suggested that type 1 diabetes may have a different phenotype from the classical form of the disease described in western literature. Making an accurate diagnosis of type 1 diabetes in Africa is challenging, given the predominance of atypical diabetes forms and limited resources. The peak age of onset of type 1 diabetes in sub-Saharan Africa seems to occur after 18â€“20 years. Multiple studies have reported lower rates of islet autoantibodies ranging from 20 to 60% amongst people with type 1 diabetes in African populations, lower than that reported in other populations. Some studies have reported much higher levels of retained endogenous insulin secretion than in type 1 diabetes elsewhere, with lower rates of type 1 diabetes genetic susceptibility and HLA haplotypes. The HLA DR3 appears to be the most predominant HLA haplotype amongst people with type 1 diabetes in sub-Saharan Africa than the HLA DR4 haplotype. Some type 1 diabetes studies in sub-Saharan Africa have been limited by small sample sizes and diverse methods employed. Robust studies close to diabetes onset are sparse. Large prospective studies with well-standardized methodologies in people at or close to diabetes diagnosis in different population groups will be paramount to provide further insight into the phenotype of type 1 diabetes in sub-Saharan Africa.
