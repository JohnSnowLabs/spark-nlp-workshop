The primary goal of the Genetics and Neuroendocrinology of Short Stature International Study (GeNeSIS) was to assess the safety and effectiveness of HumatropeÂ®, a GH preparation, in the treatment of pediatric patients with short stature. We report our findings in the GH-treated Japanese pediatric population focusing on the incidence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and occurrence of neoplasms. A total of 2,345 Japanese patients were assessed for safety. During a mean observation period of 3.2 yr, T2D occurred in 3 patients (0.13%) and slowly progressive insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (SPIDDM) related to underlying mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) in 1 patient (0.04%). Neoplasms were reported in 13 patients (0.56%), including 1 patient with brain tumor (germinoma) and 5 with craniopharyngiomas (4 recurrences); the remainder were benign, typically dermatological, neoplasms. The incidence of diabetes mellitus determined in the study did not differ from previous reports in GH-treated pediatric patients, and there was no apparent increase in the risk of new neoplastic lesions or malignant tumors.
