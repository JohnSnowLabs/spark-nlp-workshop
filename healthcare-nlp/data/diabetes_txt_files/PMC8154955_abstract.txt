X-linked nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (X-linked NDI) is a rare inherited disease mainly caused by lost-of-function mutations in human AVPR2 gene encoding arginine vasopressin receptor 2 (V2R). Our focus of the current study is on exploration of the functional and biochemical properties of Ile324Met (I324M) mutation identified in a pedigree showing as typical recessive X-linked NDI. We demonstrated that I324M mutation interfered with the conformation of complex glycosylation of V2R. Moreover, almost all of the I324M-V2R failed to express on the cell surface due to being captured by the endoplasmic reticulum control system. We further examined the signaling activity of DDAVP-medicated cAMP and ERK1/2 pathways and the results revealed that the mutant receptor lost the ability in response to DDAVP stimulation contributed to the failure of accumulation of cAMP and phosphorylated ERK1/2. Based on the characteristics of molecular defects of I324M mutant, we selected two reagents (SR49059 and alvespimycin) to determine whether the functions of I324M-V2R can be restored and we found that both compounds can significantly “rescue” I324M mutation. Our findings may provide further insights for understanding the pathogenic mechanism of AVPR2 gene mutations and may offer some implications on development of promising treatments for patients with X-linked NDI.
