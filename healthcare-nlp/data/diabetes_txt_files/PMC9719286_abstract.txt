The association between serum osteocalcin (OCN) levels and metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) is still controversial. Moreover, few studies have explored their relationship in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients so far. The present study aimed to investigate the association of serum OCN levels with MAFLD in Chinese T2DM patients.
This cross-sectional, real-world study included 1889 Chinese T2DM inpatients. MAFLD was diagnosed by abdominal ultrasonography. Participants were divided into four groups according to serum OCN quartiles, among which the clinical characteristics were compared. The association of serum OCN levels with the presence of MAFLD was also analyzed in subjects.
After controlling for sex, age, and diabetes duration, the prevalence of MAFLD significantly decreased across the serum OCN quartiles (55.3%, 52.0%, 48.6%, and 42.1% for the first, second, third, and fourth quartiles, respectively, P < 0.001 for trend). A fully adjusted multiple logistic regression analysis showed that serum OCN levels were independently and negatively associated with the presence of MAFLD in T2DM patients (odds ratio, 0.832; 95% confidence interval, 0.719â€“0.962; P = 0.013). Furthermore, there were significant decreases in HOMA-IR (P = 0.001 for trend) and C-reactive protein (P < 0.001 for trend) levels across the serum OCN quartiles after controlling for sex, age, and diabetes duration.
Serum OCN levels were independently and negatively associated with the presence of MAFLD in Chinese T2DM patients, partially due to the improvement of insulin resistance and inflammation mediated by OCN. Serum OCN may be used as a biomarker to assess the risk of MAFLD in T2DM patients.
