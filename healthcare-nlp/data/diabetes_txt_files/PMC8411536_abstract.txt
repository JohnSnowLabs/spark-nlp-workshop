Central diabetes insipidus (CDI) is a rare complication of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Although the cytogenetic features of patients with MDS and CDI are not clear, CDI in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is associated with chromosome 7 and/or 3 anomalies.
 In this report, we describe two patients with MDS and concurrent CDI, and in one of them, CDI was the first manifestation. One patient had monosomy 7 on metaphase cytogenetics (MC). Monosomy 7 and numerous cytogenetic abnormalities were found in the other patient using single-nucleotide polymorphism array (SNP-A) karyotyping, while the MC did not uncover monosomy 7. In this manuscript we also reviewed reported cases of MDS with diabetes insipidus (DI-MDS) to summarize the relationship between DI-MDS and karyotype, and explore the best treatment strategy for DI-MDS.
DI-MDS is closely related to monosomy 7. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation may be the only effective treatment for DI-MDS. The SNP-A-based karyotyping is helpful to reveal subtle cytogenetic abnormalities and unveil their roles in the clinical features of MDS.
