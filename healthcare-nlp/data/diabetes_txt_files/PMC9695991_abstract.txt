Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a progressive disease with a growing prevalence, associated with an increased risk of complications. The introduction of new classes of antidiabetic drugs into clinical practice has dramatically changed the landscape of diabetes therapy. However, despite the progress made in the pharmacotherapy of T2DM, mitigating the burden of the disease on individuals, societies and health care systems remains a challenge. Remission has recently emerged as a therapeutic target in T2DM, achievable through a wide range of interventions. Recent studies have shown that extensive lifestyle changes, such as weight reduction, bariatric surgery, and intensive glucose lowering therapy, can prompt the remission of diabetes, but some unanswered questions remain regarding its long-term effects on diabetic complications. Metabolic surgery and novel classes of glucose-lowering medications are currently the most effective interventions to induce weight loss and by extension remission in patients with diabetes; however, the ideal strategy to achieve the long-term maintenance of remission remains doubtful. In this narrative review, we discuss the available therapeutic approaches to target the remission of diabetes through personalized multimodal care, based on the latest evidence.
