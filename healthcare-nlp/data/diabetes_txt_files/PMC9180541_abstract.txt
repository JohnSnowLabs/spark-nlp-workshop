Coronavirus disease—COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) has become the cause of the global pandemic in the last three years. Its etiological factor is SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus type 2). Patients with diabetes (DM—diabetes mellitus), in contrast to healthy people not suffering from chronic diseases, are characterised by higher morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19. Patients who test positive for SARCoV-2 are at higher risk of developing hyperglycaemia. In this paper, we present, analyse and summarize the data on possible mechanisms underlying the increased susceptibility and mortality of patients with diabetes mellitus in the case of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, further research is required to determine the optimal therapeutic management of patients with diabetes and COVID-19.
