Autoimmune hypothalamitis is a very rare neuroendocrine disorder that causes central diabetes insipidus, headache, visual impairment, and sometimes cognitive impairment. Autoimmune hypothalamitis may occur in association with autoimmune hypophysitis, including lymphocytic hypophysitis, or in isolation. It is not known whether autoimmune hypothalamitis and autoimmune hypophysitis are consecutive diseases.
A 52-year-old woman developed autoimmune hypothalamitis 7 years after developing central diabetes insipidus due to lymphocytic hypophysitis, resulting in severe memory impairment. High-dose intravenous methylprednisolone therapy improved her cognitive function and decreased the size of the lesion.
This case presented a unique clinical course, with a long period of time between the onset of autoimmune hypopituitaritis and the development of autoimmune hypothalamitis.
