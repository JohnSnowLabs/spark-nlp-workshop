Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is recognized as one of the most common medical complications of pregnancy that can lead to significant short-term and long-term risks for the mother and the fetus if not detected early and treated appropriately. Current evidence suggests that, with the use of appropriate screening programs for GDM, those women diagnosed and treated have reduced perinatal morbidity. It has been implied that, when screening for GDM, there should be uniformity in the testing used and in further management. This paper summarizes and compares current screening strategies proposed by international bodies and discusses application in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.
