Diabetes mellitus, a very common and multifaceted metabolic disorder is considered as one of the fastest growing public health problems in the world. It is characterized by hyperglycemia, a condition with high glucose level in the blood plasma resulting from defects in insulin secretion or its action and in some cases both the impairment in secretion and also action of insulin coexist. Historically, animal models have played a critical role in exploring and describing malady pathophysiology and recognizable proof of targets and surveying new remedial specialists and in vivo medicines. In the present study, we reviewed the experimental models employed for diabetes and for its related complications. This paper reviews briefly the broad chemical induction of alloxan and streptozotocin and its mechanisms associated with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Also we highlighted the different models in other species and other animals.
