We present a case of Langerhansâ€™ cell histiocytosis in a 40-year-old woman presenting with central diabetes insipidus and right ear pain. As this disease process is often clinically challenging, the presence of certain imaging findings should raise the possibility of this diagnosis. We review the pertinent imaging and correlate with histology and immunohistochemistry leading to the diagnosis.
