The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus continues to increase in many Asian countries, with possible contributing factors, such as younger‐onset disease, diabetes development at lower body mass index, higher visceral fat accumulation and poorer β‐cell function, among Asian populations. Sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors have been shown to confer favorable effects in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients, such as improved glycemic control, weight and blood pressure reduction, and importantly, cardiorenal benefits. Sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors are generally well‐tolerated, and have a well‐defined safety profile based on evidence from numerous clinical trials and post‐marketing pharmacovigilance reporting. To our knowledge, this review is the first to provide a comprehensive coverage of the adverse events of sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors, as well as their management and counseling aspects for Asian type 2 diabetes mellitus populations.
Sodium glucose co‐transporter‐2 (SGLT‐2) inhibitor have gained a central role in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus particularly owing to its cardiorenal benefits. It is generally well‐tolerated and have a well‐defined safety profile. This review is the first to provide a comprehensive coverage on the side effects of SGLT2i as well as their management and counseling aspects for Asian type 2 diabetes mellitus population.
