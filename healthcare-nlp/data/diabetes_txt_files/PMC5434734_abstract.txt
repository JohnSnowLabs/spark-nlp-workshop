The aetiology of hearing loss in humans is multifactorial. Besides genetic, environmental and infectious causes, several endocrine and metabolic abnormalities are associated with varying degrees of hearing impairment. The pattern of hearing loss may be conductive, sensori-neural or mixed. The neurophysiology of hearing as well as the anatomical structure of the auditory system may be influenced by changes in the hormonal and metabolic milieu. Optimal management of these conditions requires the integrated efforts of the otolaryngologist and the endocrinologist. The presence of hearing loss especially in the young age group should prompt the clinician to explore the possibility of an associated endocrine or metabolic disorder for timely referral and early initiation of treatment.
