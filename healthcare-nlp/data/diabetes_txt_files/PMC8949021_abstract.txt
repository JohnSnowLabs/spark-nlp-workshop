Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) is responsible for an important premature mortality. Pharmacists involved in community-based pharmaceutical care services could help patients with diabetes through education and management as they participate in their regular and long-term care. This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the association between interventions led by pharmacists in the primary care setting and mean change in HbA1c levels. Randomized controlled trials and quasi-experimental studies with a control group were included. Standardized mean differences (SMD) and their 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated to compare the mean change in HbA1c values between baseline and end of the intervention in each group. Subgroup analyses were performed to explore heterogeneity. Twelve articles were included. The results showed that pharmacist’s interventions significantly reduced HbA1c compared to usual care with an overall SMD of −0.67 (95% CI = [−0.87; −0.48], p < 0.0001). Even if no significant difference between subgroups were found, the reduction of HbA1c seemed more important when baseline HbA1c was ≥8.5%, the intervention occurred monthly, in a primary care center and in countries with a lower human development index. Our results suggest that pharmacists-led interventions in the primary care setting can improve glycemic control for adults with T2D.
