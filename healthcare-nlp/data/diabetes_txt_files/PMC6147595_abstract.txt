Loss-of-function mutations of progranulin are associated with frontotemporal dementia in humans, and its deficiency in mice is a model for this disease but with normal life expectancy and mild cognitive decline on aging. The present study shows that aging progranulin deficient mice develop progressive polydipsia and polyuria under standard housing conditions starting at middle age (6-9 months). They showed high water licking behavior and doubling of the normal daily drinking volume, associated with increased daily urine output and a decrease of urine osmolality, all maintained during water restriction. Creatinine clearance, urine urea, urine albumin and glucose were normal. Hence, there were no signs of osmotic diuresis or overt renal disease, other than a concentrating defect. In line, the kidney morphology and histology revealed a 50% increase of the kidney weight, kidney enlargement, mild infiltrations of the medulla with pro-inflammatory cells, widening of tubules but no overt signs of a glomerular or tubular pathology. Plasma vasopressin levels were on average about 3-fold higher than normal levels, suggesting that the water loss resulted from unresponsiveness of the collecting tubules towards vasopressin, and indeed aquaporin-2 immunofluorescence in collecting tubules was diminished, whereas renal and hypothalamic vasopressin were increased, the latter in spite of substantial astrogliosis in the hypothalamus. The data suggest that progranulin deficiency causes nephrogenic diabetes insipidus in mice during aging. Possibly, polydipsia in affected patients - eventually interpreted as psychogenic polydipsia - may point to a similar concentrating defect.
