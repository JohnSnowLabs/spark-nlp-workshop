The purpose of this study was to investigate the knowledge, perceptions and concerns of individuals living with diabetes mellitus regarding the disorder and its associated long-term health complications. Individuals living with type 1 (N = 110) and type 2 (N = 100) diabetes were surveyed at the Diabetes Centre at University Hospital Galway (Ireland). A questionnaire was used to record respondent’s perceptions and concerns about living with diabetes and developing associated long-term health complications, especially diabetes-induced osteopathy. Participants’ responses revealed a variety of perspectives. Individuals with type 1 diabetes had a deeper understanding of the aetiology of diabetes and were more concerned about its complications than individuals with type 2 diabetes. The most recognized complications identified by the participants were retinopathy (92% type 1; 83% type 2), amputations (80% type 1; 70% type 2) and nephropathy (83% type 1; 63% type 2). Diabetes-related osteopathy was under-recognized, with 37% (type 1) and 23% (type 2) of respondents identifying bone fractures as a diabetes-related complication. Enhancing the patient awareness of this under-recognized diabetes-associated complication and ensuring that preventative measures are incorporated within health care programmes may offer methodologies to address this complication clinically.
