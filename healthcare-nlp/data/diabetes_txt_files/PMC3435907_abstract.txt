A 24-year-old female swimmer presented to a sports medicine clinic with complaints of frequent urination and increased thirst. The patient admitted to progressive worsening of her symptoms over a 4-year period since suffering a concussion. A water deprivation test, antidiuretic hormone level, and diamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin challenge were completed, and the patient was diagnosed with persistent central diabetes insipidus. As concussion awareness increases, health care professionals will be faced with treatment of post-concussive patients more often. The aim of this case report is to increase awareness of possible pituitary dysfunction—specifically, central diabetes insipidus—following a concussion.
