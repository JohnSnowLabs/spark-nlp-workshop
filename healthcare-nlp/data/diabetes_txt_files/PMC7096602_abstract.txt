This case report describes the clinical presentation, and the diagnostic and therapeutic approaches of a 4‐year‐old gelding presented with severe polyuria and polydipsia. The horse was diagnosed with central diabetes insipidus. After diagnosis, different therapeutic regimens with intraocular desmopressin acetate (Minirin, Ferring GmbH, Kiel, Germany) (a synthetic arginine vasopressin analog) were tested, but without success. Only the subcutaneous injection of desmopressin acetate (Minirin, Ferring GmbH) led to an increase in urine specific gravity and a decrease in water intake and urine output. Daily subcutaneous treatment with desmopressin acetate (Minirin, Ferring GmbH) was initiated and maintained for at least 5 years. The horse did not develop adverse effects or re‐occurrence of the initial complaints. This case report describes successful long‐term treatment of central diabetes insipidus in a horse.
