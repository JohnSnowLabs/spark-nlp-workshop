Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is one of the major chronic diseases, whose prevalence is increasing dramatically worldwide and can lead to a range of serious complications. Wnt ligands (Wnts) and their activating Wnt signalling pathways are closely involved in the regulation of various processes that are important for the occurrence and progression of T2DM and related complications. However, our understanding of their roles in these diseases is quite rudimentary due to the numerous family members of Wnts and conflicting effects via activating the canonical and/or non‐canonical Wnt signalling pathways. In this review, we summarize the current findings on the expression pattern and exact role of each human Wnt in T2DM and related complications, including Wnt1, Wnt2, Wnt2b, Wnt3, Wnt3a, Wnt4, Wnt5a, Wnt5b, Wnt6, Wnt7a, Wnt7b, Wnt8a, Wnt8b, Wnt9a, Wnt9b, Wnt10a, Wnt10b, Wnt11 and Wnt16. Moreover, the role of main antagonists (sFRPs and WIF‐1) and coreceptor (LRP6) of Wnts in T2DM and related complications and main challenges in designing Wnt‐based therapeutic approaches for these diseases are discussed. We hope a deep understanding of the mechanistic links between Wnt signalling pathways and diabetic‐related diseases will ultimately result in a better management of these diseases.
