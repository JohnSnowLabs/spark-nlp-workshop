The global prevalence of diabetes, especially type 2 diabetes mellitus, has reached epidemic proportions in the last few decades of the 20th century because of the obesity pandemic resulting from adverse lifestyles. Diabetes as a consequence of obesity (diabesity), continues to increase exponentially in the 21st century. Although there are a multitude of drugs for the effective management of diabesity with modest benefits, most patients will require insulin for control of diabetes at some stage that would worsen obesity, and thereby diabesity. Therefore, effective non-pharmacological therapy needs to be expedited in all patients with diabesity. These measures include medical nutrition interventions, change of lifestyles and bariatric surgery. Non-pharmacological interventions are also useful for the effective management of even type 1 diabetes mellitus when used along with insulin therapy especially in those with obesity. This review summarises the current evidence base for the non-pharmacological interventions in the management of diabetes.
