Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder characterized by hyperglycemia resulting from defects in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. Diabetes and its complications can be reduced by enhancing the attitude of the community. However, there is limited information regarding attitude towards diabetes in northwest Ethiopia. Therefore, this study determined the attitude and associated factors of diabetes mellitus among adult non-diabetic participants in Gondar city.
A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted in Gondar city. Systematic random sampling was employed to select 626 non-diabetic participants. The data were collected using a pre-tested structured questionnaire. Descriptive statistics, processing, and analysis were done using STATA version 14. Both bivariable and multivariable binary logistic regressions were used to identify the associated factors. An adjusted odds ratio with a 95% confidence interval was used to calculate a level of significance.
Of 626 participants, 572 (91.37%) study subjects heard about diabetes mellitus. Three hundred and fifteen participants (55.07%) (95% CI: 50.9% - 59.1%) had a favorable attitude towards diabetes mellitus. Having good knowledge about diabetes (adjusted odds ratio = 2.69, 95% CI: 1.88, 3.87), and higher educational status (adjusted odds ratio = 1.69, 95% CI: 1.04, 2.78) were positively associated with a favorable attitude towards diabetes mellitus. Female gender (adjusted odds ratio = 0.68, 95% CI: 0.47, 0.98), on the other hand, had poor attitude towards diabetes mellitus.
In this study, a favorable attitude towards diabetes was low among adult non-diabetic participants. Good knowledge, higher educational status, and being male were the factors associated with a favorable attitude towards diabetes.
