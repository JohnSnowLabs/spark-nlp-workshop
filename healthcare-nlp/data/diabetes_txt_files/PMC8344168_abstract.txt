Despite the increased fracture risk, bone mineral density (BMD) is variable in type 1 (T1D) and type 2 (T2D) diabetes mellitus. We aimed at comparing independent BMD predictors in T1D, T2D and control subjects, respectively.
Cross-sectional case-control study enrolling 30 T1D, 39 T2D and 69 age, sex and body mass index (BMI) – matched controls that underwent clinical examination, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (BMD at the lumbar spine and femoral neck) and serum determination of HbA1c and parameters of calcium and phosphate metabolism.
T2D patients had similar BMD compared to T1D individuals (after adjusting for age, BMI and disease duration) and to matched controls, respectively. In multiple regression analysis, diabetes duration – but not HbA1c- negatively predicted femoral neck BMD in T1D (β= -0.39, p = 0.014), while BMI was a positive predictor for lumbar spine (β = 0.46, p = 0.006) and femoral neck BMD (β = 0.44, p = 0.007) in T2D, besides gender influence. Age negatively predicted BMD in controls, but not in patients with diabetes.
Long-standing diabetes and female gender particularly increase the risk for low bone mass in T1D. An increased body weight partially hinders BMD loss in T2D. The impact of age appears to be surpassed by that of other bone regulating factors in both T1D and T2D patients.
