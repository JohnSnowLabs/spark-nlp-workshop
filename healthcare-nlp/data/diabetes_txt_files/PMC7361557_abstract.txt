Although type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) develop a more severe condition compared to those without diabetes, the mechanisms for this are unknown. Moreover, the impact of treatment with antihyperglycemic drugs and glucocorticoids is unclear.
From 1584 COVID‐19 patients, 364 severe/critical COVID‐19 patients with clinical outcome were enrolled for the final analysis, and patients without preexisting T2DM but elevated glucose levels were excluded. Epidemiological data were obtained and clinical status evaluation carried out to assess the impact of T2DM and its management on clinical outcomes.
Of 364 enrolled severe COVID‐19 inpatients, 114 (31.3%) had a history of T2DM. Twenty‐seven (23.7%) T2DM patients died, who had more severe inflammation, coagulation activation, myocardia injury, hepatic injury, and kidney injury compared with non‐DM patients. In severe COVID‐19 patients with T2DM, we demonstrated a higher risk of all‐cause fatality with glucocorticoid treatment (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 3.61; 95% CI, 1.14‐11.46; P = .029) and severe hyperglycemia (fasting plasma glucose ≥11.1 mmol/L; adjusted HR, 11.86; 95% CI, 1.21‐116.44; P = .034).
T2DM status aggravated the clinical condition of COVID‐19 patients and increased their critical illness risk. Poor fasting blood glucose (≥ 11.1 mmol/L) and glucocorticoid treatment are associated with poor prognosis for T2DM patients with severe COVID‐19.
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection had more severe inflammation, coagulation activation, myocardia injury, hepatic injury, and kidney injury. T2DM aggravated the clinical status of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) patients and increased their critical illness rate and mortality.
Glucocorticoid treatment and poor fasting blood glucose (≥11.1 mmol/L) control were found to be risk factors of fatality in T2DM patients with severe COVID‐19.
