Background: Diabetes mellitus is described as a chronic disease resulting from failure of the pancreas to generate enough insulin or inability of the body to efficiently utilize the insulin it generates. Diabetes clients must adjust their lives to live healthy with the diseases for the rest of their lives. Optimizing diabetic knowledge and awareness among people living with diabetes will yield better health outcomes. This study seeks to investigate the knowledge, practices, and challenges of diabetes mellitus clients regarding management of the disease at selected clinics in the Capricorn District of Limpopo Province, South Africa. Methods: This study used a qualitative research approach and a phenomenological research design. A purposive sampling method was used to acquire the 18 participants for this study. Semi-structured interviews with a guide were used to collect data. Teschâ€™s coding method was employed for data analysis. Results: The study findings revealed that there are comparable explanations of what it means to follow medication instructions by diabetes mellitus clients, and challenges living with DM. The findings also indicate that there are problems related to conceptualization of medication instructions among diabetes clients. Conclusion: This study indicated that diabetes mellitus clients have poor knowledge regarding management of the disease and its process, and problems related to medication instructions. Therefore, proper teaching of clients and guidance regarding diabetes and its management are required to improve compliance and delay of long-term complications.
