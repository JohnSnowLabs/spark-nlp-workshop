Aim: Diabetes and periodontal disease are both chronic pathological conditions linked by several underlying biological mechanisms, in which the inflammatory response plays a critical role, and their association has been largely recognized. Recently, attention has been given to diabetes as an important mediator of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) overexpression in periodontal tissues, by virtue of its ability to affect microvasculature. This review aims to summarize the findings from studies that explored VEGF expression in diabetic patients with periodontitis, compared to periodontally healthy subjects. Materials and Methods: A systematic literature review was performed using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A PubMed search of select medical subject heading (MeSH) terms was carried out to identify all studies reporting findings about VEGF expression in periodontal tissues of diabetic patients up to May 2018. The inclusion criteria were studies on VEGF expression in periodontally diseased tissues of diabetic patients compared with nondiabetic subjects, with any method of analysis, and published in the English language. Results: Eight articles met the inclusion criteria. Immunohistochemistry was used in six of the studies, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (real-time RT-PCR) aiming to quantify mRNA VEGF expression was used in one study, and ELISA analysis was used for one study. Compared with nondiabetic patients, a higher VEGF expression in gingival tissue and gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) samples in diabetic patients with periodontitis was reported. Conclusions: Overall, novel evidence for the VEGF expression within the periodontal tissue of diabetic patients paves the way for further studies on the role of this protein in neovascularization physiology and pathophysiology in microvasculature of the periodontium.
