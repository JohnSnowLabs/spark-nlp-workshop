Although the gut microbiota (GM) are associated with various diseases, their role in gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) remains uncharacterized. Further study is urgently needed to expose the real relationship between GM and GDM.
We performed a prospective study in 33 pregnant Chinese individuals [15, GDM; 18, normal glucose tolerance (NGT)] to observe the fecal microbiota by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing at 24–28 weeks of gestational age after a standard 75 g oral glucose tolerance test. Linear regression analysis was employed to assess the relationships between the GM and GDM clinical parameters.
Sequencing showed no difference in the microbiota alpha diversity but a significant difference in the beta diversity between the GDM and NGT groups, with the relative abundances of Ruminococcus bromii, Clostridium colinum, and Streptococcus infantis being higher in the GDM group (P < 0.05). The quantitative PCR results validated the putative bacterial markers of R. bromii and S. infantis. Moreover, a strong positive correlation was found between S. infantis and blood glucose levels after adjusting for body mass index (P < 0.05).
Three abnormally expressed intestinal bacteria (R. bromii, C. colinum, and S. infantis) were identified in GDM patients. S. infantis may confer an increased risk of GDM. Hence, the GM may serve as a potential therapeutic target for GDM.
