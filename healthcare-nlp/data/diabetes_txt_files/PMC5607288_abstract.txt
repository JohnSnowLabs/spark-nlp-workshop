Serum 1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG) levels can not only accurately reflect the mean blood glucose over the previous 1–2 weeks in diabetic patients but also offers the advantage of representing postprandial glucose. To evaluate the clinical significance of 1,5-AG in diabetes detection, especially when used in combination with fasting plasma glucose (FPG), a total of 3098 participants at high risk for diabetes (1467 men, 1631 women) were enrolled. A total of 1471 (47.5%) participants were diagnosed with diabetes, and the mean 1,5-AG level in the diabetic group was significantly lower than that in non-diabetic group [12.5 (7.8–17.5) μg/mL vs. 20.5 (15.3–26.4) μg/mL, P < 0.001]. The optimal cut-off point was 15.9 μg/mL, for which the sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC) were 69.2%, 72.3%, and 0.781, respectively. For the combination of FPG and 1,5-AG, the sensitivity, specificity, and AUC improved to 82.5%, 83.5%, and 0.912, respectively. This method helped 75.8% of the participants avoid an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), reducing the need to carry out the OGTT by 43.9% compared to the use of the FPG criterion only. In conclusion, the addition of FPG to serum 1,5-AG improves the efficiency of diabetes screening in the Chinese population.
