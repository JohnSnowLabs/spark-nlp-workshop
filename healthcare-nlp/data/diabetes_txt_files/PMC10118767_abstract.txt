“What's in a name? That which we call a rose / By any other name would smell as sweet” (Juliet, from Romeo and Juliet by William Shakespeare). Shakespeare's implication is that a name is nothing but a word and it therefore represents a convention with no intrinsic meaning. Whilst this may be relevant to romantic literature, disease names do have real meanings, and consequences, in medicine. Hence, there must be a very good rational for changing the name of a disease that has a centuries-old historical context. A working group of representatives from national and international endocrinology and endocrine pediatric societies now proposes changing the name of “diabetes insipidus” to “Arginine Vasopressin Deficiency (AVP-D)” for central etiologies, and “Arginine Vasopressin Resistance (AVP-R)” for nephrogenic etiologies This editorial provides both the historical context and the rational for this proposed name change.
