Both diabetes and fungal infections contribute significantly to the global disease burden, with increasing trends seen in most developed and developing countries during recent decades. This is reflected in urogenital infections caused by Candida species that are becoming ever more pervasive in diabetic patients, particularly those that present with unsatisfactory glycemic control. In addition, a relatively new group of anti-hyperglycemic drugs, known as sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors, has been linked with an increased risk for colonization of the urogenital region with Candida spp., which can subsequently lead to an infectious process. In this review paper, we have highlighted notable virulence factors of Candida species (with an emphasis on Candida albicans) and shown how the interplay of many pathophysiological factors can give rise to vulvovaginal candidiasis, potentially complicated with recurrences and dire pregnancy outcomes. We have also addressed an increased risk of candiduria and urinary tract infections caused by species of Candida in females and males with diabetes, further highlighting possible complications such as emphysematous cystitis as well as the risk for the development of balanitis and balanoposthitis in (primarily uncircumcised) males. With a steadily increasing global burden of diabetes, urogenital mycotic infections will undoubtedly become more prevalent in the future; hence, there is a need for an evidence-based approach from both clinical and public health perspectives.
