Report Status :
Unsigned
ADMISSION DATE :
12-6-93
DISCHARGE DATE :
12-9-93
IDENTIFYING DATA :
This 75 year old female was transferred from Iming Medical Center for angioplasty .
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Unstable angina .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
Hypertension .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
Right and circumflex angioplasty , cardiac catheterization on 12-6-93 .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This 75 year old woman was previously admitted here in November 1993 for chronic angina .
She had mild mitral regurgitation and a slightly diminished ejection fraction .
There was a 90% right coronary stenosis which was reduced to 30 with a balloon angioplasty .
There were three lesions in the circumflex , dilated successfully .
However , the low circumflex marginal vessel could not be crossed with the balloon .
She did well in follow up , being treated for hypertension .
In the end of 1992 , she was feeling well and was taken off Isordil .
During the winter and early parts of 1993 , the patient noticed increasing fatigue , symptoms of breathlessness and recurrent substernal chest pressure which finally led to admission to Xas Tupalmsmodral Hospital on 11-11-93 with documentation of a subendocardial myocardial infarction and a blood pressure of 210/108 .
Cardiac catheterization towards the end of the hospitalization showed recurrent right coronary artery stenosis proximally and high grade new stenosis in the distal circumflex at the area of the origin of the previously untreated low circumflex marginal vessel .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Medications on transfer were Ecotrin , Vasotec 5 mg , Lopressor 25 bid , Isordil 20 tid , Procardia XL once per day , and Lasix 20 q3 days .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On physical examination , the blood pressure was 150 , heart rate 70 , bilateral carotid bruits , grade II systolic ejection murmur , good femoral pulses without bruits , good dorsalis pedis pulses with no posterior tibial pulses felt .
LABORATORY DATA :
The electrocardiogram revealed left bundle branch block .
The electrolytes were normal .
The admission hematocrit was 34 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
On 12-6-93 , angioplasty was performed of the right coronary artery using a 3 mm solo balloon reducing the stenosis from 80 to approximately 20% with a faint diagonal lucency which was not obstructive .
The new distal circumflex lesion was dilated with a 2.0 mm balloon with a good result and minimal persistent stenosis .
But the low circumflex marginal could not be entered with a wire .
The first marginal had a 505 stenosis at its origin , which was not attempted .
The patient did well post procedure .
He developed a grape sized hematoma over the femoral artery with a loud bruit .
The ultrasound on the day of discharge showed no evidence of pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula .
The blood pressure was 150-170 systolic .
The patient was ambulating without symptoms .
ADDENDUM :
The admission hematocrit was 34 .
This fell to 25 after the cardiac catheterization without evidence of bleeding and rose to 29 by the time of discharge .
DOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :
She was discharged with advice by Cardiac Rehabilitation for gradually increasing activity .
She will be followed by her physician at Cean , Dr. Dieseld Pollejesc , for further pressure management and follow up of the femoral hematoma .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
Stable , resolving anemia .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Ecotrin 160 mg per day , Vasotec 5 mg per day , Lopressor 25 bid , Isordil 20 tid , Procardia XL 30 per day , Lasix 20 mg q3 days .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. He is a 77 year old male with squamous cell carcinoma of the lung .
The initial presentation was the orifice of the right upper lobe with mediastinoscopy positive for subcarinal lymph node .
He received 6,000 rads to his mediastinum with external beam .
Subsequently , he returned to Goo where he received another 3,000 rads via an endobronchial catheter , apparently due to recurrence .
Over the pat three to four weeks , he started having increased dyspnea and noted wheezing .
A bronchoscopy showed protrusion of the tumor into the right main stem bronchus with a positive needle biopsy , washings and brushings for squamous cell carcinoma .
A computerized tomography scan showed a large subcarinal mass .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
His past medical history was significant for malignant bladder tumor in 1991 .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On physical examination , Mr. He had very marked inspiratory and expiratory stridor .
There were no nodes present .
The breath sounds were somewhat decreased through both lung fields .
His cardiac examination did not show any murmur , gallop , or cardiomegaly .
There was no hepatosplenomegaly , and no peripheral edema .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
A bronchoscopy with the intention of coring out tumor was carried out by Dr. Reg He , but all the tumor was extrinsic to the airway and he was unable to relieve the obstruction .
The tumor now involves the trachea as well as the right main bronchus .
His major complaint was of persistent severe coughing and secretions .
Ultimately , only codeine at 30 mg q6h controlled him and this was very affective .
Inhalers provide only mild relief .
He is aware of his prognosis .
The patient was also seen by Dr. Lenchermoi Fyfesaul of the Oncology Service who did not feel that chemotherapy had anything of promise to offer .
Mr. He is an anxious man , but very pleasant .
He and his family understand his prognosis .

AORTIC STENOSIS .
Unsigned
DIS
Report Status :
Unsigned
ADMISSION DATE :
4-1-93
DISCHARGE DATE :
4-13-93
DIAGNOSES :
Aortic stenosis .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
Stenosis of porcine aortic valve with fibrous pannus formation , coronary disease , status post aortic valve replacement and coronary artery bypass grafting , manic depressive disorder , left ventricular dysfunction , question of basilar artery migraine .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
4-2-93 , right and left heart catheterization ( transeptal ) with coronary graft and left ventriculogram .
4-8-93 , open heart aortic valve replacement and bypass of right coronary artery .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. No is a 65 year old male who , in 1986 , had a coronary artery bypass grafting procedure at Noughwell Entanbon Health in Stoningi , Kansas .
This involved construction of an internal mammary graft from the left internal mammary artery to the left circumflex , a right internal mammary was anastomosed to the anterior descending and diagonal branch , and a saphenous vein was constructed to the right coronary artery .
He did well , but appeared here in 1991 with high grade aortic stenosis , and an ejection fraction of only 23% .
He underwent aortic valve replacement with a porcine valve by Dr. G Hemp .
Following this , he was followed closely by Dr. Brown in Na .
Over the last several months , he has had a recurrence of his congestive heart failure and an echocardiogram performed by Dr. Brown suggested the possibility of the development of aortic stenosis .
He also was having some chest tightness , as well as increasing shortness of breath .
The patient was referred here for further evaluation .
Mr. No suffers from a bipolar mood disorder , together with hypercholesterolemia and vertebral basilar insufficiency .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On physical examination , the patient was a well developed , stocky gentleman .
The blood pressure was 115/80 , pulse 80 , respirations of 20 , venous pressure elevated at 3 cm above the clavicle at 90 degrees .
There were very small , barely palpable carotid pulses .
There was dullness at the right base , with a high diaphragm and possibly some fluid .
The cardiac examination showed a left ventricular tap at the fifth intercostal space left of the midclavicular line .
There was a grade II / VI systolic ejection murmur in the aortic area , no third sound , and paradoxical splitting of the second sound .
The liver was not palpable .
There were diminished pulses in the legs .
LABORATORY DATA :
The hemoglobin was 14.4 grams percent , white blood count 6,900 , platelet count 125,000 , sodium 137 mEq. per liter , potassium of 4.7 , BUN and creatinine of 23 and 1.3 mg percent .
The electrocardiogram showed left ventricular hypertrophy and non-specific ST-T wave changes .
The chest film showed massive cardiomegaly with pulmonary venous engorgement .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
I indicated to Dr. Brown that I had never seen a situation in which an adult had stenosed aortic valve so rapidly , but certainly his clinical signs suggested aortic stenosis .
Accordingly , on April 2 , 1993 , he underwent a cardiac catheterization .
The study showed that the right internal mammary and left internal mammary artery grafts were patent to the distal vessels .
The right saphenous vein graft was also patent , but there was a high grade narrowing in the vessel beyond it .
Using transeptal catheterization , he proved to have a 70 mm gradient across the aortic valve and there was no doubt about his aortic stenosis .
The left ventricular contraction showed an ejection fraction of around 25% .
An attempt at transesophageal echocardiogram was unsuccessful , because the patient was not cooperative .
On April 8 , 1993 , Dr. G Hemp performed open heart surgery .
At the time of operation , the porcine valve showed a heavy fibrous pannus underneath the valve , and there was what looked like organized thrombus in the leaflets which impeded leaflet movement .
There was no calcification of the valve , and no clear evidence of infection .
I have in fact never seen anything quite like this on an aortic porcine valve .
The valve was replaced , and a saphenous vein graft was then constructed from the distal saphenous vein graft that was already in place to the distal right coronary artery beyond the obstruction .
The surgery was very difficult , because of a great deal of scarring from the previous operation , but generally things went along smoothly .
Mr. No was on the pump for 2 hours and 25 minutes , with an aortic crossclamp time of 1 hour and 48 minutes .
Postoperatively , the patient was extubated on the first postoperative day .
He had a good deal of pulmonary congestion .
He seemed to be doing well until the morning of 4-13-93 when he suddenly became pulseless .
There was no evidence of ventricular fibrillation .
Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was immediately undertaken , but was not successful .
The patient had his chest opened for any evidence of tamponade and there was no evidence of bleeding .
The heart appeared to be flaccid .
We really have no good explanation of what this was all about .
He was being treated for a possible pneumonia .
He did have a good deal of pulmonary congestion , but this occurred suddenly and unexpectedly .
Cardiopulmonary resuscitation efforts were carried out for virtually one hour , but were unsuccessful .
The patient was pronounced dead on the morning of 4-13-93 .
A post mortem examination will be performed .

DISCHARGE DATE :
12/17/93
CAUSE OF DEATH :
Cardiogenic shock .
CAUSATIVE FACTORS :
Including cardiomyopathy , aortic stenosis , status post aortic valve replacement , coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass grafting with congestive heart failure and pulmonary edema .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 65 year old male who sustained a small myocardial infarction first in 1978 , with course thereafter including a coronary artery bypass graft by Dr. Wierst ______________at Noughwell Entanbon Health in 1986 .
In 1991 he presented with congestive heart failure and he underwent porcine aortic valve replacement .
In the seven to eight months preceding admission , he developed recurrent angina with dyspnea on exertion .
The patient was admitted for cardiac catheterization in early December , 1993 .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Significant for vertebrobasilar insufficiency , bipolar mood disorder , and hypercholesterolemia , as well as some baseline renal insufficiency .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Procardia sustained release 60 mg. po q.day , Digoxin .25 mg. po q.day , Lasix 30 mg. ( interval unspecified ) , Prozac 40 mg. po q.day , Lovestatin 20 mg. po bid , aspirin q. day and supplemental potassium .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Remarkable for an oriented , alert male in no acute distress with decreased breath sounds at the right base consistent with effusion and a 3/6 systolic murmur consistent with aortic stenosis .
His pulse exam was intact .
Cardiac catheterization demonstrated elevated right and left-sided filling pressures at rest , with pulmonary hypertension and normal cardiac index .
There was severe aortic stenosis of 70 millimeter peak gradient , native three vessel disease with patent left internal mammary artery graft to the left circumflex , dissection of the left main was induced by the catheter tip .
A patent right internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending artery and diagonal was noted , and a patent saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery was present .
Also of note , pulmonary edema was induced by dye and anxiety and treated with Lasix , Morphine , oxygen and nitroglycerin .
Post-procedure he was admitted to the CCU because of the history of left main dissection .
He remained hemodynamically stable but of note , would not tolerate a transesophageal echo because of anxiety-he would not swallow the probe .
Transthoracic echo demonstrated gradients of 100 peak and 65 mean across the aortic valve and there was mild aortic insufficiency and ejection fraction was noted to be 18% with global hypokinesis .
The next several days were remarkable for events in which the patient was quite agitated and was evaluated by Psychiatry and treated with Ativan .
The patient was then evaluated by Cardiac Surgery for probable re-do aortic valve replacement and possible re-do coronary artery bypass grafting .
In the course of preoperative workup , Mr. Has was evaluated completely by Psychiatry with diagnoses including underlying chronic depression well-controlled on Prozac , underlying organ brain vulnerability of unclear etiology , possibly microvascular infarct , acute paranoid and belligerent behavior , possibly due to medications .
On December 12 the patient underwent surgery , including a re-do aortic valve replacement with # 25 St. Jude and re-do coronary artery bypass grafting times one ; saphenous vein graft to the posterior descending artery as a veno-venous jump graft .
The total bypass time :
2 hours 25 minutes .
Total crossclamp time :
1 hour and 48 minutes .
The patient was admitted to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit postoperatively with stable hemodynamics on Lidocaine at one , Dobutamine at 200 and Nipride .
The patient was extubated by postoperative day # 1 but was noted to be relatively hypoxemic with high oxygen requirement .
Chest x-ray demonstrating pulmonary edema .
Aggressive diuresis was undertaken and the patient responded , albeit sluggishly .
In addition , he remained agitated .
This was attributed to mild hypoxia and / or his underlying psychiatric diagnoses and he was treated with Haldol appropriately .
On day # 2 the patient continued to diurese and this was maintained with the Lasix/ Mannitol infusion .
His urine output remained at 150 to 200 cc. an hour .
Despite this , his chest x-ray continued to show severe pulmonary edema and the clinical picture correlated .
He required anti-hypertensive therapy initially with Nipride which was changed to Hydralazine to avoid shunting .
He received several units of packed red blood cells to increase his hematocrit and oncotic pressure .
Very early in the morning on postoperative day # 3 , the patient became acutely hypoxic after several hours of marginal oxygenation with respiratory rates in the thirties and the patient was urgently intubated , without complication .
With positive pressure ventilation and continued diuresis , his arterial blood gases improved .
Throughout this he remained hemodynamically stable .
Exception was a ten beat run of ventricular tachycardia which was thought to be ischemic in origin and treated with nitrates and Lidocaine .
His chest x-ray blossomed to demonstrate pulmonary infiltrate and the patient began to produce sputum .
Infectious Disease consultation was obtained for evaluation of his purulent sputum and the patient was covered with Vancomycin , Ceftazidime and Gentamicin .
Cardiology evaluation commented on the patient 's increasing ventricular ectopy and suggested that these were due to an R and T phenomenon from his pacer in the setting of prolonged QT interval .
Consequently his Pronestyl was discontinued .
In addition , the patient was given magnesium to bring his level above 2 .
On the evening of the 18th , the patient continued to remain hemodynamically stable , although his oxygenation was clearly deteriorating and more marginal .
On 60% FIO2 his pO2 was 63 .
It was increased to 65% with pO2 of 81 .
At approximately 7:50 a.m. , house officer was called to the room for blood pressure of 70/40 with falling oxygen saturations .
The patient was immediately given 400 mg. of Calcium Chloride i.v. push and ventilator disconnected and the patient manually ventilated .
Within one minute , the patient lost his blood pressure and CPR was initiated and code was called .
The patient initially continued to have rhythm consistent with EMV and he was bolused with Levophed and given some volume while compressions continued .
The patient 's prothrombin time had been 23 early the same morning and tamponade was considered and thoracotomy instruments obtained .
The chest was opened partially and through sub-xyphoid area it was determined that there was no evidence of tamponade .
Compressions were continued and adequate pulse was felt and arterial blood gases demonstrated adequate oxygenation and perfusion .
The patient 's rhythm degenerated to ventricular tachycardia and he was shocked , initially without response but after several doses of Epinephine , one-half mg. of Atropine and a bolus of Lidocaine we were able to obtain a blood pressure and rhythm only briefly , and quickly deteriorated back to ventricular fibrillation .
Further attempts at resuscitation were unsuccessful and the patient was pronounced dead at 8:30 a.m.
The family has been notified and autopsy consent has been obtained .

The neurological examination was nonfocal .
The rectal examination was guaiac negative , no masses .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the hospital , to the private surgery service .
A chest X-ray on admission revealed a left lower lobe nodule suspicious for metastases .
Because of this , a computerized tomography scan was obtained which revealed multiple nodules within both lungs , predominantly in the periphery , largest up to a centimeter , highly suspicious for metastases .
Due to an abnormal electrocardiogram , the patient was seen in consultation preoperatively and an exercise tolerance test with Thallium was performed , which was normal .
The patient continued to run low grade fevers but was continued on cefotetan .
On the sixth hospital day , the patient was brought to the Operating Room where she underwent right colectomy , G-tube placement .
There were no complications during the procedure .
Findings included sinus tract from the right cecum into a right lower quadrant tumor .
There was gross fecal soilage after removal of the tumor .
Infectious Disease consultation was obtained postoperatively due to the fecal contamination and patient was placed on Vancomycin , Gentamicin , and Flagyl .
She remained hemodynamically stable , although she did spike temperatures postoperatively .
All blood cultures were negative .
The patient was seen in consultation by Oncology and chemotherapy was set up for her at the Brook Hospital near her home .
The patient continued to run low grade temperatures and an abdominal computerized tomography scan was obtained which revealed no abscess .
Bowel function returned by postoperative day ten and the patient 's diet was slowly advanced and her G-tube was gradually clamped .

DISCHARGE DATE :
07/27/92
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Hepatocellular carcinoma , and hepatitis C .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
Liver transplant .
Native hepatectomy .
Re-exploration for bleeding .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. Villesatelkscurb is a fifty year old black gentleman with a long history of hepatitis C , believed to be contracted during transfusions in a previous trauma .
The patient had recently prior to this admission , had a rise in his alpha feta protein and a biopsy of his liver had shown hepatocellular carcinoma .
The patient was admitted for liver transplant workup and to await liver transplant .
PAST MEDICAL and
SURGICAL HISTORY :
Significant for motor vehicle accident in 1966 , requiring exploratory laparotomy and splenectomy , tonsillectomy as a child , pneumonia in the past , hepatitis C and recent diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma .
ADVERSE DRUG REACTIONS :
no known drug allergies .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
On admission medications included Lasix and iron .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Significant for normal head , eyes , ears , nose , throat exam with no scleral icterus .
Heart regular rate and rhythm , his lungs were clear .
He had no appreciable ascites .
He did have clubbing and palmar erythema with bilateral ankle edema .
He was Neurologically intact .
LABORATORY DATA :
bilirubin to be .6 .
SGOT of 80 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Preoperatively , the patient underwent chemo-embolization for his hepatocellular carcinoma .
The remainder of his preoperative course was benign .
On July 15 , 1992 , a liver became available , and the patient underwent hepatectomy and orthotopic liver transplant .
His operation was complicated by severe coagulopathy requiring fifty-nine units of packed red blood cells , 64 units of FFP and 34 units of platelets .
Postoperatively , the patient continued to have a coagulopathy requiring re-exploration on postoperatively day 2 , with findings only of hematoma and no active bleeding .
Initially , the patient did well in the Intensive Care Unit , mentally alert , and oriented , however , he continued to be coagulopathic and was requiring large amounts of blood and FFP transfusions , with a resultant pulmonary edema .
He developed renal failure felt to be ATN secondary to ischemia of his kidneys .
The patient remained intubated in the Intensive Care Unit for twelve days prior to his death .
He had daily transfusions of FFP and blood , and continued coagulopathy .
He also developed thrombocytopenia , requiring persistent platelet transfusions on a daily basis .
His immunosuppression was OKT3 and Solu Medrol , and he underwent hemodialysis and ultra filtration to remove fluid .
While in the ICU he developed seizures , requiring large amounts of intravenous Valium to break his seizures , and he was maintained on Tegretol and Dilantin .
However , he became progressively more mentally obtunded .
During the seizure , he bit his tongue , resulting in a large bleed from his tongue , which was sutured by the ENT Service , however , his continued coagulopathy resulted in bleeding from his nasopharynx , which could never be identified , and also upper gastrointestinal bleeding .
Endoscopy never revealed specific sources of bleeding , although he appeared to have a diffuse duodenitis .
He was started on Pitressin to try to control the gastrointestinal bleeding , but he continued to have severe bleeding , and became progressively hypotensive , with eventual bradycardia and cardiac arrest .
He was pronounced dead at 3:49 PM on July 15 , 1992 .

MRI , as discussed , was done at outside hospital and demonstrated large ventricles .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the Arkzie- Memorial for lumbar puncture .
On the night of admission lumbar puncture was attempted on the floor , but we were unable to get cerebral spinal fluid due to difficulty with compliance with the patient who was severely agitated and would not comply with the examination .
On hospital day the patient underwent conscious sedation in the operating room where lumbar puncture was performed .

ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
Tricuspid insufficiency , atrial fibrillation , congestive heart failure , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , pulmonary hypertension .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
04/22/94 , mitral valve replacement and tricuspid valve reconstruction .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This 68 year old female had rheumatic fever in the past , and has had chronic atrial fibrillation .
She has had progressive heart failure and an evaluation demonstrated worsening mitral stenosis with severe pulmonary hypertension .
Because of her deteriorating status , she underwent prior cardiac catheterization , which confirmed severe mitral stenosis with secondary tricuspid valve regurgitation due to pulmonary hypertension .
She was referred for valve surgery .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY is remarkable for chronic lung disease due to smoking .
She had undergone a previous nasal arterial embolization for treatment of recurrent epistaxis .
She had a partial gastrectomy in 1972 .
Her MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION included Coumadin , digoxin , 0.125 , qD , Lasix , 40 , q.i.d. , and Vanceril inhaler .
PERTINENT EXAMINATION demonstrated mild elevation of her jugular venous pulse , with prominent V-waves , and systolic and diastolic murmurs .
Peripheral pulses were all intact , and there was venous stasis changes on her legs , with some edema .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was brought to the Operating Room , on April 22 .
She underwent a mitral valve replacement , utilizing a 27 mm .
St. Jude prosthesis , and tricuspid valve reconstruction by ring anuloplasty .
She weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass with good hemodynamics .
She initially awoke after surgery , with good hemodynamics .
She was transiently in sinus rhythm , but atrial fibrillation recurred .
She was extubated on the third postoperative day , and was initially slightly agitated and confused , largely due to an Intensive Care Unit psychosis .
She continued to improve , with mobilization of fluid .
She was initially noted to have a slow ventricular response in atrial fibrillation , but this gradually improved over time .
She was initially noted to be somewhat anemic , and received transfusions .
Coumadin was restarted , and her anticoagulation came into range .
She was ultimately discharged with a heart rate in the 90 's , and with resolving edema and a clear chest .
Her MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE included Lasix , 40 , b.i.d. , potassium , 20 mEq. , b.i.d. , iron , and folic acid replacement , and Coumadin .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Epistaxis .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
Mitral stenosis , tricuspid regurgitation , heart failure , chronic atrial fibrillation , chronic ventricular ectopy , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .
ADVERSE DRUG REACTIONS :
Epistaxis on Coumadin in the past .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
Partial embolization of blood supply to nose , 8/22 .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This 68 year old female has rheumatic heart disease .
Mitral and possibly tricuspid valve surgery is scheduled for Labor Day by Dr. Riemund C. Kennedy .
Her history is detailed in the discharge summary of August 10 of this year .
She is admitted now for a neuro-interventional radiology procedure to decrease the likelihood of epistaxis on Coumadin .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Chest was clear .
Right neck and right groin catheterization sites were benign .
No edema .
Examination was otherwise unchanged .
LABORATORY DATA :
Hematocrit was 42 , PT was 10 , potassium was 3.6 , BUN was 29 , creatinine was 1.4 , blood sugar was 111 .
EKG showed atrial fibrillation , moderate ventricular response , right ventricular hypertrophy , right axis deviation .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The interventional neuro-radiology procedure was performed by Dr. A Skizeis , on August 22 , via the right femoral artery .
The right internal maxillary artery supply to the nasal mucosa was embolized .
The left external carotid artery was occluded at its origin , with collaterals from the internal carotid artery .
Thus , embolization on the left side was not possible .
The patient received Coumadin , 10 mg. , on the evening following the procedure , and is discharged the next day .
Her prothrombin time will be rechecked on August 27 by her primary care physician , Dr. Naka Gift .
Once her prothrombin time is in therapeutic range , she will be observed for epistaxis .
She will take her last dose of Coumadin on September 1 in anticipation of cardiac surgery .
If her prothrombin time does not come into therapeutic range promptly , then surgery may be delayed .
DISCHARGE REGIMEN :
Coumadin , 5 mg. , alternating with 2.5 mg. , qD , digoxin , 0.125 mg. , qD , Lasix , 80 mg. , qAM and 40 mg. , qPM , Vanceril , 3 puffs , b.i.d.

ADVERSE DRUG REACTIONS :
Epistaxis to Coumadin in the past .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
Cardiac catheterization 11/03 .
OTHER PROCEDURE :
Pulmonary function test 11/04 .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This 68-year-old patient of Dr. Naka Jesc had two episodes of rheumatic fever as a teenager .
She has had chronic atrial fibrillation .
Coumadin has caused bleeding from the mouth and nose on two occasions , on one occasion with prothrombin time 13 , and has been replaced by anti-platelet agents .
She has had recurrent syncope since age 6 .
She has now had progressive heart failure .
A Holter showed atrial fibrillation with period of ventricular bigemini .
She cut down dramatically on smoking two years ago , but has continued to smoke , although , very recently , she admits to only "" two puffs "" per day .
She has not had hypertension or diabetes , and says he has lowered her cholesterol from 333 to 197 by changing her diet .
There is no family history of heart disease .
She has been treated with Vanceril for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .
She has had one gram per day proteinuria with normal creatinine .
She had a partial gastrectomy in 1972 for a "" tumor "" .
She has had an appendectomy and cholecystectomy .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Digoxin 0.125 mg po q.d. , Lasix 40 mg b.i.d. , aspirin held , and Vanceril three puffs b.i.d.
ALLERGIES :
Transdermal nitroglycerin caused headache .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
She does not drink .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Heart rate 86 , irregularly irregular , blood pressure 142/86 .
Neck veins distended .
Carotids normal .
Chest clear .
Apical impulse not palpable .
Right ventricular heave .
S1 normal .
S2 narrowly physiologically split with accentuation of P2 .
No S3 or opening snap .
Grade II systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border .
Grade II decrescendo diastolic murmur at the left lower sternal border .
Diastolic rumble at the apex .
Liver slightly pulsatile but no enlarged .
Pulses normal to the femorals with weak dorsalis pedis pulses .
Superficial varicose veins .
No edema .
LABORATORY DATA :
Hematocrit 44 , potassium 4.0 , BUN 23 , creatinine 1.2 , blood sugar 115 , Digoxin 1.4 .
Electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation , moderate ventricular response , incomplete right bundle branch block , right axis deviation , right ventricular hypertrophy and possible apical infarction .
Chest x-ray showed left atrial , right ventricular and pulmonary arterial enlargement and interstitial edema with small , bilateral effusions .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Cardiac catheterization was performed without complication from the right neck and right groin on the day of admission .
Right atrial pressure was 12 with a wave form consistent with tricuspid regurgitation .
There was no tricuspid valve gradient .
Pulmonary artery pressure was markedly elevated at 120/60 .
Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was markedly elevated at 38 , with a very large mitral valve gradient .
There was little or no aortic valve gradient .
Fich cardiac output was 3.0 and indexed 2.0 .
Arterial oxygen saturation was 85 percent .
There was minimal mitral valve calcification , normal left ventricular contraction , and 2+ mitral regurgitation into a large left atrium .
There was minimal aortic valve calcification , mild ______________ thickening , normal open , and mild aortic regurgitation .
There was mild atherosclerosis of the mid left anterior descending .
FVC was 1.6 or 58 percent of predicted and FEV1 0.95 or 45 percent of predicted .
Room air arterial blood gas was 56/40/7.45 .
Because it would be ideal to place a mechanical valve if valve replacement rather that commissurotomy is needed , she was seen by Dr. Ca Shuff of ENT for her history of epistaxis .
He identified no bleeding source , but felt that the risk of nasal hemorrhage on Coumadin could be minimized interventional neuroradiology occlusion of the arteries to the nose bilaterally .
The patient was therefore referred to the Dr. A Eu Wave .
The procedure could not be scheduled during this admission .
The patient is , therefore , discharged after a three day hospitalization , with plans for re-admission for the neuroradiology procedure .
This will be followed by a trial of Coumadin , and then by mitral commissurotomy or replacement and probable tricuspid annuloplasty by Dr. Riemund C. Wave .
In the meantime , Lasix dosage is increased .
Potassium replacement has caused , according to the patient , marked hyperkalemia in the past .
DISCHARGE REGIMEN :
Digoxin 0.125 mg q.d. , Lasix 80 mg q.a.m. and 40 mg q.p.m. aspirin 1 q.d. , and Vanceril three puffs b.i.d.

An upper gastrointestinal revealed narrowing and effacement of the mucosal folds involving the second part of the duodenum suggestive of extrinsic compression and involvement by tumor .
There was no evidence of significant obstruction at this level .
There was displacement and irregularity of the inferior portion of the stomach suggesting tumor involvement .
A mesenteric arteriogram revealed a large retroperitoneal mass in the right side of the abdomen .
The mass distorts the regional anatomy , displacing the liver superiorly and antrally toward the left .
The right kidney is displaced medially and rotated approximately 90 degrees .
The inferior vena cava is displaced antrally and medially .
The mass does not receive its arterial supply from the hepatic arteries .
No major arterial or venous encasement is present .
The portal vein , although stretched in places , it does not encase .
The vena cava is patent , displaced , but not thrombosed or encased .
There were no major arterial abnormalities .
The electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 68 beats per minute , with first degree AV block , with a mild intraventricular conduction delay , with poor R-wave progression consistent with anteroseptal myocardial infarction , clockwise rotation or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .
There were non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
Exploratory laparotomy , resection of retroperitoneal liposarcoma , partial right hepatectomy , partial left hepatectomy , cholecystectomy , excision of part of the diaphragm , right nephrectomy and right adrenalectomy ; this was done on 12-23-93 .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This 61 year old woman was transferred from the Iming Medical Center because of alleged intractible ascites .
The patient had a history of post tranfusion hepatitis to twenty years duration , allegedly due to hepatitis C , and had previously failed therapy with Prednisone , and also Interferon .
She had been known to have chronic liver disease , X 12 years .
In the fall she began to have episodes of seizures associated with asystole , and for this reason had recently had a pacemaker implanted .
At the time of her admission to the Iming Medical Center in February and March of 1992 , on Mar 20 , 1992 , a permanent BVI pacemaker was placed .
She was also noted to have a toxic level of Dilantin , originally given for her seizures , which had been tapered and switched to Tegretol , alkaline phosphatase had become elevated to 600 , ultrasound of gallbladder and bile ducts were done and were normal .
During her recent hospitalization at Iming Medical Center , she was noted to have marked abdominal distension , felt to be due to ascites .
A diagnostic paracentesis was said to show a sterile transudate .
A weak prior to admission she developed diffuse upper abdominal pain and progressive distension with mental confusion , which partially cleared after defectation , and for this reason , the famiy requested transfer to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :

Stool culture was negative , blood culture was positive for streptococcus mitis on 2 bottles on Apr 14 , acidic fluid cytology was negative .
Radiological flat and upright abdomen on 4/15/92 showed nonspecific bowel gas pattern , no evidence of free air .
4/13/92 , no evidence of obstruction .
Portable chest 4/13/92 , no evidence of penumonia .
ultrasound and guided paracentesis was done on 4/14/92 .
Barium enema showed a large amount of stool in the colon without sign of obstruction on 4/17/92 .
Gaited blood pool scan on 4/18/92 shows slight decrease left ventricular function with an LVEF of 45% , minimal wall motion abnormalities confined to a small zone of the apex .
Persantine Thallium study , no definite evidence of ischemia or infarction .
Abdominal and pelvic computerized axial tomography showed cirrhotic liver with markedly enlarged portal vein and recannulization of the umbilical vein prominent acidic fluid in the abdomen , moderate splenomegaly , right renal cyst , status post hysterectomy .
electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia , first degree AV block , left axis deviation .
At the time of transfer , the patient seemed reasonably compensated , nevertheless , abdominal paracentesis was done , which showed unequivocal evidence of backterial peritonitis , for which the patient was intiially treated with Ampicillin , Gentamicin and Flagyl for two days and then switched to Unasyn 3 grams per day .
The patient was initially febrile , but then became afebrile on antibiotic therapy .
The patient was evaluated for long term therapy .
The patient developed increasing ascites in conjunction with her bacterial peritonitis , and was placed on diuretics with Aldactone and Lasix .
Marked abdominal tenderness was noted due to a bacterial peritonitis , which gradually cleared over several days .
Because of the patient 's history of asystole , she was discussed with Dr. White as a possible transplant candidate .
He felt that significant coronary artery disease should be ruled out .
For that reason a gaited blood pool scan was done with a 45% ejection fraction .
A Persantine Thallium stress test was done , which was negative for ischemia .
Her diabetes mellitus was managed on a sliding scale , and she had one episode of hypoglycemia , secondary to fasting .
The patient was officially evaluated for transplantation by Dr. White , who felt , although there was no absolute contraindication to transplantation , that her multiple medical problems made her a poor candidate , and that her chronic disability since a previous auto accident made it unlikely that she would ever be returned to useful function .
An upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed on 4/23/92 and revealed portal hypertension gastropathy , and grade 4 varices of the esophagus .
Meanwhile , she began to diuresis effectively on oral antibiotics , and intravenous antibiotics were discontinued after ten days and repeat paracentesis performed with only 320 white cells , with no preponderance of polys .
The patient was difficult to mobilize , and required the assistance of her family as her diuresis progressed , eventually the diuretic program had to be reduced because of a drop in her weight , associated with nausea and weakness , with her weight eventually falling down to 123 pounds .
At the time of maximum diuresis , she developed lethargy , and cramping of her extremities , and the diuretics had to be temporarily discontinued , and an optimum weight was finally decided upon , that was felt to be between 126 and 128 .
This period of time there was a brief increase in her SGOT from the 100 's to 230 .
She was discharged home on 5/5/92 on the following program .
1600 calorie ADA diet .
No free water , no added salt , 60 gram protein diet .
Tegretol 200 mg. d , 6 units NPH and 10 units CZI qam .

The abdominal CT revealed mesenteric adenopathy , normal bowels , hepatosplenomegaly , and ? fatty liver .
Chest x-ray revealed early interstitial edema .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted with the diagnosis of Cocaine induced rhabdomyolysis , renal failure , disseminated intravascular coagulation , shock , hepatic failure , pancreatitis , and thrombocytopenia in the setting of Cocaine intoxication .
He was accepted at the Vo Yd Burgsygu Hospital Center Intensive Care Unit and his hospital course will be reviewed by problems .
1-Rhabdomyolysis .
The patient had massive Cocaine induced rhabdomyolysis .
This resulted in tremendous third spacing of fluid and persistent intervascular hypovolemia .
The patient 's creatinine ______________ kinase peaked at 56,160 with negative MB percentages .
The aldolase was positive at 142 .
This was further complicated by hypocalcemia which resulted in mild electrocardiographic abnormalities .
The patient 's urine was alkalinized with intravenous bicarbonate to maximize the myoglobin secretion .
The patient 's urine output was further augmented by adding Dopamine .
Nevertheless , the patient 's renal failure continued to progress .
Over the course of the hospitalization his CK fell in the serum .
Much of his diffuse pain was felt to be due to this massive rhabdomyolysis .
2-Renal failure .
The creatinine was 4.4 on admission and peaked at 10.5 on the 15th .
The urinalysis revealed 4+ albumin with marked occult blood .
Peritoneal dialysis was instituted on 4/11 after a Tenckhoff catheter was placed by Drs. Freierm , Le , and Round .
Subsequently his creatinine rose for three days and then stabilized at 10 .
He continued to make minimal urine throughout the hospitalization .
3-Disseminated intravascular coagulation .
On admission the patient 's prothrombin time was 27.7 with a partial thromboplastin time of greater than 100 and a d-dimer positive at 8 with a fibrinogen of 69 .
He went on to develop profound thrombocytopenia complicated by hemorrhage .
The patient was supported with abundant use of fresh frozen plasma , cryoprecipitate , platelets , and packed red blood cells .
His DIC was further complicated by hepatic failure which resulted in poor endogenous production of clotting factors and he remained fresh frozen plasma dependent .
4-Septic shock .
The patient remained pressor dependent throughout his hospitalization .
He was maintained variously on Levophed , Dobutamine , Dopamine , and ultimately Epinephrine for blood pressure support .
Hemodynamic monitoring revealed low systemic vascular resistance and high cardiac output .
He had multiple sources of infection including his sinuses , lungs , and multiple lines .
This will be discussed below .
Further he had massive muscle necrosis and hepatic failure .
An echocardiogram on 4/12 revealed a dilated left ventricle which was diffusely mildly hypokinetic with no vegetations .
His ejection fraction was 55% .
On 4/16 the pulmonary artery catheter was placed which revealed a wedge pressure of 8 , cardiac index of 4.5 , and an SVR of 5.8 .
5-Hepatic failure .
His SGPT on admission was 2,520 with a peak at 7,680 on hospital day two .
He had complete loss of synthetic and conjugation function of the liver with rising bilirubin and falling albumin with dependence on transfusion for support of his prothrombin time .
He was seen in consultation by the GI Service and the Liver Transplantation Service .
Given his multiple other medical problems , the direness of his situation , and his ongoing substance abuse at the time of admission he was deemed not to be a candidate for a liver transplantation .
6-Cocaine intoxication .
Serum Cocaine was positive 6-12 hours ingestion at the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital .
Further , at Ceanotsit Ortgold Center his serum toxicology screens were positive .
This is thought to be the insighting cause of his massive rhabdomyolysis and hepatic failure .
7-Pneumonia .
The patient developed two pneumonias with two separate organisms .
The first was Acinetobacter calcoaceticus subspecies anitratus , treated with Ciprofloxacin and Gentamicin .
He subsequently developed a staphylococcus aureus pneumonia which was treated with Vancomycin , dosed to levels appropriate for his renal failure .
He was seen in consultation by the Infectious Disease Service who advised us on antibiotic choices daily .
8-Pancreatitis .
The amylase on admission was 279 with a lipase of 161 .
Although not fully this may have contributed to his hypocalcemia and volume requirements .
9-Catheter tip infections .
The patient grew out coagulase negative staphylococcus from the femoral lines which were placed during his profound hypertension .
These were treated with Vancomycin .
10-Anemia .
The patient 's hematocrit was 33% on admission and fell to 28 requiring 4 units of packed red blood cells over the course of his hospitalization .
11-Coma .
The patient , although initially minimally responsive , went on to develop a deep comatose state .
A CT scan on admission revealed no evidence of hemorrhage though he did have sphenoid sinusitis .
The lumbar puncture and sinus exploration were unable to be performed given the patient 's persistent coagulopathy .
The patient was treated empirically with Nafcillin and Ceftriaxone for meningitis and sinusitis .
Further complicating this was his profound liver failure with rising ammonias and hepatic encephalopathy .
Despite maximal supports the patient continued to be hypotensive .
Mid-way through his hospital course he developed trilobar pneumonia and this was probably complicated further by adult respiratory distress syndrome and the multi-organ system failure syndrome .
The patient remained mechanically ventilated throughout his hospitalization .
Nevertheless , he developed refractory hypoxemia , hypotension , and ultimately the patient died despite total life support .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 75 year old righthanded Caucasian female who was admitted to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital because of left facial droop and hand weakness after glaucoma laser surgery .
She was transferred to the Sas General Hospital for further evaluation of some weakness in the setting of multiple medical problems .
The patient had o.d. glaucoma surgery , 1400 hours , on May 12th , 1992 .
Soon after surgery , the patient noted her left lower face and hand were weak .
She was brought to the emergency room where she was evaluated and determined to have had a cerebrovascular accident .

Her admitting hematocrit was 45% , white count 7,700 , with an MCV of 92 , platelets were normal at 263,000 .
Albumin 2.5 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
# 1. cerebrovascular accident .
The patient suffered some mild weakness which was attributed to stenosis of the distal right internal carotid artery .
This was determined by head CT , head MRI , head MRA , carotid noninvasive studies , transcranial Dopplers .
The possibility of a cardiac origin was evaluated by echocardiogram and Holter monitor .
Her echocardiogram curiously showed a normal left ventricular size and systolic function , a patent foramen ovale , with a trace right to left shunt , as determined by bubble study , trace MR was present .
Previous echoes have shown MVP at the Ona Hospital .
Her Holter showed up to 12 beats of SVT , but was otherwise unremarkable .
The patient had a normal B12 , negative syphilis serologies and normal thyroid function during this hospitalization .
She was anticoagulated with heparin and after several days Coumadin was started .
Her exact Coumadin dose is undetermined at this point , however it looks like it will be something around 5 mg a day .
Her pro time and PTT have normalized at the time of discharge .
She needs to be given 5 mg of Coumadin tonight , 5/22/92 .
In addition heparin should be started to drip on arrival at 400 units an hour .
It is discontinued at the time of transport .
The patient has received physical therapy and occupational therapy and her recovery is near complete .
During evaluation of her neurologic status , it was determined that for several months prior to admission , the patient has been too unsteady to ambulate .
On our exam she is found to have a significant amount of ataxia , especially in the midline and the exact cause of this is unknown .
There are multiple possible contributions and this is where her need for careful internal medical evaluation has arisen .
At the time we were to embark on this evaluation , the patient 's family strongly requested that she be transferred to the Sas General Hospital .
What follows is a summary of her medical problems and their possible relationship to her ataxia .
Her ataxia is likely due to some cerebellar function , though this is not certain .
Moreover her MRI did not show any discrete cerebellar lesions .
Our leading theory at this point is that her cerebellar dysfunction relates to perineoplastic syndrome , relating to her history of breast Ca .
As I mentioned above , her evaluation was limited by her cardiologic status at the time .
While mammogram and CA-15.3 and breast exam are all normal , the idea of a perineoplastic syndrome with or without concomitant breast Ca has reared its head .
Two possible markers are anti-Hu syndrome and anti-Yo antibody .
These tests were sent on the 18th and are pending at the time of discharge .
The results can be obtained by paging me , Do A. Joasscchird , M.D. at 834-364-2251 .
I will be happy to furnish the results .
The patient has a history of MI in 1989 .
Echocardiogram no longer shows wall motion abnormalities .
EKG , when the patient goes out of left bundle branch block transiently shows an anterolateral Q/wave inversion .
We would like to discontinue her Isordil to improve upon some orthostatic hypotension , but we are not certain whether her heart will tolerate this .
Persantine thallium is scheduled at this time , but is yet to be performed .
The patient has a history of orthostatic hypotension x many years .
It has been evaluated in the past without success .
During her hospitalization , we confirmed the presence of this , even when she was hydrated with saline , to a fractional excretion of sodium of 2% .
Studies of her autonomic system did not document any dysautonomia .
Studies of skin galvanic conduction were normal and her RR interval evaluation was not abnormal .
This is a chronic problem but may be contributing to her current weakness and inability to walk .
Florinef is to be considered , however stopping the Isordil is one goal .
The patient has a history of bronchiectasis from a childhood pneumonia .
In addition there is a distant history of M. kansasaii infection .
This has been evaluated by Dr. Screen at Sas General Hospital and probably relates to her lung xray .
CT at the Ona Hospital in 1989 showed similar findings .
A chest CT was to be performed and may be yielding .
A PPD was placed and is to be read on Saturday , 4 26th .
The left volar forearm has the PPD just proximal to the wrist crease and a candida albicans placed just distal to the antecubital fossa .
The patient has a history of deep venous thrombosis in 1990 , for which she received 6 months of Coumadin .
Dopplers of her lower extremities were negative on this admission .
It is doubtful that she has chronic PE , but this is one consideration .
It is likely that she has pulmonary hypertension from her lung disease , and so this is a consideration .
The patient had mild hyponatremia during this hospitalization with a sodium as low as 131 .
We think this is likely due to an SIADH as she is euvolemic .
This can be evaluated further and is not a problem at this time .
The patient has glaucoma .
Her medications are as listed below .
Her ophthalmologist is aware of transfer .
His name is Ettrent Can and he can be reached at 678-233-5033 , b 549 .

He had a posterior lateral approach , and a HG 2 58 mm acetabular component with a 28 mm liner end no holes .
Cementing of a central line number 4 central femoral component with a 28 mm head and medium neck .
Placement of a 16 mm Herbert bone screw into the greater trochanter .
SECONDARY PROCEDURES :
12/20/92 - Mr. Head underwent bilateral lower extremity venous ultrasounds which showed no evidence for deep venous thrombosis bilaterally .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the hospital preoperative exam .
His total estimated blood loss for the operation was 3,070 cc , of which 1,970 cc was weighed on the sponges , 700 cc was in the suction , and 400 cc was estimated from the fields .
For replacement he received 500 cc of autologous packed cells , 2,250 cc of albumen and 2400 cc of lactated ringer solutions .
In the recovery room his hemivac drained 350 cc over 4 hours .
His labs in the recovery room showed a white blood count of 9.9 , hematocrit 29.5 , and a platelet count of 183,000 .
His prothrombin time was 11.3 , and partial thromboplastin time of 31.4 .
electrocardiogram showed some intermittent premature ventricular contractions and ST wave changes .
He was transferred an additional unit of autologous packed cells in the recovery room and an additional unit of autologous blood was hung to be transfused on the floor .
Over the next 24 hours , his hemivac drain put out small amounts of serous sanguinous fluid , and was removed without difficulty .
He was transfused 1 additional unit of banked blood the evening of surgery .
He underwent serial hematocrit determinations throughout the rest of the hospital stay .
On postoperative day 1 , his hematocrit was 29.1 , the next day it was 26.5 .
On 12/19 , his hematocrit stabilized at 29.6 , and he received no additional transfusion .
For management of pain postoperatively , he was placed on the PCA Morphine pump .
This provided excellent relief of his incisional pain .
He was gradually weaned off the intravenous Morphine , and switched over to oral analgesics with good control of his pain .
Prior to discharge , he was switched over to Percocet , which provided excellent relief of his pain , and he was discharged with a prescription for Percocet .
Postoperatively , he was placed in balance suspension , and kept at bedrest for two days when he was then mobilized , and started gait training , using a walker , and then crutches .
Prior to discharge , he was independent in ambulation with crutches , as well as transfers .
With the history of electrocardiogram changes in the recovery room , the patient was seen in consult by Dr. Lako Head , of Cardiology .
Dr. Head found the at the electrocardiogram was consistent , but not diagnostic with mild ischemia .
The patient has had no prior history of coronary artery disease , and the absence of significant ST depressions , he found the findings of only mild concern .
Patient was placed on Nitropace 1/2 "" q6h .
He was placed on the cardiac monitor for 36 hours , and had CPK isoenzyme determinations .
The patient 's electrocardiogram returned to normal , he had no evidence or episodes , of ischemia or chest pain , in the perioperative , his CPK and isoenzymes showed no evidence of myocardial infarction .
Nitropace was discontinued on 12/17/92 , and the patient was cleared by Dr. Head , and no further Cardiology followup was required .
Mr. Head 's wound was checked daily , and found to be healing well without evidence for infection .
On postoperative day number 10 , 2 days after the patient was discharged , the patient returned to the hospital for staple removal .
The staples were removed , and steri strips were applied .
The wound was found healing by primary intention , without evidence for infection .
For prophylaxis against infection Mr. Head was placed on Ancef perioperatively .
This was continued for 72 hours postoperatively .
For prophylaxis against deep venous thrombosis , he was placed on Coumadin perioperatively .
His daily dosage was adjusted according to his prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time .
On postoperative day number 2 his prothrombin time was 13.3 , and partial thromboplastin time was 39.0 , and he received 5 mg of Coumadin .
On postoperative day 3 , his prothrombin time was 14.9 , and his partial thromboplastin time was 40.6 , and he received 4 mg of Coumadin .
On 12/20/92 , he underwent bilateral venous ultrasound of the lower extremities .
This was negative for deep venous thrombosis bilaterally .
His Coumadin was discontinued .
Mr. Head required intermittent straight cath for the first 48 hours postoperatively .
Urine was sent for urinalysis , and culture and sensitivity , with this straight catheterization , and the urine culture and the urinalysis were negative .
He was continued on intravenous Ancef for a total of 72 hours postoperatively , to cover him for the intermittent catheterizations .
About 36 hours postoperatively , the patient was able to void spontaneously , and there no further intermittent catheterizations were required .
Mr. Head continued to progress well with his physical therapy .
Prior to discharge he was ambulating independently with crutches , and on stairs , and was independent with transfers .
He was discharged to home on postoperative day number 7 , 12/21/92 .
COMPLICATIONS :
None .
PLANS AND INSTRUCTIONS :
He is discharged to home with self care on 12/21/92 , he is to continue using 2 crutches full time for the next three months and will be seen by Dr. Ca in followup after that time .

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On physical examination , the patient was an uncomfortable appearing elderly male who was not complaining of pain .
His vital signs included a blood pressure of 150/70 , pulse 66 , respirations 17 , temperature 98.3 .
The head , eyes , ears , nose , throat examination was remarkable for a jugular venous distention of eight centimeters .
The carotids were without bruits .

Cardiovascular exam :
S3 and S4 were heard , but no murmur or rub were noted .
The point of maximal impulse was not palpable .
The abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended .

Included a sodium of 141 , potassium 3.5 , chloride 103 , bicarbonate 26.9 , BUN and creatinine 45/2.5 , glucose 59 , white blood count 8.9 , hemoglobin 8.8 , hematocrit 26.5 , platelet count 172,000 , prothrombin time 9.5 , partial thromboplastin time 27.8 .
The urinalysis revealed 10-20 white blood cells , 10-20 red blood cells .
Admission chest X-ray showed some cephalization of flow and an irregular right hemidiaphragm .
The electrocardiogram revealed a normal sinus rhythm at 65 beats per minute , with biphasic T 's in I , IV , V1 and T2 .
ST depression and biphasic T 's were noted in V3 through V6 .
No Q waves were noted .
Picture was believed to be consistent with anteroseptal ischemia , right bundle branch block , and question of left bundle branch block .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital for further evaluation and definite treatment of his cardiac disease , as well as evaluation of his chronic renal insufficiency and multiple medical problems .
He underwent numerous preoperative radiologic studies , including a transcranial Doppler , which revealed moderate to severe right PICA stenosis but no evidence of disease in the vertebrals , proximal basilars , posterior communicating arteries , middle cerebral arteries , anterior cerebral arteries , or ophthalmic systems .
He also underwent a preoperative renal scan which showed decreased perfusion bilaterally , and borderline asymmetric renal function , 57% left , 43% right .
The renal ultrasound revealed normal kidneys bilaterally with no evidence of hydronephrosis .
The impression of the Renal consultant was that the patient 's renal function was likely secondary to mild ischemic acute tubular necrosis and hypoperfusion .
No evidence of cholesterol emboli were noted .
On 8-27-92 , the patient was brought to the Operating Room where he underwent coronary artery bypass grafting with left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending , reversed saphenous vein graft to circumflex , sequential reversed saphenous vein to acute marginal and posterior left ventricular artery .
Mr. Ear did well in the postoperative period and continued to be followed closely by the Cardiology , Renal , and Diabetes and Cardiac Surgery Services .
The patient was then extubated on the second postoperative day in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit .
He did have some trouble with postoperative hypertension , with systolics to the 150 's and was placed on Captopril , 6.25 mg PO t.i.d.
His blood pressure subsequently came under better control and his Captopril was discontinued .
His renal function slowly improved throughout his postoperative course and by the day prior to discharge , his BUN and creatinine were 48 and 1.9 .
Dr. Freiermthalskush felt that this represented an appropriate improvement in the patient 's acute tubular necrosis , and that he was probably approaching his baseline renal function .
On the sixth postoperative day , he was transferred out of the Surgical Intensive Care Unit to the regular floor , without incident .
He did well subsequently with good control of his blood glucoses and blood pressures .
The patient is being transferred to Nacalv Medical Center in stable condition , with his sternal wounds healing well .
His saphenous vein graft donor site has been seeping somewhat and his stitches and staples will remain in to be removed during his postoperative office visit .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :

Unsigned
DIS
Report Status :
Unsigned
ADMISSION DATE :
5-28-92
DISCHARGE DATE :
6-4-91
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
left brachial artery thromboembolism .
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES :
include hiatus hernia with Barrett 's esophagus , pseudo-gout , and dilated cardiomyopathy with history of intra-atrial thrombus .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
Undergone during this hospital admission was a left brachial artery embolectomy .
The patient also underwent upper endoscopy and a left wrist fine needle aspiration .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 76 year old white male with a probable brachial artery embolism .
The patient has a history of cardiomyopathy and atrial fibrillation .
He was previously on Coumadin because of a prior embolic cerebrovascular accident .
The patient had his Coumadin discontinued in January 1992 secondary to an upper gastrointestinal bleed .
The patient was swimming at 4:00 o 'clock this afternoon when he experienced left upper extremity pain and paralysis .
He was evaluated at Sephsandpot Center and referred to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital for evaluation .
The patient is righthanded .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
1. cardiomyopathy .
2. atrial fibrillation .
3. upper gastrointestinal bleed in January of 1992 complicating his Coumadin treatment .
The Coumadin was discontinued .
4. cerebrovascular accident in 1988 with a residual aphasia .
5. polycythemia vera .
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :
Is none .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Isordil , Ditropan , Cytotec and Ecotrin .
ADVERSE DRUG REACTIONS :
no known drug allergies .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
( at time of admission ) the systolic blood pressure is 180 , his head and neck examination within normal limits .
Cardiac :
he has a II out of VI systolic ejection murmur which is loudest at the right upper sternal border .
His chest is clear .
His abdomen was benign .
His rectal examination guaiac negative .
Of greatest note on his pulse examination :
his carotid , femoral , popliteal , dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses are 2 plus both right and left .
His subclavian artery and axillary artery pulses are 2 plus bilaterally .
His brachial pulse is 2 plus , radial pulse 2 plus and ulnar pulse 2 plus on the right .
On the left he has no brachial , no radial and no ulnar pulse .
His left hand and arm strength is 4/4 with decreased sensation in the left fingers in the median and ulnar distribution .
The impression :
a probable brachial artery embolus .
The plan is to perform an urgent embolectomy .
The risks and benefits have been explained to the patient and consent has been obtained .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
On 5-28-92 at 12:00 midnight the patient was taken to the operating room .
The preoperative diagnosis as above was a left brachial embolus .
The postoperative diagnosis , the same .
The procedure was a left brachial embolectomy .
The surgeon was Dr. Home and first assistant Dr. Home .
The findings were a thromboembolism with propagated clot in the left brachial artery .
There were no complications .
The patient tolerated the procedure well and returned to the floor soon after the procedure .
On postoperative day # 1 the patient was afebrile with stable vitals and he had a very strong left radial pulse and a warm hand .
He was heparinized postoperatively and a cardiology consult was obtained .
In addition echocardiography for the next day was arranged .
The patient was seen on 5-29-92 by the ward cardiology consult .
His assessment was that this was a 76 year old gentleman with atrial fibrillation and a dilated non-ischemic cardiomyopathy status post two embolic / thrombotic phenomena with a recent history of an upper gastrointestinal bleed .
He recommended that the patient be heparinized as the Scabeth T Hospital Surgery Team had already done and that Coumadinization be begun within a few days of heparinization .
These recommendations were already underway .
Consequently we simply continued our management .
The cardiology consult also spoke to the patient 's primary medical doctor , Dr. Blood in Clear La who related that the patient had had two large esophageal ulcers and a history of polycythemia vera in the past .
On 5-30-92 the patient 's gastroenterologist Dr. Ri Blood was contacted .
Dr. Blood was on vacation , however Dr. Kotethorereke , his partner was in the office and went through Mr. Flytheleungfyfe 's old chart and noted that Dr. Blood had performed esophagogastroduodenoscopy on the patient during his North Carolina admission for an acute upper gastrointestinal bleed .
During this time in January of 1992 Dr. Blood had noted two distal esophageal ulcers .
He had treated both of these with epinephrine injection .
Follow up endoscopy on Mar 15 , 1992 had shown two deformities in the distal esophagus corresponding to the presence of esophageal ulcers treated earlier in January .
There was also a 4 cm. hiatus hernia from 36 cm. to 40 cm .
The stomach and duodenum were otherwise normal .
From Dr. Blood 's standpoint on Mar 15 , 1992 there was no contraindication to Coumadinization .
We discussed Coumadinization with Dr. Blood and noting Dr. Blood 's earlier findings we , in conjunction with Dr. Blood decided to Coumadinize the patient and Coumadinization was begun on 5-30-92 .
It was noted at that time that a stable dose for the patient earlier when he had been Coumadinized before was 5 mg. po q.day .
That was concurrent with Albuterol 150 mg. po q.day .
Given the patient 's history of ulcer and hiatus hernia and the fact that we did wish to anticoagulate the patient we actually performed upper endoscopy on the patient on 5-31-92 .
The findings were as follows .
The principal operating surgeon was Dr. Ca Scgach with the assistance of Dr. Jesclinke .
The principal findings were a 5.0 cm. hiatal hernia and apparent Ingree and Ot of Weamanshy Medical Center 's esophagus distally .
In the stomach there were mild erosions of the gastroesophageal junction without other abnormalities .
There were no abnormalities into the second portion of the duodenum .
The overall impression was that there was an apparent healed esophageal ulcer , a hiatus hernia , an esophageal mucosal changes distally were consistent with a Barrett 's esophagus .
No biopsy was taken .
The biopsy was deferred because the patient had received a dose of Coumadin the night before and had a prothrombin time of approximately 15 before the procedure .
On 6-1-92 the patient went to the echocardiography suite .
Findings were :
there was no evidence of intracardiac thrombus , although this was a transcardiac echocardiogram which is not the best technique for visualizing intraatrial thrombus .
There was a thickened mitral leaflet with mild mitral regurgitation .
There was focal calcification in the mitral annulus .
The aortic leaflets were thickened with no aortic stenosis .
There was trace aortic insufficiency .
The aorta at the sinuses was ectactic at 42 millimeters .
The left ventricular size and function were within normal limits with a left ventricular ejection fractio n of 57 percent .
There was trace tricuspid insufficiency .
There was evidence of an old pacer wire in the right atrium .
There was trace pulmonary insufficiency with right ventricular systolic blood pressure of 35 millimeters .
There was paradoxical septal motion consistent with bundle branch block .
The patient , it should be noted at this time , was doing very well and he was taking regular diet , voiding spontaneously .
He had been therapeutically heparinized since going to the operating room and by 6-2-92 his prothrombin time was beginning to elevate .
On 6-2-92 he presented a new complaint with left wrist swelling and pain .
He confessed to a history of gout in the past and consequently Rheumatology consult was obtained .
The Rheumatologist entertained gout as an attractive diagnosis given his history and they aspirated the joint .
Joint aspirate was remarkable for calcium phosphate crystals , that is the patient actually had a case of pseudo-gout .
Joint aspirate that was sent for culture has been negative to date and today is 6-4-92 .
The rheumatologist recommended checking a wrist xray to rule out calcification .
A wrist xray was obtained of the left wrist and it did show chondrocalcinosis thus confirming the diagnosis of pseudo-gout .
The patient 's pseudogout was treated with Colchicine 0.6 mg. po q. 3 hours and he received nine such doses over a time span of about 42 hours with some relief of his symptoms .
He is being discharged on Colchicine 0.6 mg. PO t.i.d. as an acute measure for his pseudo-gout and that prescription will last until he sees Dr. Blood in follow up this coming Tuesday .
Today , on 6-4-92 , the patient has no new complaint .
Yesterday , on 6-3-92 , his prothrombin time was just a bit over 16 , between 16 and 17 and consequently his heparin was discontinued .
Today his prothrombin time is 16.7 and it looks like 5 mg. of Coumadin per day is going to be a stable dose for him .
Consequently , he is ready for discharge today .
The only other thing of note is that secondary to his anticoagulation with Coumadin his Ecotrin has been discontinued .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Isordil 10 mg. PO t.i.d.
Ditropan 5 mg. po q.i.d.
Cimetidine 400 mg. PO b.i.d.
Omeprazole 20 mg. PO b.i.d.
Colchicine 0.6 mg. PO t.i.d.
Percocet 1 tablet po q. 4 to 6 hours prn and Coumadin 5 mg. po q.day .

Report Status :
Unsigned
ADMISSION DATE :
05/30/94
DISCHARGE DATE :
06/23/94
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
(1) stage IIIC ovarian carcinoma .
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES :
(1) right lower lobe pneumonia .
(2) failure to thrive ;
(3) obstructive uropathy .
IDENTIFYING DATA AND CHIEF COMPLAINT :
Mrs. Saujule T. Neathe is a 73 year old Gravida 6 Para 4 abortions 2 with a background history of stage IIIC papillary serous adenocarcinoma of the ovary who presents on 5/30/94 for failure to thrive , right lower lobe pneumonia and obstructive uropathy .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient was diagnosed with ovarian carcinoma in the summer of 1992 when she presented with abdominal distention .
At that time she was taken to the operating room and an ileostomy and colectomy performed .
The admission was complicated by the development of a right calf deep venous thrombosis on postoperative day four .
The patient was referred then to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital where she underwent thrombectomy .
One month later the patient was readmitted to Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital for definitive debulking including total abdominal hysterectomy , bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy , omentectomy , splenectomy and ileostomy take-down by Dr. Slaineaee Chabechird .
Thereafter she underwent line 1 chemotherapy with cis platinum , VP16 which she received six cycles and which was completed in March of 1993 .
This course of chemotherapy was complicated only by persistent diarrhea and some nausea and vomiting .
On 4/28/94 the patient developed a left femoral deep venous thrombosis requiring admission for anticoagulation .
An abdominopelvic computerized tomography scan during that admission showed recurrent disease in the pelvis with bilateral hydronephrosis .
Bilateral ureteric stents were placed prior to discharge .
Two days following discharge , however , the patient was admitted to Sephsandpot Center because of a decreased urinary output and persistent nausea and vomiting and anorexia .
She was maintained on intravenous fluids and received a transfusion of Prilosec which helped her urinary obstruction .
On this regimen she showed good improvement and was discharge home .
She was then seen on 5/30/94 at Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital for a routine chemotherapy but complained of decreased urinary output , nausea and vomiting and poor appetite and was therefore admitted .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Is as detailed above .
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :
She is also status post appendectomy in 1944 and dilation and curettage in 1945 .
ALLERGIES :
She is allergic to shellfish .
DRUG ALLERGIES :
She has no known drug allergies .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Include Coumadin 2.5 mg. P.O. q.h.s. , omeprazole 20 mg. P.O. q.d. , M.V.I. one tablet P.O. q.d. , ferrous sulfate 325 mg. P.O. b.i.d. , Ativan .5 mg. P.O. q.h.s. p.r.n. for sleep and Tylenol No. 3 one to two tablets P.O. 4 hourly for pain .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
( on admission ) showed the patient to be low-grade febrile with temperature of 99.6 , vital signs were stable with a blood pressure of 104/68 and a pulse of 92 , respiratory rate 16 .
She was noted to be a thin , cachectic woman in no apparent distress .
Head and neck examination remarkable only for extreme dry mucous membranes consistent with dehydration .
She had slightly icteric sclera , no adenopathy or thyromegaly .
Lungs examination was unremarkable with no focal pathology , breasts were within normal limits .
Heart :
regular rate and rhythm , no evidence of evidence , cardiac failure or endocarditis .
Abdomen :
showed well healed midline scar , non-distended , non-tender , bowel sounds were good , multiple small nodules were palpated subcutaneously in the upper abdomen which was non-tender , there was no costovertebral angle tenderness .
Pelvic and rectal examinations confirmed recurrence of tumor mass in the pelvis .
The patient was occult blood negative .
Extremities :
showed no evidence of acute deep venous thrombosis .
However , left leg had two plus pitting edema to the knee whereas the right leg had minimal edema .
LABORATORY DATA :
( on admission ) showed sodium 119 , potassium 9.8 ( the specimen was hemolyzed ) BUN and creatinine of 26 and 2.3 respectively , glucose 104 , ALT was 13 , total bilirubin .5 , alkaline phosphatase 62 , white blood cell count was 17.7 , hematocrit 26.7 , platelet count 223,000 , prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time were 22.1 and 37 respectively .
I and R was 5.2. Urinalysis showed no white blood cells and few bacteria .
Chest x-ray from 5/18/94 was within normal limits .
IN SUMMARY :
The patient was assessed as a 72 year old woman with a background of stage IIIC ovarian carcinoma and documented local recurrence who presents for line 2 of cycle 1 chemotherapy with Adriamycin , Ifex and MESNA .
She also has a low-grade fever of unknown etiology , has a background history of deep venous thrombosis and is therefore currently on anticoagulation and she shows evidence of dehydration and failure to thrive .
It was decided at that time to hold off with the chemotherapy .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was therefore admitted to the GYN / Oncology Service under the care of Dr. Chabechird .
Laboratory tests were repeated in view of some of the above abnormalities and was remarkable for sodium 138 , potassium 4.0 , BUN and creatinine remained elevated at 36 and 2.8 respectively .
Urinalysis showed 10-20 white blood cells .
In view of the nausea and vomiting a nasogastric tube was placed to which the patient some relief .
Repeat chest x-ray showed evidence of right lower lobe pneumonia .
Renal ultrasound was performed which showed moderate right and severe left hydronephrosis , bilateral ureteric stents were visualized .
Dr. Ryna R. Jescdrig from the Urology Service was consulted in view of the above findings .
He requested a Lasix renal nuclear medicine scan which showed high-grade obstruction of both kidneys , left greater than right and minimal clearance with Lasix .
Neither kidney appeared to be completely obstructed .
In view of these results with the elevated white blood count , elevated creatinine , Dr. Jescdrig felt that the patient was inadequately stented .
As a result she was taken back to the operating room on 6/2/94 and under cystoscopy the old stents were removed and new larger stents were placed .
The patient was started on Ampicillin and Gentamicin for urinary tract infection which ultimately grew out Escherichia coli sensitive to the above antibiotics and for right lower lobe pneumonia on x-ray .
She was started on nebulizers around-the-clock and chest physical therapy .
Sputum culture was sent but failed to identify an infective organism .
On the above regimen the patient showed marked improvement .
Her urinary output remained good at 80-100 ccs. per hour .
However , her BUN and creatinine remained elevated .
On 6/5/94 they were 21 and 2.2 respectively .
Her Coumadin anticoagulation was adjusted to give a prothrombin time between 16 and 18 and an I and R of 2.5-3 .
On June 5 , 1994 it was decided that Mrs. Neathe was not stable enough with a line 2 cycle I chemotherapy with Ifex , Adriamycin and MESNA .
She was therefore well hydrated and was started on her chemotherapy .
In view of her kidney damage it was suggested to change her intravenous antibiotics from Ancef and Gentamicin to Ancef and ciprofloxacin which she tolerated well .
On 6/7/94 the patient was found to be mildly confused with persistent nausea and malaise .
Urinary electrolytes were noted to be within normal limits but her confusion persisted .
A Neuro-Oncology consult was sought which felt this was probably secondary to Ifex intoxication and her chemotherapy was stopped .
An electroencephalogram was requested and was negative .
No computerized tomography scan or magnetic resonance imaging study of the head was performed .
She continued to have persistent nausea and vomiting with large amount of drainage through the nasogastric tube between 1200 and 1500 ccs. for 24 hours .
Off her Ifex the patient 's sensorium slowly cleared but the nausea and vomiting persisted .
For this reason a barium study was performed on 6/12/94 which showed a fixed stricture at the anastomosis of the descending colon with the rectum .
The mucosa appeared to be preserved .
In addition there was some narrowing in the mid portion of the descending colon .
The patient 's white blood count which had been followed carefully began to drop precipitously on 6/11/94 and nadired down to 0.7 on 6/12/94 .
The patient was placed on neutropenic precautions , her intravenous antibiotics were continued .
Her sensorium had cleared .
Because of persistent nausea and vomiting on June 13 , 1994 a KUB and upright was requested which showed large amounts of retained barium confirming a rectosigmoid stricture approximately one centimeter in diameter .
The patient 's white blood count persisted in the region of .5 to .6 with an ANC of 60 for the next two to three days .
In addition her platelets began to drop and reach a level on 6/13/94 .
She was maintained on intravenous antibiotics and GCSF therapy was started because of the profound neutropenia .
Despite the low platelets the patient showed no evidence of active bleeding and was not transfused .
A Gastrograffin upper gastrointestinal was attempted on 6/14/94 but was unsuccessful due to nausea and vomiting .
On conservative therapy the patient 's nausea and vomiting has slowly subsided .
A percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy ( PEG ) tube was placed on June 18 , 1994 which has helped to decompress the stomach and prevent nausea and vomiting .
On 6/17/94 in view of a drop in hematocrit to 25 , the patient was transfused three units of packed red blood cells , white count however had increased to 8.5 and her platelets were on their way up , count was 74,000 .
And she was not given platelets in addition .
Throughout this period the patient 's pain remained well controlled on patient controlled analgesia .
After much discussion with the family and Social Services it was decided to transfer the patient home once stable .
On August 21 , 1994 a PICC line was placed to facilitate home patient controlled analgesia ( PCA ) and on 6/23/94 this was found to be correctly positioned on chest x-ray .
On June 23 , 1994 the patient was found to be mobilizing relatively well with few episodes of nausea and vomiting .
The PEG tube was found to be draining well .
She was discharged home in a stable condition into the care of her family .
In addition she will be followed by Sephsandpot Center and Dwardsc Center who will arrange for home PCA ( patient controlled analgesia ) .
The patient 's prognosis is guarded .
Her current code status is do not resuscitate ( DNR ) .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Include omeprazole 20 mg. P.O. q.d. , Timoptic eye drops .5 percent one drop OU b.i.d.
She will receive intravenous fluids D5 1/2 normal saline plus 20 of potassium at 110 ccs / hour at home and is going to be placed on a subcutaneous morphine pump as arranged by Sephsandpot Center .
The patient may have liquids as tolerated but no solid foods .
In addition she will be followed by Santea Gehawhi General Hospital for PEG tube care and flushing and to assess her pain control .
FOLLOW-UP :
The patient will follow up with Dr. Chabechird on an out-patient basis .

DISCHARGE DATE :
1-9-94
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Mediastinal tumor mass .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
History of colon cancer , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , obesity , hypertension , history of myocardial infarction .
SPECIAL PROCEDURES AND OPERATIONS :
January 3 , 1994 , median sternotomy with mediastinal exploration , radical resection of tumor and aortopulmonary window ; partial resection of adjacent lung , en bloc resection of vagus and phrenic nerves ; partial pericardectomy ; fiberoptic bronchoscopy .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 66 year old white female with metastatic colon carcinoma with a mass in the left superhilar region , who presents for bronchoscopy , mediastinal exploration and resection .
The patient was in her usual state of health until she experienced the onset of abdominal pain in early 1992 .
In December of 1992 , she underwent a transverse colectomy for colon carcinoma which was Duke 's grade B-II , lymph nodes were negative .
She received postoperative chemotherapy .
In September of 1992 , she underwent an exploratory laparotomy because of an increased level of CEA in her blood with the presence of a liver abnormality on computerized tomography scan .
The exploratory laparotomy was negative .
She continued to have a rise in her CEA level which prompted a further work up .
In September of 1993 , an abdominal and pelvic computerized tomography scan was negative and in June of 1993 , she had a negative bone scan .
In December of 1994 , a thoracic computerized tomography scan showed a four centimeter soft tissue mass on the left suprahilar region , adjacent to the aortopulmonary window .
She also experienced increased hoarseness over the preceding months , which was due to left vocal cord paralysis .
She also complains of increased shortness of breath for the preceding month and now presents for mediastinal exploration and resection of her probable metastatic mass .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
The patient has a history of hypertension , coronary artery disease , previous myocardial infarction in 1983 , hypothyroidism , history of breast cancer and history of colon cancer .
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :
The past surgical history is notable for a 1971 mastectomy on the right , 1937 appendectomy , 1991 cholecystectomy , 1992 transverse colectomy , 1992 exploratory laparotomy , 1991 bilateral cataract surgery .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Levoxine 0.125 mg PO q.day , Vasotec 10 mg PO b.i.d. , Maxzide 75/50 , 30 mg PO q.day .
ALLERGIES :
The patient is allergic to sulfa .
HABITS :
50 pack year smoking history , still smoking currently .
Ethanol :
none .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On physical examination , she is an obese white female in no acute distress with a hoarse voice .
The head , eyes , ears , nose , throat examination shows that she is normocephalic , atraumatic , extra ocular movements are intact , pupils equal , round , reactive to light and accommodation , and the oropharynx was clear , neck was supple without lymphadenopathy , either axillary or supraclavicular .
Chest is clear with decreased breath sounds at the left base .
She has a previous right mastectomy .
Cardiovascular exam :
regular rate and rhythm , without murmur , rub or gallop .
Abdomen :
obese with multiple well healed surgical incisions , positive bowel sounds .
The rectal examination is guaiac negative without masses .
Extremities :
no clubbing , cyanosis or edema .
The neurological examination is nonfocal .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital .
The patient was brought to the Operating Room on January 3 , 1994 where she underwent a median sternotomy with removal of her mediastinal mass .
This mass was situated in the aortopulmonary window and was sent to pathology .
The frozen section analysis revealed this to be adenocarcinoma , metastatic disease from the colon most likely .
She had a chest tube placed intraoperatively and another placed postoperatively in the recovery room , for what was presumed to be a left pleural effusion .
This tube drained only a small amount of fluid and it was likely that the effusion was made to look more severe in the presence of left hemidiaphragm elevation .
This additional chest tube was removed the following day .
Her postoperative hematocrit was 31 , compared to a preoperative level of 43 .
Her postoperative recovery was really quite remarkable .
Mediastinal chest tube was removed on postoperative day three .
The patient was discharged home in stable condition on postoperative day six .
DOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :
Percocet for pain .
Follow up with Dr. Fede Duhenile .
She will have a home health aide to visit and help her with meals .

DISCHARGE DATE :
12-04-92
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
hepatic cyst .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
1. history of colon cancer ,
2. elevated carcinoembryogenic antigen .
SPECIAL PROCEDURES AND OPERATIONS :
11-28-92 , exploratory laparotomy , lysis of adhesions , biopsy of lymph nodes and small bowel mesentery and intraoperative ultrasound .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 65 year old female , status post a right colectomy for colon cancer , now with some question of hepatic metastases .
She has received postoperative chemotherapy .
She has had some right sided abdominal pain and apparently had a computerized tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging study at an outside hospital that showed a question of hepatic metastases .
She was referred to Dr. Duhenile and is now scheduled for ultrasound , magnetic resonance imaging study , angiography and possible surgical resection .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY / PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :
1. status post right colectomy ,
2. status post laparoscopic cholecystectomy ,
3. status post appendectomy ,
4. status post mastectomy ,
5. myocardial infarction in 1983 .
ALLERGIES :
The patient is allergic to sulfa .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
1. Mevacor ,
2. Thyroxine ,
3. Maxzide .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
The patient is a nondrinker and has a 30 pack year smoking history .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On physical examination , her vital signs included a temperature of 98.2 , blood pressure of 122/72 , heart rate of 100 , she was in no respiratory distress .
The head , eyes , ears , nose , throat examination :
no scleral icterus .
Her neck was supple , no adenopathy .
Her lungs were clear to auscultation and percussion .
Cardiovascular exam :
regular rate and rhythm .
The abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended , obese , well healed incisions , no hepatomegaly .
LABORATORY DATA :
significant for a hematocrit of 41.8 , white blood count of 7.0 , alkaline phosphatase 133 , total bilirubin 0.6 , direct bilirubin 0.2 , prothrombin time 9.4 , partial thromboplastin time of 25.0 .
The admission chest X-ray showed bilateral apical calcific densities that were felt to be consistent with granulomas .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted and underwent abdominal ultrasound , which was more consistent with a cystic lesion .
She also had a magnetic resonance imaging study , which suggested cyst or hemangioma .
However , a computerized tomography scan suggested a solid mass .
Given the uncertainty , decision was made to proceed with angiography and exploration to resolve the issue .
A mesenteric angiogram on 11-27-92 demonstrated no variant anatomy , the venous phase being okay , and no other abnormalities .
On 11-28-92 , the patient was brought to the Operating Room where she underwent exploratory laparotomy , total mobilization of the liver with intraoperative ultrasound , resection of fat necrosis of the small bowel mesentery and extensive lysis of adhesions .
Dr. Besti Kotebreun of the Radiology Service performed intraoperative ultrasound , and carefully looked at the entire liver .
The mass that had been seen on computerized tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging study proved to be a simple cyst and the rest of the liver looked perfectly normal .
The patient tolerated the procedure well and postoperatively had a relatively uneventful course .
She was advanced slowly to a regular diet .
She did have some persistent fever after the operation with a white blood count in the 14-15,000 range and on the day of discharge , her temperature was in the 101 range .
She said that she routinely runs fevers to 101 or 102 at home and has for years , and insisted upon going home .
This seemed reasonable given there was no identifiable source for a fever at the time of discharge and she promised close follow up for any problems .
It should be noted that her CEA upon admission was 13.9 , indicating that she must have tumor somewhere .
She underwent a computerized tomography scan of the chest prior to discharge , which demonstrated no evidence of pulmonary metastases .
She also underwent a bone scan by Nuclear Radiology , which demonstrated no findings suggestive of metastatic disease .
Her pathology report was as follows :
1. mesenteric nodule was adipose tissue with fibrosis and fat necrosis with no evidence of malignancy ,
2. peripancreatic mesentery , small bowel biopsy was adipose tissue with fibrosis and fat necrosis with no evidence of malignancy , and
3. lymph node excision from the periportal region was no evidence of malignancy .
The patient was discharged home in stable condition on 12-04-92 .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
1. Percocet , 1-2 PO q4-6h prn .

Left internal carotid occlusion .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSES :
coronary artery disease , insulin dependent diabetes mellitus , status post right above-knee amputation and status post left great toe amputation .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
left carotid endarterectomy 09/22/93 .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This 75 year old Hispanic male with insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and peripheral vascular disease , status post a middle cerebral artery cerebrovascular accident was admitted for left carotid endarterectomy .
His history of present illness began with a worsening left toe ulcer in 06/93 resulting in a left great toe amputation .
Approximately two days following discharge , his family members noted that his behavior had changed , including personality changes , confusion and self-neglect
On 08/07/93 he was admitted to Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital where an magnetic resonance imaging study confirmed a 4 centimeter infarct in the left frontoparietal and temporal areas without evidence of bleeding .
He was noted to have calcified vertebral artery .
His infarct was felt to be consistent with a superior middle cerebral infarct .
At that time Holter monitor showed no abnormalities .
An echocardiogram was reportedly normal and an MRI angiogram documented a 95% occlusion of his left coronary artery .
He was sent home on Coumadin for follow up with Vascular Surgery for carotid endarterectomy and presented on 09/18/93 for his procedure .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
insulin dependent diabetes mellitus for five years and peripheral vascular disease , status post a right above knee amputation in 1987 for gangrene and status post his left great toe amputation in 06/93 .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Included Coumadin 2.5 mg. g with 5 mg. d , Lasix 40 mg. q.day and NPH insulin 55 units sub-cu. qam .
SUBSTANCE HISTORY :
Notable for remote alcohol abuse .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
He was reportedly well-appearing with a temperature of 99.7 , blood pressure of 140/86 , heart rate of 92 and respiratory rate of 20 .
HEENT was normocephalic , atraumatic with a supple neck and no lymphadenopathy .
Lungs demonstrated bilateral bibasilar crackles .
Cardiac exam :
regular rate and rhythm , S1 , S2 , and a systolic flow murmur was noted .
His abdomen was reportedly soft , nontender with normoactive bowel sounds .
Extremities showed no evidence of clubbing , cyanosis or edema .
Pulses were markedly diminished bilaterally .
Radially the left carotid pulse was felt to be stronger than the right and the left dorsalis pedis pulse was 1+ .
Bilateral carotid bruits were noted as well .
Neurologic exam was notable for disorientation to time , increased tone in his left upper extremity and slight right facial droop and a markedly decreased gag on the right side .
The deep tendon reflexes were present and symmetric .
LABORATORY DATA :
sodium of 138 , potassium of 4.4 , chloride of 101 , bicarbonate 30.9 , BUN of 16 , creatinine 1.0 , glucose of 283 , hematocrit of 41.5 , white blood count of 6.7 with 50% polys , 29% lymphs .
Platelet count of 224,000 , prothrombin time of 12.2 , partial thromboplastin time of 30.9 .
His admission electrocardiogram was normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 90 with PR interval of .14 , QRS of .08 with ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities consistent with apical lateral subendocardial ischemia relative to the August 7 , 1993 electrocardiogram .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Mr. Iron was admitted to the Ossontonville Milt Ywestmeadtl Marlenc Hospital where he underwent preoperative evaluation .
A medical consultation was obtained for his abnormal electrocardiogram with recommendation for a Persantine Thallium study .
On 09/21/93 he underwent a Persantine Thallium study with no complaints of chest pain .
His heart rate went from 70 to 84 , 63% maximal predicted heart rate .
Blood pressure was unchanged .
After Persantine infusion , electrocardiogram showed 1 to 2 millimeter downsloping ST-depressions , V4 through V6 , 0.5 to 1 millimeter ST-depressions in 1 , 2 and AVF .
The changes returned to baseline after intravenous Aminophylline was administered .
The test was felt to be positive for ischemia and Thallium images demonstrated a small amount of inferoapical ischemia as well as left ventricular dilatation upon exercise and normal pulmonary uptake .
On 09/22/93 he underwent an uncomplicated left carotid endarterectomy and was treated intraoperatively with nitroglycerin .
On 09/23 he was noted to have asymptomatic ST-depressions of 1 to 2 millimeters in leads 2 , 3 , F , V2 through V6 .
He ruled out for a myocardial infarction with serial CPK 's on nitro paste , oxygen , Metoprolol and aspirin .
The ST-depressions largely resolved .
On 09/26/93 he was transferred to the Medical Service for further evaluation of his cardiovascular status .
A Cardiology consult was obtained with recommendations for maximization of medical regimen and deferring cardiac catheterization at that time .
His course was also remarkable for adjustments in his insulin regimen with difficult control of his glucose and postoperative anemia treated with iron sulfate .
On 09/29/93 he remained hemodynamically stable with his left carotid endarterectomy site healing well .
He was discharged home to follow up with Dr. Tiffill Sapnins of Dingclearf Alllirefaith Memorial Hospital and Dr. Dwainco Rallsversgach of Cardiology .
He was to follow up as well in the H Health Network for postoperative care .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :

Bilateral knee replacements in 1973 .
Carpal tunnel releases in 1982 and 1965.
cholecystectomy in 1967 .
Hysterectomy in 1952 .
Right heart biopsy in 1990 which was benign .
FAMILY HISTORY :
was noncontributory .
MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER :
included Percocet , Tenormin , Xanax , Mevacor and with a history of of Calan , Ornade and Lasix .
ALLERGIES :
There were no known drug allergies .
HABITS :
did not include tobacco or alcohol ingestion .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On physical examination on admission the patient was somnolent but conversant , oriented x 1 only .
Chest was clear .
Heart had regular rate and rhythm .
Neck was supple without mass or bruits .
The abdomen was soft and nontender .
Calves were nontender .
On neuro exam the patient was somnolent but readily arousable to conversation .
She looked at the examiner and carried an appropriate conversation but only for seconds at a time .
Her face was strong and symmetric .
She felt pin prick and light touch bilaterally to the face symmetrically .
Her extra ocular movements were full without nystagmus .
She sees light only od. which is chronic .
She reads large print os.
Her tongue was midline and her palate elevated symmetrically .
She could not maintain her arms long enough to detect drift .
She also lifted both legs and flexes at the knees .
Her grip is 5/5 bilaterally .
Ankle dorsiflexion and plantar flexion were 5/5 bilaterally .
LABORATORY DATA :
On admission her labs. were notable for a hematocrit of 41.9 , white blood count 11.1 , MCV 87 , sodium 142 , potassium 3.0 , chloride 101 , bicarb. 29.3 , BUN 13 , creatinine 0.9 and sugar 134 .
A head CT performed on 01/10/92 revealed no cerebrovascular accident and no evidence of acute blood .
MRA / MRI revealed a left internal carotid artery aneurysm about 7 mm. in width .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital where a four vessel cerebral angiogram was performed on 01/13/92 .
This revealed a lobulated aneurysm at the p. comm. origin on the left .
This was a left internal carotid artery aneurysm .
The internal carotid arteries and middle cerebral artery showed irregularity of caliber probably due to atherosclerosis .
After much discussion , endovascular treatment with GD coils were recommended .
The patient underwent coiling on 01/14/92 .
This showed that 60-70% of the distal aneurysm was obliterated by the coils .
One coil protruded into the lumen of the left internal carotid artery aneurysm .
It was thought that the risk of subarachnoid hemorrhage was low but still substantial from the untreated proximal lobe .
Also the risk of ischemia or infarct from the internal carotid artery coil could lead to thromboembolism .
Therefore the lowest overall risk was thought to be a craniotomy to obliterate the aneurysm and possibly remove the protruding coil .
Therefore after discussion in detail with Sister Rora Dose , a left pterional craniotomy was performed on 01/15/92 .
At this time it was noted that the left internal carotid artery aneurysm was mostly within the cavernous sinus and the extracavernous portion was extremely atherosclerotic .
Therefore no clip was possible and the patient underwent a muslin wrapping of the aneurysm .
The patient postoperatively was able to open her eyes to voice and name .
Her pupils were equal and reactive and she was able to localize with the left upper extremity as well as raise the right upper extremity above the bed .
Her consciousness as well as her strength improved gradually and the patient was referred for rehabilitation at a chronic care center .
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :
subarachnoid hemorrhage and left internal carotid artery aneurysm .
PROCEDURES :
On 01/13/92 four vessel cerebral angiogram .
01/14/92 embolization of the left internal carotid artery aneurysm .
01/15/92 left pterional craniotomy for left internal carotid artery aneurysm with exploration and muslin wrap of the aneurysm .
COMPLICATIONS :
There were no noted complications .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
include heparin 5000 units sq. b.i.d. , MOM 30 cc. p.o. q. hs. , Dulcolax 10 mg. p.o. b.i.d. p.r.n. , Tenormin 50 mg. p.o. b.i.d. , Calan 60 mg. p.o. t.i.d. , Omeprazole 20 mg. p.o.q.d. , Lasix 20 mg. p.o. b.i.d. , potassium chloride 40 mEq. p.o. b.i.d. , Dilantin 200 mg. p.o. b.i.d. , Lotrimin to groin t.i.d. , Droperidol .625 mg. po 1.25 mg. m. q. 6 p.r.n. , Dulcolax 1 pr. q.d. p.r.n. , Tylenol 975 mg. q. 6 p.r.n. and CZI sliding scale b.i.d.
The patient has increased her p.o. intake however given her uncertain p.o. intake the patient was not started on a p.o. antidiabetic regimen .
Therefore we suggest a fasting blood sugar q.d. for several days after discharge .
If the fasting blood sugar remains greater than 160 we would have the local M.D. consider starting the patient on p.o. medications such as Glyburide .
This may include Tolinase at 100 mg. p.o. q. am .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Dilated cardiomyopathy .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
Interstitial lung disease , mitral regurgitation , systolic hypertension , status post myocardial infarction , transurethral resection of prostate , inguinal hernia repair , shingles , cataracts , ulcer disease , gout , mediastinal mass , thymoma .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
Right heart catheterization .
ADVERSE DRUG REACTIONS :
None .
CLINICAL INFECTIONS :
None .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. Nertland is an 84-year-old man who was admitted with decompensated heart failure .
The patient has a long standing history of significant left ventricular systolic dysfunction with severe mitral regurgitation and moderate aortic stenosis .
He was recently hospitalized at the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital for repeat cardiac catheterization .
After a comprehensive assessment , Drs. Sieh and Shufffyfe did not recommend operative repair of severe mitral regurgitation or aortic stenosis .
He was thus discharged with plans for continued medical therapy of his coronary artery disease .
Unfortunately , the patient continued to deteriorate and was readmitted for an attempt at hemodynamic tailoring and possible inotropic support .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Is notable for above .
For long standing dilated cardiomyopathy , severe mitral regurgitation and moderate aortic stenosis with a calculated aortic valve area of 1.1 by previous catheterization .
The patient had limited coronary artery disease with an occluded right coronary artery collateralized from the left system .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient was a well appearing pleasant man who was dyspneic on the examining table .
Initial blood pressure was 95/65 , heart rate 80 and regular .
Respiratory rate was 14 .
Jugular venous pressure was 7 with modest hepatojugular reflex .
The carotids were 2+ and the lungs were notable for diminished breath sounds with inspiratory rhonchi .
The point of maximum impulse was displaced and the first and second heart sounds were unremarkable with a 2/6 murmur of mitral regurgitation .
There was no S3 gallop .
Abdomen was soft and non-tender and the rest of the examination was notable only for a slightly diminished pulses and poor perfusion .
LABORATORY DATA :
Notable for a sodium of 144 , potassium 3.7 , BUN 43 , creatinine 1.8 , albumin 3.0 , hematocrit 36 , white count 9.5 , platelet count 254 and a negative urinalysis .
A chest x-ray revealed moderate cardiomegaly with modest edema and the electrocardiogram revealed a normal sinus rhythm with left axis deviation , previous inferior apical infarct and right bundle branch block .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient was admitted to the hospital and underwent right heart catheterization which revealed a right atrial pressure of 11 , pulmonary artery pressure of 55/25 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 26 and a cardiac output of 2.7 liters per minute .
The PA line was kept in place while the patient was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit where he underwent an attempt at hemodynamic tailoring .
Initially Nipride was begun with some augmentation of the cardiac index but eventually a fall of the cardiac index to 1.8 .
The patient was then begun on Milrinone to a dose of .4 mcg. per kg. per minute with improvement in his cardiac index to approximately 2.0 and a corresponding fall in his filling pressures .
Because of the increased ectopy that appeared to be temporally associated with this infusion , the patient was switched to Dobutamine and titrated to a dose of 250 mcg. per minute .
On Dobutamine the cardiac index was 2.4-2.7 and at the end of his hemodynamic tailoring which included vigorous diuresis and the addition of Isordil and Captopril back to his chronic medical program , the patient 's right atrial pressure was 6 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was 9 and the cardiac index was 2.7 .
Systemic vascular resistance was 900 .
The patient was then decannulated and sent to the floor with improvement in his central hemodynamics .
Over the subsequent days of his hospitalization , the patient had adjustment of his diuretic program .
At discharge his goal weight will be 120 pounds and he will be maintained on a chronic Dobutamine infusion at 250 mcg. per minute .
Should he tachy phylax to this which is inevitable , he will be begun on a home Milrinone infusion per previous protocol .
The patient on the dose of Dobutamine noted , had little in the way of resting symptoms and was without paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , and orthopnea and able to ambulate approximately 100-150 feet without dyspnea .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Lasix 20 mg. q.day .
Isordil 10 mg. t.i.d. Aldactone 25 mg. q.d. Digoxin .125 mg. q.d. Plavix 75 mg. q.d. Allopurinol 100 mg. q.d.
Serevent and Flovent inhalers the patient b.i.d. Zoloft 25 mg. q.d. Nexium 40 mg. b.i.d. Captopril 25 mg. t.i.d. Zocor 20 mg. q.d. Seroquel 25 mg. q.d.
The patient will be maintained with a goal weight of 120 pounds .
Should his weight fall below 118 pounds , then he has been instructed to hold his Lasix .
Should his weight increase above 122 pounds , then the patient will take 40 mg. of Lasix a day .
FOLLOW UP :
He will be followed closely by Dr. Sieh and Mizy Flomhemp of the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital Heart Failure Program .
In addition he will seen as necessary by Dr. Ri Tlandmaul of the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital Psychiatry Service .

Mr. Warm is an 83 year old man with chronic congestive heart failure , mitral regurgitation and aortic stenosis who was admitted for diagnostic cardiac catheterization .
Over the last four to five months , Mr. Warm has noted a marked decline in functional capacity with nearly daily PND and orthopnea .
He has not experienced recent syncope but did have a syncopal episode in 1 resulting in implantation of a defibrillator .
Although in the past , he has been somewhat ambivalent with respect to cardiac surgery , given the decline in his functional capacity , he agreed to undergo repeat cardiac catheterization with a view towards defining his candidacy for cardiac surgery .
The patient lives independently with his wife in Connecticut and continues to be less and less active unfortunately .
He has nearly curtailed his trips to a gymnasium for cardiopulmonary exercising .
He does not drink alcohol and does not smoke cigarettes .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION :
On examination , the patient was an extraordinarily pleasant man who appeared his stated age .
His blood pressure was 110/70 .
Heart was 82 and regular .
Respiratory rate was 16 .
His jugular venous pressure was not elevated and his carotids were 2+ .
Lungs were notable for adequate air movement with no rales .
The first and second heart sounds were physiologically split and the cardiac impulse was rather diffuse and inferiorly displaced .
There was an S3 gallop at the apex and a 2/6 murmur of mitral regurgitation at the apex which radiated to the axilla .
The abdomen was soft and nontender .
There was no organomegaly but modest hepatojugular reflex .
The extremities were without edema and were warm and well perfused .
The posterior tibialis pulses were intact .
LABORATORY DATA :
Sodium 140 , potassium 5.0 , BUN 45 , creatinine 1.9 , glucose 90 .
Albumin 3.6 , hematocrit 41 , white count 8.6 , platelets 388 and PT 12.6 seconds .
The chest X-ray revealed cardiomegaly and no significant congestion .
The ECG was paced .
An outpatient echocardiogram revealed a left atrium of 45 mms. , an LV of 60 mms. , ejection fraction of 26% , moderate to severe mitral regurgitation by color and spectral Doppler , aortic stenosis with a valve area of .8 cms. squared with a peak gradient of 50 , a mean gradient of 30 , an ejection fraction of 26% with diffuse left ventricular hypokinesis and more severe inferior hypokinesis .
There was mild tricuspid insufficiency , an estimated RV peak systolic pressure of 55 and a mild diffuse hypokinesis of the right ventricle .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the hospital following uncomplicated cardiac catheterization that revealed a right atrial pressure of 5 , a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 23 , pulmonary artery pressure of 56/22 with a mean of 36 , a cardiac output of 6.1 liters per minute with a cardiac index of 3.8 liters per minute per meter squared .
The aortic valve gradient was approximately 32 mms of Mercury peak with a calculated aortic valve area of 1.1 cms. squared .
Coronary angiography revealed occlusion of the dominant right coronary artery in the proximal segment with distal reconstitution via left to right collaterals .
Left ventriculography revealed a dilated , diffusely and severe hypokinetic left ventricle with the anterior basilar wall best perfused and an ejection fraction of 18% .
There was 3+ mitral regurgitation and reflux into the pulmonary veins in the ------ views .
In addition , there was a 60% lesion in the left circumflex artery and only minimal irregularities in the left anterior descending itself .
The patient tolerated the procedure well apart from a small rise in his creatinine to 2.3 which returned to his baseline value of approximately 1.7 to 1.9 at the time of discharge after holding his diuretics and his vasodilator medications .
The patient was seen in consultation by Dr. Win Shufffyfe of the Cardiac Surgery Service and after a long discussion with the patient , Dr. Shufffyfe and the patient 's family , it was decided to defer cardiac surgery likely indefinitely and probably permanently given the patient 's age , co-morbidities , lack of probable benefit with relief of his mitral regurgitation , modest aortic stenosis and relatively modest coronary artery disease .
While in hospital , the patient was seen by Lenni Breutzoln who felt that the incremental benefit from biventricular pacing was likely to be modest .
The patient also underwent a sleep study which revealed evidence for fairly advanced and severe obstructive sleep apnea with multiple hypopneas and apneas , mean duration of which was approximately 30 seconds with one episodes of 68 seconds with a desaturation to 71% .
The patient was fitted with a CPAP apparatus with titration of 8-12 cms. of water as tolerated as an outpatient .
In addition , the patient had oxygen therapy given his prominent desaturation at night .
At the time of discharge , the patient 's vasodilator regimen had been winnowed appreciably and he was discharged with a goal weight of 125 lbs .
He will be followed both by Dr. Warm closely upon return to his son 's home in Connecticut and by Gie Lung of the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital Heart Failure Partners Home Care Program .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Pulmonary edema .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
Congestive heart failure , coronary artery disease , mediastinal mass , inferior myocardial infarction , bronchiectasis .
ADVERSE DRUG REACTIONS :
None .
CLINICAL INFECTIONS :
None .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
Cardiac catheterization .
ASSOCIATED PROCEDURES :
VQ scan , lower extremities noninvasive Doppler studies and overnight oximetry saturation monitoring .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. State is an 81-year-old man with a history of restrictive and obstructive lung disease , dilated cardiomyopathy , inferior myocardial infarction , and anterior mediastinal masses admitted with acute onset of pulmonary edema .
In the setting of inadvertently decreasing Lasix from 80 mg. po 40 mg. a day Mr. State had sudden onset dyspnea after approximate day and a half prodrome culminating in severe dyspnea .
Upon arrival in the Emergency Room Mr. State 's saturations were in the mid 80s and he was promptly rendered more comfortable with high flow oxygen , morphine , and nitrates and intravenous Lasix .
Chest x-ray was relatively unrevealing for interstitial or alveolar edema and with clinical improvement ensued with the immediate therapy in the Emergency Room as noted .
The patient denied angina , syncope , preceding worsening orthopnea , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , palpitations , chest pain , hematemesis or melena .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Is notable for an inferior myocardial infarction , restrictive and obstructive lung disease with an FEV1 of .9 and FVC of 1.34 and a moderate at best response to bronchodilators , and a negative sestamibi scan in May , 1999 apart from a severe fixed inferolateral defect , systolic dysfunction with recent echocardiography revealing an LVID of 62 mm. and ejection fraction of 28 percent , moderate mitral regurgitation and mild-to-moderate aortic stenosis with a peak gradient of 33 and a mean gradient of 19 and a valve area of 1.4 cm. squared .
In addition , Mr. State has an anterior mediastinal mass 2x2x1.7 cm. by recent computerized tomography scan without surrounding or adjacent adenopathy or parenchymal lung disease apart from bronchiectasis .
His cardiomyopathy work up entailed a negative ANA , negative SPEP , UPEP and Benz-Jones proteins , normal ferritin , thyroid stimulating hormone and a recent work up for possible bimomatous associated myasthenia gravis that was negative .
The patient lives on Quelene with his wife .
He is a non-smoker and drinks rare alcohol .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient was a very pleasant man who appeared his stated age .
Blood pressure was 155/60 , heart rate 70 with occasional premature ventricular contractions , respirations 14 .
Mr. State was dyspneic speaking in short sentences initially on high flow oxygen .
Jugular venous pressure was 8 with a brisk inspiratory descent .
There was no thyromegaly .
Carotids were 2+ .
Breath sounds were decreased at the bases only with distant heart sounds and a 2 out of 6 systolic ejection murmur consistent with aortic stenosis with Gallavardin like radiation to the apex .
Abdomen :
soft , nontender with hepatosplenomegaly , or hepatojugular reflex , bruits or pulsations .
There was no rash and no edema and the neurological examination was non-focal .
LABORATORY DATA :
Notable for a sodium of 145 , potassium 3.6 , BUN 23 , creatinine 1.3 , glucose 104 , hematocrit 42 , white count 8.7 , platelet count 235 and a PT of 12.9 seconds .
The urinalysis was negative .
The Troponin I was less than .4 and the creatine kinase was 114 .
Chest x-ray revealed moderate cardiomegaly with no clear interstitial or alveolar pulmonary edema and chronic atelectasis and / or scarring at both lung bases .
The electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm with premature atrial complexes and right bundle branch block with left anterior hemiblock and old anterior myocardial infarction .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the Hospital and underwent an approximate 1.5 liter diuresis within the first 24 hours with improvement in his symptoms and improvement in his oxygen saturations .
After a long discussion with the patient and his family it was determined that a cardiac catheterization would be prudent .
Prior to catheterization a VQ scan was performed which revealed a moderate probability for PE with a subsegmental defect in the lingular on the left lung .
Subsequent lower extremities noninvasive studies and D-dimer test were both negative rendering the probability of acute pulmonary embolism less than 2 percent .
It was not felt that the patient would be in need of chronic Coumadin therapy in lieu of this low probability findings in toto .
Coronary angiography revealed occlusion of the right coronary artery proximally with insignificant plaquing in the left anterior descending artery and circumflex arteries .
After a approximate 3 liter total diuresis the right atrial pressure was 5 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 14 , pulmonary vacuolar resistance 353 and the cardiac output depressed at 2.95 liters per minute , or a cardiac index of 1.7 liters per minute .
Based upon these findings it was felt that Mr. State most likely has multi-factorial dyspnea owing to both his ventilatory limitation and to a chronic low output state .
In Hospital he was seen by both Speech Therapy , physical therapy , and the Uspend Harmemewood Medical Center Congestive Heart Failure Nurse Practitioner Program .
His Isordil was increased in Hospital and blood pressure control was relative episodic with systolic pressures ranging between 100 and 160 .
Future adjustments will be made at home pending his blood pressure measures .
At a goal weight of 142 pounds , Mr. State 's filling pressures appeared ideal with a wedge pressure of 14 and his goal weight range will be between 142 and 44 pounds at home .
The patient will be followed by Dr. State within a week of discharge and by Nieie Naebrand Freierm of the Dyathenslycha Medical Center .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Imdur 120 mg. PO q.d. Captopril 100mg. PO t.i.d. Lasix 80 mg. PO q.d. Potassium chloride 40 mEq. PO q.d. Coreg 12.5 mg. b.i.d. Cozaar 100 mg. b.i.d. Plavix 75 mg. q.d. Allopurinol 300 mg. q.d.

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
cerebellar hematoma .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
1. deep venous thrombosis ,
2. history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .
SPECIAL PROCEDURES AND OPERATIONS :
10-11-93 , suboccipital craniectomy with evacuation of cerebellar hematoma and left lateral cerebellar hemisphere resection .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 112y year old female who was found unresponsive and underwent an initial evaluation at Tonland County Medical Center where a computerized tomography scan showed evidence of an acute posterior ______________ bleed .
She was transferred to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital for further neurosurgical evaluation .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
As documented previously in the patient 's medical record , includes a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , and coronary artery disease as evaluated by cardiac catheterization on 07/93 , although no cardiac catheterization report is available , the discharge summary that no evidence of significant coronary artery disease was found .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Atenolol 25 mg PO q.day , Procardia XL 60 mg PO q.day , Pepcid 20 mg PO b.i.d. , Isordil 10 mg PO t.i.d.
ALLERGIES :
The patient has no known drug allergies .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On physical examination on admission , she is an elderly woman with labored respirations .
Her blood pressure was 148/65 , pulse 78 , respirations 20 , temperature was afebrile .
Her head , eyes , ears , nose , throat examination showed normocephalic , atraumatic head , oropharynx was clear , her lungs had coarse breath sounds bilaterally .
Cardiovascular exam :
II / VI systolic ejection murmur .
The heart exam revealed a normal Sl and S2 .
The abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended , positive bowel sounds .
Extremities :
2+ edema in the bilateral lower extremities .
Her neurological examination revealed that she was awake and alert at the time of her arrival to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital and was moving all extremities to commands with pupils equal , round , reactive to light and accommodation .
Her extra ocular movements were intact .
LABORATORY DATA :
significant for normal electrolytes , BUN and creatinine of 27 and 1.1 , electrocardiogram which revealed normal sinus rhythm at 78 beats per minute with T wave inversions in V2 through V6 .
The chest X-ray showed a left pleural effusion .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient arrived at the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital and given her history of variably responsive state , and her computerized tomography scan showing a cerebellar hematoma , the patient was brought immediately to the Operating Room after consultation with the Medicine Service , given the previously noted electrocardiogram changes .
It was felt that her prior evaluation at the Ona Hospital had showed no significant coronary artery disease , according to cardiac catheterization results at that time .
However , invasive monitoring was undertaken in the operating room , as well as intravenous nitroglycerin for blood pressure control as needed .
The patient tolerated the initial procedure well .
On the next morning , however , a computerized tomography scan revealed recurrent hemorrhage with obliteration of her cisterns .
She was awake and following commands .
It was necessary , however , to return to the operating room for re-evacuation of her hematoma , which was performed .
The patient 's postoperative course was remarkably benign given the patient 's age and past medical history .
The patient was then extubated on the fifth postoperative day .
She did develop some respiratory distress on the first day post-extubation , requiring 48 hours of re-intubation .
Her subsequent course from a respiratory standpoint has been relatively unremarkable .
In addition , the patient has done very well from a neurological standpoint .
She is very bright , alert and oriented x three with an essentially normal neurological examination except for some bilateral dysmetria .
She has been tolerating a regular diet and has been working with physical therapy towards ambulation .
On 10-28-93 , the patient 's course was complicated by the development of a left lower extremity deep venous thrombosis .
She had been maintained on subcutaneous heparin and pneumoboots initially postoperatively and developed her thrombosis in this setting .
Since that time , she has been maintained on bedrest and Coumadinized .
Her current prothrombin time on 11-3-93 was 14.8 and it is felt that she could begin to be mobilized to a chair .
Her prothrombin time should be followed in rehabilitation to maintain it at the level of 14-16 .
The patient overall has done very well following her hospitalization .
We feel that she is an excellent candidate for rehabilitation and has been accepted at Villrow Health to continue this effort .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Coumadin , dosed daily to maintain a prothrombin time of 14-16 .
Her dosing has currently been 4-5 mg PO qhs and we suspect that she will even out at a dose of anywhere from 2.5 to 3 mg PO qhs to maintain her level .
Other medications include :
Isordil 10 mg PO t.i.d. , which has been held for systolic blood pressure of less than 110 .
The patient also has been taking Fluconazole 100 mg PO b.i.d.; she is on day two of a five day course .
Additionally , Cimetidine 400 mg PO t.i.d.
DISPOSITION / PLAN ON DISCHARGE :
The patient is transferred to Villrow Health .
She should be seen in the Neurosurgery Service clinic in six weeks ' time for follow up evaluation .
She should continue taking Coumadin to maintain a therapeutic prothrombin time in the 14-16 range for 4-6 weeks 'time .
She will require physical therapy and occupational therapy at Villrow Health .

Mr. Single is a 58 year old gentleman with a long standing smoking history who was diagnosed with an extensive stage small cell lung carcinoma involving his liver and his lungs in April 2000 .
He was treated with Carboplatin and Etoposide for six cycles and achieved a near complete response .
Re-staging scans in September 2000 demonstrated complete resolution of his lung and mediastinal disease and a 90% reduction in his liver metastases .
His severe abdominal pain had markedly improved and he was asymptomatic while taking narcotics for analgesia .
He presented to the emergency department of Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital on the day of admission with a three day history of severe abdominal pain .
He did not have nausea and vomiting , constipation or diarrhea .
He had run out of his narcotics for approximately three days .
Abdominal computerized tomography scan demonstrated extensive hepatic metastases consistent with relapse of his small cell lung carcinoma .
His mental status quickly deteriorated after beginning on his standard doses of Fentanyl patch and a head computerized tomography scan was obtained .
This demonstrated multiple enhancing masses in all lobes of the brain .
There was no hemorrhage seen .
He was started on steroids and began radiation therapy .
His abdominal pain was easily controlled with narcotics and his neurological deficits persisted although they did improve somewhat , once starting steroids .
Of note , he has an ataxic gait , he has periodic lapses in concentration , and he has dysphonia but no evidence of frank aspiration while he is eating his meals .
Initially , he had an expressive aphasia , but this seems to have resolved somewhat .
Other staging scans , including bone scan and chest computerized tomography scan were unremarkable for metastases in his bone but there are three new right lower lobe pulmonary nodules .
After discussion of findings of relapse of his small cell lung carcinoma with the patient he agreed to do not resuscitate / do not intubate status .
Our treatment plan of steroids and radiation therapy is to palliate his symptoms and try to improve his baseline .
These were discussed with Mr. Be 's children as well and everyone is in agreement with this plan .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Otherwise unremarkable .
ALLERGIES :
The patient has no known drug allergies .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Decadron 4 mg. q6 hours , this may be given PO or intravenous .
Heparin 5,000 units subq. b.i.d. , Lopressor 25 mg. PO b.i.d. , nicotine patch 21 mg. y q.d. , Fentanyl patch 100 mcg. per hour q72 hours and Senna liquid 2 teaspoons b.i.d.
LABORATORY DATA :
Unremarkable with a creatinine of 0.6 and normal glucose .
Calcium 8.8 , phosphate 2.9 , magnesium 1.8 , normal liver function tests and alkaline phosphatase is 112 .
Bilirubins are normal .
Coagulation times are normal .
The white blood count is 15,000 , hematocrit 40% , platelet count 300,000 .
Urinalysis is unremarkable .
DISPOSITION :
To Nacalv Medical Center to complete his whole brain XRT .
Ten fractions were planned and currently he is on day #6 .
His code status is do not resuscitate / do not intubate .
He will follow up with Dr. Maren Tlandflent and Dr. Lentny Be in the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital Oncology Clinic after completion of his whole brain XRT .

She was seen at the outside hospital and put on aspirin for two days .
An magnetic resonance imaging study showed basilar artery disease , questionable aneurysm .
The patient was transferred to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital .
An angiogram on 11/3 was consistent with thrombosis at the mid basilar artery .
The patient was put on heparin and was stable since .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :

The neurological examination :
post angiogram her eyes were closed .
She was very responsive , somewhat sleepy , she complained of chest pain , which was diffuse , non-localizing without electrocardiogram changes and persisted for several days and then went away completely .
She was oriented to person , place , time and purpose , she recalled three out of three objects at five minutes , she is able to do calculations .
She maintained her fixation on the conversation well .
The cranial nerve exam :
pupils reactive to light , extra ocular movements show good upgaze up to 3 mm. , good down gaze .
Right lateral gaze , the right eye had 2 mm. of sclera showing , the left eye was normal , and there are a few beats of right beading nystagmus .
The left lateral gaze , the left eye had 1 mm. of lateral sclera showing .
Disks were flat .
Sensory limb of the right eye corneal reflex is slowed , otherwise normal .
Seventh nerve weakness on the right in a central pattern is present .
Soft palate was in the midline and moved upward nicely , but did not respond to gag .
Tongue protrudes 2 cm. with slight deviation to the right .
Sensory exam was not remarkable , cerebellar exam was not possible .
Motor exam showed greater than 4+ strength bilateral upper extremities and psoas unable to lift off bed .
Quadraceps 2+ on the left and 3+ on the right .
Gastroc. 3 on the left and 4+ on the right .
Tibialis 3 on the left , 5+ on the right .
Reflexes were diffuse 3+ , toes upgoing bilaterally .
LABORATORY DATA :
On admission , electrocardiogram showed less than 1 mm. of ST depression in V4 to V6 , which is likely the patient 's baseline .
CK 's were mildly elevated but the MB fractions were not remarkable .
A chest X-ray showed some left lower lobe atelectasis .
Admitting creatinine was .7 , glucose 131 , white blood count was 10,000 , hematocrit was 40 , liver enzymes normal range .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was taken to the Intensive Care Unit after her angiogram .
She was aggressively anticoagulated with heparin .
A small intimal tear in the arch of the aorta during the angiogram , was without sequelae .
She was doing well with at least 4+ strength in all of her extremities , when on 11/13 , she had an acute drop in her systolic blood pressure to 70 for unclear reasons and without evidence of acute sepsis .
This was accompanied by substantial decrement in neurologic function .
For a short time , she seemed "" locked in "" .
She has made slow progress since then and at the time of discharge has 4-strength at the left elbow and 4+ in the left wrist and hand .
Trace movement of the right elbow and 4-strength of the right wrist and hand .
4-to 4+ strength at the left ankle , 4+ strength at the right knee and right ankle .
She is unable to lift either foot off the bed .
The extra ocular movements are full .
Tongue protrudes 4 cm .
She is drowsy at times , but generally alert , responsive , interactive , able to talk in two to three word sentences when she wants to .
She has severe memory deficits , but nevertheless , is able to engage in conversation , answers questions , names things well , does calculations and recognizes family members and states preferences .
She has been working with Speech Therapy , occupational therapy and physical therapy closely and should continue to show improvement .
She is anticoagulated on Coumadin and this has been stable .
She is do not resuscitate in agreement with the wishes of her multiple family members .
Follow up computerized tomography scans and magnetic resonance imaging studies have shown infarction in bilateral basis pontis , mid brain , the superior cerebellar areas , left thalamus , bilateral temporal lobes medially and inferiorly and left posterior communicating artery .
The patient had fevers sporadically during this hospitalization with rising white blood counts .
A chest X-ray documented a progressing left lower lobe infiltrate .
Initially this improved on Clindamycin and Cefotetan , but fevers recurred on this antibiotic regimen .
Sputum grew out Klebsiella pneumoniae , and she was treated with Gentamicin and Ancef for 14 days intravenous ( bug being sensitive to these two drugs ) .
A left pleural effusion developed and this was tapped with ultrasound guidance , and found to be sterile , and without evidence of empyema .
The patient is on Ciprofloxacin .
The day of discharge is day #3 of 7 , after which antibiotics should be totally discontinued .
She has developed bad thrush in this setting , she is not yet able to swallow and so she is on Nystatin swish and spit five times a day .
She also gets Peridex to clean out her mouth .
Once her liver enzymes are completely normal , a seven day course of Fluconazol may be helpful if the thrush is not spontaneously resolving off of antibiotics .
She has been afebrile for greater than 10 days , including several days on oral antibiotics .
The patient 's liver enzymes were noted to be elevated mid way through her hospital course , to about three times normal , especially the SGOT and SGPT .
These have spontaneously reversed , and are nearly normal at the time of discharge .
A right upper quadrant ultrasound documented gallstones , without evidence of common bile duct dilatation or active cholecystitis .
The exact cause of her liver enzyme elevation is unclear , but we are being careful about administering drugs , which might irritate the liver .
The patient had a steady decline in her hematocrit during this hospitalization .
Iron studies are all entirely normal , her anemia is attributed to anemia or chronic disease with hypoproliferation as well as multiple phlebotomies .
The plan is to give her folic acid , but not iron .
The patient 's potassiums have been repeatedly low and require daily checks and repletion .
This is thought due to the extensive course of Gentamicin which she received .
This must be carefully checked despite the standing order for potassium .
The patient has had low sodiums during this hospitalization .
This may due to her central nervous system process or her pulmonary process , with fluids administered as described , she should not have any problems from this .
Her sodiums were never below 130 .
She does well with tube feeds .
Her tube feeds orders are as follow :
full strength Replete with fiber at 70 cc. per hour .
In addition , the patient gets 250 cc. of juice ( not water ) three times a day .
She also gets Lactinex granules three packages in each bottle of tube feeds .
She also gets Metamucil one teaspoon with the first bolus of juice each day .
Please note that evaluation by the swallowing therapist , showed that the patient is aspirating at this time , but there is great hope from the nature of her deficit and the good movements of her tongue that normal swallowing should return soon .
It is for this reason that she is discharged with an nasogastric tube and that no plans for G tube placement are made at this time .
She has a history of of angina without myocardial infarction that has not been worked up .
She did have brief chest pain twice during this admission that did not correlate with electrocardiogram changes .
In the first week of November , her electrocardiogram showed T wave inversions in the lateral leads , correlating with an increase in the LDH , but not CK .
This did not normalize with administration of Isordil and the patient denied chest pain at this time .
As of 5/9 , her electrocardiogram had reverted back to normal and there is no evidence of congestive heart failure or continued electrocardiogram changes , and chest pain is absent .
Her cholesterol was 350 here .
She has been off of her hypercholesterol medicines .
These can be restarted when it is deemed reasonable , in view of her acute disease and recently elevated liver enzymes .
Note that the liver enzymes were normal on admission , at which time she was taking all of the above cholesterol medicines .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Metamucil 1 teaspoon q.d. , with first bolus of juice , juice 250 cc. down nasogastric tube t.i.d. , tube feeds as above , Lactinex as above , Tagamet 800 mg. nasogastric tube qhs , Nystatin swish and spit 10 cc. five times a day , Cardizem slow release 90 mg. PO q.d. , Folic Acid 1 mg. PO q.d. , Ciprofloxacin 500 mg. PO b.i.d. , discontinue on 12/10/92 KayCiel 30 mEq. down nasogastric tube q.d. , Peridex 10 cc. swish and spit q.i.d. , Coumadin 4 mg. nasogastric tube on odd days , alternating with 5 mg. nasogastric tube on even days , once daily , Tylenol 650 mg.

Report Status :
Unsigned
ADMISSION DATE :
10-24-93
DISCHARGE DATE :
11-2-93
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Non-Q wave myocardial infarction .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
Status post anterior myocardial infarction in 05-93 , status post percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of left anterior descending in 05-93 , hypertension , diabetes mellitus .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
Coronary angiography , exercise tolerance test with Thallium .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Metoprolol 50 mg PO bid , Isordil 20 mg PO tid , enteric coated aspirin 1 PO qd .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 65 year old Portuguese male with a history of an anterior myocardial infarction i May 1993 and is status post a percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the LAD who presented on 10-24-93 with crushing substernal chest pain and shortness of breath .
He had no prior cardiac history until May 1993 when on 5-24 he had crushing chest pain which radiated to his left arm .
He was found at that time to have 3-4 mm ST segment elevations in V1 through V4 at Pre Health .
The patient was transferred to Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital and had 4-7 mm ST segment elevations across the precordium with Q's in V1 and V2 , 2 mm ST elevation in AVL , and 1-2 mm reciprocal ST depression in II , III , and F.
On physical examination at that time he had bright red blood per rectum and therefore lysis was deferred and he was taken directly to the cardiac catheterization lab .
The cardiac catheterization results at that time revealed a right atrial pressure of 7 , pulmonary artery pressure of 29/16 , RV 33/8 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 16 .
He had a 95% proximal left anterior descending lesion which was PTCA 'd to a residual of 30% and an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed .
He also had some mild to moderate disease at the OM1 noted at that time .
The patient was transferred to the Cardiac Care Unit where he had a peak CPK of 5,042 and 26.7% MB's .
His intra-aortic balloon pump was weaned without problems .
He had hypotension with beta blockers and therefore they were not started .
On day six , an echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 44% with anterior akinesis and septal hypokinesis .
On day nine , he had a low level exercise tolerance test with Thallium which was positive for 2.5 mm horizontal depressions in II , III , and AVF , and 1.5 mm downsloping ST depressions in V5 and V6 , as well as some anteroseptal redistribution on Thallium .
Therefore , he went to repeat cardiac catheterization which revealed that the left anterior descending site was patent and revealed a distal PDA lesion and a circumflex lesion after the OM .
The patient was discharged to home and is supposed to follow up with Dr. Shuffburle of Gastroenterology for work up of his bright red blood per rectum and is supposed to follow up with Dr. Amesin of Cardiology and Dr. Shuffpasc of Dingclearf Alllirefaith Memorial Hospital .
However , he did not keep any of these appointments .
He went home and did not take any of his medications and smoked and drank heavily throughout the several months .
On the a.m. of 10-24-93 , the patient developed crushing substernal chest pain and shortness of breath .
He came to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital Emergency Ward where he was noted to be ashen and diaphoretic .
He was treated with oxygen , aspirin , five sublingual nitroglycerins , heparin , and was eventually made pain free with that regimen .
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS :
His cardiac risk factors included hypertension , diabetes mellitus , hypercholesterolemia , cigarette smoking , and a positive family history .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
His past medical history included hypertension and non-insulin diabetes mellitus which is diet controlled .
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :
His past surgical history had included gastric ulcer surgery and appendectomy .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
On admission , he was on Isordil 10 tid and enteric coated aspirin , but he was not taking either of these medications .
HABITS :
The patient smokes one pack per day and has a history of heavy alcohol use .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The physical examination on admission revealed a blood pressure of 110/70 , a heart rate of 66 , respirations of 24 , temperature of 98 .
The HEENT exam revealed the extra ocular movements intact .
The pupils equal , round , reactive to light .
The oropharynx was clear and the fundi were normal .
There were no hypertensive or diabetic changes .
The neck was suppled , with no lymphadenopathy and no jugular venous distention .
The carotids were 1+ without bruits .
The heart was regular rate and rhythm , S4 , S1 , S2 , with a I / VI systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border .
The lungs were clear , except for a few dry crackles bibasilarly .
The abdomen revealed a midline scar and a right lower quadrant scar , and it was soft and nontender wit positive bowel sounds .
The liver edge was 2 cm below the right costal margin , but smooth and nontender .
There was no splenomegaly .
The femoral pulses were diminished .
He had bilateral intertrigo in his femoral region as well as his axillae .
The extremities revealed no clubbing , cyanosis or edema .
The pulses were 1+ bilaterally .
The skin exam revealed changes consistent with vitiligo .
The rectal examination was guaiac negative .
LABORATORY DATA :
The laboratory data revealed normal electrolytes , BUN and creatinine , normal liver function tests , a first CPK of 140 , and a hematocrit of 43.1 .
The portable chest X-ray showed clear lungs , slight enlarged heart , and a mildly elevated hemidiaphragm .
The electrocardiogram was normal sinus rhythm at 81 , with normal intervals and normal axis , had poor R-wave progression consistent with an old anterior myocardial infarction , had flipped T-waves in V1 through V5 , which were of no significant change since his last EKG on 5-25-93 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the Step Down Unit for a rule out MI protocol .
He was treated with aspirin , heparin , and intravenous nitroglycerin .
No beta blockers was started because of his history of hypertension with beta blockers and because his blood pressure of only 110/70 .
The patient ruled in for myocardial infarction with a peak CPK of 219 and 20.9% MB fraction .
This was a non-Q wave myocardial infarction as there were no diagnostic electrocardiogram changes .
on 10-27-93 , the patient went to the cath lab which revealed a small nondominant right coronary artery without any lesions , a restenosis of the proximal left anterior descending lesion that had been PTCA 'd , a lesion in the first OM , and a moderately severe left circumflex lesion after the OM3 .
The left ventriculogram revealed an akinetic anterolateral and apical ventricle .
Given the results of this cardiac catheterization , which were not significantly changed from his previous cardiac catheterization prior to the PTCA , it was elected to attempt to medically manage the patient .
He was ambulated progressively on the floor .
A beta blocker was started with Metoprolol initially at 25 mg PO bid and eventually increased to 50 mg PO bid .
The patient ambulated extensively on the FIH 20 floor each day without any episodes of chest pain or shortness of breath .
On 11-2-93 , the patient underwent a low level treadmill exercise test with Thallium imaging .
This treadmill test was done on medications , including beta blockers , in hopes to assess an amount of ischemia on treatment .
The patient was able to exercise for approximately nine minutes on a modified Bruce protocol , however , he did not reach his predicted maximal heart rate while he was on the beta blockade .
There were no diagnostic electrocardiogram changes during the treadmill exercise test , although he did have 0.5 to 1 mm ST depression in II , III , and AVF .
The study was halted for shortness of breath and there was no chest pain .
Thallium images revealed a moderate sized region of ischemic but viable myocardium involving the anteroseptal and lateral segments of the left ventricle .
There was also some evidence of left ventricular dysfunction during the test .
These images were essentially unchanged compared with the previous Thallium images in May 1993 .
After extensive discussion between myself , Dr. Amesin , and Dr. Scgach , it was elected to discharge the patient to home with medical management .
The patient was extremely reluctant to undergo surgery , although he understands that this may become necessary in the future .
Dr. Amesin had a long discussion with the patient 's daughters revolving primarily around issues of the patient 's compliance .
Previously he had not taken any of his medicines and smoked heavily on the outside and not kept any of his appointments .
The importance of quitting smoking as well as continuing to follow his medical regimen was emphasized to the daughter and to the patient .
She will be actively involved in encouraging the patient to comply with this medical regimen and also to follow up with Dr. Amesin as well as Dr. Lfsquarc on the outside .
The patient remained guaiac negative throughout the entire hospitalization .
Despite being on heparin for a short time , his hematocrit remained very stable with only a small dip after the catheterization was done .
He will need to be followed up as an out patient for guaiac positive stools and possibly worked up for this in the future .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Acute myocardial infarction .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
Lower gastrointestinal bleed .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 65 year old Portuguese male whose cardiac risk factors include hypertension , diabetes mellitus , hypercholesterolemia , tobacco use and a positive family history .
He was a previously healthy male who reports a pattern of intermittent chest pain during the week prior to admission .
On the night prior to admission he was awakened from sleep with severe substernal chest pain radiating to the left arm , accompanied by back pain at about 9:30 p.m.
He was taken to the Pre Health emergency room and at about 2:45 a.m. on 7/30 an electrocardiogram demonstrated 3 to 4 mm ST elevations in leads V1 to V4 and 2 mm ST elevations in lead V5 .
He was treated with nitroglycerin , antacids and intravenous morphine .
He was transferred to Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital hemodynamically stable .
HE arrived in the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital emergency room with a blood pressure of 120/80 , heart rate 90 .
An electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm at a rate of 94 with premature ventricular contractions .
It was notable for 4 to 7 mm ST elevations throughout the precordium with Qs in leads V1 and V2 , with 2 mm ST elevations in aVL and 1 to 2 mm reciprocal ST depressions in leads II , III and aVF .
The initial physical examination was notable for bright red blood per rectum .
He was treated with intravenous nitroglycerin , intravenous morphine , aspirin , Ativan and a LIdocaine drip .
Because of the noted bright red blood per rectum , thrombolysis was deferred and the patient was taken immediately to the cardiac catheterization laboratory .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Notable only for surgical repair of an ulcer and a remote appendectomy .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
None
ALLERGIES :
Penicillin , which gives him a rash .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
His habits include smoking one pack per day for many years and moderate to heavy alcohol use .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient was an elderly appearing male in no significant distress .
His pulse was 84 and regular , blood pressure 114/70 .
The head , eyes , ears , nose , throat examination was unremarkable .
The neck was supple .
The carotids were of normal amplitude without bruits .
On cardiac examination he had a nonpalpable left ventricular impulse , a quiet S1 and S2 , no murmurs .
He had an audible S3 and a jugular venous pressure of 8 .
On lung examination he had rales one third up bilaterally .
His abdomen was soft and nontender with no hepatosplenomegaly , no guarding and no rebound .
On rectal examination he had bright red blood in the vault without any stool .
His extremities were without clubbing , cyanosis or edema .
LABORATORY DATA :
The hematocrit was 44.9 , white blood count 14.3 , platelet count 301,000 , sodium 138 , potassium 3.7 , chloride 102 , CO2 27.4 , BUN 12 , creatinine 1.0 , glucose 147 .
The electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 94 , left atrial enlargement , ST elevations in V4 through V6 , I and aVL , consistent with acute anterolateral myocardial infarction with Q waves in V1 to V3 and reciprocal ST depressions in leads II , III and aFV .
The chest X-ray showed a normal cardiac and mediastinal silhouette , mild pulmonary edema and an elevated left hemidiaphragm .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory where hemodynamic measurements included a right atrial pressure of 7 , a right ventricular pressure of 33/8 , pulmonary artery pressure 29/16 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 16 .
He had a proximal 95% left anterior descending lesion and mild to moderate disease in the first obtuse marginal .
The left anterior descending lesion was angioplastied to a 30% residual stenosis .
An intra-aortic balloon pump was placed in the left groin prophylactically .
The patient was hemodynamically stable throughout and was transferred to the MICU .
On hospital day 2 the intra-aortic balloon pump was weaned .
The patient was intermittently agitated while on the intra-aortic balloon pump and was treated presumptively for alcohol withdrawal with Serax .
The Lidocaine drip was rapidly weaned as well .
On the third hospital day the intra-aortic balloon pump was removed .
The intravenous nitroglycerin and heparin were weaned off .
After removal of the intra-aortic balloon pump the patient was noticeably less agitated .
On the fourth hospital day an attempt was made to transfer the patient to the floor .
However , after a single dose of 25 mg of po metoprolol , the patient 's blood pressure dropped to the 60/40 range and he was therefore kept in the MICU .
The peak CPK level was on the second hospital day and was 5,042 with 26.7% MB fraction .
On the fifth hospital day the patient was considered stable for transfer to the floor .
Once on the floor the patient had no recurrent chest pain .
An echocardiogram was performed on the sixth hospital day which demonstrated an ejection fraction of 44% .
On transfer to the medical floor the patient was noted to have guaiac negative stool .
He was evaluated by the GI Service who felt that , given the patient 's course , he could undergo flexible sigmoidoscopy electively at some point in the future .
The patient underwent exercise stress testing with thallium on the ninth hospital day .
He exercised for 7 minutes and 30 seconds , achieving 80% of the maximal heart rate on the modified Bruce protocol .
He did not have chest pain .
There were ST and T wave abnormalities with 2.5 mm horizontal depressions at the beginning of 3 minutes of exercise , which persisted into recovery .
The thallium images showed fixed anterior and septal wall defects without any definite evidence of redistribution .
Based on this data , on the tenth hospital day the patient underwent repeat cardiac catheterization which demonstrated a patent left anterior descending site , a circumflex lesion after the third obtuse marginal , and a distal posterior descending artery lesion with a tight stenosis and a small vessel .
These findings were considered not to be hemodynamically significant and the patient was therefore to be discharged on medical therapy including nitrates and aspirin .
Because of his persistently marginal blood pressure at 100/70 , an ACE inhibitor which was tried briefly and a beta blockers were elected not to be continued .
The patient was discharged in stable condition on the eleventh hospital day .

He is continuing on the radiation therapy to date .
On February 23 , Mr. Patient presented to Dr. Patient 's office with two major symptoms .
First , he had right lower extremity swelling and lower extremity noninvasives confirmed the diagnosis of a femoral deep venous thrombosis .
Second , he had a witnessed episode in which his eyes rolled to the back of his head and there was a question of some seizure activity .
In the past , he has not been known to have a history of CNS metastases .
The episode of potential seizure activity occurred in the setting of a bowel movement and may have been associated with vasovagal activity .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
The past medical history is as above .
FAMILY HISTORY :
Noncontributory .
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS :
The review of systems is negative , except as above .
ALLERGIES :
The patient has no known drug allergies .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 78 year old male with dysphagia who was found to have endoscopically two nodules in the esophagus , biopsy of which showed small cell carcinoma .
Recently , he has complained of pain radiating down the left leg and work up had shown absent left knee jerk .
Plain films of the lumbosacral spine showed some scoliosis with blastic changes around L3 .
The bone marrow biopsy was positive for metastatic carcinoma .
The patient was admitted for further evaluation .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On physical examination on admission , the blood pressure was 164/90 , pulse 88 , respirations 20 .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Note :
past medical history included hypertension , treated by Cardizem .
The patient also has a history of degenerative joint disease .
He had an episode of chest pain but ruled out for myocardial infarction .
On physical examination , vital signs were as above .
The head , eyes , ears , nose , throat examination was within normal limits , neck was supple , lungs were clear to auscultation and percussion .
The abdomen was benign with no masses felt .
Cardiovascular exam :
grade I / VI systolic ejection murmur at the right upper sternal border , single S1 , S2 .
The rectal examination showed guaiac negative stool .
Extremities :
within normal limits .
The neurological examination showed an absent left knee jerk .
Cerebellar function was normal .
LABORATORY DATA :
significant for a sodium of 140 , potassium 3.9 , chloride 105 , BUN and creatinine 21 and 1.5 , LDH 732 , SGOT 84 , alkaline phosphatase 145 , bilirubin 0.3 , calcium 10 , albumen 4.1 , globulin 3.9 , white blood count 8.9 , hematocrit 43.3 , 62 polys , 26 lymphs , 9 monos , 1 eo , 2 basos , prothrombin time 9.8/10.0 , partial thromboplastin time 31.8 .
During this admission , an upper gastrointestinal and small bowel follow-through on 9-5-93 was normal .
A computerized tomography scan of the chest showed diffuse esophageal wall thickening , dilatation of the esophagus with air fluid levels and no evidence of mediastinitis and some air space disease in a medial segment of the right middle lobe .
Bone scan showed multiple regions of abnormally increased activity in the dorsal spine and lumbar vertebrae , as well as a right anterior fourth rib , consistent with metastases .
A magnetic resonance imaging study of the brain showed no definite evidence of metastatic deposits .
There was microvascular disease .
A computerized tomography scan of the abdomen showed multiple low density lesions within the liver , consistent with metastatic disease and a 1.5 centimeter low thoracic paraesophageal lymph node , pathological .
Spleen , pancreas and kidneys were within normal limits .
A magnetic resonance imaging study of the brain showed no metastases .
The magnetic resonance imaging study of the spine showed extensive bony metastases .
There was no evidence of spinal cord compression on magnetic resonance imaging study , though there was evidence of pressure on the L4 nerve root .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted and he was started on chemotherapy and radiation therapy to the L4 spine region .
The first course of chemotherapy was given from 8-19-93 through 8-21-93 .
This was VP-16 150 mg daily x three and cisplatin 60 mg daily x three with Zofran 11 mg on three occasions as an antiemetic and each dose of cisplatin was preceded by 12.5 grams of Decadron .
The chemotherapy was well tolerated but did result in febrile neutropenia .
Granulocyte colony stimulating factor was added .
Thus white blood count dropped to 0.6 minimum on 8-27 , with platelet count of 63,000 but with granulocyte colony stimulating factor support and antibiotics for febrile neutropenia , white blood count recovered .
Actually the lowest white blood count was 0.5 on 8-31-93 .
On that occasion , platelet count was as low as 17,000 .
By 9-8-93 , the white blood count was back up to 16.2 .
The patient 's course was complicated by severe pain and intractable nausea and vomiting and severe substernal pain .
He is on MS Contin and also on Duragesic patch .
He continued to have nausea and vomiting .
The patient was seen in consultation by Dr. Signs of Gastroenterology .
Eventually , a PICC line was inserted and he was given central total parenteral nutrition because of severe anorexia during radiation therapy .
Two weeks passed without a bowel movement because of the lack of intake and eventually that resolved .
It was felt that endoscopy would be of value .
A central venous line was placed on 8-29-93 .
After neutropenia resolved by 9-2-93 with white blood count rising to 2.2 and platelet count to 28,000 , endoscopy became feasible .
This was done on 9-4-93 and there were inflammatory exudates , ulcerations , and granulation tissue in the middle and distal third of the esophagus , but the tumor polypoid masses had completely disappeared .
Cytologic brushings of the ulcerated areas were positive for cancer cells but deep biopsies were negative .
The patient was treated with fluconazole in case there was any Monilia , although biopsy did not confirm the presence of Monilia .
Gradually during the hospitalization , the sternal pain improved , as did the pain in the left hip and the patient became able to ambulate somewhat .
He was making progress and accordingly , a second course of chemotherapy was given at lower dose .
He received VP-16 100 mg daily x three , 9-12 , 9-13 and 9-14-93 , and cisplatin 40 mg daily x three on that same date with Zofran 10 mg.
The only problem was some recurrent nausea .
The radiation therapy was finally finished on the day of discharge , 9-19-93 , at which point the patient was able to take fluids and food but was still occasionally vomiting .
His white blood count was in the range of 53,000 because Neupogen had been started with his second cycle of chemotherapy and will be continued until it is clear that he has passed the nadir of any neutropenia to be expected from this cycle of chemotherapy .
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :
1. metastatic small cell cancer of esophageal origin to liver and bone ,
2. severe ulcerations of the esophagus at sites of prior tumor ,
3. intractable nausea and vomiting ,
4. pain syndrome , largely resolved ,
5. hypertension .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Prilosec 20 mg PO qa.m. , Senokot one to two tablets PO q.day as needed , Colace 100 mg PO b.i.d. , Microstatin 100,000 units swish and swallow four times a day , Darvocet-N 100 1 PO q4h prn pain , Cardizem 240 mg PO q.day , Neupogen 300 mg subcutaneously q.day x ten days , depending on trend of blood counts , Compazine 10 mg PO q6h prn nausea , PICC line flushes , 200 units of heparin twice daily .
The patient will need complete blood count , differential and platelet count twice weekly on Monday and Thursday , and fax it to 463-8992 .
The patient is on diet as tolerated .
There will be plans to do additional chemotherapy in the future if the patient improves sufficiently .

A peripheral blood smear showed mature eosinophils in increased numbers .
Chromosomal studies were negative .
A bone scan showed increased uptake at the manubrium at the site of an old fracture , as well as in the right supraclavicular area .
A thyroid ultrasound showed an inferior thyroid mass .
This was followed by an abdominal CT which showed an enlarged spleen , a lytic lesion on the right iliac bone and a benign renal cyst .
Biopsy of the lytic lesion was consistent with metastases papillary carcinoma of the thyroid .
An upper gastrointestinal was unremarkable .
The small bowel follow through was within normal limits .
A thyroid scan revealed decreased function and displacement of the thyroid by a cold mass located inferiorly with calcifications on the right side .
A chest CT also revealed a small pulmonary nodule with a necrotic mass involving the right lung posteriorly .
The patient was subsequently referred to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital under the service of Dr. Brain .
She continued to have profound weakness , a decreased appetite and weight loss .
She also developed lower extremity edema as well as left upper extremity swelling associated with increased shortness of breath on exertion .
A needle biopsy of the right thyroid nodule showed papillary thyroid carcinoma .

She had a 3 x 4 cm firm , nontender right thyroid mass that seemed to be fixed to the trachea .
She had no jugular venous distention or bruits .
The lungs exhibited right basilar dullness one quarter of the way up .
She had no definite S3 .
The liver edge was palpable to 6 cm below the right costal margin .
Her spleen could not be palpated .
She had 4+ edema to the knees bilaterally .
LABORATORY DATA :
On admission the white blood count was 67.3 with a differential of 21% polys , 16% bands , 3% lymphocytes , 2% monocytes , 57% eosinophils and 1% myelocytes .
Her hematocrit was 38.8 , hemoglobin 13.7 , platelet count 155,000 , PT 12.7/10.1 , PTT 33.9 , erythrocyte sedimentation rate 18 , calcium 7.5 , phosphorus 3.5 , sodium 136 , potassium 3.7 , BUN 15 , total protein 5.9 , albumin 2.3 , globulin 3.6 , alkaline phosphatase 379 , SGOT 37 , Digoxin level 0.7 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to Dr. Shatermivaet S Brain on 4/28/93 with a history of papillary carcinoma of the thyroid with bone involvement and possible lung involvement .
Work up was begun for the possible myeloproliferative / myelodysplastic disorder associated with the hyper-eosinophilic syndrome .
Accordingly , an Oncology consult was called on 4/29/93 and a bone marrow aspirate biopsy was performed .
This revealed maturation of leukocytes to all stages with markedly increased eosinophilic proliferation .
A lung biopsy was performed on 4/30/93 without definitive results .
During this time the patient 's coagulation status had improved with Vitamin K therapy with PTs normalizing .
ANCA serum results were negative .
ANA results were also nonsuggestive .
The patient continued to suffer from edema of the left upper extremity and a Vascular Radiology consult revealed a thrombosis of the left subclavian vein extending into the axillary vein .
There was some thrombosis of the left internal jugular vein as well .
A head CT was performed and was completely negative for any metastatic process involving the brain .
Thus , a heparin sliding scale was begun .
Meanwhile , the patient 's eosinophilia was treated with a trial of prednisone .
She also developed a mild urinary tract infection which responded to Bactrim , but which was subsequently stopped because of diarrhea .
The conclusions at this time of the thyroid cytologist , as well as the bone pathologist , were that the findings were diagnostic of papillary thyroid carcinoma with pulmonary metastases .
Dr. Trial was subsequently consulted on 5/5 for surgical intervention .
On 5/6/93 the patient underwent a right thyroidectomy with sacrifice of the right recurrent laryngeal nerve as well as the right sternothyroid muscle and lower parathyroid gland .
She underwent autotransplantation of the right upper parathyroid gland , as well as repair of a right posterior membranous tracheotomy .
She was received in the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit immediately postoperatively in stable condition .
Her rate was well controlled on Digoxin .
The patient was transferred to the floor on 5/7 .
On the ward she continued a gentle diuresis as well as Solu-Medrol therapy .
Calcium levels remained 7.2 to 7.5 postoperatively .
She continued to improve with a slight hoarseness in her voice that was expected .
She continued to exhibit asymptomatic atrial fibrillation .
Anticoagulation was begun on the third postoperative day with Coumadin .
She was effectively anticoagulated with a PT in the range between 15 and 17 over a control of 10 .
She also received a Radiation Therapy consult for local control of her invasive carcinoma .
She did well on the ward and was discharged on her ninth postoperative day .
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :
Metastatic papillary thyroid carcinoma .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :

PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
Replacement of ICD pulse generator .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
REASON FOR ADMISSION :
This is a 55-year-old female , with complicated prior medical history , including myotonic muscular dystrophy , resulting in cardiomyopathy , who also had multiple , recurrent ventricular tachycardias in the past requiring cardioversion , radio frequency ablation , pulse generator placement ( cardiovascular defibrillator ) 08/93 .
The patient is now admitted for elective replacement of her pulse generator due to end of life .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient underwent successful replacement of her pulse generator .
This procedure was quite complicated , required intubation during [ ] anesthesia due to respiratory compromise , and was technically challenging ; however , preexistent leads did not show any problems , and the patient received new Medtronic [ ] pulse generator .
The DFT was less than 24 joules .
The patient was extubated successfully and recovered uneventfully .
Final settings of her device include ejection fraction detection at the rate of 182 beats per minutes , therapy for this is 34 joules x 6 , VT detection between 160-182 beats per minute , therapy for this is 10 joules x 1 and 34 joules x 4 .
VVI is set in the backup mode at the rate of 40 beats per minute .
The patient 's pacemaker was also interrogated after procedure , if settings did not change during defibrillation , and includes minimum rate of 60 beats per minute with a maximum rate of 90 beats per minute , the mode is VVIR , bipolar configuration with a lead of an amplitude of 5 volts and with .5 msec .
The patient 's length of longevity was estimated at 35 months at this time .
The patient recovered uneventfully after the procedure .
She received standard antibiotics .
She is back to her baseline ambulatory level .
She is going to be discharged home today with follow up with Dr. Jescdrig in his private office in about two months .

ADULT RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME .
Unsigned
DIS
Report Status :
Unsigned
ADMISSION DATE :
5-3-93
DISCHARGE DATE :
5-12-93
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Adult respiratory distress syndrome .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
Urinary tract infection , tracheostomy status , diabetes mellitus .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. Stain was transferred from the Oreiewlefell Merkane I Penaltbridgesgreat University Medical Center for progressive respiratory failure and adult respiratory distress syndrome superimposed on a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , perhaps asthma , and ulcerative colitis .
His only positive result was a sputum culture for Pseudomonas and this came after he had already been on antibiotics .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The physical examination on transfer showed an alert male with temperature 100 degrees , blood pressure 120/64 , heart rate 80 .
He was intubated with pressor support of 25 , and PEEP of 12.5 with 70% FIO2 .
Tracheostomy tube was in good position .
There was an audible air leak .
His chest showed bilateral rhonchi .
The abdomen was distended with active bowel sounds .
The rectal examination was unremarkable .
Extremities showed trace pulmonary edema .
LABORATORY DATA :
A chest X-ray showed diffuse bilateral alveolar infiltrates , greater in the lower lung fields than in the upper .
The EKG showed normal sinus rhythm at 83 , with an 11 degree axis , non-specific ST-T wave changes .
The sputum Gram stain showed a few polys and no organisms .
The blood gas showed a pO2 of 56 , pCO2 of 48 and pH of 7.47 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was seen in consultation by Dr. Wire who felt that manipulation of the tracheal tube was the best approach to the air leak since it was a new trach and he was requiring such high ventilator support that it was risky to change it .
He also felt that lung biopsy at this time was rather risky .
The patient was therefore completely cultured again and begun on antibiotic coverage which would take care of the Pseudomonas he was known to have .
The steroids were tapered .
He was also begun on anti-Candida regimen for his urinary tract infection with yeast being seen .
Because of the story of hemoptysis , he also underwent an exotic bleeding work up for such things as Wegner 's and Goodpasture 's .
These results were all negative .
He continued to require very high FIO2 .
He was found to have a DVT by ultrasound .
He underwent a trial of TPA followed by heparin .
This produced substantially further hemoptysis and the need for transfusion .
He stabilized from this , but on the fifth while continuing to have extremely ventilator requirement .
In consultation with his family , it was decided that enough support had been done .
At that time , therefore , ventilator support was withdrawn under the comfort measures of morphine .

CHIEF COMPLAINT :
Elective transcatheter radio frequency ablation of the AV node for drug refractory atrial fibrillation .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is an 83 year old male with longstanding atrial fibrillation that has proved refractory to numerous AV nodal agents in the past .
He was recently hospitalized at Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital in the summer of 1993 for elective radio frequency ablation of the AV node , however , the patient , after extensive discussions , declined this procedure .
He is now readmitted after reconsideration and willingness to undergo treatment .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
The past medical history is significant for 1. chronic atrial fibrillation , refractory to numerous medications , as above ,
2. peripheral vascular disease , status post abdominal aortic aneurysm repair in April 1989 , status post axio-bifemoral grafts in September 1992 .
3. Status post permanent pacemaker implantation in 1984 ( Medtronic model # 8422 VVI ) ,
4. no known drug allergies .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On physical examination on admission , the patient appeared well .
The rhythm was atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response between 100 and 130 beats per minute .
The lungs were clear .
The Cardiovascular exam showed an irregular rhythm .
The first and second heart sounds were otherwise normal .
There were no murmurs or gallops .
LABORATORY DATA :
On admission , the electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation with intermittent ventricular pacing , and a left bundle branch block pattern at baseline .
The baseline creatinine was 1.8 .
The hematocrit was 44 and the prothrombin time was 12.7 on the evening of admission .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was taken to the Cardiac Electrophysiology Laboratory on 4-24-93 .
The baseline rhythm was documented to be atrial fibrillation with a mean ventricular response rate of 125 beats per minute .
A total of two radio frequency applications ( 60 seconds , 55 volts , 33 watts ) was applied with the ablation catheter and a typical HIS position ( right anteroseptal ) resulting in complete heart block with an underlying ventricular rhythm resulting from pacing at 50 beats per minute .
No spontaneous rhythm was demonstrated after pacemaker programming down to a rate of 30 beats per minute .
After fifteen minutes of observation , the rhythm remained ventricular paced at 50 beats per minute with a threshold of 2.5 volts at 0.1 milliseconds pulse width .
The pacemaker was reprogrammed to a rate of 70 beats per minute at 2.5 volts and 0.5 milliseconds pulse width .
Sensitivity was reprogrammed to 5 volts .
The patient tolerated this procedure without difficulty .
He was transferred back to the Scst.ontdrain University Medical Center Step Down Unit in satisfactory condition .
There were no groin complications related to his venous puncture site .
He was maintained on interim heparin and his Coumadin was reinitiated .
Throughout the remainder of his hospitalization he remained in atrial fibrillation with complete heart block , as expected , with ventricular demand pacing at 70 beats per minute .
The final program settings of his Medtronic # 8422 VVI pacemaker were 70 beats per minute , pulse width 0.5 milliseconds , amplitude 2.5 volts , sensitivity 5 millivolts , refractory period 325 milliseconds .
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :
1. Drug resistance atrial fibrillation ,
2. radio frequency ablation of HIS bundle ,
3. pacemaker dependence ,
4. peripheral vascular disease , as above .
SPECIAL PROCEDURES AND OPERATIONS :
1. Radio frequency ablation of HIS bundle with resultant complete AV block and pacemaker dependence , 4-24-93 ,

DIS
Report Status :
Unsigned
ADMISSION DATE :
4/13/94
DISCHARGE DATE :
4/20/94
DATE OF BIRTH :
9/9/1930 .
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Metastatic adenocarcinoma of lung primary .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
Metastatic brain tumor .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. Days presented in September 1993 with a dry cough , and left arm / hand paresthesias .
Workup at that time showed a large right upper lobe lung mass , infiltrating positive C4-C6 vertebrae , and appeared to be threatening the spinal cord .
Mr. Days underwent a biopsy and stabilization procedure of the C4 through C6 veretebrae by Drs. Lockstrip and Rekefreiermin of Neurosurgery .
The biopsy was consistent with poorly-differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma , thought to be lung primary , given his chest X-ray findings and smoking history .
Mr. Days subsequently underwent external X-ray therapy to the cervical spine for palliation .
Bone-scan and abdominal computerized tomography scan in October 1993 showed metastatic disease diffusely in the ribs , cervical , and lumbar spine , pelvis , and femur , and metastases to the liver and left adrenal gland .
In December 1993 , Mr. Days underwent brachiotherapy of his right upper lobe mass .
Since that time , his disease has progressed with increasing metastases , at least his pelvis and spine .
Compression fractures of T12 and L3 were noted in February 1993 .
Mr. Days has also developed a slowly-progressive microcytic anemia , with elevated ferritin and normal B12 and folate levels over the past several months , thought secondary to probable bone marrow involvement of his tumor .
He also has apparently developed a mild-moderate persistent leukocytosis over the past 1-2 months , progressively higher neutrophil percentages , but without clear evidence of systemic infection .
He also developed rather regular night sweats and fevers , which have been attributed to tumor fevers .
On 03/23/94 , Mr. Days presented to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital Emergency Ward for significant sacral decubitus ulcer , which was debrided by Surgery .
They recommended a ten-day course of Keflex , which he completed , and b.i.d. wet-to-dry dressing changes .
He was PPD-negative , with positive control , back in September 1993 , but that needs to be verified .
He received a Pneumovax in 09/93 .
On the day of admission , the patient presented with chief complaint of difficulty focusing , walking , and coordinating his movements for the past three days .
The patient 's family initially attributed this to overmedicaion with Tylenol III .
He denied any nausea , vomiting , unusual fevers or rigors , or acute confusional state .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
His adenocarcinoma is outlined above .
2. Hypertension , controlled with Nadolol .
3. Constipation , rather severe , secondary to pain medications .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
MS-Contin , 30 mg. , b.i.d. , Nadolol , about 350 mg. , qD , Tylenol No. III , prn , multivitamins , and five stool softeners .
His initial blood gas was 47/37/7.47 on room air , with corresponding O2 saturation of 88% .
His hematocrit on admission was 28.6 , with a white count of 16.4 , and platelet count of 313 .
His differential included 92% polys , 2% bands , one lymphocyte , 4 monocytes , and one eosinophil .
His electrolytes were normal , with a sodium of 136 , potassium of 4 , chloride of 102 , bicarbonate was 24.3 , BUN of 24 , and creatinine of 1.1 .
His glucose was 166 .
His calcium was 9 , his phosphate was 3.4 , his magnesium was 2 , his albumin was 1.8 , his globulin was 4.9 , his LDH was 422 , his SGOT was 43 , his alkaline phosphatase was 424 , his total bilirubin was 1.2 , and direct bilirubin was 0.6 .
His chest X-ray on admission compared to January 9 , 1993 :
There was increase in volume loss in the right upper lobe .
There was mild patchy consolidation consistent with collapse or infection .
The right hemidiaphragm was more elevated , and new left-sided metastases were evident .
Head computerized tomography scan revealed a 1 cm. lesion with surrounding edema and a mild midline cyst in the right occipital lobe , consistent with a metastatic lesion .
There may be two additional smaller metastases present .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
This is a 63 year old cachectic , ill-appearing man , in mild respiratory distress .
His temperature was 96.4 , his blood pressure was 178/72 , his pulse was 86 , and respirations were 23 .
His head , eyes , ears , nose , throat examination was normocephalic , atraumatic , pupils equal , round , reactive to light and accommodation , extra ocular movements were intact , fundi were benign , without papilledema , and no lesions .
His oropharynx was benign .
His neck was supple , no lymphadenopathy , no jugular venous distention , his carotids were 2+ , without bruits , and his neck was without any masses .
His lungs had some right upper lobe wheezing , and rhonchi , with an increased I to E ratio , and expiratory wheezes throughout .
On cardiac examination , he was regular rate , normal Sl and S2 , no murmurs or extra heart sounds .
His abdomen :
He did have bowel sounds , soft , nontender , nondistended , no hepatosplenomegaly .
Extremities :
He had 2+ pulses throughout , no clubbing , cyanosis or edema .
His skin :
He did have a decubitus ulcer over the sacrum , with no evidence of supra-infection .
Neurologically , he was alert and oriented times three , with cranial nerves II / XII grossly intact .
Strength was 5/5 throughout , except for left lower extremity , 4/5 weakness secondary to hip pain .
His sensory examination was grossly intact .
There were no cerebellar deficits .
His reflexes were normal , with downgoing toes bilaterally .
The patient 's HOSPITAL COURSE was significant for a chest computerized tomography scan , the impression which showed :
1. Marked interval progression of metastatic carcinoma of the lung , with chest wall , bony , pulmonary , hepatic , and vertebral metastases , as above .
2. Interval development of large bilateral pleural effusions , larger on the right .
3. Compression fracture of T12 vertebral body .
This may or may not be pathologic .
The patient also had a head computerized tomography scan done , which showed the new metastasis , as mentioned above .
The patient was begun on palliative X-ray therapy to the brain and to the right pelvis , where he also has metastases .
The patient was started on intravenous Dilantin for seizure prophylaxis and Decadron to prevent cerebral edema in the setting of his radiation treatments .
At the time of discharge , the patient will require ten more treatments to the left hip , and nine to the brain .
Also of note , the patient was empirically treated during this hospitalization for a possible post-destructive pneumonia .
The patient was unable to bring up sputum throughout this hospitalization , with an increased white count , with a left shift on admission , and a chest X-ray , suggestive of a partial collapse of the right upper lobe , and it was thought to empirically treat this patient with antibiotics .
The patient 's sacral decubitus was followed throughout by Surgery throughout his hospital course .
This hospital course was also significant for having a family meeting on the 15th of April to decide what further treatments would maximize the patient 's quality of life .
The patient and the family opted for palliative X-ray therapy and home hospice .
The patient was discharged with full knowledge of his grave prognosis , to go home with home hospice .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Pauci May is a sixty three year old patient referred by Dr. Laymie Aslinke for significant coronary artery disease .
He developed acute pulmonary edema on May 27 , 1993 , and was admitted to Sonpathcermu Jords Hospital , and found to be in rapid atrial fibrillation .
He denied any angina .
He had a gaited cardiac blood pool scan that showed an ejection fraction of 31% .
His pulmonary function tests showed FEV1 of 2.1 , and he was found to have intermittent obstructive sleep apnea .
An echocardiogram showed a dilated left atrium with mitral anular calcification .
He was discharged home but readmitted on May 21 with recurrent congestive heart failure .
A Thallium Stress Test showed equivocal ST segment changes with fixed apical and inferior defects .
His coronary risk factors include cigarette smoking , obesity , a family history of coronary disease , and elevated serum cholesterol .
He also has a history of atrial fibrillation with sinus pauses during sleep apnea .
On June 4 , 1993 , he underwent cardiac catheterization .
He was found to have an occluded right coronary artery , 70% distal left main lesion , 80% proximal ramus lesion , and his left ventricular ejection shows preserved function except for akinesis of the inferior wall .
His ejection fraction was 50% , a carotid duplex study showed plaqueing but no critical lesions .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
As above .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
He has a wife Pandeprob and lives in Ashing .
He did smoke up to three pack per day .
He has three children .
He is retired .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Six foot , 250 pounds .
He is a well appearing male , in no distress .
HIs blood pressure was 140/70 , pulse 80 and irregular .
His neck veins were not distended .
His carotids showed bilateral bruits .
His lungs are clear .
His cardiac exam shows a 1/6 systolic ejection murmur .
His abdomen is obese , but benign .
His peripheral pulses are intact .
He has no peripheral edema .
His Neurological exam is nonfocal .
LABORATORY DATA :
sodium 140 , potassium 4.4 , chloride 104 , CO2 30 , calcium 9.3 , phosphorous 1.2 , BUN 9 , creatinine 1.3 , glucose 183 .
Uric acid 8.4 , bilirubin 0.7 , alkaline phosphatase 72 , amylase 46 , SGOT 20 , and his Digoxin level was 1.0 .
hematocrit 38% , white blood cell count 7700 , MCV 86 , PT and PTT were normal .
urinalysis was unremarkable .
His chest X-ray was normal with bilateral pleural thickening .
His electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation .
There were nonspecific ST and T wave changes .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to Hellworthston Hospital .
There , he stabilized , and was seen in consultation by Cardiology and Anesthesiology .
There was concern over his sleep apnea , but he appeared to have primarily cardiac disease and therefore because of the left main stenosis , it was reasonable to proceed .
On June 24 , 1993 , Dr. Lenni Breutzoln performed triple coronary bypass surgery .
He placed a left internal mammary artery graft to the left anterior descending , single saphenous vein to the posterior descending artery with 170 cc. per minute flow and a single saphenous vein to the circumflex with 140 cc. per minute flow .
He weaned easily off cardiopulmonary bypass .
He had no hemodynamic difficulties .
He was able to wean from the ventilator , but he did have marginal oxygenation throughout .
He did revert back to atrial fibrillation .
He was extubated within forty eight hours .
He was transferred out of the Surgical Intensive Care Unit on June 26 .
He reverted back to atrial fibrillation that required Digoxin , and Verapamil to control .
He could not be converted back to normal sinus rhythm even with a trial of Quinaglute .
He also had anemia and he was seen in consultation by the Nutrition Service .
He was advised to have an ideal body weight of 178 pounds , and clearly a 2300 calorie diet was appropriate for him .
Weight reduction would be important in the long term management of his coronary disease .
He was treated with Digoxin and Diuretics along with Ace inhibitors because of his depressed left ventricular function .
He was able to ambulate although somewhat slowly because of his rapid atrial fibrillation .
It was considered to obtain a pulmonary consultation on a formal basis , but it was then felt that he would do better by healing fully from his surgery , because he really had little in the way of pulmonary complications , despite the history of sleep apnea of an obstructive basis .
Primary in his long term management is cardiac rehabilitation with weight reduction .
He will be followed closely in 23 Hwy , Hamp by Dr. Laymie Aslinke .

11/29/93
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Biliary obstruction secondary to malignancy .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSES :
1 ) Down 's syndrome ,
2 ) intestinal malrotation ,
3 ) status post Ladd 's procedure ,
4 ) status post duodenal jejunostomy as an infant .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with stent placement , performed on 11/25/93 .
ASSOCIATED PROCEDURES :
1 ) needle biopsy of portal mass , performed on 11/25/93 .
2 ) endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography , with temporary stent placement , performed on 11/23/93 .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. Tauaswatl is a 45 year old gentleman with Down 's syndrome , who presents to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital with jaundice .
Mr. Tauaswatl has a history of vague abdominal and back pain over the past several years .
A recent workup of his symptoms , which were predominantly right upper quadrant symptoms was done .
A right upper quadrant abdominal ultrasound was obtained in May of 1993 .
This study showed gall stones , with common bile duct dilatation .
Subsequently , an oral cholecystogram was performed , and the gall bladder was not visualized on this study .
The patient was therefore diagnosed with chronic cholelithiasis , and possible choledocholithiasis .
On Jul 27 , 1993 , the patient underwent a right upper quadrant abdominal exploration at the Nor Chi Gay Hospital .
At operation , a phlegmon was noted in the right upper quadrants in the region of the gall bladder .
The surgeons were unable to visualize the gall bladder , and the operation was aborted .
Since that time , the patient has had increasing jaundice , but no nausea or vomiting .
It should be noted that the patient has experienced occasional episodes of vomiting for years , but these symptoms have not changed recently .
The patient denies abdominal pain , fevers , chills , or any other complaints , although he was noted to have a fever over the weekend prior to admission .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
1 ) Down 's syndrome ,
2 ) intestinal malrotation ,
3 ) status post Ladd 's procedure ,
4 ) status post duodenojejunostomy as an infant .
ALLERGIES :
The patient has no known drug allergies .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
1 ) Tagamet 400 mg. po q.day ,
2 ) Tetracycline 250 mg. po bid prn ingrown facial hair .
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS :
Remarkable only for a recent weight loss of 20 lb .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient is a well-nourished but jaundiced male , with Down 's facies , in no acute distress .
Vital signs :
temperature 97.8 , heart rate 107 , blood pressure 116/77 , respirations 20 .
His head , eyes , ears , nose , and throat exam reveals a normocephalic and atraumatic head .
His pupils were equal , round , reactive to light and accommodation , positive scleral icterus , intact extra ocular movements , and a supple neck .
Examination of the back reveals no costovertebral angle tenderness .
Examination of the chest reveals lungs which are clear to auscultation .
Cardiovascular exam reveals regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 and S2 , a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur heard best at the upper right sternal border , and a 1/6 decrescendo diastolic murmur heard best at Erb 's point , with no gallop or rub appreciated .
The abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended .
There are no palpable masses , and there is no shake tenderness .
There is a well-healed right subcostal scar , and a well-healed right paramedian scar .
Rectal examination is nontender , free of any palpable masses , and guaiac-negative stool .
Extremities :
no clubbing , cyanosis or edema .
Neurological examination is nonfocal .
LABORATORY DATA :
A panel of serum electrolytes is normal .
The white blood cell count is 7.3 , hematocrit 28.4 , platelets 586,000 .
Lymphocyte differential count shows 77% PMNs , 13% lymphocytes , 8% monocytes , and 1% basophils .
Alkaline phosphatase is 1,342 , lactacte dehydrogenase is 253 , and AST is 221 .
Total bilirubin is 10.7 , and direct bilirubin is 8.2 .
Total protein is 7.1 , and albumin is 2.1 .
Serum amylase is 43 .
Calcium is 8.2 , magnesium 1.8 , and phosphorous 3.1 .
X-ray examination of the chest reveals clear lungs and a normal heart .
KUB and upright abdominal x-rays revealed no obstruction or perforation , focal dilatation of small bowel in the right upper quadrants , and two calcified densities noted in the right upper quadrants , which may represent gall stones .
Ultrasonography of the right upper abdominal quadrant reveals a portal mass with calcification and possible invasion of the portal vein , thought to appear suspiciously similar to a hepatocellular carcinoma .
Intrahepatic biliary duct dilatation was noted proximal to the mass .
Electrocardiography reveals normal sinus rhythm , with non-specific ST and T-wave abnormalities in leads 2 , 3 , and AVF .
The axis and intervals are otherwise within normal limits .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital to the General Surgery Service of Dr. Lynea Moyduhe .
A modified upper GI x-ray series was obtained , which revealed malpositioning of the duodenum and jejunum in the right abdomen , consistent with intestinal malrotation , but no evidence of obstruction in the duodenum or jejunum was identified .
Therefore , the patient was prevented from taking anything by mouth and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was performed .
This study identified a 5 centimeter narrowed segment in the distal common bile duct , and moderately severe dilatation of the left biliary radicals in the right hepatic duct .
A temporary stent was placed , which seemed to function well despite its unsatisfactory positioning .
The patient tolerated the procedure well , and there were no complications .
He was returned to the Surgical Ward in stable condition .
Because of the probable malignant nature of the patient 's biliary obstruction , the patient was returned to the GI lab on 11/25/93 , where repeat endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was performed .
This procedure was performed under general anesthesia , and resulted in successful placement of a permanent stent within the distal common bile duct .
Additionally , a computer tomography guided needle biopsy was performed of the paraportal mass .
These procedures were well tolerated by the patient , and were free of complication .
As before , the patient was covered with post-procedure antibiotic therapy .
He was returned to the surgical ward in stable condition .
Preliminary report on the biopsy specimen at the time of this dictation describes the presence of acute and chronic inflammation , but no malignant cells .
However , two cytology specimens were both positive for malignant cells , the histopathologic characteristics of which suggest adenocarcinoma .
Following the permanent stent placement , the patient 's diet was slowly advanced .
His serum bilirubin levels and other liver function studies continued to normalize .
Because of his rapid progress , the resolution of his right upper quadrant pain , and the fact that no surgical therapy was indicated at this time , the patient was discharged to his group home on 11/29/93 .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
Improved .
DOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :
1 ) Discharged to group home ,
2 ) diet as tolerated ,
3 ) activity ad lib ,
4 ) followup with Dr. Moyduhe ,
5 )

SEVERE BLUNT ABDOMINAL TRAUMA .
Unsigned
DIS
Report Status :
Unsigned
ADMISSION DATE :
7-2-93
DISCHARGE DATE :
7-30-93
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Severe blunt abdominal trauma .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
1. Grade II / V laceration of liver ,
2. rupture of left renal vein ,
3. tear of transverse mesocolon ,
4. serosal tear of transverse colon ,
5. blunt fracture of the neck of the pancreas .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS AND HOSPITAL COURSE :
Mr. Breath was a 32 year old previously healthy unbelted driver whose car was hit at high speed by a vehicle driven by an intoxicated driver .
The patient was ejected and his vehicle rolled over , possibly over him .
He was found awake at the scene , complaining of abdominal pain .
He had a blood pressure of 60 systolic upon arrival of the Giles Min General Hospital crew .
Intravenous fluids was given .
He was paralyzed and endotracheally intubated , and a 14 gauge catheter was inserted in his left chest because of poor breath sounds .
He arrived at the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital at 02:30 with a blood pressure of 86 and a heart rate of 170 .
Large bore cannulas were inserted into the femoral veins , bilateral chest tubes were placed , and his blood pressure rose to 110 systolic after two liters of crystalloid .
He had an ecchymosis over the medial right costal margin and his abdomen was distended .
His hematocrit was 36 , and creatinine 1.6 .
The abdominal tap was grossly positive for blood .
His blood pressure fell to 60 systolic as he was being transferred to the computerized tomography scan table ; the scan was aborted and he was taken directly to the operating room at 03:00 .
At laparotomy , there was a liter of blood in the peritoneal cavity .
There was a class II laceration of the left liver at the falciform ligament which was actively bleeding , a tear of the transverse mesocolon from its base to the bowel wall with active bleeding , a 7 cm serosal tear of the adjacent transverse colon , and a large central retroperitoneal hematoma .
Control of the super-celiac aorta was obtained , and both left and right sided "" Mattox "" maneuvers were performed .
The retroperitoneum was opened , with vigorous bleeding resulting .
This was controlled , necessitating ten minutes of aortic clamping and found to have originated from the rupture of the left renal vein one centimeter from its junction with the inferior vena cava .
The vein was divided and suture ligated .
Bleeding from the liver was controlled with sutures .
The tears in the transverse mesocolon and colon serosa were repaired .
The examination of the remainder of the abdominal contents revealed no other injury ; in particular , the entire anterior surface and the immediately juxtaduodenal posterior surface of the pancreas were normal .
The patient was now very stable , and he was taken to the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit .
The patient had received ten units of packed red blood cells , five units of fresh frozen plasma , seven units of platelets , and nine liters of Ringer 's lactate .
An intracranial pressure monitoring bolt had been placed by the Neurosurgery Service staff during the laparotomy .
Intracranial pressures were normal .
That day , cranial computerized tomography scan and cervical spine films were normal .
An arch aortogram was normal .
Over the ensuing twenty-four hours , bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray with poor oxygenation and labile blood pressure requiring PA line guided fluid and pressors developed .
The patient had a large fluid requirement with total body capillary leak , decreasing SVR , oliguria unresponsive to Lasix / Mannitol accompanied by a rise in creatinine to 3.2 , worsening ARDS , a rise in temperature to 103 , and a serum amylase of 1265 .
He was returned to the operating room on July 4 .
Three liters of clear green fluid were found in the abdominal cavity .
Exploration of the pancreas revealed a posterior fracture a the superior mesenteric vessels .
Because of the intense diffuse inflammatory reaction that had already set in , it was decided that neither distal pancreatic resection nor Roux-en-Y drainage was feasible .
Four large flat Jackson-Pratt drains were placed , and gastrostomy , jejunostomy , and cholecystostomy tubes , as well as a right subclavian Quinton catheter were placed .
The patient 's hemodynamics had improved markedly with the evacuation of the peritoneal pancreatic fluid , so that he was no longer on pressors .
However , upon transfer from the operating room table to the RICU bed , he suffered a cardiac arrest , which upon investigation was a primary respiratory arrest ; the initial arterial blood gas was 32/88/6.92 .
He was successfully resuscitated after fifteen minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation and he was taken to the RICU .
Continuous venovenous hemodialysis was started on July 5 , and continued for most of the remainder of the patient 's course .
Vancomycin , Flagyl , and Aztreonam were given for gram negative Coccobacilli ( later identified as Bacteroides ) that had grown in his blood cultures and gram negative rods ( Enterobacter ) in his peritoneal fluid .
He was kept sedated and paralyzed because of his severe adult respiratory distress syndrome .
Total parenteral nutrition was started on July 5 .
Initial improvement was followed by recurrence of low SVR , high cardiac output , ongoing acidosis , requiring norepinephrine infusion in the 30 to 40 mcg per minute range ; drainage from the Jackson-Pratt drains were minimal despite irrigation and manipulation .
The patient was returned to the operating room on July 10 , where several loculated thin fluid collections were drained and obviously necrotic tissue was debrided .
It was decided to place more drains and pack the lesser sac with Adaptic and laparotomy pads .
The abdomen was left open , with the wound margins connected by a sheet of Marlex mesh to prevent evisceration .
He was returned to the operating room on July 12 , 13 , 16 , 19 , 21 , and 23 for packing change , irrigation and debridement .
Tracheostomy was also performed on July 17 .
There was severe diffuse peritonitis with intense inflammation , infection , and patchy necrosis of peritoneal surfaces and of the distal pancreas .
The subsequent overall course was a slow downhill one , with ongoing extreme hyperdynamic ( cardiac output 12 to 15 liters per minute ) and catabolic state .
On July 26 , abdominal irrigation and debridement was performed in the RICU ; this was repeated daily for the next three days .
On July 29 , the septic state with low SVR and acidosis accelerated beyond the control of maximal support .
His blood pressure gradually fell , and he died early on July 30 , 1993 .
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :
Severe blunt abdominal trauma with rupture of liver , left renal vein , pancreas , and transverse mesocolon .
SPECIAL PROCEDURES AND OPERATIONS :
1. 7-2-93 , emergency room exploratory laparotomy , repair of liver laceration , repair of torn transverse mesocolon , repair of serosal tear of transverse colon , ligation and division of ruptured left renal vein , exploration of pancreas ,
2. 7-4-93 , exploratory laparotomy , irrigation and debridement , pancreatic drainage placement , gastrostomy tube , jejunostomy , cholecystostomy , placement of right subclavian Quinton catheter ,

Report Status :
Unsigned
ADMISSION DATE :
Martin Luther King Day
DISCHARGE DATE :
01/22/93
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. Louplardkote is a 70 year old male who was admitted for coronary artery bypass grafting .
He has been followed by his local physician for heart block which has progressed and culminated in a DDD pacer being inserted 02/92 .
In March , 1993 he noted chest discomfort with exertion .
An exercise tolerance test and stress Thallium showed septal and anterior wall ischemia .
In October , 1993 the patient developed shortness of breath and orthopnea .
An echocardiogram at the time revealed left ventricular dilatation and septal dyskinesis .
The patient subsequently developed congestive heart failure which was treated with diuretics .
On 12/29 the patient underwent cardiac catheterization which revealed a right coronary artery that had serial stenosis , and left anterior descending artery that had a long complex proximal lesion and a circumflex which had its first obtuse marginal which was stenotic .
The left ventriculogram showed global hypokinesis and preserved left ventricular function with mitral valve prolapse without regurgitation .
The patient is thus admitted for coronary artery bypass grafting .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
1 ) hypercholesterolemia ,
2 ) arthritis ,
3 ) history of guaiac-positive stools with a lower gastrointestinal endoscopy negative three years ago ,
4 ) status post appendectomy .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Toprol XL 50 mg. po q.day , Ismo 20 mg. po bid , Lasix 40 mg. d , Lopid 600 mg. po bid , Questran 1 scoop po bid , nitroglycerin spray prn .
ALLERGIES :
no known drug allergies .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
His head , eyes , ears , nose , and throat exam was benign .
Cardiac exam revealed a normal S1 and S2 with a I-II / VI late systolic murmur radiating to the apex .
Lungs were clear .
Abdomen was benign .
Rectal :
guaiac negative , no lesions , smooth prostate .
Vascular exam ; 2+ pulses throughout bilaterally without bruits .
LABORATORY DATA :
On admission , chest x-ray revealed two nodular opacities that were projected over the left lung , one over the anterior aspect of the left fourth rib and the other over the interspace between the anterior sixth and seventh ribs .
These were also seen on previous film .
These were felt to be consistent with a granulomata .
There was also a bipolar pacemaker present .
Creatinine was 0.9 , BUN 13 , hematocrit was 40 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the hospital on 01/15/93 and on the following day was taken to the operating room where he underwent a saphenous coronary artery bypass graft to the diagonal , circumflex marginal artery , and acute marginal coronary artery and left internal mammary artery graft to the left anterior descending coronary artery .
This operation was performed by Dr. Chitllik Kote .
Intraoperative findings were as follows :
The pericardium was opened to reveal a heart that appeared essentially normal .
The diagonal coronary artery was isolated , opened and probed with a 1.5 millimeter probe .
The circumflex marginal artery was small and only took a 1 millimeter probe tightly .
The first main was anastomosed side to side to the diagonal and end to end to the circumflex marginal artery .
The left anterior descending artery was then isolated , opened , probed with a 1.5 millimeter probe and anastomosed to the left internal mammary artery .
The acute marginal branch of the right coronary artery was isolated , opened and probed with a 1.5 millimeter probe tightly and a second main was anastomosed to this .
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transported to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit in stable condition on nitroglycerin at 50 mcg. per minute Levophed at 4 mcg. per minute and Lidocaine at 1 mg. r minute .
The patient was extubated on postoperative day # 1 and transported to the routine postoperative care floor on postoperative day # 2 in good condition .
The only issue of note during the patient 's SICU course was a small right apical pneumothorax which disappeared on repeat chest x-ray .
The other issue was that the Pacer Lab was consulted for an atrial sensing problem .
The pace setter 2022 Synchrony II was interrogated .
It was found to have inadequate atrial sensing , even post re-programming to the maximum sensitivity at 0.5 millivolts .
No changes with unipolar ring or tip .
The V threshhold was changed from 0.6 millivolts/ 2.0 millivolts to 0.8 millivolts/ 4.0 millivolts .
The V sensor was changed from 4 millivolts to 2 millivolts .
It was felt that the atrial pacing would improve as the edema resolved .
Meanwhile , the patient was AV paced using the epicardial wires .
While on the routine postoperative care floor the patient continued to progress well .
Of note , he developed a small right apical pneumothorax which was followed on serial films and found to be stable and was not causing the patient any respiratory distress .
Also , the Pacer Service re-programmed the patient 's cardiac pacer to a VVIR mode with a rate of 60 beats per minute , an AV delay of 175 , a maximum track of 120 .
The ventricular pulse configuration was bipolar with a V-pulse width of .8 , a V-pulse amplitude of 4.0 , a V-sense configuration of bipolar , a V-sensitivity of 2.0 and a V-refractory of 250 .
The atrial pulse configuration was bipolar with an A-pulse width of .4 , an A-pulse amplitude of 2.5 , an A-sensed configuration that was bipolar , an A-sensitivity that was .5 , an A-refractory that was 325 .
Blanking was set at 38 , AV-safety option was on enable , PVC options were on , PMT options were off , a rate respiratory AV-delay was on enable , a magnet was temporary off .
The threshhold was 2.0 .
The measured average sensor was 2.0 .
The slope was 8 .
The maximum sensory rate was 110 .
The reaction time was fast , the recovery time was medium .
The patient continued to progress well and was ultimately discharged on 01/22/93 in good condition .

There were two large mediastinal nodes and needle biopsy of the left lobe lesion was non-diagnostic .
She was referred for tissue diagnosis and on 1/13/94 was brought to the operating room .
She underwent flexible bronchoscopy with mediastinoscopy .
These were negative for tumor and a mini left thoracotomy was performed with pleural biopsy .
Intraoperatively there was a large emphysematous portion of the left lung which prohibited her left lower lobe to fully expand .
It was decided to perform reduction pneumoplasty .
This proceeded uneventfully .
She was extubated and stable with a good airway and good oxygen saturation .
However , upon transferring her from the operating room bed to the stretcher she had an arrest .
This appeared to be respiratory in origin .
She was placed back on the operating room table and cardiopulmonary resuscitation was begun .
Pressors were given and she quickly responded with a return in blood pressure and heart rate .
Her blood pressure remained unstable requiring large amounts of pressors .
X-rays showed no pneumothorax and there was no bleeding from her chest tubes .
She was therefore transferred up to the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit .
Early in her postoperative course her pulmonary artery pressures were quite high , 70/30 .
Her wedge pressure was 20 and there were no electrocardiogram changes .
She ruled out for myocardial infarction .
She developed a picture consistent with right heart failure with pulmonary hypertension and require nitric oxide administration .
This improved her right heart function with lower PA pressures .
She developed a right pleural effusion which required chest tube placement to remove 1200 ccs of straw-colored fluid .
She remained fully ventilated with marginal hemodynamic status on Levophed , dobutamine and nitric oxide .
Ultimately she was able to be weaned off of her Levophed as well as her nitric oxide .
However , because of persistent episodes of right heart failure , dobutamine was started .
This improved her cardiac function .
She failed to wean from the ventilator and on 2/14/94 was brought to the operating room for a tracheostomy .
She had a complicated course from an Infectious Disease standpoint with multiple positive cultures including sputum positive for Pseudomonas cepacia , blood cultures which were positive for Streptococcus milleri .
The right pleural fluid was also positive for Streptococcus milleri .
She had Citrobacter from her sinuses with evidence of sinusitis .
She was treated with multiple courses of broad spectrum antibiotics .
Given her protracted postoperative course the family uniformly decided to withdraw all support and initiate comfort measures only .
This was discussed with the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit staff .
Her support was withdrawn and she expired on 2/17/94 at 9:00 p.m.
The patient 's family was notified .

Unsigned
ADMISSION DATE :
5/13/94
DISCHARGE DATE :
5/16/94
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Hypopharyngeal cancer .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
Removal of left neck lymph node and esophageal endoscopy and dilation .
HISTORY AND REASON FOR ADMISSION :
This is a 69 year-old white male status post surgery in July of 1993 for a laryngopharyngoesophagogastrectomy with gastric reconstruction and modified right neck dissection for pharyngeal cancer .
Since that surgery , the patient has had dysphagia off and on , solids worse than liquids .
Sometimes solids get stuck for about 10 minutes .
About two months ago the patient had come to the emergency room because he couldn 't swallow for three days .
He required esophageal dilation .
Also , since July the patient has noted bilateral lymphadenopathy , especially the large submandibular , which has gotten larger .
It is difficult to get an exact history as to the onset of the lymphadenopathy , as the patient cannot vocalize and is intoxicated at the time of admission .
The lymphadenopathy is uncomfortable but not painful .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Significant for radiation therapy after his surgery in July , a tracheoesophageal fistula , which was repaired , exploratory laparotomy in November , 1994 , for small bowel obstruction , hypertension , colitis , neonatal jaundice , and on September 1 , 1993 , drainage of a neck abscess .
He underwent closure of pharyngeal cutaneous fistula with muscle interposition on November 5 , 1994 , and a left upper lobectomy in September , 1993 , for lung cancer .
ALLERGIES :
Aspirin .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
None .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
Notable for heavy alcohol use and history of heavy tobacco use , although he quit two years ago .
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS :
No fevers or chills , no nightsweats .
Positive weight gain since his last admission , positive diarrhea times two weeks-soft brown stools .
Negative bright red blood per rectum , negative coughing , negative hemoptysis , negative hematemesis , negative chest pain , positive shortness of breath with exertion .
The patient can walk or go up a flight of stairs without any shortness of breath , however .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient was a pleasant , mildly intoxicated male with grossly swollen neck .
He was afebrile with stable vital signs .
Head , eyes , ears , nose , throat :
normocephalic , atraumatic , pupils equal , regular and reactive to light and accommodation , extra ocular muscles intact .
Tongue with multiple white-yellow lesions .
Neck grossly swollen at the midline and right angle with jaw , unable to fully swallow .
The lungs were clear to auscultation .
Heart :
regular rate and rhythm .
The abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended , positive bowel sounds .
Extremities without clubbing , cyanosis or edema .
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN :
This 69 year-old male status post laryngopharyngo-esophagogastrectomy for cancer in 05/93 now represents with progressive dysphagia and gross lymphadenopathy and neck mass .
The patient is mildly intoxicated .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was given overnight hydration .
He was taken to the operating room on May 14 , 1994 , for a bronchoscopy and esophagoscopy , dilatation and biopsy .
His left neck mass was excised and preliminarily was said to be squamous cell carcinoma .
The patient had esophagoscopy , where a stenosis was noted which was dilated to a # 49 French catheter .
There were no complications .
The patient was taken to the floor in stable condition .
Postoperatively , there was no crepitus and X-rays showed no mediastinal air .
Neck biopsy site was clean .
On May 15 , the patient 's diet was advanced to a soft diet and then later in the day to a regular diet .
Radiation Oncology was consulted and it was determined that Mr. Douet still had room for more palliative radiation therapy of his neck , and he arranged an appointment with Dr. Wires on Tuesday following discharge .
Dr. Wires 's telephone number is 526-6508 .
On May 16 , the patient was tolerating PO well , his lungs were clear , and he was discharged to home in stable condition .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
None .
FOLLOW-UP :
The patient will follow up with Dr. Wires and Dr. Caslighlourdes .

DISCHARGE SUMMARY NAME :
RATA GIVEN ,
UNIT NUMBER :
126-10-12
ADMISSION DATE :
06/13/94
DISCHARGE DATE :
07/01/94
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Cardiogenic shock .
OTHER DIAGNOSES :
1 ) Coronary artery disease .
2 ) Atrial fibrillation .
3 ) Acute renal failure .
4 ) Crohn 's disease .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
6/13/94 :
Intra-aortic balloon placement .
6/17/94 :
Intubation .
Hemodialysis .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 56-year-old man with a history of ischemic disease transferred to the FIH for further care for cardiogenic shock .
Mr. Given had an anterior myocardial infarction in 1981 .
He had inferior myocardial infarction in February 1992 .
His course was complicated at that time by hypertension and an echocardiogram showed an LV ejection fraction of 0.10 to 0.15 .
In August , 1993 he had an out of hospital cardiac arrest .
He rule in for another myocardial infarction at that time .
He was transferred to the FIH where he underwent a work up of both his arrhythmia and his heart failure .
An automatic implantable defibrillator was placed .
He was thought to be a good candidate for a transplant at that time as coronary arteriography showed diffuse disease in the LAD and right coronary arteries as well as a proximal circumflex stenosis .
Because of the diffuse nature of the disease and the left ventricular dysfunction , Mr. Given was thought not to be a revascularization candidate and was listed for a transplant .
Mr. Given waited as an outpatient for the availability of a donor heart .
He was admitted to the hospital in late April with multiple episodes of bloody diarrhea .
Colonoscopy demonstrated severe Crohn 's disease with sparing of the rectum .
A perirectal fistula was seen .
Treatment with IV corticosteroids led to improvement and Mr. Given was discharged from the hospital ten days ago .
On the evening of April 22nd , Mr. Given developed progressively worsening dyspnea .
He presented to the Iming Medical Center emergency room on the morning of April 22nd with hypertension and dyspnea .
He was given intravenous fluid to support his blood pressure and developed pulmonary edema and was intubated .
Hypertension continued and an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed .
He is now being transferred to the FIH for further treatment .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Physical examination on transfer was remarkable for a blood pressure of 80/56 and a heart rate of 124 .
His CVP was 16 .
He was on the balloon pump at the time .
His chest was clear anteriorly .
His cardiac exam was remarkable for a summation gallop .
No murmur was auscultated but the high heart rate did diminish the possibility of this .
His abdomen was soft and he had no extremity edema .
His feet were cool but there were pedal pulses bilaterally .
LABORATORY DATA :
Admission laboratory studies included a hematocrit of 34.3 and a white count of 25,700 .
The sodium was 126 , the BUN 80 and a creatinine of 4.6 .
Electrocardiogram revealed a sinus tachycardia with an intraventricular conduction defect .
There were inferior Q waves consistent with an old infarct .
The chest x-ray revealed mild pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Mr. Given was admitted to the hospital and it was hoped that his end organ dysfunction would improve with a period of ballooning and improved perfusion such as to allow transplantation to eventually take place .
He was maintained on Levophed as a vasopressor as well as dopamine and dobutamine .
It was noted that his intra-aortic balloon pump was only a 30 ml pump , and on the day after admission , Mr. Given was taken to the catheterization laboratory where this was exchanged for a 40 ml pump .
After replacement of the intra-aortic balloon pump , Mr. Given remained critically ill , although there was some improvement in his augmented diastolic pressure .
He did develop atrial fibrillation , however , which led to hemodynamic decompensation with a wedge pressure of 32 and a cardiac index of 1.6 .
It was hoped that with continued inotropic support this would improve .
He also remained intubated .
Mr. Given was seen by Dr. Farstshuff of the GI Service for advice regarding his Crohn 's disease .
All of these issues , including his acute renal failure , were thought to be contraindications to transplantation .
As Mr. Given did not have any bowel sounds , he did have to remain on nasogastric suction .
He was seen in consultation by Dr. Needs of the Renal Unit .
Dr. Needs felt that the patient had had ischemic acute tubular necrosis and that we could continue to administer diuretics in a an effort to take off volume , but that we did have to allow time to pass in order to see improvement .
Procainamide was begun in an effort to convert Mr. Given to sinus rhythm from atrial fibrillation .
Initially he was in and out of sinus rhythm , but paroxysmal atrial fibrillation did occur frequently .
As Mr. Given 's renal function did not improve , he was begun on continuous venovenous hemodialysis .
This resulted in a reasonable clearance of creatinine .
He was able to get some fluid off as well .
With getting some volume off , the patient 's ventilation improved , as did many of his other metabolic parameters .
His cardiac index had also improved with this to 2.7 , although he was on dobutamine as well .
On 6/19 an effort was made to attempt to wean the intra-aortic balloon pump .
With a decrease in the counterpulsation ration , he developed atrial flutter with a fall in blood pressure and cardiac index .
The balloon pump was restored .
He was continued on this as well as on dobutamine and amrinone support .
He continued on hemodialysis , but had little urine output .
Supportive care continued .
Unfortunately , the white blood count began rising , raising the possibility of sepsis .
Broad spectrum antibiotics to cover potential sources in the gastrointestinal tract were begun and ciprofloxacin was added .
Mr. Given 's blood pressure appeared to stabilize .
Another effort was made on 6/22 to attempt to wean the balloon , but this led to an increase in his wedge pressure and a fall in his arterial pressure , and this was stopped and he was restored to full counterpulsation .
He had been able to be transiently extubated after dialysis had reduced his lung water , but he had to be reintubated on 6/24 .
Hemodialysis continued with maintenance of reasonable metabolic parameters .
He did develop worsening metabolic acidosis .
His hemodialysis was adjusted in an effort to resolve this .
He continued on vancomycin , ciprofloxacin , Zosyn , and fluconazole antibiotics .
Another effort was made to attempt to wean the intra-aortic balloon pump on 6/26 .
This resulted in a fall in his cardiac index , but his blood pressure and wedge pressure were stable .
He did have runs of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia .
On 6/29 Mr. Given began developing periods of hypotension .
The patient stated that he did not want to be reintubated , as it became quite clear that he would not be a transplant candidate .
He began having multiple runs of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia .
The patient and his significant friend , Incloztaua , had a long discussion with his physicians and they felt that , given the futility of his situation , supportive care should be ended .
Indicative of this , Mr. Given took his oxygen mask and demanded that it not be replaced .
He developed progressive hypotension and was pronounced dead early on the morning of 7/1 .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient was a 71 year old white female with a history of carcinoid lung cancer who presented for evaluation of a tracheoesophageal fistula .
The patient was initially diagnosed in 1978 with atypical small cell carcinoma of the lung and treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy until 1980 .
She did well for approximately twelve years until she was diagnosed with carcinoid cancer of the same right upper lobe .
This may have been the initial primary cancer although it is unclear at present .
Bronchoscopy at that time showed an endobronchial tumor of the right upper lobe bronchus and it was felt to be unresectable .
She underwent four treatments of brachytherapy in March through May of 1993 .
She had been doing reasonably well until December of 1993 when she presented with persistent and worsening cough and near strangulation on attempts at eating solids or drinking liquids .
A bronchoscopy showed a tracheoesophageal fistula with an opening into the trachea above the carina and no tumor in the right upper lobe .
She has been on total parenteral nutrition and has been nothing by mouth since then .
A barium swallow prior to admission showed the presence of a tracheoesophageal fistula with entrance into the right mainstem bronchus below the carina .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Bronchitis , asthma , carcinoid cancer , no history of coronary artery disease or cerebrovascular accident .
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :
The patient is status post appendectomy , hysterectomy and right salpingo-oophorectomy , bladder suspension and a tumor removal from the right neck .

ALLERGIES :
The patient is allergic to penicillin , morphine , codeine .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient is a pleasant white female in no acute distress .
She is afebrile with stable vital signs .
The head , eyes , ears , nose , throat examination was unremarkable .
Neck shows a well healed low collar incision without adenopathy or bruit .
The lungs showed mild inspiratory wheeze and moderate expiratory wheezes .
Breath sounds are present bilaterally .
Cardiovascular exam :
regular rate and rhythm .
The abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended .
Extremities :
no clubbing , cyanosis or edema .
The rectal examination is guaiac negative with a minimal amount of stool .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted on February 5 , 1994 and had a central venous line placed in her right subclavian .
The patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 6 , 1994 where she underwent rigid and flexible bronchoscopy and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy .
Findings included necrotic debris in the distal trachea at the carina and right mainstem bronchus .
Esophageal mucosa was visible through the trachea .
Her steroids were weaned and the patient was brought to the Operating Room on February 10 , 1994 where she underwent once again flexible bronchoscopy and flexible esophagoscopy , as well as rigid bronchoscopy .
She then had a transhiatal esophagectomy which was partial , and a substernal gastric interposition as well as a jejunostomy .
The pathology report suggested that the area was involved with radiation esophagitis and focal ulceration .
She remained ventilator dependent postoperatively and was taken to the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit .
The patient was maintained on triple antibiotics which included Vancomycin , ceftazidime and Gentamicin .
On postoperative day two , she had an electroencephalogram which showed no evidence of seizure activity but some generalized slowing .
The patient was seen in consultation by the Neurology Service for her apparent postoperative encephalopathy and episodes of shaking .
An endoscopy was also performed on postoperative day two which showed clean anastomosis .
She received multiple bronchoscopies for pulmonary toilet .
The patient was maintained on tube feedings and the ventilator .
A repeat echocardiogram on February 18 showed no significant change of her previous echocardiogram on February 11 , which showed only a small pericardial effusion .
A pelvic and abdominal computerized tomography scan on February 18 also showed no evidence of a focal collection or abscess .
She remained intermittently febrile despite numerous antibiotics .
Her chest X-ray showed bilateral air space disease , consistent with pneumonia or adult respiratory distress syndrome .
She suffered an episode of renal failure which was felt attributable to aminoglycoside toxicity .
Her steroids were weaned .
Because of her prolonged intubation and inability to wean , on February 24 , 1994 , she had a tracheostomy placed .
She remained in a coma .
The blood cultures on February 26 , 1994 grew out Staphylococcus and she was treated for septicemia .
Her sputum grew out Pseudomonas aeruginosa as well .
The urine contained yeast and she was treated with amphotericin .
On March 3 , 1994 , a repeat chest and abdominal and pelvis computerized tomography scan showed no evidence of fluid collections .
There was a large left pleural effusion however .
This was drained with a left chest tube .
Her sputum then grew out Klebsiella and she was treated with amikacin and imipenem .
She developed a right pleural effusion and had a right chest tube placed .
On March 13 , 1994 , she regained some level of consciousness .
She was able to fix and follow with her eyes , respond to commands .
On March 14 , 1994 , her right lung was pleurodesed .
Attempts were made to facilitate her wean by resting her overnight with a combination of propafol and Fentanyl .
This was tried for approximately seven days with no real progress made toward facilitating her vent wean .
She continued to require pressor support in the high 30 's .
She also fell into a coma once again .
On March 31 , 1994 , her pressor support requirement increased and she continued to have tachypneic episodes .
On April 2 , 1994 , she had several episodes of bradycardia and asystole , which responded only to manual ventilation .
Discussions were held with the patient 's family with regard to her previously expressed wishes not to be maintained on artificial life support for extended period of time with little or no hope for recovery .
She had expressed these wishes in writing on several legal forms from the state of Jose Pineston , as well as in discussions with her loved ones .
Decision was made in conjunction with the family and Dr. Caslighlourdes to terminate artificial respiratory support .
The patient was removed from the ventilator and placed on a T-piece in her trachea only and was made comfortable with narcotics .
Her respirations ceased and she died at 10:15 a.m. on April 2 , 1994 .
DISPOSITION / PLAN ON DISCHARGE :
The family will return the body to Sa for burial .
They have declined a post-mortem examination .

HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital , on the Neurological Surgery Service of Lupevickette L. Ca , M.D.
Prior to his admission , the patient 's gunshot wound was sutured close in the emergency room .
The patient was placed on suicide precautions , and was hydrated with an infusion of intravenous fluid .
The patient was seen in consultation by the Psychiatry Service , who began a battery of testing , which continues at the time of discharge .
The Consulting Psychiatrist recommended a minimum of 2 point restraints at all times , and recommended the patient be monitored by a sitter .
Allowing the patient to ambulate was not recommended .
From a medical standpoint , the patient did well .
He was initially admitted to the Neurological Intensive Care Unit where he was closely monitored during the first two days of his hospitalization .
The chief obstacle was bringing his blood pressure under control and this was ultimately achieved with a combination of Captopril and Nifedipine .
After his blood pressure had stabilized , the patient was transferred to the Neurology Ward .
Close monitoring demonstrated his blood pressure to be stable and within an acceptable rang on his dosage regimen .
The Psychiatry Service followed up extensively with the patient , and his Psychiatric progress is detailed in the Psychiatry transfer note .
By the 7th hospital day , the patient was medically stable .
He had undergone full Psychiatric evaluation , and was prepared for transfer to a Psychiatric Hospital .
Therefore , because of his need for intense psychiatric care , the patient is discharged to the Vo Black Doylestrictshore Ft. Clinics Medical Center on the 7th hospital day .

DISCHARGE SUMMARY NAME :
BREUNCA , AREU T
UNIT NUMBER :
961-88-20
ADMISSION DATE :
12/20/2002
DISCHARGE DATE :
12/26/2002
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
AV nodal re-entrant tachycardia ( AVNRT ) .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSES :
1. AV conduction tissue disease .
2. Coronary artery disease .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
Radiofrequency ablation of the slow pathway and permanent pacemaker implantation .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Patient is an 82-year-old male with a past medical history significant for coronary artery disease ( status-post PCI of the RCA one week ago ) , history of peripheral vascular disease and preserved LV function with history of nonsustained VT .
He was transferred from an outside hospital for further investigation and management of his recent arrhythmic problem .
He was noted by the cardiologist to complain of some malaise with no complaints of weakness and malaise .
He also complained of mild palpitations and syncope .
At the time of his visit to his cardiologist 's office , he was noted to be in tachycardia which was found to be a junctional tachycardia , treated with carotid sinus massage , breaking into sinus bradycardia .
In the setting of the sinus bradycardia , he had a very prolonged PR interval and happened to be on sotalol which was subsequently discontinued .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Ecotrin ; Lipitor ; Cardura ; Plavix ; Lasix ; Cozaar ; Procardia .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
He was comfortable , afebrile with a heart rate of 60 beat / min and a blood pressure of 100/70 , respirations 18 .
JVP was not raised .
His cardiac exam revealed a fourth heart sounds , normal S1 , S2 and an ejection systolic murmur at the base of the heart .
His abdominal examination was benign .
Lungs were clear .
His EKG at the time of presentation showed evidence of sinus bradycardia , prolonged PR interval at 100-500 ms and evidence of Wenckebach .
His EKG also showed evidence of atrial echo beats and evidence of a slow AV nodal re-entrant tachycardia .
IMPRESSION :
Patient is an 82-year-old gentleman with a history of coronary artery disease and peripheral vascular disease with evidence of intrinsic conduction tissue disease who presented with an AVNRT .
He was admitted with the idea of having electrophysiology study to determine the exact mechanism of his tachycardia and subsequently undergo radiofrequency ablation .
It was also felt that because of his underlying conduction tissue disease , he would benefit from having a permanent pacemaker implanted .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient had his electrophysiology study on 12/23/2002 .
His baseline tracings showed evidence of a high AV block with AV Wenckebach at 550 ms.
He had evidence of AVNRT , typical slow-fast variant which was easily inducible .
Two radiofrequency ablations at the slow pathway terminated the tachycardia .
The patient was not inducible for tachycardia at the end of the procedure .
The procedure was well tolerated , and he was transferred back to the step-down unit for further monitoring .
On the next morning of 12/26/2002 , the patient had a dual chamber permanent pacemaker implanted .
This was a Medtronic Sigma SDR 303 type pacemaker .
His atrial and ventricular lead were both bipolar .
The atrial measurements were as follows :
amplitude 5.6 to 8 mV , outflow threshold of 0.5 volts at 0.4 ms , evidence for lead impedance of 450 ohm .
His ventricular measurements were as follows :
RV amplitude of greater than 15.68 , output threshold of 0.5 volts at 0.5 ms and impedance of 680 ohm .
The patient was kept overnight for further monitoring .
Noninvasive pacemaker evaluation on 12/26/2002 showed optimal sensing and capture thresholds of both the atrial and ventricular leads .
A chest x-ray prior to discharge showed adequate position of the atrial and ventricular leads .
Of note , there was a coincidental finding of a small solitary pulmonary nodule on his chest x-ray , and the patient has been advised regarding obtaining a CAT scan after discharge to follow up on this .
After discussions with the patient and his family , they preferred having the CAT scan performed at the hospital closer to their residence so that it could be sequentially followed up with serial CAT scans if there was a need for the same .
The patient will follow up with his cardiologist as well as his primary care physician in the outpatient setting .
He has also been given a follow-up appointment with the pacemaker clinic .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
His medications at the time of discharge essentially remain the same .
He is being discharged on :
1. Lipitor 20 mg p.o. q.d.
2. Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d.
3. Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.d.
4. Cozaar 100 mg p.o. q.d.
5. Procardia 60 mg p.o. q.d.
6. Cardura 5 mg p.o. q.d.
7. Isordil 20 mg p.o. t.i.d.
8. Detrol 5 mg p.o. t.i.d.
9. Atenolol 25 mg p.o. q.d.

Chest x-ray increased opacity in the left lower lobe which likely represents pneumonia and / or pleural effusion .
There was a superimposed radiolucency in this region as well which may also represent a hiatal hernia .
When the patient 's condition permit PA and lateral view of the chest is recommended to exclude pleural effusion and further evaluate the presence of a hiatal hernia .
The patient had a followup chest x-ray on 8/5/98 that showed low lung volumes with a vague opacity in the right upper lobe that may be artifactual related to the cardiac electrode .
A repeat chest x-ray is advised .
There is a large overall density with an air fluid level in the left lower zone posteriorly that is likely a hiatal hernia .
There are also displaced fractures of the left 8th , 9th and 10th ribs .
Head computer tomogram showed no evidenced of intracerebral hemorrhage , acute large vessel territorial infarction or mass effect .
There were nonspecific low attention white matter T2 changes most likely secondary to small vessel disease .

His electrocardiogram was normal sinus rhythm at 90 with normal axis and slightly widened QRS at .14 seconds and Qs inferiorly in II , III and aVF .
There were no acute ST-T wave changes .
SUMMARY :
In summary , this an 81 year old gentleman with a significant cardiac history and alcohol history who presented to Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital with loss of consciousness , who had a tox screen and a negative head computer tomogram who likely is suffering from an alcohol related fall versus syncope .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
He was admitted to Lyjoneshutchepawalt Cleod Exre Hospital for observation .
It was felt that he should be ruled out for an myocardial infarction given his cardiac history and was placed in two point restraints .
When the patient came to the floor he was angry and upset about admitted to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital instead of the Bridges Hospital and was somewhat combative .
He admitted to drinking 1 pint or so of alcohol not every day but the last drink was the night prior to admission to Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital and he had a couple of glasses of wine .
He was quite confused in relaying the history and very tangential in his replies .
He says he was out to lunch some friends to eat pizza at a restaurant on Valemin .
He decided to go to the basemen so they could eat in privacy when he was hit over the head by police with a gun and lost consciousness at the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital Emergency Ward .
He was quite paranoid , agitated and delusional during an interview and there is no evidence to support the patient 's history and recall of events leading to the hospitalization .
Hospital course by system .
1. NEUROLOGICALLY :
The patient is completely alert , awake and oriented x 3 .
The patient shows no evidence of alcohol withdrawal although he was prophylactically treated with Ativan and was given multivitamins , thiamine and folate .
Psychiatry saw the patient and felt that he was suffering from alcohol related syndrome versus some component of pugilist brain given the fact that he was a boxer in the past .
They felt that there was no acute psychiatric issue at hand .
2. CARDIOVASCULAR :
The patient ruled out for an myocardial infarction with peak creatinine phosphokinase of 350 and flat isoenzymes .
He deserves a full syncope as an inpatient and is stable for transfer from a cardiovascular standpoint .
This will be pursued at the Bridges Hospital .
He is maintained on his antihypertensive of Lisinopril and his anti-hyperlipidemic of Gemfibrozil and gets an aspirin .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
Good .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
1. Aspirin 325 mg per day .
2. Gemfibrozil 600 mg twice a day .
3. Lisinopril 20 mg per day .
4. Oral thiamine 100 mg per day .
5. Folate 1 tab per day .
6. Multivitamins 1 tab per day .
7. Ativan 2 mg q 1-2 tabs po as needed .
FOLLOWUP :
The patient will be transferred to the Bridges Hospital on 8/6/98 and will followup with Dr. Chpo Night at the Bridges Hospital .

These nodules are confirmed by chest CT and demonstrated to be smaller than 3 millimeter peripheral nodules appearing in both lung apices .
The CT also demonstrated questionable right hepatic hemangioma and multiple tubular hypodensities were hepatic veins should be .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
Because of the extensiveness of Ms. Abreun 's hospital course it will be organized by system :
1. Neurological :
On admission the patient was intubated and sedated .
Her sedation was gradually weaned during her first month in the Intensive Care Unit and she was noted to have an underlying depression and history of obsessive compulsive disorder as listed from the patient and her family .
A psychiatric evaluation was obtained and she was placed on Paxil at 5 milligrams which was gradually increased to a total of 20 milligrams po q day at the time of her admission .
On August 29th , Ms. Abreun again required sedation when she found apneic and hypotensive .
She spent several days in the Intensive Care Unit at that time , during which her sedation was gradually weaned back to off .
2. Pulmonary :
Ms. Abreun was admitted , sedated and on a respirator , requiring minimal settings with a pressure support of 10 and a pep of 5 .
After two weeks of intubation on July 25th the patient went to the operating room for a tracheostomy which she tolerated without issue .
Over the next several weeks , the ventilatory support was gradually weaned to off .
By August 9th she was tolerating trach mask trials and was on the verge of tracheostomy removal by August 29th .
At this time , she had a sudden episode of respiratory distress accompanied by hypotension and unresponsiveness .
She was bag masked and taken immediately to the Intensive Care Unit where she was placed on respiratory support with SIMV settings which were gradually weaned over the course of her ten days in the Intensive Care Unit .
After her wean from the respiratory , she was transferred back to the floor and over the next several days tolerated trach mask trials admirably and had her tracheostomy removed on September 16th , 1998 .
At the time of her discharge , she had no acute respiratory issues .
3. Cardiovascular :
Ms. Abreun was admitted on cardiac support requiring 30 of Neo-Synephrine .
She was placed on a Swan Gans catheter monitor and gradually weaned off the Neo-Synephrine by the 22nd of July .
She required no further support and had no further issues until August 29th when she had her respiratory crisis and was transferred to the unit .
At this time her dramatic pressure drop required Dopamine support at levels of 500 micrograms per minute .
A Swan Gans catheter floated at this time demonstrated an SVR of 500 .
She was supported with Dopamine and with fluid and was slow to come off the Dopamine requiring approximately 8 to 10 days for full weaning .
After the wean she required no further cardiac medication and had no further issues .
4. Renal :
Ms. Abreun 's fluid management was an important contributor to her hospital course .
She presented with massive ascites and anasarca for which she received large volume diuresis with regular Lasix dosing daily .
Renal parameters were normal until the time of her respiratory cardiovascular crisis on August 29th .
At this time , it was noted that her bun jumped to levels of approximately 80 , while her creatinine stayed at levels of .6 to .7 .
An elevation by Dr. Freiermthalskush of renal medicine at first suspected a subclinical congestive heart failure as being responsible for a prerenal azotemia , however on further elucidation of the patient 's course , it is evident that a broad sepsis caused by her pneumonia was responsible for her decreased SVR and eventual renal hypoperfusion .
Her azotemia responded readily to pressor support and fluid resuscitation .
At the end of her second Intensive Care Unit admission , her bun and creatinine had resolved to normal values .
5. Gastrointestinal :
Ms. Abreun was admitted nothing by mouth , intubated on intravenous fluids alone .
She was immediately begun on total parenteral nutrition therapy for what would be a prolonged course without PO intake .
On July 25th a G tube was placed and feeds were begun gradually .
These G tube feeds were gradually increased with a total parenteral nutrition wean , however at the time of her re-admission to the Intensive Care Unit on August 29th aspiration was suspected and all tube feeds were held .
She was maintained on total parenteral nutrition for the course of her time in the Intensive Care Unit .
At the end of this time , she was begun gradually on G tube feeding , however she was able to tolerate only very small volumes and produce large aspirates .
This problem had remained and been ongoing for the remainder of her hospital at Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital .
She is currently being supported on tube feeds of Vivonex at a rate of approximately 20 and hour with aspirates being measured q 4 hours and measuring from 30 to 250 regularly .
She has also been supplemented with Glutamine 10 grams b.i.d. via the G tube in hopes of reviving what most certainly be her gut atrophy from prolonged disuse .
Ms. Abreun , from the onset of her stay at Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital demonstrated elevated alkaline phosphatase levels in isolation from her other liver function tests .
These values ranging as high as 2300 were evaluated by gastrointestinal consult who came and performed and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography which demonstrated a normal biliary system with diameters on the large end of normal .
Stone was demonstrated in the gallbladder , but there was no evidence of obstruction and the study was ready as normal .
5 'nucleotidase values have also been elevated ranging from 150 to 180 .
To date there has been no satisfactory explanation for these elevations in alkaline phosphatase and 5 'nucleotidase and all associated studies have been negative .
Further evaluation of this during her later hospital stay or as an outpatient .
6. Infectious disease :
Ms. Abreun underwent a work up for tuberculosis at the beginning of her hospital course .
She ruled out by PPD .
The initial management of her necrotizing fascitis was empiric with Imipenem , Flagyl and Vancomycin .
Because of the extent of her wound , she was also treated with hyperbaric oxygen which was of some benefit in resolving her infection .
The course of Flagyl , Imipenem and Vancomycin was continued for fourteen days .
At this time Imipenem were discontinued and Vancomycin was maintained alone for additional several days .
She then went without antibiotic therapy for a period of several weeks until her crisis of August 29th .
ON admission to the unit , she was begun on triple antibiotic therapy with Levo / Vanc/Flagyl .
Shortly thereafter Gentamicin was added to the regimen which was maintained for a period of one week until cultures came back and her therapy could be stream lined to Vancomycin , Levofloxacin alone .
After a ten day course of Levofloxacin it was discontinued , Vancomycin was maintained for five additional days , after which time , it was discontinued as well and she was without antibiotics .
On discharge , she was currently taking no antibiotics .
Ms. Abreun entered the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital having taking only oral hypoglycemic agents for control of her diabetes .
Because of the stress of her infection and Intensive Care Unit admission she was requiring sliding scale Insulin for the full course of her hospital stay .
Her total parenteral nutrition was also supplemented with Insulin NPH for better control .
Her total parenteral nutrition is currently supplemented with 30 units NPH q day and she is on a sliding scale to control the remainder of her sugars .
Ms. Abreun 's hypothyroidism diagnosed shortly before her admission was an important aspect of her therapy during her course at Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital .
Her thyroid necessity was poorly controlled with a Synthroid dose of 0.125 milligrams for the majority of her stay .
At the time of her admission to the Intensive Care Unit on August 29th it was noted that she had a thyroid stimulating hormone that was dramatically raised to a value of 26.83 .
More active supplementation was performed increasing her dose to .3 milligrams q day , which caused a rapid resolution of her thyroid studies and an improvement in her physiology almost immediately .
She has since been maintained on a dose of 0.2 milligrams IV q d .
However , she has had a gradual rise in her thyroid stimulating hormone to a value of 6.68 .
Her discharge medication will include Synthroid dose of 0.3 milligrams po q day with recommendation that this parameter be followed closely .
IN SUMMARY :
Ms. Abreun is a fifty nine-year-old female who presented with necrotizing fascitis of the right hip , status post debridement , severely debilitated by the extent of her infection .
Over the course of 2 months this infection was cleared , the wound was cleaned and split thickness skin grafting was successful in covering over the wound .
Her course , however was complicated by an methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia which was resistant to therapy and which produced a profound sepsis which caused a hypotensive ana apneic episode which required Intensive Care Unit support for a period of a week .
Her course was also complicated by her hypoactive thyroid function which went unrecognized for some period , but has since resolved with aggressive Synthroid therapy .
Currently , her most issues are the advancement of her tube feeds and the restarting of her PO intake which was planned to begin for the next several days before her transfer was initiated .
Her wound also requires further care as smaller areas of non-take in the graft are being management with sterile saline wet to dry dressings .

Chest X-ray :
subtle increased density in the left middle lung .
Electrocardiogram notable for sinus tachycardia with emphysematous pattern , poor R progression V1 through V3 , and P. pulmonale with right axis deviation .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted for acute and chronic respiratory distress with likely chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and question of a pulmonary embolus .
The patient was ruled out for myocardial infarction with serial CK 's which were normal .
Echocardiogram was obtained which showed normal left ventricle , a dilated right ventricle with diffuse hypokinesis .
The RVSP was estimated at 35 .
Echocardiogram findings with persistent , profound right heart failure .
The patient subsequently underwent a pulmonary arteriogram which revealed no pulmonary emboli , but pulmonary artery pressure of 39/22 , wedge pressure of 12 and a right atrial pressure of 10 .
The patient also had mild liver function test abnormalities , for which she underwent right upper quadrant ultrasound which showed patent portal vein , patent hepatic vein and artery and bilateral small pleural effusions with a 4 cm. complex cystic lesion with calcified walls on the lateral aspect of the spleen .
The patient 's heparin was subsequently discontinued .
Pulmonary status stabilized , with the patient 's room air sat hovering around 90% .
Microbiologic work up for possible chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare exacerbation was subsequently negative .
The patient remained cardiovascularly stable but unclear etiology of her subtle electrocardiogram changes and respiratory distress .
It was subsequently felt after full work up with a negative PA gram , plus / minus VQ , negative echocardiogram , negative sero-CK 's and no evolving electrocardiogram that the patient had pulmonary hypertension secondary to chronic lung disease .
It was felt that the patient likely had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease of greater severity and duration than initially suspected and by history from the patient , in particular supported by her chronic CO2 retention on subsequent arterial blood gases .
The patient was maintained on treatment for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation , including steroid taper and nebs as well as antibiotic coverage .
Repeat chest x-ray subsequently showed hyperinflation consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , no signs of pneumonia or pulmonary edema , bilateral blunting of the costophrenic angles , consistent with pleural thickening , and / or small bilateral pleural effusions , consistent with right upper quadrant ultrasound .
Pulmonary Service was consulted .

It was subsequently arranged for the patient to transfer back to Balau for care there with a pulmonologist as well as her primary-care physician .
The patient was discharged in good state of health , ambulating .
Sats with and without O2 were above 88% .
A complete copy of the medical chart was sent with the patient to Lo .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Cefuroxime 500 mg. PO b.i.d. times 10 days , albuterol inhalers 2 puffs q4 hours , Atrovent inhalers 2 puffs q6 hours , Prednisone 40 mg. PO qday , then taper as directed by primary-care physician in Reveverburg .

The patient is a 47-year-old man with advanced stage chronic lymphocytic leukemia who was admitted for autologous bone marrow transplant as per protocol 94-055 of the Santusli Hospital .
The patient was originally diagnosed in 06/98 during a routine physical when he was noted to have a white blood cell count of 20,000 , weight loss , and swelling in his neck and groin .
He was watched after his initial diagnosis , but six months later he developed rapidly increasing leukocytosis and he became more symptomatic .
After treatment with three cycles of fludarabine he had 90% involvement of his intratrabecular space .
He was therefore treated with three cycles of fludarabine in combination with cytoxan .
After this therapy he achieved a protocol eligible minimal disease state .
However , he did have relative pancytopenia following this therapy .
He was taken to bone marrow harvest in 08/22 at which time insufficient cells were obtained to proceed .
He was returned previous to this admission for repeat bone marrow harvest and at that time he was given Neupogen prior to his harvest , and sufficient cells were not obtained to proceed with autologous bone marrow transplantation .
His most recent bone marrow biopsy revealed less than 5% of intratrabecular space involvement .
Recent CT scan showed no significant lymphadenopathy .
The spleen was within normal limits .

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :
Dehydration , electrolyte imbalance .
SPECIAL PROCEDURES AND OPERATIONS :
None .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is an 85-year-old male who has had longstanding diarrhea over the years and comes in because of severe dehydration , referred from the Sonpathcermu Jords Hospital .
He had had previous studies including a computed axial tomography scan which showed no pathology and they were at a loss to explain his diarrhea and dehydration .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
Accordingly , the patient underwent numerous studies here , all of which were negative including endoscopic assessment of his upper gastrointestinal tract and colonoscopy , both of which were normal .
The patient seemed to settle down while in the hospital and in fact started to have solid bowel movements and so on a controlled diet , which was purposely free of milk and milk products , the patient was discharged to be followed by his doctor , Dr. Both at the Sonpathcermu Jords Hospital but suffice it to say that no pathology was found in this hospital .
He had widespread abdominal distention and for a while looked like he might have had ischemic problems with his sigmoid colon resulting in a functional large bowel obstruction but this cleared while he was in the hospital and he expelled large amounts of gas and decompressed his distention and his diarrhea stopped and he seemed to be much , much better .
Whether this was related to medication , viral gastroenteritis or ischemic bowel problems is unclear , but he got better and went home .

On post operative day # 1 the patient was noted to have significant amounts of chest tube drainage of approximately 2.5 liters and was thought to exhibit some tamponade physiology .
He did have a left hemothorax .
He was taken back to the Operating Room for drainage of this and a chest tube was left in place following that for several days .
2. The second operation was a reoperation for bleeding at which time he had a mediastinal exploration and evacuation of hematoma .
The patient tolerated that procedure well and was brought to the Intensive Care Unit in stable condition .
The patient had the intra-aortic balloon weaned off on 11/28/98 .
On 11/29/98 it was noted the patient had an acute drop in his white blood cell count .
The lowest white blood cell count was 1.25 .
Hematology was consulted on this and they thought this was most likely secondary to administration of Diuril .
The patient was taken off the medication and his white blood cell count gradually began to rise .
On post operative day # 7 the patient had the one remaining chest tube removed .
COMPLICATIONS :
1. Post operative bleeding requiring return to the Operating Room for mediastinal exploration and evacuation of hematoma .
2. Profound leukopenia thought secondary to Diuril administration .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Breunlinke is a 70-year-old patient of Dr. Brendniungand Asilbekote in California .
She is referred for progressive angina .
She had rheumatoid fever as a child and a heart murmur noted but no further testing .
She has used antibiotic prophylaxis since 1980 .
In 1980 she had quadruple coronary artery bypass graft surgery by Dr. Elks at Feargunwake Otacaa Community Hospital and did well until 1988 when she had exertional angina and a positive stress test and found that three or four grafts were occluded .
In October , 1989 , Dr. No re-did her bypass operation .
She had a left internal mammary artery graft to the left anterior descending , saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal 1 and a saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal 2 .
In 1993 she had a DDD pacemaker for complete heart block .
She had exertional angina at that time .
In November , 1997 she had a small myocardial infarction as was transferred to Ona Hospital where a cardiac catheterization showed a tight left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending stenosis , high grade saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal 1 stenosis and patent obtuse marginal 2 graft .
She had normal left ventricular function with apical tip akinesis .
Since that time she has continued to have exertional left chest burning , radiating to the left neck and arm , relieved by nitroglycerin .
She was turned down for re-do surgery at that time and did not have a percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty .
Because these symptoms have been increasing , particularly at cardiac rehabilitation , she was referred here .
In May , 1998 she had an exercise tolerance test in which her heart rate went to 112 and her blood pressure fell to 95 systolic .
She had diffuse ischemic ST segment changes and increased lung uptake and a reversible anterior and lateral defect .
She has had no syncope .
Her cardiac risk factors are hypertension and elevated cholesterol .
She has a very strong family history of coronary artery disease with a mother , sister and brother dying of myocardial infarction .
She is a remote cigarette smoker .
She also has a history of lactose intolerance , peptic ulcer disease , with a remote gastrointestinal bleed and multiple ectopic pregnancies and mid term miscarriages .
She has had a total abdominal hysterectomy .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
She is a widow for 20 years and retired 18 years from Palmci
She lives alone .
Her son , Nertland is nearby and he works at the Em Nysonken Medical Center on Verville .
They live in Ohio .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
She is a healthy appearing female , 5 foot 120 pounds .
Her blood pressure was 120/70 , pulse 60 and regular .
Neck veins are not distended .
Respiratory rate 12 .
Carotids :
no bruits .
Lungs were clear .
Cardiac :
1/6 systolic ejection murmur .
Abdomen was benign .
Peripheral pulses intact .
Neurological examination non-focal .
LABORATORY DATA :
On admission , includes an electrocardiogram that shows DDD pacing .
Hematocrit 39 percent , white blood cell count 4500 , PT and PTT normal .
Sodium 140 , potassium 4.2 , chloride 105 , carbon dioxide 30 , BUN 24 , creatinine 1.0 .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient was admitted to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory .
There , her pulmonary wedge pressure was 12 and her right atrial pressure was 4 and pulmonary artery pressure 44/17 .
Her left ventricular contraction showed akinesis of the anterior wall with dyskinesis of the apex .
She had preserved inferior contraction and basal contraction .
Her native right and left anterior descending vessels were occluded as was an obtuse marginal branch .
The saphenous vein to the high diagonal or high obtuse marginal was occluded .
The left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending was also occluded .
The saphenous vein graft to the second obtuse marginal was open with no significant stenosis , but there was an outflow lesion in the obtuse marginal 2 as well as severe distal lesion as the obtuse marginal 2 fed the posterior descending artery .
This was considered her culprit lesion .
This was considered too high risk for angioplasty because of the severe disease in the graft .
In addition , it was noted that she had saphenous vein harvested from both thighs .
Her left internal mammary artery was also unused .
It was also noted that she had failure to sense with the atrial lead .
She would not sense the atrial contraction and the fire and this occasionally led to competition of firing .
This was intermittent .
The P wave amplitude was .6 and this could not be totally sensed .
The patient was admitted for management of her coronary artery disease and evaluation of her pacemaker .
It was noted that she became very symptomatic when she was not on a beta blocker but that on a beta blocker she had significant pacemaker failure .
Her pacemaker was set to a VVI mode which sensed appropriately .
She was in sinus rhythm with most of the time .
When her pacemaker was in a sinus rhythm without a beta blocker , she had significant angina .
Carotid non-invasive testing was unremarkable .
The situation was reviewed with Dr. Niste Graft .
He felt the patient was not a coronary artery bypass graft candidate because of the lack of conduit and because of the presence of a large anterior myocardial infarction .
For this reason , it was decided to maximize her beta blockers and nitrates .
The situation was reviewed with Dr. No of the Pacemaker Service .
On August 20 , under local anesthesia the right pectoral region was explored and the leads disconnected and the pulse generator changed to a CPI unit in which the sensitivity could be adjusted to .15 mm. , which permitted appropriate atrial sensing .
There was nothing wrong with the prior generator and nothing wrong with the leads .
It just needed a unit that could have more sensitivity in the atrial mode .
She tolerated this well .
Her medications were resumed .
She ambulated without difficulty and was discharged to home to be followed medically for her coronary artery disease following two failed bypass graft procedure by Dr. Brendniungand Asilbekote in Bi Masase , KS .

SOCIAL HISTORY :
Negative for tobacco , negative for alcohol .
The patient lives alone , but in a senior living facility adjacent to friends .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1 ) Cardiovascular :
The patient was admitted for rule out myocardial infarction .
She remained on telemetry for greater than 48 hours which demonstrated no dysrhythmia during this time .
The patient underwent an echocardiogram which demonstrated a preserved ejection fraction with left ventricular hypertrophy and no significant valvular abnormalities .
The patient was maintained on her aspirin and Lasix .
The patient 's Diltiazem was stopped due to her increased blood pressure and was started on Labetalol which was gradually titrated up to a target blood pressure of 160-170 systolic in her right arm .
The patient also underwent an Adenosine MIBI stress test which showed only mild lateral ischemia .
At this time , the patient 's presyncopal symptoms were not felt to be secondary to a cardiovascular etiology .
2 ) Neurological / vascular :
The discrepancy in the patient 's pulses and blood pressure was felt to be consistent with a subclavian artery stenosis .
The patient underwent MRI / MRA of the head , neck and upper chest which demonstrated a proximal left subclavian artery stenosis , proximal to the take off of the left vertebral artery .
The left vertebral artery had a decreased flow consistent with either native vessel disease or some degree of retrograde flow with subclavian steal phenomenon .
The patient had patent carotids bilaterally on her neck MRA .
MRI of the head demonstrated a small vessel disease and was likely an old right cerebellar infarct .
The patient underwent non-invasive carotid ultrasounds which demonstrated no significant carotid disease .
The patient was also noted to have antegrade flow in both of her vertebral arteries bilaterally .
The results of these studies suggested that the patient 's symptoms were not due to subclavian steal phenomenon , and therefore , it was decided that the patient would not go further to angio and / or surgical or percutaneous intervention .
A Neurology consult was obtained and it was felt that the most valuable intervention that could be done for the patient 's intervascular disease would be adequate control of her blood pressure .
3 ) Orthopedic :
The patient suffered a fall at home with her initial event .
Outside hip films were obtained , but were not available for view .
Repeat hip films demonstrated a right sided pubic rami fracture , likely new .
An Orthopedics consult was obtained and the patient was encouraged to weight bear as tolerated with Physical Therapy assistance .
A bone scan was also obtained to rule out an occult hip fracture which was negative .
At the time of this dictation , the patient was able to bear weight with the assistance of Physical Therapy and a walker .
Plans were made for the patient to be discharged to Dwardmegriff Rehabilitation for rehabilitation of her rami fracture .
4 ) Gastrointestinal :
The patient had an episode of her described vertigo while lying in bed and on the monitor during which no dysrhythmia was noted .
The patient also complained of frequent vomiting at least once a day , occasionally associated with ingestion of her medications , but sometimes associated with ambulation .
The patient has a long-standing history of spontaneous emesis due to overwhelming stress or excitement .
However , the patient reports emesis in the hospital more frequently .
The patient 's emesis was noted to be bilious without evidence of new or old blood .
The etiology of the patient 's nausea remained unclear as she demonstrated ability to keep down many of her meals which did not suggest an anatomical lesion of her gastrointestinal tract .
The patient was started on Meclizine on December 31 , 2000 for her nausea and vertigo .
An attempt was also made to reduce the patient 's large number of medications and the patient 's Os-Cal , multivitamin , Lasix and Colace were discontinued .
5 ) Infectious disease :
The patient complained of some urinary incontinence and difficulty initiating urine on December 30 , 2000 .
Urinalysis demonstrated a likely urinary tract infection .
The patient was started on Levofloxacin 250 mg p.o. q. day times seven days for a possible nosocomial urinary tract infection .
The urine culture was pending at the time of this dictation .
6 ) Fluids , electrolytes and nutrition :
The patient had a mild increase in her BUN and creatinine during her hospitalization which promptly returned to her baseline levels with intravenous fluids .
The patient was encouraged to increase her p.o. intake .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Left sided spastic hemiparesis , status post surgical correction of C-1 , C-2 dural AVM .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Ms. Breunlinke is a 69 year-old right handed woman , status post surgical correction of a C-1 to C-2 dural AVM in January , 1998 , now presenting with a one month history of increasing left sided weakness and pain with spasticity , occasional difficulty swallowing and abdominal pain .
She was originally admitted to the Verg Medical Center in January , 1998 , because of a one year history of left sided weakness and spasticity .
She was found to have intermedullary lesion at C1-2 level which on biopsy showed abnormal vasculature , hemosiderin deposit , leading in turn to the discovery of a dural arteriovenous malformation at that level which was surgically corrected .
The postoperative period was complicated by transient swallowing difficulty , increasing left sided weakness and urinary retention .
She was discharged to inpatient rehabilitation where she made significant progress toward recovery .
As of the beginning of September , 1999 , she was able to swallow without difficulty , urinate without difficulty ( although bowel movements have been problematic ) .
Functionally , she was at the level of pre-gait training and able to stand and take several steps with upper body support .
Over the past 4-5 weeks her functional level has progressively deteriorated .
She is now unable to stand and needs assistance to sit up .
Her left arm has developed a flexure contraction and she reports intermitttent pain in the left arm and leg which occurs both spontaneously and is also triggered by contact .
She has developed some new swallowing difficulty and since her transfer to a long term inpatient care facility , she has lost ten pounds .
She denies dysuria or excessive urinary frequency .
Over the past several weeks she has also developed severe intermittent abdominal pain , localized to the suprapubic area , left greater than right , occurring intermittently .
The patient feels this is secondary to her hemorrhoids , although it does not clearly localize to the rectum .
This pain often follows bowel movement but does occur spontaneously .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :

Discharge Date :
11/03/2000
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
RUPTURED PARATHYROID ADENOMA .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Ms. Shuffa is a 73-year-old Portuguese speaking woman who was transferred via Med Flight to Verg Medical Center .
She arrived intubated and was hemodynamically stable despite concerns of a dissecting aortic arch aneurysm .
She initially presented to Brottlake Medical Center on 9/15/00 complaining of acute onset dysphasia to liquids and solids .
While she was in Brottlake Medical Center , she developed new onset stridor , and an ENT consult was obtained .
They attempted a fiberoptic intubation with a # 6 endotracheal tube and found a 5 mm severely compressed airway .
She was also found to have a differential systolic blood pressure and ecchymosis on her anterior chest .
Given these findings , she underwent a CT scan which showed a retrotracheal mass that appeared to obliterate the esophagus .
This raised concerns for a hemorrhage , and she was transferred to Verg Medical Center emergently .
At the Ingree and Ot of Weamanshy Medical Center , she underwent an emergent CT scan with IV contrast .
This revealed no extravasation of contrast and no aortic aneurysm .
However , it did show an anterior mediastinal mass compressing the trachea with a density consistent with a hematoma .
She was admitted to the Thoracic Surgery Service under the care of Dr. Sccrookes .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Severe hypertension , angina , GERD , peptic ulcer disease , status post Billroth II , ovarian cancer , status post TAH-BSO in 1987 with a negative second look laparotomy in 1988 , chronic anemia , chronic left ear infection .
MEDICATIONS PRIOR TO ADMISSION :
Celexa 10 mg p.o. q.d.; Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d.; Capoten 50 mg p.o. b.i.d.; Pepcid 20 mg p.o. q.d.; Cardizem 180 mg p.o. q.d.; Xanax 0.5 mg tabs .
On transfer , she was on her preadmission medications plus Unasyn and Tigan 250 mg p.o. q.6h. p.r.n.
ALLERGIES :
No known drug allergies .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
She is divorced and retired .
She lives with her daughter , and denies any tobacco or alcohol use .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient is intubated .
VITAL SIGNS :
Temperature 98.6 , 66 .
Right arm was 180/80 , left 188/72 , and A-line was 151/61 .
Tidal volume is 700 with a rate of 10 , 10 of pressure support , and 10 of PEEP , and 100% FiO2 , satting 100% .
GENERAL :
She was sedated and spontaneously moving all four extremities .
NECK :
Edematous .
Trachea was midline .
She had bilateral crepitus in the anterior neck .
The superior clavicular area showed no signs of central line access attempts .
She had a 3 cm mobile gelatinous well-circumscribed mass in the right supraclavicular region .
Her anterior neck and chest had a 1 cm to 2 cm area of ecchymosis .
LUNGS :
She had bilateral expiratory wheezes .
ABDOMEN :
Soft with good bowel sounds .
It was nontender .
It was obese with a large midline defect consistent with a ventral hernia , as well as a smaller anterior defect in the left lower quadrant .
Both were easily reducible .
PULSE :
On the right side , 2+ femoral , popliteal , DP , PT , and radial ; on the left side , 2+ femoral , popliteal , DP , PT , and radial .
LABORATORY DATA :
CBC was 8.7 , 25.3 , and 184 .
Coags 12.2 , 24.8 , and 1.0 .
Her gas was 7.47/40/332 .
Electrolytes were 143 , 3.4 , 105 , 28 , 24 , 3 , and 131 .
EKG showed normal sinus rhythm with left ventricular hypertrophy and incomplete left bundle branch block .
CT scan showed an anterior mediastinal mass compressing the trachea with air .
It was consistent with a hematoma .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Ms. Shuffa underwent an EGD and flexible bronchoscopy on 9/16/00 shortly after she arrived .
This showed tracheal compressions but no other lesions that were obvious at the time .
She was hemodynamically stable and remained on the ventilator .
The differential diagnoses at this point consisted of hematoma vs. neoplasm vs. an abscess vs. a thyroid tumor .
On 9/22/00 , she underwent a cervical mediastinoscopy .
A biopsy of this mass was consistent with hematoma .
The operative report shows that there was an abnormal area below the trachea to the left which represented a cavity between the esophagus , trachea , aorta , and spine that was full of clot .
There was no active bleeding at the time .
Over the next several days , the patient remained hemodynamically stable on the ventilator .
She had an elevated calcium level that raised the suspicion that this mass could be a hematoma coming from a ruptured parathyroid adenoma .
The ionized calcium was elevated as was the parathormone level .
Given these findings , she underwent a Sestamibi scan .
The Sestamibi scan showed findings that were consistent with a parathyroid adenoma in the right lobe of the thyroid .
At this time , it was believed that her clot was due to a rupture of this parathyroid adenoma .
Dr. Ear brought the patient to the operating room on 10/5/00 .
She underwent a parathyroid exploration with resection of a ruptured ectopic right upper parathyroid adenoma , a biopsy of a normal left and right lower parathyroids , resection of a left upper parathyroid , and tracheostomy .
She tolerated the procedure well and was transferred back to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit with her new tracheostomy working well .
Her postoperative course was complicated by serosanguineous pleural effusion on the left .
This required a chest tube .
Her hematocrit continued to drop over the next couple of days despite normal platelet count , normal coags , and no obvious source of bleeding .
It was believed that she was continuing to bleed in her chest .
However , we are not quite sure why this was occurring .
She underwent an extensive workup by Hematology that revealed a bleeding diatheses of unknown etiology .
It turns out that several people in her family have a similar bleeding diathesis of unknown etiology .
In conclusion , by systems :
1. Neuro .
The patient became intermittently agitated .
We have been giving her Haldol at bedtime as well as Ativan p.r.n. throughout the day .
She responds well to this .
She speaks some English and seems to understand more than she speaks .
She has a family member who is present for approximately 12 hours each day .
She has been very helpful in translating and seems to say that Ms. Shuffa is in good spirits .
2. Cardiac .
The patient 's blood pressure has been ranging from approximately 140 to 160 systolic .
This is on a current regimen of Lopressor 25 mg per NG tube t.i.d. as well as Diltiazem 60 mg per NG tube t.i.d. , and lisinopril 10 mg per NG tube q.d. She occasionally gets hypertensive when she is agitated .
For this , we have given her 10 mg of hydralazine .
Her blood pressure responds well to this .
Otherwise , she is in normal sinus rhythm and has been hemodynamically stable throughout her hospitalization .
The patient developed a left femoral artery pseudoaneurysm after placement of a Greenfield filter .
This has been followed by the Vascular Surgery Service here at the Ingree and Ot of Weamanshy Medical Center .
Dr. Lenni Lung has been consulted .
The aneurysm at the time of discharge is approximately 2.5 cm .
They elected not to inject it with thrombin .
They asked that the patient follow-up with Dr. Ear in approximately three to four weeks so that this aneurysm can be assessed .
They have opted for conservative management given the size .
3. Respiratory .
At the time of discharge , the patient remained on CPAP with a PEEP of 7.5 and a pressure support of 9 .
She seems to be tolerating this well as she has an O2 sat of 100% on 40% FIO2 .
Her chest x-ray shows a left lower lobe hematoma that had greatly improved in the last few days .
Her right lung field is clear .
Her tracheostomy is functioning well , and we have had no problems with it .
She will obviously need to be weaned as tolerated .
We had her down to a low pressure support of 7 in the last week .
With the pressure support at 7 , she became tachypneic and had to be brought back up to 10 .
Her oxygen saturation has always been good .
4. GI .
The patient is getting tube feeds via her NG tube of full strength Jevity of 75 cc per hour .
This is her goal .
She tolerates them very well and has approximately 200 cc to 300 cc of stool per day .
Last week , she had copious amounts of stool in the range of 500 cc to 1000 cc of liquid stool per day .
Stool cultures have been sent numerous times as well as analysis for C. difficile toxin .
These have all been negative .
We believe the this was an osmotic diarrhea .
Since her tube feeds have been changed from full strength Nephro to Jevity , her diarrhea has resolved .
She has been taking Zantac , and the pH of her NG tube residuals have been in the 5 to 8 range .
5. GU .
The patient has had hypernatremia .
She is approximately 10 kg up her overall body weight .
We believe her to still be total body overloaded .
Over the last several days , we have been giving her approximately 500 cc to 1000 cc of free water through her NG tube .
We also have been diuresing her with Bumex .
This seems to trend her sodium down .
This will need to be monitored closely .
Her BUN and creatinine have been normal , and she has always made good urine .
6. Heme .
As stated before , the patient continued to ooze into her pleural space well after her definitive operation .
She had an extensive workup by Hematology which revealed a bleeding diathesis of unknown origin .
Before we removed her chest tube , we had to give her platelets .
She had no problems with this .
At the time of discharge , her hematocrit is stable in the 28 to 33 range .
I stress that she cannot be anticoagulated .
We have given her Lovenox in the past , and she continues to bleed .
Therefore , she is on no DVT prophylaxis .
She does have a left iliac deep vein thrombosis .
She has a Greenfield filter in place , and this is her only DVT prophylaxis .
7. ID .
At the time of discharge , the patient has a urinary tract infection .
She is growing Enterobacter cloacae that is sensitive only to Macrodantin from her urine cultures .
Interestingly enough , she also has Enterobacter cloacae growing out of her sputum .
This is also sensitive only to Macrodantin .
We do not believe that she has any respiratory process going on at the time .
She is just begun on Macrodantin at the day of discharge and should continue 100 mg per NG tube q.i.d. for a ten day course .
Her Foley was changed the day before discharge .
8. Tubes , lines , and drains .
The patient has a tracheostomy , NG tube , and a Foley catheter .
Her central line , which was left subclavian quad lumen , was removed on the day of discharge .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
Albuterol nebulizers 2.5 mg q.4h. and Atrovent nebulizers 0.5 mg q.4h. , please alternate albuterol and Atrovent ; Rocaltrol 0.25 mcg per NG tube q.d.; calcium carbonate 1250 mg per NG tube q.i.d.; vitamin B12 1000 mcg IM q. month , next dose is due Nov 18 ; diltiazem 60 mg per NG tube t.i.d.; ferrous sulfate 300 mg per NG t.i.d.; Haldol 5 mg IV q.h.s.; hydralazine 10 mg IV q.6h. p.r.n. hypertension ; lisinopril 10 mg per NG tube q.d.; Ativan 1 mg per NG tube q.h.s.; Lopressor 25 mg per NG tube t.i.d.; Zantac 150 mg per NG tube b.i.d.; multivitamin 10 ml per NG tube q.d.; Macrodantin 100 mg per NG tube q.i.d. x 10 days beginning on 11/3/00 .

PULMONARY EMBOLUS
Signed
DIS
Admission Date :
04/06/1998
Report Status :
Signed
Discharge Date :
04/12/1998
FINAL DIAGNOSIS :
PULMONARY EMBOLUS HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient remained in-house on IV heparin awaiting discharge to rehabilitation at Ocfasciences Valley Hospital Medical Center at the Wesrajoke Healthcare .
The patient 's course remained uncomplicated .
Hematology :
The patient 's hematocrit has slowly drifted down from his admission hematocrit of 38 down to 33.6 .
Given that the patient had not had a bowel movement during his entire hospital course , we were unable to document whether he was having gastrointestinal loss but it is unlikely that it is a large bleed , given there is no overt evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding .
The patient will ultimately need a colonoscopy as an outpatient , given his age and concern for occult malignancy as a cause of his likely gastrointestinal blood loss .
That can be arranged by his primary care physician back in Plain Pa .
Pulmonary embolus :
The patient will need to remain on Coumadin for six months .
His Coumadin dose will need to be titrated while at Coness- Tansdener Medical Center .
For the time being , his Tamoxifen is being held given its thrombogenic potential and that will have to be readdressed by his primary care physician upon his return to Rie , North Dakota .
It may not be unreasonable to restart the tamoxifen even whileon the coumadin .
Orthopedics :
The patient is status post multiple left upper extremity fractures .
The patient was followed by orthopedics during his hospital stay .
He will not need to follow-up at Pointexasp Region General Hospital during his stay at the rehabilitation and can follow-up once he returns back to Grovecu And in three to four weeks .
His fractures are stable by x-ray .
Physical therapy :
The patient has been cleared for passive range of motion exercises at the left elbow approximately two to three weeks after his initial fractures which will be on Monday , 04/15/98 .
The patient will need to have aggressive physical therapy for reconditioning given his marked deconditioning from his past two hospitalizations .
DISPOSITION :
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
Vitamin C 500 mg p.o. b.i.d. , aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d. , Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , heparin 1,250 units per hour IV until INR greater than 2 , Lactulose 30 ml p.o. q.i.d. , Lopressor 50 mg p.o. b.i.d. , vitamin E 400 units p.o. q.d. , Trazedone 50 mg p.o. qhs , Coumadin 5 mg p.o. qhs , multivitamin with iron 1 tablet p.o. q.d. , Percocet 1 to 2 tablets q4h p.r.n. pain .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
Stable .
The patient is discharged to Coness- Tansdener Medical Center where he will need aggressive physical therapy given his deconditioning status post his fall and recent hospitalization .
FOLLOWUP :
The patient will need follow-up with his primary care physician back in Ma Tony , Rhode Island in three weeks , as well as orthopedic follow-up in Wawa Lero .

RIGHT BREAST CARCINOMA , STATUS POST HIGH DOSE CHEMOTHERAPY AND AUTOLOGOUS STEM CELL RESCUE .
LIST OF SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS :
( 1 ) High risk carcinoma of the right breast .
( 2 ) Hypertension .
( 3 ) Hypothyroidism .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Ms. A is a 48-year-old woman , who was diagnosed with breast cancer in May of 1998 .
She was in her usual state of health until May of 1997 , when her right breast was noted to be abnormal on mammography .
Biopsy of this specific area was negative .
Subsequent mammography was , reportedly , benign and without significant interval change .
However , by May 1998 , she had appreciated a fullness in the right breast , and noted the emergence of a mass , which increased in size over time .
Mammography was repeated , which was highly suspicious for malignancy .
An ultrasound of the lesion was similarly suspicious for neoplasm .
The patient , therefore , went to incisional biopsy , which confirmed invasive ductal carcinoma .
She , subsequently , underwent mastectomy with axillary lymph node dissection ( November 1998 ) .
The final results from pathology revealed a very large tumor measuring 14 centimeters in size permeating the whole breast with a positive deep margin .
The tumor was described as histologically nuclear grade III with extensive lymphatic vascular invasion .
ER and PR were strongly positive , although , a K-617 index was unfavorable at 30 percent with a high esterase .
DNA content was deployed .
On examination of the lymph nodes , 22 of 24 lymph nodes sampled were involved with carcinoma .
Subsequent to surgery , she had an uncomplicated recovery .
She then went on to dose-intensive Adriamycin and tolerated this procedure remarkably well .
Restaging revealed no evidence of interval progression and the patient , therefore , went on to high-dose cyclophosphamide for stem cell mobilization .
Leukophoresis went well and stem cell yields were excellent .
Therefore , she is being admitted for intensification with high-dose cyclophosphamide , thiotepa , and carboplatin followed by stem cell rescue .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :
ANGIOSARCOMA
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
POOR
CHIEF COMPLAINT :
Fever , abdominal pain and vomiting .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Riie Pruesschird is a 25 year-old gentleman with metastatic angiosarcoma who presents as a transfer from Nacalv Medical Center with a fever to 101 , vomiting times one and "" left kidney pain "" .
This patient is an unfortunate young gentleman who was initially diagnosed with a germ cell tumor in the fall of 1997 after undergoing orchiectomy with a left scrotal mass and underwent three cycles of DEP therapy for pulmonary involvement .
In the summer of 1998 he was found to have a retroperitoneal mass which ultimately revealed angiosarcoma of presumed germ-cell transformation .
In early 1999 he underwent resection of this mass however in February of 1999 he was found to have a new right pleural mass and subsequently underwent pleurodesis and chemotherapy with ifosfamide and Adriamycin for six cycles .
In 05/99 he had increasing abdominal pain and evaluation revealed extensive progressive retroperitoneal disease as well as left hydronephrosis .
In early 2000 he was started on therapy with Taxol per Dr. Azel Hibbskays and finished this in March of this year .
CT imaging at that time was negative for disease .
In April of this year , he was found to have acute renal failure with left hydronephrosis and this was treated with percutaneous nephrostomy tube on that side .
Thereafter he began chemotherapy with Taxotere in 05/13 and his nephrostomy tube was removed after being displaced on 06/14/00 .
Most recently he has had problems with nausea , vomiting , fever and left sided abdominal pain and was admitted to the Pointexasp Region General Hospital on 06/16/00 .
That hospital course was sign for hydration , antibiotics for questionable pneumonia and more importantly , tachycardia and respiratory distress ultimately secondary to a large left pulmonary arterial mass that was likely a thrombus .
He was treated with intra-arterial thrombolysis ( TPA ) and was discharged on 06/28/00 on high dose , low molecular weight Heparin .
It was entirely clear that this mass represents a clot , certainly this could have been tumor embolization .
Finally , the patient developed hyponatremia with a sodium down to 130 and was otherwise eventually discharged to Pre Health with morphine for comfort care and advanced care plans , not to be resuscitated in the event of a life-threatening situation .
Mr. Pruesschird returns tonight after being found to have a temperature of 101 , last evening and early this morning in addition to nausea , vomiting times one earlier today .
As well he has complained of some vague left abdominal / flank pain that he attributes to "" kidney pain "" .
He was given Flagyl and had already apparently been on Levofloxacin at the outside hospital since his recent discharge for questionable pneumonia .
Mr. Pruesschird denies headaches , chest pain and any change in his breathing or comfort with breathing .
He denies persistent vomiting , abdominal pain , other than as mentioned , new skin changes or diarrhea .
There is no joint swelling or tenderness .
He otherwise feels about the same as when he left the hospital recently except for his left abdominal flank pain .

DISCHARGE SUMMARY NAME :
RIEFF , ALB P
UNIT NUMBER :
185-64-30
ADMISSION DATE :
08/24/1998
DISCHARGE DATE :
09/14/1998
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Sternal wound infection .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSES :
Infected aortic graft .
Hypertension .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
08/31/98 ascending aortic root replacement with homograft with omentopexy .
ASSOCIATED PROCEDURES :
09/02/98 sternal debridement .
Bilateral pectoralis major myocutaneous advancement flap .
Right superiorly based rectus abdominis flap .
Primary closure of wound .
HISTORY AND REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION :
The patient is a 79 year old gentleman with a history of an ascending aortic graft replacement in 1991 for aortic dissection .
At that time the patient 's hospital course was complicated by a sternal wound infection requiring a sternal debridement and subsequent abdominal flap .
The patient was then continued by report on Dicloxacillin for approximately one year following that reconstructive operation .
The patient apparently did well until June 1998 when he noted a bulge in his sternal area .
A ruptured aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm at the junction of the graft and arch was diagnosed and this was subsequently repaired .
The patient then had recurrent bleeding two weeks later which was once again repaired .
However the same problem recurred for a third time and a computer tomogram scan at an outside hospital showed an anterior hematoma .
By report the patient was at that time told that there was no more that could be done for him and was then apparently placed on comfort measures and pain control at the outside hospital .
However the patient was then subsequently transferred to Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital upon request of the family on 8/24/98 for further evaluation and possible intervention .
The patient was evaluated by Dr. Rhalt of Dentvailr. Medical Center .
As the patient 's early evaluation the patient underwent an aortogram which showed an ascending aortic graft with bulging flaps and a pseudoaneurysm at the anastomosis of the graft and arch just below the great vessels .
There was no evidence for a definite leak but there was evidence for gas bubbles in the anterior posterior distal ends of the grafts consistent with an infectious process .
At the same time the patient was seen in consultation by the Infectious Disease Service who upon culturing the patient 's sternal drainage switched the patient from intravenous Unasyn to Levofloxacin for what appeared to be Citrobacter and Diphtheroids in the wound cultures .
Subsequent to starting this antibiotic regimen the patient 's wound drainage appeared to subside .
Given all the findings on the aortogram and the subsequent chest computer tomogram scan it was discovered that the patient 's only real surgical option for cure was a risky operation that involved removal and replacement of the aortic graft probably with homograft and long term antibiotic coverage as well as a plastic surgical reconstructive procedure .
The patient understood the risks and potential benefits of the procedure and was willing to proceed .
The patient otherwise complained of no angina , no shortness of breath , no paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , no edema , no palpitations or symptoms of syncope .
He did report a 20 lbs weight loss over the last several months .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
1. Thoracic aneurysm repair .
2. Hypertension .
3. Status post hernia repair .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
1. Lopressor 100 mg po three times a day .
2. Captopril 75 mg po three times a day .
3. Prilosec 20 mg po per day .
4. Hydralazine 12.5 mg four times per day .
5. Reglan 10 mg po three times a day .
ALLERGIES :
No known drug allergies .
FAMILY HISTORY :
Noncontributory .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
The patient was married and denied any tobacco or alcohol use .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient was afebrile , vital signs were stable .
Head , eyes , ears , nose and throat exam :
negative .
Neck was supple .
There was no jugular venous distention .
2+ carotids without bruits .
Cardiovascular exam :
regular rate and rhythm with a 2/6 diastolic ___ and a 1/6 systolic ejection murmur .
His lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally without any evidence for crackles .
Extremities :
the patient had 2+ femoral pulses and 1+ pedal pulses .
LABORATORY AND RADIOLOGIC DATA :
Sodium 137 , potassium 4.0 , blood urea nitrogen 16 , creatinine .9 , white blood cell count 4.9 , hematocrit 29.7 , platelet count 207 .
The patient 's preoperative chest x-ray showed bilateral effusions and bibasilar atelectasis .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient 's sternal incision had a superior edge that was dehisced with evidence for stay sutures and some superficial closure sutures exposed .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was initially admitted to the Cardiac Surgical Service under Dr. Rhalt .
The patient was admitted to the Cardiac Surgical Intensive Care Unit given the patient 's precarious condition .
Over the next several hospital days the patient underwent aortogram as well as chest computer tomogram as outlined earlier .
The patient was also seen in consultation by the Infectious Disease Service as well as the Cardiology Service who assisted in managing the patient 's intermittent hypertension .
The patient was also seen preoperatively in consultation by the Plastic Surgical Service for potential sternal reconstruction .
After lengthy discussions with the patient and the patient 's family as well as the various consultant services it was decided that the patient was a viable candidate for aortic root replacement procedure using homograft .
This was obtained on 08/30/98 by Dr. Niste Rhalt of the Cardiac Surgical Service .
The patient was then subsequently taken to the Operating Room on 08/31/98 with the preoperative diagnosis of ascending aortic graft infection .
The procedure performed was homograft replacement of the ascending aorta with omentopexy and an open chest .
The aortic perfusions were via the femoral artery with venous return by the femoral vein .
The cardiopulmonary bypass time was one hour and 49 minutes .
The graft used was a homograft .
The patient tolerated the procedure fairly well and was transferred intubated to the Cardiac Surgical Intensive Care Unit with his chest open .
The immediate postoperative plans were for a short Intensive Care Unit stay and subsequent plastic surgical reconstruction of the patient 's sternum .
The patient was transferred to the Cardiac Surgical Intensive Care Unit in stable condition .
There he continued to be hemodynamically stable .
Of note , intraoperatively multiple tissue cultures had been sent .
In the Intensive Care Unit the patient was kept intubated and sedated until 09/02/98 which was postoperative day no. 1 following the homograft replacement .
On that day the Plastic Surgical Service performed further sternal debridement and subsequent reconstruction using bilateral pectoralis major myocutaneous advancement flaps and right superiorly rectus abdominis flap to cover the patient 's sternal wound with subsequent primary closure of that wound .
The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no complications .
A number of indwelling closed suction drains were left in place so as to drain the bed underneath the muscle flaps .
The patient was then transferred back to the Cardiac Surgical Intensive Care Unit in stable condition .
At this point the patient continued to followed by Infectious Disease Service and continued to be on intravenous antibiotics which included Vancomycin and Levofloxacin .
The Operating Room cultures at that point were positive for Crinobactermium with sputum cultures being sensitive for yeast and gram positive cocci in clusters .
Over the next postoperative day the patient was awakened and weaned to extubate without significant difficulties .
The patient 's subsequent postoperative course was characterized by persistent hypertension which required a significant amount of antihypertensives including Lopressor 100 mg po three times a day , Captopril 100 mg po three times a day , as well as Procardia .
The patient otherwise continued to do well and was becoming more oriented as time went on and as his blood pressure was brought under control .
Subsequently on postoperative day no. 8 in the Intensive Care Unit the patient was felt to be ready for transfer to the Cardiac Surgical Inpatient Service .
The patient continued to be followed by the Infectious Disease Service who felt that the patient 's Jackson Pratt drains needed to stay in as there was still some significant drainage from them .
As per the Infectious Disease Service the patient was continued on Levofloxacin , Vancomycin as antibiotic coverage .
However on 09/08/98 the Infectious Disease Service was made aware that the patient 's intraoperative cultures had also grown out Mycoplasma humilius .
Given this finding it was felt that the patient would certainly need long term intravenous antibiotics to include at least six weeks of Vancomycin and then subsequent Levofloxacin for the Citrobacter and Mycoplasma as well .
The patient was scheduled for peripherally inserted central catheter line placement knowing that he was going to need long term intravenous antibiotics .
This was placed on postoperative day no. 9 without any difficulty .
At the same time the patient continued to be stable on his antihypertensive regimen .
He was becoming more mobile and was taking a high protein high calories diet which he tolerated well .
He continued to be afebrile and otherwise very stable .
On postoperative day no. 12 the patient was noted to have fallen and subsequently dislocating the PIP joint of his left middle finger .
Subsequent hand x-rays obtained showed no evidence of fracture but the patient was seen in consultation by the Plastic Surgery Hand Service .
The patient will benefit from splinting of his finger while the swelling subsided and subsequent early mobilization to prevent any rigidity in that joint .
The patient was also seen subsequently in consultation by the Plastic Surgical Service who discontinued a number of the patient 's indwelling drains but they felt that others needed to stay while the patient was sent to rehabilitation .
These drains will then be subsequently taken out by Dr. General upon his followup with the patient .
Prior to discharge the patient also underwent an audiogram as a baseline hearing test while the patient was to stay on long term intravenous antibiotics .
The patient otherwise continued to be hemodynamically stable making good progress .
As a matter of fact the patient made remarkable progress given the severity of his disease condition prior to the operation .
The patient 's condition continued to be improved .
Given this finding the patient was therefore felt to be ready for discharge to a rehabilitation facility on 09/13/1998 .
In consultation with the Infectious Disease Service the patient was to stay on long term intravenous antibiotics .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
Good .
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS :
Diet :
High calorie , high protein .
The patient 's treatment will include typical peripherally inserted central catheter line care with frequent wound checks .
The patient prior to discharge was fitted with an orthoplast finger splint as manufactured by Occupational Therapy Services Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital .
The patient was also instructed in range of motion exercises for the left middle finger .
The patient on discharge is to have twice weekly Vancomycin peak and trough levels while he continues on long term Vancomycin therapy .
The patient was instructed to return to Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital if he developed any signs of wound infection such a erythema , drainage , or increasing incisional pain .
The patient was instructed to be vigilant for any fevers or chills .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
1. Vancomycin 750 mg intravenous q 18h.
2. Levofloxacin 500 mg po per day .
3. Prilosec 20 mg po per day .
4. Captopril 100 mg po three times a day .

FOLLOWUP :
The patient was instructed that he needed to followup with Dr. Rhalt by calling his office for appointment at 763-6361 subsequent to his discharge to his rehabilitation facility in Oaksale Lavalle .
The patient was also instructed to followup with Dr. Both of the Cardiology Service Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital following his discharge so that his antihypertension medications could be appropriately adjusted .
The patient will also be seen in followup by Dr. Chpo E. Enla General of the Plastic Surgery Service Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital so that his indwelling Jackson Pratt drains be appropriately management and if needed be discontinued by him .
The patient will also be followed by the Infectious Disease Service so as to ascertain the exact length and course of his antibiotic therapy .
The patient was instructed to followup with Dr. Naco Mesprhalt of the Infectious Disease Service by calling her office for an appointment at 094-902-2879 to be seen in approximately four weeks following the patient 's discharge .
Dr. Dau 's recommendation is that the patient is to stay on Vancomycin and Levofloxacin for approximately six weeks following discharge and then subsequently on antibiotic regimen for chronic suppression .

1 ) THROMBOTIC THROMBOCYTOPENIC PURPURA .
2 ) BRONCHIOLITIS OBLITERANS ORGANIZING PNEUMONIA .
3 ) RENAL FAILURE REQUIRING CHRONIC DIALYSIS .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 63 year-old woman transferred from Pre Health on June 19 , 1998 to the Verg Medical Center Intensive Care Unit for evaluation of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia .
On May 12 , 1998 , the patient presented to Pre Health with fever , cough , dyspnea and a chest x-ray revealing a patchy infiltrate in the right lung .
She was treated with Clindamycin and Erythromycin which were changed to Trovan and then transferred to A Hospital .
On May 27 , 1998 , the patient desaturated to 40% with a temperature of 100.5 degrees .
Her oxygen saturations improved to only 92% on 100% face mask and she was admitted to Pre Health Intensive Care Unit .
Chest x-ray there revealed bilateral pulmonary infiltrates with increasing pleural effusion .
A VQ scan was high probability , but no pulmonary angiogram was done and an echocardiogram revealed a normal left ventricle with no wall motion abnormality and an ejection fraction of 75% .
On May 24 , 1998 , the patient had a CT scan of the chest which revealed diffuse alveolar infiltrates at the right base , mediastinal lymphadenopathy and bilateral pleural effusions .
At this point , a diagnosis of lupus was considered and her ANA was 1:640 and her rheumatoid factor and ANCA were negative .
She was started on a steroid trial at that point .
Her pleural fluid was tapped and it was negative for malignancy .
On June 11 , 1998 , the patient had a video assisted thoracoscopic study of the right lung which revealed chronic interstitial pneumonitis with a bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia-like reaction and a chest tube was placed .
The patient was then started on 40 mg of Prednisone q. day .
From May 27 , 1998 through June 19 , 1998 , the patient had a decline in her platelets from 394 to 28 with a stable hematocrit of 32 to 33 and a rise in creatinine from 1.0 to 3.8 .
On June 19 , 1998 , she was transferred to the Verg Medical Center Medical Intensive Care Unit for evaluation of possible thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
1 ) Cerebrovascular accident in 1995 in the pontine region secondary to hypertension .
2 ) Hypertension .
3 ) Status post hysterectomy .
4 ) Status post appendectomy .

8 ) Folic acid .
9 ) Premarin 0.625 mg p.o. q. day .
10 ) Omeprazole 20 mg p.o. q. day .
11 ) Insulin sliding scale .
ALLERGIES :
The patient had no known drug allergies .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
The patient is divorced .
She has two children .
She recently retired as a clerical worker .
She denies any tobacco .
She has only social alcohol use .
FAMILY HISTORY :
Father died at age 56 of coronary artery disease .
Mother died at age 68 of pancreatic carcinoma .
Brother has coronary artery disease .
There is no family history of hematologic problems .
LABORATORY :
Laboratory studies on admission were notable for a sodium of 131 , potassium 6.2 , BUN 111 , creatinine 3.9 , white blood cell count 23 , hematocrit 27 with 2+ schistocytes and 2+ spherocytes on the smear , platelet count 92 and LDH 496 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1 ) Bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia :
The video assisted thoracoscopic study at the outside hospital was consistent with bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia .
The patient was continued on steroids throughout the course of her stay .
This was changed to Solu-Medrol part way through the course due to her hematologic problems , see below .
By discharge , she was returned to 40 mg of Prednisone q. day times one month to be followed by a slow taper .
The patient 's bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia appeared to improve slowly throughout her hospital course , however on July 12 , 1998 , after starting dialysis ( see below ) , the patient desaturated and required supplemental oxygen .
Repeat chest x-rays and chest CT scans appeared consistent with pulmonary edema from volume overload given her renal failure and eventually , the patient 's pulmonary status did improve after significant volume removal with dialysis for several weeks .
At the time of her discharge , the patient was still requiring two liters of supplemental oxygen to maintain her oxygen saturations in the mid 90% .
2 ) Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura :
The patient was initially admitted with platelet count of 28 , hematocrit of 32 , LDH of 496 with 2+ schistocytes and 2+ spherocytes on her smear .
This was felt to be consistent with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and on June 20 , 1998 , she was started on daily plasma exchange which continued through July 27 , 1999 .
She was also changed to intravenous Solu-Medrol 50 mg q. day which was changed back to 40 mg of Prednisone prior to discharge .
Her platelet count initially rose to a maximum of 159 on July 3 , 1998 , then they steadily fell to a low of 60 on July 20 , 1999 .
Her LDH which peaked at 1255 decreased to the mid 200s , but remained elevated .
She continued to have a few schistocytes on her smear , but it was much decreased .
The patient also required red blood cell transfusions , approximately two units every seven to ten days to maintain her hematocrit .
Eventually , her plasma exchange was tapered to a smaller and smaller dose each day and then discontinued altogether after July 27 , 1999 .
After this , the patient 's platelet count rose to a maximum of 177 on discharge .
It is felt that the patient 's thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura has resolved .
She will continue on her Prednisone for one month as above for the bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia with a very slow taper .
3 ) Renal :
The patient presented in acute renal failure with a BUN of 101 and a creatinine of 3.7 .
Throughout the month of June , she had a rising Potassium phosphate and increasing volume overload with decreasing response to diuretics and she was finally initiated on dialysis with ultrafiltration on July 12 , 1998 .
The opinion of the Renal consult was that this was permanent and non-reversible renal failure since it did not improve with dialysis and the patient will continue on dialysis three times per week .
She required approximately five liters of ultrafiltration fluid removal at each dialysis session due to her significant volume overload .
During the course of her dialysis , she had a great improvement in her lower extremity edema and her oxygen saturation .
4 ) Infectious disease :
The patient had multiple line infections during her admission including a confirmed coag. negative Staphylococcus line infection with positive blood cultures on June 23 , 1998 , July 4 , 1998 , July 8 , 1998 and July 9 , 1998 .
The patient eventually had a left subclavian Tesio catheter placed and a right brachial PICC line placed on July 10 , 1998 which remained patent and uninfected .
She received a full three week course of Vancomycin and also received a three week course of Ceftazidime .
In addition , she had a fungal urinary tract infection treated with Amphojel bladder irrigation , which was followed by a Klebsiella urinary tract infection for which she received Levofloxacin times fourteen days .
She also received a fourteen day course of Acyclovir which was begun on June 21 , 1998 for perianal lesions consistent with herpes simplex virus .
She was also on Fluconazole for some oral thrush which was inadvertently continued for a total of thirty days .
The patient was also started on Bactrim one double strength tablet q.o.d. as prophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia while on her high dose steroids .
5 ) Rheumatology :
The patient was admitted with a question of lupus given her ANA of 1:640 although her rheumatoid factor and ANCA were negative .
Unfortunately throughout her admission , we were unable to test any more titers since she was receiving daily plasma exchange .
A repeat ANA , rheumatoid factor and ANCA may be repeated as an outpatient .

Cranial nerves II-XII intact with the exception of right cranial nerves X , right facial nerve paresis , right glossopharyngeal nerve paresis , left visual field partial absence ( noticed post procedure ) .
LABORATORY DATA AND RADIOLOGIC DATA :
During hospitalization computerized tomography scan examination of brain performed with and without intravenous contrast enhancement was obtained , following demonstration of left partial homonymous hemianopsia .
Computerized tomography scan demonstrated two murally enhancing cystic masses , the first occupying much of the inferior right cerebellar hemisphere , the second shown focally in the left lateral occipital lobe , with associated vasogenic edema .
Metastatic disease suspected .
Additional magnetic resonance angiogram examination requested .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient was admitted on 1/10/99 , at which time intentional balloon sacrifice of right coronary artery was performed .
Systemic anticoagulation was accomplished with limited mobility permitted .
Over the course of the next three days the patient was mobilized .
At this time the diagnosis of presumed metastatic involvement of a super-tentorial and infratentorial compartments had been arrived at , and it was also noted that the patient 's swallowing was sufficiently impaired where Nutrition was compromised and in question .
It was decided at this point that the patient 's neck resection may need to be withheld pending exploration of chemotherapeutic and radiation therapy options , and that the Nutrition status would need to be addressed .
As such , it was decided that a transfer to the Valtawnprinceel Community Memorial Hospital under Dr. Cuchsoissfreiermcot 'care , who is the patient 's Oncologic Otolaryngologic Surgeon , should be entertained .
On the evening of 1/14/99 , nursing noticed that the patient was somewhat confused , and suspected a possible post ictal state .
As such , the patient was placed on Dilantin , and Dilantin is being continued .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. Service is a 58 year old gentleman with a history of anal squamous cell carcinoma , who is admitted with a history of fevers .
The patient was initially diagnosed in 03/98 with a 6 cm rectal mass .
Biopsy , at that time , showed squamous cell carcinoma .
A staging CT , at that time , showed no evidence of inguinal lymph node .
The patient was treated with 5-FU , mitomycin , as well as XRT with complete remission .

An inguinal biopsy , at that time , showed a squamous cell carcinoma .
The patient was treated with cisplatin and taxol x4 cycles , which was completed in 3/4/99 .
The patient was noted to have partial response to this .
On 3/26/99 , the patient underwent an abdominoperineal resection and a reconstruction rectus flap .
His hospital course was complicated by postoperative fevers , which were treated with Keflex .
However , since that time , the patient has had persistent multiple perineal non-wound healing with drainage .
The patient initially presented on 6/4/99 , with a three week history of fevers off of antibiotics .

A colostomy bag was intact .
Perineal exam was significant for surgical wounds x3 , with granulation tissue .
No obvious purulent material or abscesses were noted .
NEURO :
The patient was alert and oriented x3 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was initially admitted to the Surgery Service with a history of fevers .
During his hospital course on the surgery service , he remained febrile .
He was initially treated with Ancef .
An Infectious Disease consult was obtained and antibiotics were discontinued .
The patient remained febrile off of antibiotics and was noted to have an elevated white blood cell count .
A chest x-ray obtained on 6/14/99 revealed a right upper lobe infiltrate and cefotaxime and Flagyl were started for a probable post-obstructive pneumonia .
On 6/15/99 , a repeat chest CT was obtained , which showed a very large right hilar mass with multiple pulmonary nodules .
CT , Surgery , and Pulmonary consults were obtained regarding further diagnostic evaluations .
In addition , the patient was also noted to be hypercalcemic and was treated with IV fluids and pamidronate .
The patient was subsequently transferred from the Surgery Service to the Oncology-D Service for further management on 6/16/99 .
Briefly , his hospital course by systems on the Oncology-D Service :
( 1 ) INFECTIOUS DISEASE - The patient was continued on cefotaxime and Flagyl for a probable post-obstructive pneumonia .
Per consult with the pulmonologist , it was not felt that the patient would likely benefit from any sort of procedure or stenting .
The decision was made to continue the patient on chronic antibiotic therapy .
The patient was discharged on IV ceftriaxone , as well as oral Flagyl with plan to continue IV ceftriaxone for one week and then switch to p.o. Augmentin .
In addition , the patient 's surgical wounds were cultured to R / O any evidence of a wound infection .
Wound cultures from his buttock region revealed 1+ Acinetobacter , as well as 2+ diphtheroids with rare enterococci .
A perirectal culture showed normal fecal flora , and a second wound culture also revealed diphtheroids and coagulase negative Staphylococcus .
These were thought to be contaminants , and the patient was not treated for wound infection .
( 2 ) PULMONARY - On 6/17/99 , the patient was noted to have markedly increased O2 requirements , with O2 sats noted in the low 80% on room air .
This increased to 90-93% on four liters nasal cannula .
The patient was noted to have increased wheezes on pulmonary exam .
A STAT portable chest x-ray revealed markedly increased opacification in the right hemithorax , with increased markings on the left , which was consistent with pulmonary edema .
An EKG was obtained , at that time , which showed sinus tachycardia at a rate of 125 , with normal axis and no acute ST changes noted .
The patient was given IV Lasix with improvement in his O2 saturations .
It was also thought , at that time , given the patient 's immobility that a pulmonary embolus was also a likely cause of the patient 's hypoxia .
However , at that time , the decision had been made to make the patient DNR / DNI , and it was not felt that an aggressive workup for pulmonary embolus was indicated at that time .
Throughout the remainder of the patient 's hospitalization , his respiratory status was stable .
( 3 ) METASTATIC ANAL CARCINOMA / CODE STATUS - Given the advanced nature of the patient 's disease and his failure to respond to chemotherapeutic measures , upon discussion with the patient , the patient 's wife , and the treatment team , the decision was made to pursue comfort measures , and the patient was made DNR / DNI .
It was felt that aggressive workup was not indicated at that time .
The goal of the patient 's treatment was for maximum comfort and pain control .
( 4 ) HYPERCALCEMIA - The patient had been noted to be hypercalcemic with a calcium of 13.3 .
He was treated with aggressive IV fluid hydration , as well as pamidronate with normalization of his calcium level .
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS :
The patient was discharged on one week of IV ceftriaxone with p.o. Flagyl , with a plan to change IV ceftriaxone to p.o.
Augmentin after one week .
In addition , the patient was to receive dressing changes via SGGH .
The plan was for the patient to remain at home until he and his wife felt that hospice care would be necessary , at which time , they would transition to an inpatient hospice unit .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
Vitamin C 500 mg p.o. b.i.d.; Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.; Motrin 600 mg p.o. q.6h. p.r.n.; Indocin 25 mg p.o. b.i.d. ( for tumor fever ) ; Flagyl 500 mg p.o. q.8h.; Darvocet-N 100 mg 1 p.o. q.4-6h. p.r.n. pain ; Zantac 150 mg p.o. b.i.d.; Zinc 220 mg p.o. b.i.d.; Ensure 1 can q.i.d.; ceftriaxone 100 mg q.d. x7 days ; Augmentin 250/125 mg p.o. t.i.d. to start after ceftriaxone D / C 'd ; albuterol inhaler 2 puffs q.4-6h. p.r.n. wheezing .

Multivitamin one tablet daily and Albuterol nebulizers qid .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 69 year old woman from Maine without prior history of overt cardiac disease .
She does have a history of peripheral edema on Dyazide .
She has been a smoker and presented on the day of admission with dizziness .
She was in her usual state of health until two to three days prior to admission when she noted intermittent dizziness and felt weak .
She denied chest pain , shortness of breath , nausea or vomiting .
On the morning of admission to the Haold Memorial Hospital she went out to feed some birds and then felt weak , came back , was dizzy and was somewhat diaphoretic .
Her sister with whom she lives insisted that she seek medical care and she was brought to the Haold Memorial Hospital emergency room and was found to have a pulse of 61 and blood pressure of 91/45 .
The electrocardiogram done there showed evidence of an inferior wall infarction with ST segment elevations in leads 2 , 3 and AVF and ST depressions in leads V1 through V4 and AVL .
Right sided leads did not provide evidence of a right ventricular infarction .
She was given Streptokinase , aspirin , Dopamine for hypotension and Atropine with external Zoll pacemaker after bradycardia into the 30 's developed .
The blood sugar was elevated at 208 .
The BUN was 24 and creatinine 1.7 .
The uric acid 11.2 and initial CK was 35 .
When she developed wide complex tachycardia she was given a Lidocaine bolus and brought to the FIH by helicopter .
In the emergency room she appeared hemodynamically stable initially and the Dopamine was weaned off .
The electrocardiogram taken here showed the ST segment elevations had diminished considerably but there were continued reciprocal changes in the anterior leads .
She had a few beats of wide complex tachycardia .
Her only medication was Dyazide .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
She was a pleasant rather vague obese woman in no acute distress .
The pulse was 68 to 80 and the blood pressure 95/52 .
The respirations 18 and she was afebrile .
The jugular veins were not distended .
The carotids were full .
There were no bruits .
The chest was clear with distant breath sounds .
The cardiac rhythm was regular with frequent premature beats and no murmur .
There were no rubs .
The abdomen was obese without palpable organs or masses .
There was no peripheral edema .
There were good dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulses bilaterally .
There was decreased vibratory sense on neurological examination but there was no asterixis .
Her electrolytes were normal with a BUN of 24 and creatinine 1.9 .
The cholesterol was 171 .
Triglycerides 103 .
By this time her CK was 600 .
Her hematocrit was 37.1 .
Hemoglobin 12.8 and white blood count 7800 .
The PT was 19.3 and PTT 34.8 .
Review of the electrocardiograms from Haold Memorial Hospital demonstrated atrial flutter with variable conduction .
She was in sinus tachycardia here with right bundle branch block and continued ST segment elevation with Qs in 3 and AVF .
She was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit where she continued to have intermittent marked bradycardia with junctional rhythm and relatively low blood pressures and runs of flow ventricular tachycardia .
She became increasingly disoriented .
She developed first degree AV block and then Wenckebach block .
The chest films showed mild cephalization .
She became very drowsy with sedation when she developed some agitation and required intubation .
She went to the cardiac catheterization laboratory because of low cardiac output and shock .
She had ventricular pacing and the cardiac output came up to 2.3 .
Catheter study then revealed right coronary occlusion with no significant left sided disease .
The right coronary artery had a large burden of intravascular thrombus and she was eventually able to have the clot cleared and a near 2.5 stent was placed with good result .
She had TIMI 2 to 3 flow in the right coronary artery after stenting and removal of clot from the right coronary artery .
She continued to have intermittent runs of ventricular tachycardia .
She remained intubated but her hemodynamics improved somewhat .
Dobutamine was diminished because of the wide complex tachycardia and she developed atrial fibrillation .
She was initially tried on intravenous Pronestyl in an attempt to restore sinus rhythm .
She was later switched to Amiodarone but there continued to be no effect on her atrial fibrillation .
Eventually her lines were able to be withdrawn and she was moved to the floor .
She had a lot of wheezing and in late January she had continued elevated wedge pressure and her creatinine started to rise to 3.2 and then 4 with nonoliguric renal failure .
She was then returned to the Unit where she underwent further monitoring .
The BUN rose to 91 .
Her Digoxin level was 1.9 on February 6 .
She was able eventually to be extubated and moved back to the floor .
Efforts to mobilize her began in early January and an echocardiogram demonstrated an ejection fraction of 49% .
The right ventricular function was normal .
After extubation she developed a considerable amount of upper respiratory stridor which was treated initially with Decadron .
The patient was seen in consultation by ENT consultants who found that she had some hardened inspissated secretions in the region of the vocal cords , glottic inlet and subglottis .
There was no structural abnormality .
Moistened oxygen and Mucomyst was given with eventual restoration of her voice and diminution in her stridor .
She continued a rather slow improvement .
The patient was seen in consultation by Drs. Morning and Morning because of the abnormalities of renal function .
The possibility of renal artery stenosis was raised and she eventually was able to have a MRI .
She had some hematuria and was seen by Dr. Ryna Jescdrig .
Renal and bladder ultrasounds were normal .
She had abnormal urinary cytology however and Dr. Jescdrig strongly recommended that this be followed up by cystoscopy when she is able to do that .
That can take place either here at his office or in Aersing Rocuch Sun or when she returns to Carfachemoses Hospital .
Because of alternating and fluctuating mental status , she had a head CT scan which showed small area of intracranial bleeding .
This was followed up and was shown to resolve .
MR angiogram revealed no evidence of renal artery stenosis .
A MRI of the head because of the small area of bleeding was done to look for amyloid angiopathy which would have made anticoagulation dangerous .
She was then begun on Coumadin when none was found and is now being transferred to rehabilitation in hopes of her eventual return to her home with her sister on Carfachemoses Hospital .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Metastatic melanoma .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
Wide resection of metastatic melanoma to the right shoulder with partial thickness skin graft reconstruction on 9/1/00 .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 69 year old man who was initially diagnosed with a right upper posterior extremity melanoma level 4 , 2.5 mm in depth , in 10/02/92 .
Subsequently in 10/92 he underwent a wide excision with axillary dissection which showed residual malignant melanoma with nine negative lymph nodes .
He had a recurrence in 05/99 in a similar area which was 2.1 mm in thickness .
He had this resected between 8/4 and 9/5/97 and was treated with 6000 C of radiation therapy over the right upper extremity .
He has done well since that time and subsequently in 05/98 had pulmonary nodules which were noted and a computer tomogram scan in 08/98 demonstrated a 4.2 cm splenic lesion .
He underwent an open splenectomy in the Fall 1998 which demonstrated metastatic melanoma only to the spleen .
Since that time he has been treated with _______ cells in 1999 and also with Allovecting injection to the right anterior axillary nodule .
Most recently in he has this right anterior axillary metastatic melanoma resected at Brook Hospital by Dr. Bainpruess on with local triceps myocutaneous tissue transfer .
Since April through July this area has increased in size where the triceps tissue transfer has been replaced with a bulky metastatic melanoma disease .
Surgical consultation for resection of this for local ___ control was requested .
The patient has ___ Dr. Peakekudz and has known visceral metastases of the liver as well the lung with mediastinal adenopathy which has been stable for the past two years .
The other complicating factor in his care was that he was wheelchair bound from a viral meningeal encephalomyelitis in 1966 and has relied heavily on his upper extremity for wheelchair transfer and access and transportation .
In order to workup up this metastatic melanoma recurrent after local excision only two months previously it was elected to get an magnetic resonance imaging scan of the shoulder .
This magnetic resonance imaging scan confirmed that there was a large mass which measured approximately 4-6cm anterior to the deltopectoral groove and unfortunately a smaller lesion 1cm was seen separately adjacent and medial to the biceps tendon near the brachial neurovascular bundle .
An magnetic resonance imaging scan which was performed three months prior to admission to Brook Hospital for resection demonstrated that this more medial lesion was not present at that time and therefore it was suspicious for metastatic melanoma .
The patient had a fine needle aspiration of this bulky tumor mass which demonstrated malignant melanoma and subsequently he was sent for a positron emission tomography scan which was performed at S Nakantlakeing University Hospital And Medical Center on 8/24/00 .
The positron emission tomography scan demonstrated a known larger anterior metastatic melanoma and more medially two approximately 1cm lesions that also enhanced .
These were consistent with metastatic melanoma near the brachial plexus confirmed by the magnetic resonance imaging scan .
The patient now presents for surgical resection and reconstructive repair of this lesion .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Viral meningeal encephalomyelitis in 1996 which left him paralyzed from waist down and wheelchair bound .
He is incontinent of bowel and bladder and wears a Texas catheter due to phimosis of the penis .
He also suffered comminuted fractures of the right lower extremity .
He has bilateral venous stasis and hypertension .
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :
As above including a splenectomy .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
1. Atenolol 25 mg po per day .
ALLERGIES :
Bactrim .

Her name is Dr. Lynea Moyduhe .
FAMILY HISTORY :
Father with renal cell carcinoma and prostate cancer .
Mother with primary brain tumor .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Afebrile , vital signs stable .
His right shoulder had a large 6cm bulky mass which had grown somewhat in size over the past 2-3 weeks .
The bulky mass is somewhat mobile on the medial aspect and there are subcutaneous nodules which had not been present before .
The axillary area medially has two dominant nodules .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient underwent a wide excision of the malignant melanoma of his right shoulder and partial thickness skin grafting to his right axilla .
The donor site was his right thigh .
He tolerated the procedure well and there were no complications .
A Vac dressing was applied postoperatively and this was maintained for four days .
When this was taken down the graft was noted to be healthy with good take .
It was then dressed with Adaptic and Bacitracin ointment and covered with a dry sterile dressing per day .
The harvest site was blown dry with a blow dryer .
The patients pain was controlled initially with a PCA and this was eventually discontinued and he was started on Oxycontin .
His Foley was discontinued and a Texas catheter was reapplied .
He was tolerating a regular diet with regular bowel movements with digital rectal stimulation .
He began to work with OT Service .
They began range of motion to his right upper extremity except for around his shoulder .
This was kept to minimal activity .
He remained afebrile with stable vital signs .
On discharge his graft is clean , dry and intact without any evidence of discharge or erythema .
His donor site is also without evidence of infection .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
Good .
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS :

In the emergency room , his pulse was 120 , blood pressure initially was in the 90 's , core temperature was 96.5 ..
He , neurologically , was unresponsive and intubated .
He had received both [ ] and Fentanyl for sedation in route to the hospital .
head , eyes , ears , nose and throat :
revealed some superficial facial abrasions .
His trachea was midline .
He had a C-collar in place .
His chest wall appeared stable without any crepitus .
He had equal breath sounds on both sides .
His abdomen was flat , scaphoid , and did not appear distended .
He did have some bruising along his anterior abdominal wall as well as a superficial abrasion .
His pelvis was stable upon both AP and Lateral compression .
His examination of his right lower extremity revealed a deformity at his distal thigh .
He had an open laceration over what appeared to be a tib-fib fracture over his leg .
He had obvious fractures in his left hand .
His back exam revealed no stepoff or evidence of spine injury .
His labs were significant for a prothrombin time of 25 , hematocrit of 30 , other labs were unremarkable .
His trauma series revealed a left-sided pulmonary contusion and a wide mediastinum .
Evaluation of the C-spine revealed a C5 fracture .
His pelvis film was normal .
He had films of his right femur which revealed a distal femur fracture as well as a right-sided fibular fracture .
He underwent a head computerized tomography scan which was negative followed by an abdominal and pelvic computerized tomography scan which revealed a left-sided pulmonary contusion .
A small , left-sided pneumothorax .
His abdominal computerized tomography scan revealed a large liver laceration as well as a splenic laceration .
Throughout his stay in the emergency room , his blood pressure was above 90 .
He was tachycardic to 120 .
Because of a persistent volume requirement , he was taken up to the operating room for exploration .
In route to the operating room , the patient lost his pulse .
cardiopulmonary resuscitation was initiated .
He then underwent a resuscitative left thoracotomy and crossclamping of his aorta .
Details of this operation are dictated in a separate note .
We were able to obtain a pulse upon crossclamping of his aorta .
We then performed an abdominal exploration which revealed a large left lobe of liver laceration down to his inferior vena cava .
This was actively bleeding which could not be controlled .
The patient once again lost his pulse and we were unable to come off the aortic crossclamp .
Because of this massive liver injury , this large liver laceration could not be repaired and he was pronounced at 10:15 AM on December 2 , 1998 .
The patient 's family had been notified and they were in route as we proceeded to the operating room .
They have been informed of the turn of events and the demise of their son .

Unsigned
DIS
Report Status :
Unsigned
ADMISSION DATE :
2/15/94
DISCHARGE DATE :
2/28/94
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia , without remission , atrial fibrillation , chronic airway obstruction , hypopotassemia , cellulitis , orbital hemorrhage , protein calorie malnutrition , gastrointestinal hemorrhage , pulmonary hemorrhage / pneumonia , hyperglycemia , renal insufficiency , hyperuricemia , hypophosphatemia .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This 75 year old male had been noted to be anemic with an abnormal white blood count since at least November 1993 , while he was living in Aersing Rocuch Sun and his physicians there had begun to manage him with transfusions , and low dose hydroxyurea .
Apparently , a bone marrow biopsy at the time confirmed the diagnosis of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia .
He came to this country in late December 1994 to live with his son for a few months and was referred to me for follow up .
He had been noting night sweats , increasing fatigue , anorexia , and dyspnea , which were not particularly improved by increased transfusions or alterations of hydroxy urea .
He became profoundly thrombocytopenic , and ultimately was admitted to the hospital on 2/15 with headache and weakness .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Significant for chronic atrial fibrillation , managed with an Italian variation of Digoxin , and Amioadrone , hypertension managed with an ACE inhibitor , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease managed with a zanthine preparation and low dose steroids , as well as an occasional inhaler .
Other medical problems included chronic liver disease of uncertain etiology , for which he had been advised not to drink any alcohol .
He also had a penetrating injury to the right eye , which had rendered him blind 10 years previously .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
He was a chronically ill appearing elderly man , with a respiratory rate of 30 , temperature 99.6 , pulse 100 , and irregularly irregular , blood pressure 148/71 .
He had some petechiae on his extremities , as well as in his mucosal membranes with some hemorrhagic bullae .
There were bibasilar rales with some wheezing .
He had no cardiac murmur .
His abdomen was distended with massive hepatosplenomegaly , which was somewhat tender .
The neurological examination aside from the blind right eye was unremarkable .
LABORATORY DATA :
Included a white blood count of 140,000 , 7% polys , 1% bands , 3% lymphs , 1% monos , 2 basos , 4 blasts , 76% pearl monocytes , 6% meta 's , 3 nucleated red blood cells .
There were some oval tear drop cells and target cells with a few schistocytes .
The platelet count was 9,000 , hematocrit was 26.5 , with an mean corpuscular volume of about 73 .
His prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time were normal .
His uric acid was up at 97 , his total bilirubin was up at 1.8 , his LDH was 428 , his phosphorus was 1.2 , calcium 8.6 , Digoxin level was 1.0 , potassium on admission was 2.9 , sodium 135 , BUN and creatinine 13/1.6 , and sugar of 267 .
A computerized tomography scan of his head showed no signs of an acute bleed , a chest X-ray showed no new infiltrates or masses .
There was cardiomegaly with prominent vascularity , but no effusions .
An electrocardiogram was consistent with atrial fibrillation .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the hospital and begun on high dose Hydroxyurea , with a gradual improvement in his white blood count over the next few days .
He did spike a fever and began Ancef and Gentamicin , although cultures never revealed a source for this .
He also tried Amicar and continued on low dose Prednisone .
His headache improved , but her remained profoundly weak and intermittently febrile with dyspnea .
There was hemoptysis and intermittent gastrointestinal bleeding , while he remained profoundly thrombocytopenia .
Transfusions of platelets did not change his platelet count , presumably because of sequestration and a massive spleen .
Amicar was of uncertain value , but used intermittently .
A bone marrow biopsy revealed the transformation of his CMML to acute myelogenous leukemia , and given his other underlying medical problems , we chose chemotherapy with subcutaneous Cystosine Arabinoside and 6-Thioguanine , which he tolerated without incident and this brought his white blood count down to below 1,000 , and his spleen shrank noticeably , but he still could not maintain a bump in platelet count with platelet transfusions .
He was intermittently congested limiting our ability to give intravenous fluid , for his hydrea , although we kept him on Allopurinol .
The renal function deteriorated somewhat , hampering our ability to give him his Gentamicin .
The family maintained an extraordinary vigil over the days of his hospitalization , providing him with some food and constant attention , while we awaited the results of his chemotherapy and treatment of his infection .
He was intermittently restless and somewhat confused , and as his respiratory status deteriorated , the family agreed to a low dose Morphine drip which made him much more comfortable .
They agreed with a do not resuscitate status early on in the hospitalization and in the course of being maintain on low dose Morphine , he ultimately expired on 2/28/94 with the family present .
No autopsy was obtained .

At about an hour and a half after the patient went home she became quite drowsy , nauseated and threw up .
She fell to the floor , choking on her vomit and was struggling to take a breath .
This was witnessed by her 12 year old daughter , who called the EMT 's .
The EMTs arrived approximately five minutes after the call , found her asystolic and apneic .
They intubated her .
In the field she was given Atropine , Epinephrine and converted to an idioventricular rhythm .
She then persisted to go into EMD and then spontaneously , which is quite unclear , to normal sinus rhythm with a pulse .
Her initial systolic blood pressure was 80 .
The patient was nonresponsive in the Ponta,itri- University Medical Center emergency room. , but her blood pressure was noted to be 105/62 .
In the emergency room she received charcoal and broad speculum antibiotics and Ativan for ? of seizure activity with repetitive mouth movements .
She was evaluated by the Neurological services at that time and felt that these mouth movements might be consistent with hypoxic myoclonus .
She was admitted to our CCU for further therapy .

HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient was initially admitted to the Coronary Care Unit .
Neurologically , she remained unresponsive until 3-3 , when she became progressively more awake and alert , moving all four extremities .
Her anoxic encephalopathy has improved .
She has been evaluated by our Neurological Services , who feel that per the Levy criteria , she has about a 75% chance of a good recovery with mild to moderate neurological impairment .
She will need much time to recover .
Currently , she improves every day and we are waiting for a magnetic resonance imaging to evaluate the presence of watershed cerebral infarcts .
Cardiovascular .
Initially she appeared volume-overloaded with central venous pressure in the 20's and chest x-rays that were significant for modest to moderate pulmonary edema .
She was diuresed and had an echocardiogram which showed an ejection fraction of 57% , no segmental wall motion abnormality , and no valvular disease and her rhythms have remained stable in normal sinus rhythm .
Pulmonary .
When she was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit , she was on minimal vent settings for airway protection .

LABORATORY DATA :
Coagulation profile notable for a PT 18 , PTT 36.7 and an INR of 2.4 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted and begun on cefotetan and Flagyl , as well as heparin .
Her INR dropped to 1.6 prior to surgery , and her PTT was in the mid 80s prior to surgery .
She was admitted and placed on a bowel prep two days before surgery and was taken to the Operating Room on hospital day # 3 , 10/28/97 .
At that time , she underwent sigmoid colectomy and ventral hernia repair . ( A full account of this operation can be found in the Operative Note ) .
She tolerated this procedure without complications initially and was taken to the Recovery Room in stable condition .
Postoperatively , she had her heparin restarted , and had a PTT rising to 142.8 and then down to 92 .
Her primary postoperative development was the passage of some blood clots and blood per rectum on postoperative day # 2 .
She continued to pass blood per rectum and was transfused with one unit of packed red blood cells .
Her preoperative hematocrit was 41 and her hematocrit dropped to 30.4 on postoperative day # 2 .
This was a drop from an immediate postoperative hematocrit of 35.4 .
Upon receiving the one unit of red blood cells , her hematocrit returned to 33 , and in the two days subsequent to the transfusion , returned to 34 .
Otherwise , her postoperative course was uneventful with gradual resolution of the passage of blood per rectum .
Her heparin was discontinued when it was noted that she was bleeding per rectum and her PTT drifted to a normal range of 35 by postoperative day # 3 .
On postoperative day # 1 , the patient was restarted on 2 mg of Coumadin .
However , due to the episode of bleeding on postoperative day # 2 , the Coumadin was held for two consecutive days , and then restarted on postoperative day # 4 .
At this time , she is given 3 mg and was gradually increased to her regular regimen of 4 mg alternating with 3 mg.
The patient 's INR had dropped to 1.7 at the time of operation , and remained in this range initially , but began to rise to 2.0 with her Coumadin dosing .
At the time of discharge , it was 1.9 , for which she received 4 mg.
On the next day , it was 1.6 and she returned to a normal dosing of 4 mg followed by outpatient draws to determine the further Coumadin dosing .
This was postoperative day # 6 , at which time she is ready for discharge .
The rest of her hospital course was unremarkable , with perioperative ampicillin , gentamicin and Flagyl discontinued on postoperative day # 1 .
She had some initial nausea but had no emesis .
Her nasogastric tube was discontinued on postoperative day # 1 , and she tolerated a regular diet by postoperative day # 3 .
She had flatus and regular bowel movements by postoperative day # 5 .
She also complained of some slight dizziness upon getting up .
For this reason , her normal Lopressor and Norvasc were held .
It was felt that this was re-equalibration after being sedentary and mostly in bed following the operation .
She had some slight headaches which resolved with Tylenol , and the dizziness resolved as well .
She was ready for discharge on postoperative day # 6 .
Her wound remained benign and was healing nicely at the time of discharge .

PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
None
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
This is one of several Ponta,itri- University Medical Center admissions for this 74-year old female with multiple medical problems who developed multiple myeloma with bench Jones proteinuria over one year ago .
There were lytic lesions seen in her bones and the patient was started on intermittent courses of melphalan with Prednisone .
She had a partial response , but continued to have inappropriate amounts of gamma globulins in her blood and urine and remained anemic and poorly responsive to erythropoietin .
The patient has had one previous admission for the same symptoms a couple of months ago that she came in with this time , namely generalized weakness which in fact has on both occasions been accompanied by progressively worsening renal insufficiency .
The weakness is non focal although since she has had chronic problems with pain in her legs for uncertain reasons she was having difficulty walking .
Her appetite was gone .
She was having some nausea .
No recent history of a change in her medicines or lapse in them .
No changes in her breathing .
She did not seem sleepy or confused .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
blood pressure 130/40 , heart rate 78 regular .
Weight 132 , ( had been 126 one year previously ) .
Temperature 97 .
The patient was pale with a fine tremor of her upper extremities .
She could walk hesitantly for a few steps , was anicteric , lucid , not tachypneic .
She has flat affect at baseline and does not give may clues about somatic distress when she has some .
Her lungs were clear .
heart ; without murmur or gallop .
Her jugular venous pressure was four to five centimeters of water , carotid upstrokes normal .
soft , non tender abdomen with normal bowel sounds .
No hepatosplenomegaly or masses .
She had 2+ edema of the ankles without tender cords or erythema .
She was moving all four extremities .
Her cranial nerves were grossly intact to inspection .
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION :
Hematocrit 24.6 , white count 4.0 , platelet count 170,000 , normal differential , sodium 143 , potassium 5.7 , chloride 113 , carbon dioxide 18.9 , BUN and creatinine 71/5.2 , glucose 177 .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient was admitted to the Ponta,itri- University Medical Center as a front door admission and although her electrocardiogram is equivocal , a second potassium also came back elevated so she was treated with two doses of sodium K-exulate with improvement of her potassium to within normal limits .
Over the following days , she was gently hydrated .
Her urine was alkalinized using intravenous and later oral sodium bicarbonate and her creatinine rose to a high of about 5.8 .
She was seen by the nephrology service and it was deemed quite likely that the acute and chronic renal insufficiency that had progressed causing this admission was related to her myeloma kidney .
In the weeks prior to admission she had just begun thalidomide orally as a salvage treatment for her myeloma .
She tolerated without sedation but probably was not at a therapeutic dose and it had had no impact by the time of her admission .
The patient , her son Randdor So and I had several long conversations about the potential for further renal deterioration and need for hemodialysis .
The family and the patient felt quite clearly that hemodialysis was not indicated if the underlying myeloma was not controllable .
They did agree , however to one more attempt at pulse Decadron therapy with consists of oral Decadron forty mgs PO q.day ( in divided doses ) for four consecutive days followed by four days off , followed by four days on , etc. for a total of eight sessions of four days of Decadron on .
By the time she had left she had completed only the first of the four consecutive days as expected her blood sugars went up into high 300's or 400s and she needed sliding scale regular insulin in addition to standing doses of NPH .
On the days when she was not on Decadron the standing doses of NPH were sometimes suspended because her blood sugars would get to 41 and she would have remarkably few symptoms in this setting , perhaps related to the low dose beta blockers that she also takes .
There had been a slight down turn in her creatinine by discharge to 4.7 but there was concern that she could not tolerate any greater hydration rates due to crackles in her bases although her jugular venous pressure went about six and she was never symptomatic with fluid overload .
Potassium did not appear to be a problem throughout the rest of her hospitalization .
She was also seen by the pain service who was baffled by the cause for her lower extremity leg pain that has been present for several years , not progressive , minimally responsive to narcotics and currently on a second trial of Neurontin of dubious value and would probably by the first medicine that I discontinue if she was feeling too sleepy or weak .
The problem may be a combination of degenerative joint disease with spinal stenosis as well as neuropathic changes from diabetes +/- her myeloma .
The patient also requested to be do not resuscitate , do not intubate and this was also in agreement with her son So .
The patient is transferred to a skilled nursing facility to continue the pulses of Decadron under close monitoring for blood sugars insulin regulation and to see that her potassium does not worsen and that perhaps her creatinine will improve a slight bit more , although probably not come back to normal .
She will finish her last planned pulse of Decadron by about November 25 , 2003 at which point depending on her creatinine and her status we may or may not elect further such treatments .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
1. heparin 5000 units subQ b.i.d.
2. clonazepam 0.5 mgs PO q.h.s.
3. risperidone 3 mgs PO q.h.s.
4. regular insulin on a sliding scale as detailed in discharge medication orders , but essentially no insulin for blood sugars less than 200 but from 201 to 250 give four units subQ , 251 to 300 give six units subQ , from 301 to 350 give eight units subQ , from 351 to 400 give ten units subQ , and if over 400 give twelve units subQ.
she also has standing doses of insulin NPH ten in the morning , ten in the evening and tentatively these will only be used during the days of high Decadron and perhaps should not be used on the days without Decadron .
5. Metoprolol titrate 12.5 mgs PO b.i.d.
6. Calcium acetate ( Phos-Lo ) 667 mgs PO t.i.d.
7. Trazodone 25 mics PO q.h.s.
8. Neurontin 100 mics PO q.h.s.
9. Dilaudid 1-2 mgs PO q6h prn for leg pain .
10. Colace 100 mgs PO t.i.d.
11. Senna two tablets PO b.i.d.
12. Dexamethasone one the scheduled days will be 20 mgs PO b.i.d. with food for four consecutive days alternating with four days off and four days on .
The next start of the four days of pulse dexamethasone will be on Wednesday , Oct 6 , 2003 and should complete itself by November 25 , 2003 .
13. Ranitidine 75 mgs PO b.i.d.
14. Sodium bicarbonate 650 mgs PO t.i.d.
15. Hydrocortisone 2.5 percent cream to facial seborrheic dermatitis b.i.d.
16. Furosemide 40 mgs PO b.i.d.
The patient should probably have daily weights to make sure that she is not getting fluid overloaded and should aim for an oral intake of clear liquids of at least two liters PO q.day to help continue flushing her kidneys .
The patient was discharged in stable satisfactory condition .
The patient should have an arranged visit to see Dr. Lyn Ralekote in the hematology oncology clinic ( 692 ) 673 3025 on approximately Friday , Oct 15 , 2003 LYN MEARD SCALE , M.D.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This 82-year-old gentleman was admitted on 01/24/02 with stuttering chest pain .
Mr. Kulrinne has a history of cardiac risk factors , including hypertension , hyperlipidemia , obesity .
He had developed intermittent chest pressure with exertion since last fall .
He was placed on cardiac medications after a stress test had revealed reversible defects in the anteroseptal and apical leads .
On medications , he continued to have some discomfort , although this was not quite clear from the outpatient setting .
An attempt at medical management was continued .
However , the patient developed crescendo pattern angina pectoris and presented on the day of admission .

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION :
Blood pressure 112 , Sa02 96% , afebrile .
Lungs clear .
S1 , S2 .
No significant murmurs .
Abdomen :
Obese and soft .
Extremities :
Without edema .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the floor with variable changes in his EKG .
He became pain free in the Emergency Room and was initially admitted to Evinlandcalco Hospital .
However , he developed recurrent chest discomfort on the floor with worsening of his anterior ST segments with elevation , and he was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory .
In the cardiac catheterization laboratory , right heart catheterization showed RA 7 , RV 36/9 , wedge 16 .
He was treated with Integrelin in addition to his intravenous heparin , aspirin , and nitrates .
He was found to have the left anterior descending occluded proximally with right to left collaterals .
The circumflex was codominant with severe 90% lesion proximally in the circumflex and 50% lesion in a large OM .
The right coronary artery was codominant and had an ostial stenosis in the 70% range .
Left ventriculography revealed an akinetic anterolateral wall .
A balloon pump was placed and right heart catheterization was performed showing the above .
The patient developed worsening ST elevation on the monitor and the decision was made to go ahead and open the left anterior descending .
The procedure was reasonably complicated in that the left anterior descending had poor re-flow and two stents needed to be placed , as there was a second lesion in the mid left anterior descending .
The distal vessel was quite diseased and poor with regard to vessel quality and caliber .
A good result was obtained with a stent in the proximal left anterior descending and a stent in the mid left anterior descending and the patient went to the Intensive Care Unit on a balloon pump , intubated .
His peak CPK was in the 3000 range .
The patient developed hemoptysis while intubated and on Integrelin and heparin .
He underwent bronchoscopy , which showed no specific lesion .
In addition , chest CT showed no obvious reason for his hemoptysis , with the exception of atelectasis .
It was felt that perhaps the patient had atelectasis and perhaps some aspiration , which predisposed him to hemoptysis .
In addition , the patient had confusion and delirium .
Head CT was without any obvious intracranial catastrophe .
He was seen in consultation by the Neurology and Psychiatry services and felt to have cognitive deficits and was ultimately controlled and managed with a combination of Seroquel and Haldol .
In addition , the patient had a sitter during parts of his hospital course to keep him oriented .
The patient had a return to the cardiac catheterization lab on 2/2/02 to receive a stent to the tight circumflex .
This was uneventful , without the need for intubation , etc , and the procedure went smoothly .
He tolerated it well .
The ostial right coronary was a relatively small vessel for the patient and was not approached this admission .
The patient was transferred to Evinlandcalco Hospital .
He had difficulties with urinary incontinence and required straight catheterization for post-void residuals up until the time of this dictation .
He was still having 300 cc or so post-void remaining in his bladder .
He is followed by Dr. Squithsherl in this regard .
At the time of this dictation , the plan is for probable transfer to a rehabilitation facility for physical therapy .
He has had no recurrent heart angina pectoris or heart failure .
Of note , cardiac echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction in the 40% range with apical akinesis .

She had been feeling well until one day prior to admission .
she developed a headache above her left eye .
It was not significant enough for her to take any notice , and she was able to fall asleep without difficulty .
At 4am she awoke with a severe diffuse headache that radiated down her neck .
She denied any photophobia , nausea , vomiting , sick contacts , fevers , chills , sweats .
When she presented to the ED concern was greatest for SAH .
Head CT was negative , so an LP was done .
Had 11 WBC , negative gram stain .
Pt was admitted for antibiotics while awaiting culture results .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1. ID - was treated with cefotaxime , ampicillin , vancomycin .
she remained afebrile , and her headache resolved soon after the lumbar puncture .
she did have several monocytes in her CSF , so AFB cultures were sent .
the results were pending at the time of discharge .
by 48 hours her cx were negative , so abx were stopped .
is most likely a viral source , but there is a small chance it is from her asa .
will restart in one week .
denies any ibuprofen use .
2. CV - has hypertension .
home dose of captopril is 50 bid .
also taking hctz .
started k-dur because of mild hypokalemia .
3. PULM - on admission cxr had a nodule in the RUL .
pt had a follow-up chest CT .
there was concern that she could have old TB , given that she is from dalebile and had a known exposure many years ago .
the chest CT was negative .
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS :
1. We have added a medication , pepcid , to try to help your abdominal pain .
2. We have also added K-dur , which is a potassium supplement .

6. Synthroid , 100 mcg. q.a.m.
7. Ditropan XL , 10 mg.
8. Imodium , 2 mg. q.a.m.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Examination reveals that the patient is walking with a mild limp .
The left hip is a bit stiff with flexion to 90 degrees .
She has 10 degrees of internal rotation and external rotation .
Pulses are fine .
IMAGING :
X-rays were reviewed .
They showed advanced arthritis of the left hip .
RECOMMENDATIONS :
Dr. Etteme Overall recommended that the patient have a total hip replacement on the left side on February 2 , 2003 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Please refer to the operative note by Dr. Etteme Overall for details of the procedure .
Postoperatively , the patient was transferred to the floor in stable condition for observation , pain control and mobilization .
Initially postoperatively , she was doing quite well , though she did require four liters of oxygen postoperatively to maintain her oxygen saturations .
It was hoped that she would wean off the oxygen over the course of the next few hours .
However , she did require four liters of oxygen all the way through the night to maintain oxygen saturations of 93% .
Without oxygen , she dropped down to the low 80s .
Given the unusual nature of this oxygen requirement , the patient underwent work-up with a chest X-ray , which essentially was normal .
An ABG revealed a normal PCO2 of 32 , but a decrease in PO2- at 62 .
Therefore , given her history of breast cancer , the patient was taken for a spiral CT scan and the Medicine Service was consulted at that time .
They agreed with our plan .
On spiral CT scan , a small pulmonary embolus was seen in the right upper lobe and the left low er lobe .
She was started on heparin at that time to maintain a PTT of 60 t o 80 , and was given doses of Coumadin , in addition to the Coumadin she had been given for DVT prophylaxis .
With the recommendation of the medicine te am , we decided to maintain an INR of 2 to 3 with an overlap of heparin when the patient was therapeutic for two to three days .
She continued to do quite well even though we did keep her on bed rest for three days while she was heparinized .
Her oxygen saturations continued to improve to the point that she was on room air on postoperative day four with oxygen saturation of 95% .
She was given perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis for 48 hours after surgery .
She was mobilized on postoperative day four , getting out of bed , able to do quite well on her new hip with a minimal amount of pain .
She was given posterior hip dislocation precautions at that time , which she understood quite well .
She continued to be followed by the medical team and was watched very closely by the orthopedic team until we felt comfortable that she was breathing quite well and was mobilizing well with physical therapy .
Therefore , it was decided at that time that the patient was ready for discharge to rehabilitation on Coumadin , which would be monitored for six months to maintain an INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
The patient will continue all of her pre-admission medications , though no nonsteroidal analgesics , e.g. , aspirin or ibuprofen , will be given while she is on Coumadin therapy .
1. Colace , 100 mg. PO t.i.d.
2. Percocet , one to two tablets PO q.3 to 4 hours p.r.n. pain .
3. Coumadin with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .
Please prescribe 2 mg. tablets .
The patient will be on Coumadin for six months given her history of pulmonary embolus .
DISCHARGE PLAN :
Coumadin for six months postoperatively with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .
Check INR three times a week until stable .
Please call the results to Dr. Viennee Ester , the patient 's primary-care physician , who has agreed to follow her INR levels for the remainder of the six months .
Dr. Viennee Ester is located in Tlandcousti Lo Vuclark , where the patient is from originally .
The patient will call Dr. Overall 's office to arrange a follow-up appointment six weeks from the day of surgery .
Staples can be removed 10 to 14 days postoperatively .
Please hold removal if the wound is draining .
The patient may shower once the incision is dry , and may bathe and / or swim after the staples have been removed and there is no wound drainage .
Partial weight-bearing with crutches or a walker with posterior hip dislocation precautions for three months following surgery .
These precautions have been explained and demonstrated to the patient .
The patient has been instructed to call Dr. Overall 's office or the orthopedist on call with any questions or concerns about increasing pain , swelling , redness , wound drainage , fevers or chills at 094-897-3231 .

Admission Date :

Report Status :
Signed
Discharge Date :
08/23/1996
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
PLACENTA PREVIA .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 33 year old gravida 7 , para 2 , TAB 4 , at 30 and 6/7 weeks on admission with a known complete previa who presented for her second bleeding per vagina today , on the day of admission .
The patient was a PRGH admit on 07/30 , 07/29/96 for first bleeding episode .
She was beta complete during that admission and followed in the special OB Clinic since discharge on 07/31/96 .
The patient had a bleeding episode on 8/9 but told no one and it resolved spontaneously .
On 8/19 , the patient had bleeding per vagina with two pads , denied any abdominal pain or contractions .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Noncontributory .
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :
None .
MEDICATIONS :
Prenatal vitamins .
ALLERGIES :
No known drug allergies .
PAST OBSTETRICAL HISTORY :
In 1981 , the patient had a TAB in the first trimester .
In 1987 , full term normal spontaneous vaginal delivery of 6 pound male .
In 1988 , first trimester TAB .
In 1991 , first trimester TAB .
In 1990 , one full term normal spontaneous vaginal delivery , 8 pound male .
In 1992 , first trimester TAB .
Current pregnancy .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Afebrile with stable vital signs .
Fetal heart rate in the 140 range .
Abdomen was soft , non-tender , no palpable contractions .
Vaginal pad showed no bleeding .
LABORATORY DATA :
Hematocrit of 36.8 .
RH status is positive .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted and followed closely on strict bed rest .
Fetal tracing was reassuring .
The patient was beta complete on 08/01 .
Pediatric consult was done during last admission , normal survey , size equal to dates .
The patient was observed on the floor .
On hospital day two , the patient had another small bleed which resolved spontaneously .
There were no contractions .
The baby 's fetal heart tracing was in the 130 range to 140 range , not formally reactive but with great short term and long term variability .
After this episode , there was no further bleeding and after three additional days at bed rest , the patient , against our advice , decided to go home .
A long discussion including Dr. Darlri Kynetlandpryde and the Haenlodstate Medical Center discussed with the patient the risks of leaving the hospital given a complete previa with several known bleeds in the past as well as instability .
The patient understood all risks involved including significant maternal hemorrhage and poor fetal well being .
In spite of these potentially serious risks to her and the baby she felt she wanted to be at home .
We reminded her that even though she lives 15 minutes away , if she stays in the hospital we can act faster to put in an iv , give her fluids and blood , and perform a c / s if necessary than if she has to come in from home and those few minutes can make a difference between a good and bad outcome .
She accepted these risks and opted to be discharged home today .
She has offered that she has plenty of care at home including a housekeeper and will be able to remain on bed rest and live in Arvmelapho and knows to immediately come to the hospital for any bleeding .
She has family members who will be with her at home and will keep the phone number for the ambulance by the phone .
Therefore , the plan was for the patient to be discharged home today on strict bed rest with all precautions given .
The patient will follow-up in one week in the Special OB Clinic .
MEDICATIONS :
On discharge included prenatal vitamins .
