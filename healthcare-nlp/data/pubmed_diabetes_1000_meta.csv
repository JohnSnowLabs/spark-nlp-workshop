0,PMC3312572,"The pituitary gland and infundibulum can be involved in a variety of medical conditions, including infiltrative diseases, fungal infections, tuberculosis, and primary and metastatic tumors. Metastases to the pituitary gland are absolutely rare, and they are generally secondary to pulmonary carcinoma in men and breast carcinoma in women. Pituitary metastases more commonly affect the posterior lobe and the infundibulum than the anterior lobe. The posterior lobe involvement may explain why patients with pituitary metastases frequently present with diabetes insipidus. We are presenting a case report of a 78-year-old male patient who had metastatic prostate with sudden onset of polyuria and persistent thirst. He had no electrolyte imbalance except mild hypernatremia. The MRI scan of the brain yielded a suspicious area in pituitary gland. A pituitary stalk metastasis was found on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of pituitary. Water deprivation test was compatible with DI. A clinical response to nasal vasopressin was achieved and laboratory results revealed central diabetes insipidus. As a result, the intrasellar and suprasellar masses decreased in size, and urinary output accordingly decreased.",2012 Mar 18,Metastatic Prostate Adenocarcinoma Presenting Central Diabetes Insipidus,Case Reports in Medicine
1,PMC7730786,"Current evidence suggests that the information needs of people with diabetes mellitus differ across patient groups. With a view to being able to provide individualized information, this study aims to identify (i) the diabetes-related information needs of people with diabetes mellitus; (ii) different subgroups of people with specific information needs; and (iii) associated characteristics of the identified subgroups, such as sociodemographic characteristics, diabetes-related comorbidities, and well-being.
This cross-sectional study was based on data from 837 respondents with diabetes mellitus who participated in the population-based KORA (Cooperative Health Research in the Augsburg Region) Health Survey 2016 in Southern Germany (KORA GEFU 4 study) (45.6% female, mean age 71.1 years, 92.8% Type 2 diabetes). Diabetes-related information needs were assessed with a questionnaire asking about patients’ information needs concerning 11 diabetes-related topics, e.g. ‘long-term complications’ and ‘treatment/therapy’. Subgroups of people with different information needs and associated characteristics were identified using latent class analysis.
We identified the following four classes of people with different information needs: ‘high needs on all topics’, ‘low needs on all topics’, ‘moderate needs with a focus on complications and diabetes in everyday life’, and ‘advanced needs with a focus on social and legal aspects and diabetes research’. The classes differed significantly in age, years of education, type of diabetes, diabetes duration, diabetes-related comorbidities, smoking behaviour, diabetes education, current level of information, and time preference.
Knowledge about different patient subgroups can be useful for tailored information campaigns or physician-patient interactions. Further research is needed to analyse health care needs in these groups, changes in information needs over the course of the disease, and prospective health outcomes.

2,PMC6913526,"Ethnic minority populations exhibit disproportionately high rates of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Electronic health tools have the potential to facilitate the cultural adaptation and tailoring of T2DM education to improve the knowledge and management of diabetes mellitus (DM).
This study aimed (1) to develop an adaptable Interactive Lifestyle Assessment, Counseling, and Education (I-ACE) software to support dietitian-delivered lifestyle counseling among low-socioeconomic status (SES) ethnic minority patients with T2DM and (2) to evaluate its effect on DM-related dietary knowledge and management compared with standard lifestyle advice (SLA) in a randomized controlled trial (RCT).
The I-ACE software, developed in consultation with clinical dieticians, incorporates evidence-based dietary and physical activity (PA) recommendations and educational materials. The features and behavioral change techniques include quantitative lifestyle (dietary intake and PA) assessment and simulation, individually tailored education and recommendations, motivational interviewing, and goal setting. For the unblinded pilot RCT, 50 overweight or obese Arab adults (aged 40-62 years) with poorly controlled T2DM were recruited from primary care clinics and randomly assigned to receive 4 in-person, dietician-delivered counseling sessions over 6 months using either (1) the I-ACE tool (experimental arm) or (2) the SLA methods (comparison arm). All outcome assessments were face-to-face. DM-related dietary knowledge (primary outcome) was measured at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months. Lifestyle and other parameters were measured before, during, and after the intervention. Multiple linear regression and repeated measures linear mixed models were used to compare the changes in study outcomes and explore time trends in between-group and within-group changes.
A total of 25 participants were enrolled in each arm, of whom 24 and 21 completed the final assessment of the primary outcome in the I-ACE and SLA arms, respectively. DM-related lifestyle knowledge increased more rapidly in the I-ACE arm than in the SLA arm (P value for study arm×time interaction=.02). Within the I-ACE arm, the mean (SE) differences in added sugar and dietary fiber intakes from baseline to 12 months were −2.6% (SE 1.0%) of total energy (P=.03) and 2.7 (SE 0.0) g/1000 kcal (P=.003), respectively. The odds of engaging in any leisure PA at 12 months tended to be higher in the I-ACE arm versus SLA arm, but did not reach statistical significance (odds ratio 2.8; 95% CI 0.7-11.6; P=.16). Both arms exhibited significant reductions in HbA1c (P value for change over time <.001).
The use of the I-ACE software in a 6-month, 4-session dietician-delivered lifestyle counseling intervention improved the efficiency of lifestyle education, compared with SLA, among low-SES, ethnic minority patients with T2DM. This pilot trial provides justification for conducting a large-scale trial to evaluate its effectiveness and applicability in routine clinical care among ethnically diverse populations.

3,PMC4653349,"Recently, imbalance in the vasopressin (AVP) system, measured as elevated levels of copeptin (the C-terminal part of the AVP pro-hormone) in plasma, was linked to the development of abdominal obesity and diabetes mellitus (DM). Here, we aim to investigate if the genetic variation of the human AVP receptor 1b gene (AVPR1B) is associated with measures of obesity and DM.
Malmö Diet and Cancer study (MDC) is a population-based prospective cohort examined 1991–1996.
Four tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs: rs35810727, rs28373064, rs35439639, rs35608965) of AVPR1B were genotyped in the cardiovascular cohort (n=6103) of MDC (MDC-CC) and associated with measures of obesity and DM. Significant SNPs were replicated in another 24 344 MDC individuals (MDC replication cohort).
In MDC-CC, the major allele of rs35810727 was associated with elevated BMI (β-coefficient±s.e.m.; 0.30±0.14, P=0.03) and waist (0.78±0.36, P=0.03) after age and gender adjustment. The association with BMI was replicated in the MDC replication cohort (0.21±0.07, P=0.003), whereas that with waist was not significant. In MDC-CC there was no association between the major allele of rs35810727 and DM, but in the complete MDC cohort (n=30 447) the major allele of rs35810727 was associated with DM (OR (95% CI); 1.10 (1.00–1.20), P=0.04).

4,PMC8606862,"Deterioration in glucose homeostasis has been associated with intestinal dysbiosis, but it is not known how metabolic dysregulation alters the gastrointestinal environment. We investigated how the progression of diabetes alters ileal and colonic epithelial mucosal structure, microbial abundance, and transcript expression in the University of California Davis Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (UCD‐T2DM) rat model. Male UCD‐T2DM rats (age ~170 days) were included if <1‐month (n = 6, D1M) or 3‐month (n = 6, D3M) post‐onset of diabetes. Younger nondiabetic UCD‐T2DM rats were included as a nondiabetic comparison (n = 6, ND, age ~70 days). Ileum villi height/crypt depths and colon crypt depths were assessed by histology. Microbial abundance of colon content was measured with 16S rRNA sequencing. Ileum and colon transcriptional abundances were analyzed using RNA sequencing. Ileum villi height and crypt depth were greater in D3M rats compared to ND. Colon crypt depth was greatest in D3M rats compared to both ND and D1M rats. Colon abundances of Akkermansia and Muribaculaceae were lower in D3M rats relative to D1M, while Oscillospirales, Phascolarctobacterium, and an unidentified genus of Lachnospiraceae were higher. Only two transcripts were altered by diabetes advancement within the colon; however, 2039 ileal transcripts were altered. Only colonic abundances of Sptlc3, Enpp7, Slc7a15, and Kctd14 had more than twofold changes between D1M and D3M rats. The advancement of diabetes in the UCD‐T2DM rat results in a trophic effect on the mucosal epithelia and was associated with regulation of gastrointestinal tract RNA expression, which appears more pronounced in the ileum relative to the colon.
The advancement of diabetes in the UC Davis Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (UCD‐T2DM) rat model results in a trophic effect on the mucosal epithelia. Diabetes was also associated with regulation of gastrointestinal tract RNA expression, which appears more pronounced in the ileum relative to the colon. The UCD‐T2DM rat spontaneously develops diabetes while consuming standard chow, thus, these changes may be diabetes specific.",2021 Nov 21,Progression of diabetes is associated with changes in the ileal transcriptome and ileal‐colon morphology in the UC Davis Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus rat,Physiological Reports
5,PMC8756324,"We aimed to determine the hospital‐based prevalence and clinical features of fulminant type 1 diabetes mellitus in Korea.
We identified all patients with diabetes who regularly visited the Endocrinology outpatient clinics at eight centers for a period >1 year between January 2012 and June 2017. We investigated their medical records retrospectively.
During this period, 76,309 patients with diabetes had been regularly followed up. Among them, 913 (1.2%) patients had type 1 diabetes mellitus . There were 462 patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus whose data at the time of the first diagnosis could be identified (359 and 103 with non‐ketosis and ketosis onset, respectively). Of these, 15 (3.2% of type 1 diabetes mellitus, 14.6% of ketosis onset diabetes) patients had fulminant type 1 diabetes mellitus. The median ages at diagnosis were 40 and 27 years in the fulminant type 1 diabetes mellitus and non‐fulminant type 1 diabetes mellitus groups, respectively. The patients with fulminant type 1 diabetes mellitus had higher body mass index, lower glycated hemoglobin and fasting/peak C‐peptide, and lower frequent glutamic acid decarboxylase antibody‐positive rate (P =0.0010) at diagnosis. Furthermore, they had lower glycated hemoglobin at the last follow‐up examination than those with non‐fulminant type 1 diabetes mellitus.
In this study, the prevalence of type 1 diabetes mellitus was 1.2% among all patients with diabetes, and that of fulminant type 1 diabetes mellitus was 3.2% among those newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes mellitus. The glycated hemoglobin levels were lower in patients with fulminant type 1 diabetes mellitus than in those with non‐fulminant type 1 diabetes mellitus at diagnosis and at the last follow‐up examination.

6,PMC7245830,"Although important advances in treatment strategies have been developed in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), large gaps exist in achieving glycemic control and preventing complications, particularly in low-and middle-income countries, which suggests a potential effect of social determinants of health (SDH, i.e., education level and socioeconomic status). However, few studies have determined the role of SDH and other determinants of health (ODH, i.e., diabetes knowledge and self-care scores) in achieving T2DM goals during effective multidisciplinary interventions. We aimed to examine a multicomponent integrated care (MIC) program on diabetes care goals and determine the effect of SDH and ODH on T2DM patients.
A before-and-after design (a pretest, a 5-month intervention, and a follow-up) was used in a T2DM population from Mexico City. The SDH included education level and socioeconomic status; the ODH included diabetes knowledge, self-care scores, and deltas (i.e., differences between baseline and follow-up scores). The triple-target goal (glycated hemoglobin, blood pressure, and LDL-cholesterol) was established as a measurement of T2DM goals.
The DIABEMPIC (DIABetes EMPowerment and Improvement of Care) intervention (n = 498) reduced the glycated hemoglobin levels (mean reduction 2.65%, standard deviation [SD]: 2.02%) and cardiometabolic parameters; it also improved health-related quality of life. From 1.81% at baseline, 25.9% of participants (p-value< 0.001) achieved the triple-target goal. We found a significant association between education level (p-value = 0.010), diabetes knowledge at baseline (p-value = 0.004), and self-care scores at baseline (p-value = 0.033) in the delta (change between baseline and follow-up assessments) of HbA1c levels. Improvements (increase) in diabetes knowledge (p-value = 0.006) and self-care scores (p-value = 0.002) were also associated with greater reductions in HbA1c.
MIC strategies in urban primary care settings contribute to control of T2DM. SDH, such as education level, and ODH (diabetes knowledge and self-care scores at baseline) play a key role in improving glycemic control in these settings.",2020 May 24,Role of social and other determinants of health in the effect of a multicomponent integrated care strategy on type 2 diabetes mellitus,International Journal for Equity in Health
7,PMC7146037,"Background: Diabetes is referred to a group of diseases characterized by high glucose levels in blood. It is caused by a deficiency in the production or function of insulin or both, which can occur because of different reasons, resulting in protein and lipid metabolic disorders. The aim of this study was to systematically review the prevalence and incidence of type 1 diabetes in the world. 
Methods: A systematic search of resources was conducted to investigate the prevalence and incidence of type 1 diabetes in the world. The databases of Medline (via PubMed and Ovid),ProQuest, Scopus, and Web of Science from January 1980 to September 2019 were searched to locate English articles. The located articles were screened in multiple levels of title, abstract,and full-text and final studies that met the inclusion criteria were retrieved and included in the study. 
Results: From 1202 located articles, 193 studies were included in this systematic review. The results of meta-analysis showed that the incidence of type 1 diabetes was 15 per 100,000 people and the prevalence was 9.5% (95% CI: 0.07 to 0.12) in the world, which was statistically significant. 
Conclusion: According to the results, the incidence and prevalence of type 1 diabetes are increasing in the world. As a result, insulin will be difficult to access and afford, especially in underdeveloped and developing countries.",2020 Mar 30,Prevalence and incidence of type 1 diabetes in the world: a systematic review and meta-analysis,Health Promotion Perspectives
8,PMC4783042,"Different studies have produced conflicting results regarding the association between smoking and diabetes mellitus, and detailed analysis of this issue in Chinese males based on nationwide samples is lacking. We explored the association between cigarette smoking and newly-diagnosed diabetes mellitus (NDM) in Chinese males using a population-based case-control analysis; 16,286 male participants without previously diagnosed diabetes were included. Prediabetes and NDM were diagnosed using the oral glucose tolerance test. The cohort included 6,913 non-smokers (42.4%), 1,479 ex-smokers (9.1%) and 7,894 current smokers (48.5%). Age-adjusted glucose concentrations (mmol/L) were significantly lower at fasting and 120 min in current smokers than non-smokers (5.25 vs. 5.30, 6.46 vs. 6.55, respectively, both P < 0.01). After adjustment for demographic and behavioral variables (age, region, alcohol consumption status, physical activity, education, and family history of diabetes), logistic regression revealed significant negative associations between smoking and NDM in males of a normal weight (BMI < 25 kg/m2: adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.75, P = 0.007; waist circumference < 90 cm: AOR = 0.71, P = 0.001) and males living in southern China (AOR = 0.75, P = 0.009), but not in males who were overweight/obese, males with central obesity, or males living in northern China. Compared to non-smokers, current smokers were less likely to be centrally obese or have elevated BP (AOR: 0.82 and 0.74, both P < 0.05), and heavy smokers (≥ 20 pack-years) were less likely to have elevated TG (AOR = 0.84, P = 0.012) among males of a normal weight. There were no significant associations between quitting smoking and metabolic disorders either among males of a normal weight or males who were overweight/obese. In conclusion, smokers have a lower likelihood of NDM than non-smokers among Chinese males with a lower BMI/smaller waist.",2016 Mar 8,Cigarette Smoking Is Associated with a Lower Prevalence of Newly Diagnosed Diabetes Screened by OGTT than Non-Smoking in Chinese Men with Normal Weight,PLoS ONE
9,PMC5471766,"The prevalence of diabetes in children and adolescents is increasing worldwide, with profound implications on the long-term health of individuals, societies, and nations. The diagnosis and management of diabetes in youth presents several unique challenges. Although type 1 diabetes is more common among children and adolescents, the incidence of type 2 diabetes in youth is also on the rise, particularly among certain ethnic groups. In addition, less common types of diabetes such as monogenic diabetes syndromes and diabetes secondary to pancreatopathy (in some parts of the world) need to be accurately identified to initiate the most appropriate treatment. A detailed patient history and physical examination usually provides clues to the diagnosis. However, specific laboratory and imaging tests are needed to confirm the diagnosis. The management of diabetes in children and adolescents is challenging in some cases due to age-specific issues and the more aggressive nature of the disease. Nonetheless, a patient-centered approach focusing on comprehensive risk factor reduction with the involvement of all concerned stakeholders (the patient, parents, peers and teachers) could help in ensuring the best possible level of diabetes control and prevention or delay of long-term complications.",2016 Nov 10,Challenges in diagnosis and management of diabetes in the young,Clinical Diabetes and Endocrinology
10,PMC6364380,"The alteration of water balance and related disorders has emerged as being strictly linked to the state of activation of the vasopressin–aquaporin-2 (vasopressin–AQP2) pathway. The lack of responsiveness of the kidney to the vasopressin action impairs its ability to concentrate the urine, resulting in polyuria, polydipsia, and risk of severe dehydration for patients. Conversely, non-osmotic release of vasopressin is associated with an increase in water permeability in the renal collecting duct, producing water retention and increasing the circulatory blood volume. This review highlights some of the new insights and recent advances in therapeutic intervention targeting the dysfunctions in the vasopressin–AQP2 pathway causing diseases characterized by water balance disorders such as congenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion, nephrogenic syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis, and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease.

The current document presents in summary form the results of this process, including the recommendations and the considerations taken into account in formulating them. In general terms, what is proposed here is a screening process using the Finnish Diabetes Risk Score questionnaire adapted to the Colombian population, which enables early diagnosis of the illness, and an algorithm for determining initial treatment that can be generalized to most patients with diabetes mellitus type 2 and that is simple to apply in a primary care context. In addition, several recommendations have been made to scale up pharmacological treatment in those patients that do not achieve the objectives or fail to maintain them during initial treatment.

13,PMC6826500,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and late-onset Alzheimer’s disease–dementia (LOAD) are increasing in global prevalence and current predictions indicate they will only increase over the coming decades. These increases may be a result of the concurrent increases of obesity and aging. T2DM is associated with cognitive impairments and metabolic factors, which increase the cellular vulnerability to develop an increased risk of age-related LOAD. This review addresses possible mechanisms due to obesity, aging, multiple intersections between T2DM and LOAD and mechanisms for the continuum of progression. Multiple ultrastructural images in female diabetic db/db models are utilized to demonstrate marked cellular remodeling changes of mural and glia cells and provide for the discussion of functional changes in T2DM. Throughout this review multiple endeavors to demonstrate how T2DM increases the vulnerability of the brain’s neurovascular unit (NVU), neuroglia and neurons are presented. Five major intersecting links are considered: i. Aging (chronic age-related diseases); ii. metabolic (hyperglycemia advanced glycation end products and its receptor (AGE/RAGE) interactions and hyperinsulinemia-insulin resistance (a linking linchpin); iii. oxidative stress (reactive oxygen–nitrogen species); iv. inflammation (peripheral macrophage and central brain microglia); v. vascular (macrovascular accelerated atherosclerosis—vascular stiffening and microvascular NVU/neuroglial remodeling) with resulting impaired cerebral blood flow.",2019 Sep 29,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Increases the Risk of Late-Onset Alzheimer’s Disease: Ultrastructural Remodeling of the Neurovascular Unit and Diabetic Gliopathy,Brain Sciences

The present study investigated the levels of adiponectin and pro‐inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor‐α (TNF‐α), interleukin‐1 beta (IL‐1β) and IL‐10 in Vietnamese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, and their correlations with clinical parameters of overweight and type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Based on body mass index, 73 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were categorized either as overweight or non‐overweight. As healthy controls, 57 overweight and non‐overweight individuals without type 2 diabetes mellitus were included. The adiponectin, TNF‐α, IL‐1β and IL‐10 levels were measured in the sera samples in all study participants by enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay and were correlated with clinical parameters.
The adiponectin levels were lower in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (2.5 ± 1.5 μg/mL) compared with controls (16 ± 18.6 μg/mL; P < 0.0001), and were decreased in overweight individuals compared with those who were not overweight. The TNF‐α and IL‐1β levels were increased, whereas the IL‐10 levels were decreased in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and in overweight controls compared with non‐overweight controls (P < 0.0001). The adiponectin levels were correlated with the TNF‐α, IL‐1β, IL‐10 levels, and the clinical parameters of overweight and type 2 diabetes mellitus.

They are known to cause immune-related adverse events (irAEs), which resemble autoimmune diseases. Anterior pituitary hypophysitis with secondary hypopituitarism is a frequently reported irAE, especially in patients receiving anti–CTLA4 treatment. In contrast, posterior pituitary involvement, such as central diabetes insipidus (DI), is relatively rare and is unreported in patients undergoing PD-1/PD-L1 blockade.
We describe a case of a 73-year-old man with Merkel cell carcinoma who received the anti–PD-L1 monoclonal antibody avelumab and achieved partial response. The patient developed nocturia, polydipsia, and polyuria 3 months after starting avelumab. Further laboratory testing revealed central DI. Avelumab was held and he received desmopressin for the management of central DI. Within 6 weeks after discontinuation of avelumab, the patient’s symptoms resolved and he was eventually taken off desmopressin. The patient remained off avelumab and there were no signs or symptoms of DI 2 months after the discontinuation of desmopressin.
To our knowledge, this is the first report of central DI associated with anti–PD-L1 immunotherapy. The patient’s endocrinopathy was successfully managed by holding treatment with the immune checkpoint inhibitor. This case highlights the importance of early screening and appropriate management of hormonal irAEs in subjects undergoing treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors to minimize morbidity and mortality.

The current study included 14 231 Chinese participants (mean age, 58.08 years) who were free from myocardial infarction and stroke at the time of survey participation (2006–2007 and 2008–2009). Participants were divided into 3 categories according to the 2‐year changes in pre–diabetes mellitus, defined by fasting plasma glucose: those with progression to diabetes mellitus, those with reversion from pre–diabetes mellitus to normoglycemia, and those with persistent pre–diabetes mellitus. Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and their 95% CIs for CVD and all‐cause mortality. After a median follow‐up period of 8.75 years, a total of 879 CVD events (including 180 myocardial infarction events and 713 stroke events) and 941 all‐cause mortality events were recorded. After adjustment for confounding factors, reversion from pre–diabetes mellitus to normoglycemia was associated with decreased risks of CVD (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.64–0.96), myocardial infarction (HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.40–0.97), stroke (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.63–0.98), and all‐cause mortality (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.68–0.99) compared with progression to diabetes mellitus.
Reversion from fasting plasma glucose–defined pre–diabetes mellitus to normoglycemia was associated with a reduction in the future risk of CVD and all‐cause mortality in a Chinese population.

20,PMC5214732,"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), defined as any degree of glucose intolerance with onset or first recognition during pregnancy, is characterized by underlying maternal defects in the β-cell response to insulin during pregnancy. Women with a previous history of GDM have a greater than 7-fold higher risk of developing postpartum diabetes compared with women without GDM. Various risk factors for postpartum diabetes have been identified, including maternal age, glucose levels in pregnancy, family history of diabetes, pre-pregnancy and postpartum body mass index, dietary patterns, physical activity, and breastfeeding. Genetic studies revealed that GDM shares common genetic variants with type 2 diabetes. A number of lifestyle interventional trials that aimed to ameliorate modifiable risk factors, including diet, exercise, and breastfeeding, succeeded in reducing the incidence of postpartum diabetes, weight retention, and other obesity-related morbidities.

23,PMC4880279,"Diabetes mellitus is a group of diseases characterized by chronic hyperglycemia. Women who develops hyperglycemia for the first time during pregnancy receive the diagnosis gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Presently, there is no consensus about the diagnostic criteria for GDM. A majority of these women subsequently develop postpartum overt diabetes making it important to identify these patients as early as possible. In this study we investigated if plasma levels of the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), an endogenous inhibitor of IL-1 signaling, can be used as a complementary biomarker for diagnosing GDM and predicting postpartum development of overt diabetes mellitus. Patients participating in this study (n = 227) were diagnosed with their first GDM 2004–2013 at Lund University Hospital, Lund, Sweden. Healthy pregnant volunteers (n = 156) were recruited from women’s welfare centers in the same region 2014–2015. Levels of IL-1Ra and C-peptide were analyzed in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)-plasma or serum using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). GDM patients had significantly lower levels of IL-1Ra than the control group (p = 0.012). In addition, GDM patients that had developed impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or type 2 diabetes mellitus postpartum had significantly lower levels of IL-1Ra, and significantly higher levels of C-peptide than GDM patients that had not developed diabetes mellitus postpartum (p = 0.023) and (p = 0.0011) respectively. An inverse correlation was found between IL-1Ra and serum C-peptide levels in the control group (rs = -0.31 p = 0.0001). Our results show that IL-1Ra might be included in a future panel of biomarkers, both for diagnosing GDM to complement blood glucose, and also identifying GDM patients that are at risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus postpartum. However, the ROC curve analysis provided a sensitivity of 52.2% and specificity of 67.1%, which nonetheless may not be sufficient enough to use IL-1Ra as a sole biomarker.",2016 May 25,Plasma Levels of the Interleukin-1-Receptor Antagonist Are Lower in Women with Gestational Diabetes Mellitus and Are Particularly Associated with Postpartum Development of Type 2 Diabetes,PLoS ONE

The onset of AML-associated CDI often precedes the diagnosis of AML by weeks or months and is considered an adverse prognostic indicator in this setting. The mechanism of AML-associated CDI is not known; however, it is often reported in the setting of cytogenetic events resulting in MDS1 and EVI1 complex locus protein (MECOM) gene overexpression. Here, we describe a case of new onset CDI which preceded a diagnosis of AML by 1 month. We detail the clinical and laboratory evaluation of the patient's CDI, and we describe the pathological and laboratory workup of their AML, which ultimately yielded a diagnosis of AML with myelodysplasia-related changes. Additional cytogenetic findings included the identification of the t (2;3)(p23;q27), which leads to MECOM gene overexpression and which to our knowledge has not previously been reported in the setting of AML-associated CDI. The patient received induction chemotherapy followed by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation but experienced disease relapse and passed away nine months after initial diagnosis. We emphasize that new onset CDI can occur as a rare complication of AML where it portends a poor prognosis and may be related to AML subtypes displaying MECOM gene dysregulation.",2021 Feb 16,Concurrent Central Diabetes Insipidus and Acute Myeloid Leukemia,Case Reports in Hematology

Herein, we reported clinical and biochemical parameters in four cases of three unrelated Japanese families and analyzed the status of the AVPR2. Two of the four patients had poor weight gain. However, in the male and female sibling cases, neither had poor weight gain while toddlers, but in the male sibling, episodes of recurrent fever, polyuria, and polydipsia led to the diagnosis of NDI at 4 years of age. Analysis of AVPR2 identified two nonsense mutations (c.299_300insA; p.K100KfsX91 and c.296G > A; p.W99X) and one missense mutation (c.316C > T; p.R106C). These mutations were previously reported. The patient with c.316C > T; p.R106C had milder symptoms consistent with previous reports.

27,PMC7693664,"The increasing prevalence of older adults with diabetes has become a major social burden. Diabetes, frailty, and cognitive dysfunction are closely related to the mechanisms of aging. Insulin resistance, arteriosclerosis, chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction may be common mechanisms shared by frailty and cognitive impairment. Hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, obesity, vascular factors, physical inactivity, and malnutrition are important risk factors for cognitive impairment and frailty in older adults with diabetes. The impact of nutrients on health outcomes varies with age; thus, shifting diet therapy strategies from the treatment of obesity/metabolic syndrome to frailty prevention may be necessary in patients with diabetes who are over 75 years of age, have frailty or sarcopenia, and experience malnutrition. For the prevention of frailty, optimal energy intake, sufficient protein and vitamin intake, and healthy dietary patterns should be recommended. The treatment of diabetes after middle age should include the awareness of proper glycemic control aimed at extending healthy life expectancy with proper nutrition, exercise, and social connectivity. Nutritional therapy in combination with exercise, optimal glycemic and metabolic control, and social participation/support for frailty prevention can extend healthy life expectancy and maintain quality of life in older adults with diabetes mellitus.",2020 Nov 1,Nutrition Management in Older Adults with Diabetes: A Review on the Importance of Shifting Prevention Strategies from Metabolic Syndrome to Frailty,Nutrients
28,PMC6597612,"Smoking is a strong risk factor for albuminuria in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, it is unclear whether this sequela of smoking is brought about by its action on cardiometabolic parameters or the relationship is independent. The aim of this systematic review is to explore this relationship.
Electronic databases on cross-sectional and prospective studies in Medline and Embase were searched from January 1946 to May 2018. Adult smokers with T2DM were included, and other types of diabetes were excluded.
A random effects meta-analysis of 20,056 participants from 13 studies found that the odds ratio (OR) of smokers developing albuminuria compared to non-smokers was 2.13 (95% CI 1.32, 3.45). Apart from smoking, the odds ratio of other risk factors associated with albuminuria were: age 1.24 (95% CI 0.84, 1.64), male sex 1.39 (95% CI 1.16, 1.67), duration of diabetes 1.78 (95% CI 1.32, 2.23), HbA1c 0.63 (95% CI 0.45, 0.81), SBP 6.03 (95% CI 4.10, 7.97), DBP 1.85 (95% CI 1.08, 2.62), total cholesterol 0.06 (95% CI − 0.05, 0.17) and HDL cholesterol − 0.01 (95% CI − 0.04, 0.02), triglyceride 0.22 (95% CI 0.12, 0.33) and BMI 0.40 (95% CI 0.00–0.80). When the smoking status was adjusted in a mixed effect meta-regression model, the duration of diabetes was the only statistically significant factor that influenced the prevalence of albuminuria. In smokers, each year’s increase in the duration of T2DM was associated with an increased risk of albuminuria of 0.19 units (95% CI 0.07, 0.31) on the log odds scale or increased the odds approximately by 23%, compared to non-smokers. Prediction from the meta-regression model also suggested that the odds ratios of albuminuria in smokers after a diabetes duration of 9 years and 16 years were 1.53 (95% CI 1.10, 2.13) and 5.94 (95% CI 2.53, 13.95), respectively.
Continuing to smoke and the duration of diabetes are two strong predictors of albuminuria in smokers with T2DM. With a global surge in younger smokers developing T2DM, smoking cessation interventions at an early stage of disease trajectory should be promoted.

29,PMC7512074,"Nuclear factor of activated T cells 5 (NFAT5), a Rel/nuclear factor- (NF-) κB family member, is the only known gene regulator of the mammalian adaptive response to osmotic stress. Exposure to elevated glucose increases the expression and nuclear translocation of NFAT5, as well as NFAT5-driven transcriptional activity in vivo and in vitro. Increased expression of NFAT5 is closely correlated with the progression of diabetes in patients. The distinct structure of NFAT5 governs its physiological and pathogenic roles, indicating its opposing functions. The ability of NFAT5 to maintain cell homeostasis and proliferation is impaired in patients with diabetes. NFAT5 promotes the formation of aldose reductase, pathogenesis of diabetic vascular complications, and insulin resistance. Additionally, NFAT5 activates inflammation at a very early stage of diabetes and induces persistent inflammation. Recent studies revealed that NFAT5 is an effective therapeutic target for diabetes. Here, we describe the current knowledge about NFAT5 and its relationship with diabetes, focusing on its diverse regulatory functions, and highlight the importance of this protein as a potential therapeutic target in patients with diabetes.",2020 Sep 15,Potential Role of Gene Regulator NFAT5 in the Pathogenesis of Diabetes Mellitus,Journal of Diabetes Research
30,PMC8482730,"Diabetes mellitus accelerates the development of atherosclerosis. Patients with diabetes mellitus have higher incidence and mortality rates from cardiovascular disease and undergo a disproportionately higher number of coronary interventions compared to the general population. Proper selection of treatment modalities is thus paramount.

The purpose of this review is to assimilate emerging evidence comparing CABG to PCI in patients with diabetes and present an outlook on the latest advances in percutaneous interventions, in addition to the optimal medical therapies in patients with diabetes.
A systematic search of PubMed, Web of Science and EMBASE was performed to identify prospective, randomized trials comparing outcomes of CABG and PCI, and also PCI with different generations of stents used in patients with diabetes. Additional review of bibliography of selected studies was also performed.
Most of the trials discussed above demonstrate a survival advantage of CABG over PCI in patients with diabetes. However, recent advances in PCI technology are starting to challenge this narrative. Superior stent designs, use of specific drug-eluting stents, image-guided stent deployment, and the use of contemporary antiplatelet and lipid-lowering therapies are continuing to improve the PCI outcomes.

31,PMC5880873,"Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) is a rare disorder characterized by resistance of the kidney to the action of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), resulting in a decrease in the capacity of the kidney to concentrate the urine. NDI can be inherited or acquired due to, for example, chronic lithium therapy. Current treatment options are limited to attempts to lower urine output by a low‐solute diet and the use of diuretics or anti‐inflammatory drugs. These measures are only partially effective. Recent reports suggested that sildenafil, metformin, and simvastatin might improve ADH‐independent urine concentration. If confirmed, this would provide interesting additional therapeutic options for patients with NDI. We, therefore, tested the effect of these drugs on ADH‐independent urine concentrating capacity in healthy volunteers. We included 36 healthy volunteers who received sildenafil 20 mg thrice daily, metformin 500 mg thrice daily or simvastatin 40 mg once daily during 1 week. At baseline and at the end of treatment, a water loading test was performed. No significant increase in lowest urine osmolality was seen after the use of metformin or sildenafil (P = 0.66 and P = 0.09 respectively). Lowest urine osmolality increased modestly but significantly after the use of simvastatin (70 mOsm/kg to 85 mOsm/kg, P = 0.05). Our data suggest that only simvastatin has an effect on urine osmolality in healthy volunteers.

32,PMC4422421,"Wolfram syndrome (WS) is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by diabetes mellitus (DM), optic atrophy (OA), central diabetes insipidus (CDI) and deafness (D).
The phenotype of the disease has been associated with several mutations in the WFS1 gene, a nuclear gene localized on chromosome 4. Since the discovery of the association between WFS1 gene and Wolfram syndrome, more than 150 mutations have been identified in WS patients.
We previously described the first case of perinatal onset of Wolfram syndrome newborn carrying a segmental uniparental heterodysomy affecting the short arm of chromosome 4 responsible for a significant reduction in wolframin expression.
Here we review and discuss the pathophysiological mechanisms that we believe responsible for the perinatal onset of Wolfram syndrome as these data strongly suggest a role for WFS1 gene in foetal and neonatal neurodevelopment.
We described a male patient of 30 weeks’ gestation with intrauterine growth restriction and poly-hydramnios.
During the first days of life, the patient showed a 19% weight loss associated with polyuria and hypernatremia. The presence of persistent hypernatremia (serum sodium 150 mEq/L), high plasma osmolarity (322 mOsm/L) and low urine osmolarity (190 mOsm/l) with a Uosm/Posm ratio < 1 were consistent with CDI. The diagnosis of CDI was confirmed by the desmopressin test and the brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 34 weeks of age, that showed the lack of posterior pituitary hyperintense signal. In addition, a bilateral asymmetrical optic nerve hypoplasia associated with right orbital bone hypoplasia was observed, suggesting the diagnosis of WF.
During the five years follow-up the patient did not developed glucose intolerance or diabetes mellitus. By the end of the second year of life, primary non-autoimmune central hypothyroidism and mild neurodevelopment retardation were diagnosed.
The analysis of our case, in the light of the most recent literature, suggests a possible role for WFS1 gene in the development of certain brain structures during the fetal period.

33,PMC6048831,"Lithium is the gold-standard treatment for bipolar disorder, is highly effective in treating major depressive disorder, and has anti-suicidal properties. However, clinicians are increasingly avoiding lithium largely due to fears of renal toxicity. Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus (NDI) occurs in 15–20% of lithium users and predicts a 2–3 times increased risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD). We recently found that use of statins is associated with lower NDI risk in a cross-sectional study. In this current paper, we describe the methodology of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to treat lithium-induced NDI using atorvastatin.
We will conduct a 12-week, double-blind placebo-controlled RCT of atorvastatin for lithium-induced NDI at McGill University, Montreal, Canada. We will recruit 60 current lithium users, aged 18–85, who have indicators of NDI, which we defined as urine osmolality (UOsm) < 600 mOsm/kg after 10-h fluid restriction. We will randomize patients to atorvastatin (20 mg/day) or placebo for 12 weeks. We will examine whether this improves measures of NDI: UOsm and aquaporin (AQP2) excretion at 12-week follow-up, adjusted for baseline.
Not applicable.
The aim of this clinical trial is to provide preliminary data about the efficacy of atorvastatin in treating NDI. If successful, lithium could theoretically be used more safely in patients with a reduced subsequent risk of CKD, hypernatremia, and acute kidney injury (AKI). If future definitive trials confirm this, this could potentially allow more patients to benefit from lithium, while minimizing renal risk.

Men and women (N=2844, mean age 52.0±8.2 years) who underwent oral glucose tolerance test and anthropometric measurements, during 1976–1982, were followed for mortality until May 2019. Multiple imputation procedures for missing mortality dates and multivariable regression mixed models were applied.
At baseline, 35.8%, 48.8% and 15.4% individuals were found with normoglycemia, pre-diabetes, and diabetes, respectively. The average difference in YPLL associated with pre-diabetes as compared with normoglycemia was 4.3 years (95% CI 3.3 to 5.2; p<0.001). YPLL were 1 year higher in women with pre-diabetes than in men with pre-diabetes. These differences persisted mainly in individuals younger than 60 years, and those with body mass index (BMI) <25 kg/m2, at baseline. Adjusting for age, sex, country of origin, smoking status, BMI, and blood pressure, the average difference in YPLL associated with pre-diabetes as compared with normoglycemia was 2.0 years (95% CI 1.2 to 2.8; p<0.001). Significant reductions of 5.9 years (95% CI 4.8 to 7.0) on average were observed for diabetes as compared with pre-diabetes and 7.9 years (95% CI 6.7 to 9.1) as compared with individuals with normoglycemia.
This study reveals that life expectancy of middle-aged individuals with pre-diabetes is shorter than of normoglycemic ones. These findings are especially relevant in view of the rising worldwide prevalence of pre-diabetes within younger age groups and underscore the crucial importance of interventions by either lifestyle modification or drug therapy capable of delaying progression from pre-diabetes to diabetes to reduce the YPLL in this high-risk group.",2021 Mar 10,"Years of potential life lost in pre-diabetes and diabetes mellitus: data from a 40-year follow-up of the Israel study on Glucose intolerance, Obesity and Hypertension",BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care

PTDI is usually diagnosed in the first days after the trauma presenting with hypotonic polyuria. Frequently, the poor general status of most patients prevents adequate fluid intake to compensate the losses and severe dehydration and hypernatremia occur. Management consists of careful monitoring of fluid balance and hormonal replacement. PTDI is associated with high mortality, particularly when presenting very early following the injury.

The clinical, laboratory, and genetic features of 8 homozygotes were collected. A model of the wolframin protein was constructed, and NMA was used to simulate the effect of the variant on protein thermodynamics.
Mean age at Wolfram syndrome (WS) diagnosis among homozygotes was 30 years; diabetes (7/8) was diagnosed at mean age 19 years (15–21 years), and bilateral optic atrophy (with MRI evidence of optic/chiasm atrophy) (6/8) at mean age 29 years (15–48 years). The oldest patient (62 years) also had gait difficulties, memory problems, parietal and cerebellar atrophy, and white matter hyperintense lesions. All retained functional vision with independent ambulation and self-care; none had diabetes insipidus or hearing loss. The p.R558C variant caused less impairment of protein entropy than WFS1 variants associated with a more severe phenotype.
The p.R558C variant causes a milder, late-onset phenotype of WS.

37,PMC5713354,"Under physiological conditions, excessive loss of water through the urine is prevented by the release of the antidiuretic hormone arginine-vasopressin (AVP) from the posterior pituitary. In the kidney, AVP elicits a number of cellular responses, which converge on increasing the osmotic reabsorption of water in the collecting duct. One of the key events triggered by the binding of AVP to its type-2 receptor (AVPR2) is the exocytosis of the water channel aquaporin 2 (AQP2) at the apical membrane the principal cells of the collecting duct. Mutations of either AVPR2 or AQP2 result in a genetic disease known as nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, which is characterized by the lack of responsiveness of the collecting duct to the antidiuretic action of AVP. The affected subject, being incapable of concentrating the urine, presents marked polyuria and compensatory polydipsia and is constantly at risk of severe dehydration. The molecular bases of the disease are fully uncovered, as well as the genetic or clinical tests for a prompt diagnosis of the disease in newborns. A real cure for nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) is still missing, and the main symptoms of the disease are handled with s continuous supply of water, a restrictive diet, and nonspecific drugs. Unfortunately, the current therapeutic options are limited and only partially beneficial. Further investigation in vitro or using the available animal models of the disease, combined with clinical trials, will eventually lead to the identification of one or more targeted strategies that will improve or replace the current conventional therapy and grant NDI patients a better quality of life. Here we provide an updated overview of the genetic defects causing NDI, the most recent strategies under investigation for rescuing the activity of mutated AVPR2 or AQP2, or for bypassing defective AVPR2 signaling and restoring AQP2 plasma membrane expression.",2017 Nov 10,Hereditary Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus: Pathophysiology and Possible Treatment.

In genetic analyses of syndromes underlying daytime incontinence, urofacial (Ochoa) syndrome may be creating a prototype of a new research approach. Nocturnal enuresis has long been studied genetically, and several candidate loci have been reported. However, the pursuit for enuresis genes has been abandoned partly because genetic association and enuresis phenotype (bladder or renal type) could not be linked. Enuresis associated with diabetes insipidus has provided new insights into the etiology of the diseases. A chronobiological approach may shed new light on this area.

39,PMC8474306,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic, progressive, and multifaceted illness resulting in significant physical and psychological detriment to patients. As of 2019, 463 million people are estimated to be living with DM worldwide, out of which 90% have type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Over the years, significant progress has been made in identifying the risk factors for developing T2DM, understanding its pathophysiology and uncovering various metabolic pathways implicated in the disease process. This has culminated in the implementation of robust prevention programmes and the development of effective pharmacological agents, which have had a favourable impact on the management of T2DM in recent times. Despite these advances, the incidence and prevalence of T2DM continue to rise. Continuing research in improving efficacy, potency, delivery and reducing the adverse effect profile of currently available formulations is required to keep pace with this growing health challenge. Moreover, new metabolic pathways need to be targeted to produce novel pharmacotherapy to restore glucose homeostasis and address metabolic sequelae in patients with T2DM. We searched PubMed, MEDLINE, and Google Scholar databases for recently included agents and novel medication under development for treatment of T2DM. We discuss the pathophysiology of T2DM and review how the emerging anti-diabetic agents target the metabolic pathways involved. We also look at some of the limiting factors to developing new medication and the introduction of unique methods, including facilitating drug delivery to bypass some of these obstacles.

40,PMC8477890,"Microvascular disease (MVD) is a potential contributor to the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus–related cardiac dysfunction. However, there is a paucity of data on the link between MVD and incident heart failure (HF) in type 2 diabetes mellitus. We examined the association of MVD with incident HF in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
A total of 4095 participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus and free of HF were assessed for diabetes mellitus–related MVD including nephropathy, retinopathy, or neuropathy at baseline in the Look AHEAD (Action for Health in Diabetes) study. Incident HF events were prospectively assessed and adjudicated using hospital and death records. Cox models were used to generate hazard ratios and 95% CIs for HF. Of 4095 participants, 34.8% (n=1424) had MVD, defined as the presence of ≥1 of nephropathy, retinopathy, or neuropathy at baseline. Over a median of 9.7 years, there were 117 HF events. After adjusting for relevant confounders, participants with MVD had a 2.5‐fold higher risk of incident HF than those without MVD (hazard ratio, 2.54; 95% CI, 1.73–3.75). This association remained significant after additional adjustment for interval development of coronary artery disease (hazard ratio, 2.42; 95% CI, 1.64–3.57). The hazard ratios for HF by type of MVD were 2.22 (95% CI, 1.51–3.27), 1.30 (95% CI, 0.72–2.36), and 1.33 (95% CI, 0.86–2.07) for nephropathy, retinopathy, and neuropathy, respectively.
MVD is associated with an excess HF risk in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus after adjusting for other known risk factors. Our findings underscore the contribution of MVD to the development of diabetes mellitus–related HF.

41,PMC7571449,"Over the last decade, vitamin D has emerged as a risk determinant for type 2 diabetes and vitamin D supplementation has been hypothesized as a potential intervention to lower diabetes risk. Recently, several trials have reported on the effect of vitamin D supplementation on diabetes prevention in people with prediabetes.
A comprehensive literature review was performed using PubMed, Embase, and ClinicalTrials.gov to identify: (1) recent meta-analyses of longitudinal observational studies that report on the association between blood 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) level and incident diabetes, and (2) clinical trials of adults with prediabetes that have reported on the effect of vitamin D supplementation on incident diabetes.
Longitudinal observational studies report highly consistent associations between higher blood 25(OH)D levels and a lower risk of incident diabetes in diverse populations, including populations with prediabetes. Trials in persons with prediabetes show risk reduction in incident diabetes with vitamin D supplementation. In the 3 large trials that were specifically designed and conducted for the prevention of diabetes, vitamin D supplementation, when compared with placebo, reduced the risk of developing diabetes by 10% to 13% in persons with prediabetes not selected for vitamin D deficiency.
Results from recent trials are congruent with a large body of evidence from observational studies indicating that vitamin D has a role in modulating diabetes risk. Participant-level meta-analysis of the 3 largest trials should provide a more refined estimate of risk reduction and identify patient populations that are likely to benefit the most from vitamin D supplementation.",2020 Aug 26,Vitamin D Supplementation for Prevention of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: To D or Not to D?,The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism
42,PMC7428598,"Glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonists (GLP‐1RAs) and sodium‐glucose cotransporter‐2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) have shown their beneficial effects on cardiovascular outcomes and multiple cardiovascular risk factors, including hypertension. However, the mechanism of blood pressure (BP)–lowering effects of these agents has not been elucidated. This study aims to evaluate the effect of hemoglobin A1c reduction or body weight reduction with GLP‐1RA treatment and SGLT2i treatment on BP changes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Studies were identified by a search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register until June 2019. Meta‐regression analysis was performed to evaluate the association between hemoglobin A1c reduction or body weight reduction and changes of BP. A total of 184 trials were included. Both GLP‐1RA and SGLT2i led to significant reductions in systolic BP (weighted mean difference, −2.856 and −4.331 mm Hg, respectively; P<0.001 for both) and diastolic BP (weighted mean difference, −0.898 and −2.279 mm Hg, respectively; P<0.001 for both). For both drug classes, hemoglobin A1c reduction was not independently associated with systolic BP reduction or diastolic BP reduction. In GLP‐1RA treatment, weight reduction was positively associated with systolic BP reduction and diastolic BP reduction (β=0.821 and β=0.287, respectively; P<0.001 for both). In SGLT2i treatment, weight loss was significantly associated with systolic BP reduction (β=0.820; P=0.001) but was not associated with diastolic BP reduction.

43,PMC6367798,"Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) is associated with future cardio-metabolic risks for the mother and her child. In addition, one-third of women with recent GDM develop postpartum depression. Given these adverse impacts of GDM on the health of the mother and her offspring, it is important to intervene on modifiable factors, such as diet, physical activity, and psychosocial well-being. This integrative review therefore explored evidence on how these modifiable factors interact in women with GDM and their offspring, and how effective combined interventions are on reducing adverse impacts of GDM.
A comprehensive search strategy included carefully selected terms that corresponded to the domains of interest (diet, physical activity and psychosocial well-being). The databases searched for articles published between 1980 and February 2018 were: CINAHL, PsycINFO, Embase, Pubmed and Cochrane. Studies that were included in this review were either observational or intervention studies that included at least two domains of interest. Articles had to at least report data on maternal outcomes of women with GDM.
The search strategies identified 14′419 citations after excluding duplicates. After screening titles and then abstracts, 114 articles were selected for detailed evaluation of their full text, and 16 were included in this review: two observational and 14 intervention studies. Results from observational studies showed that psychosocial well-being (social support and self-efficacy) were positively associated with physical activity and dietary choice. Intervention studies always included diet and physical activity interventions, although none integrated psychosocial well-being in the intervention. These lifestyle interventions mostly led to increased physical activity, improved diet and lower stress perception. Many of these lifestyle interventions also reduced BMI and postpartum diabetes status, improved metabolic outcomes and reduced the risk of preterm deliveries and low birth weight.
This integrative review showed that psychosocial well-being interacted with diet as well as with physical activity in women with GDM. We recommend that future studies consider integrating psychosocial well-being in their intervention, as observational studies demonstrated that social support and self-efficacy helped with adopting a healthy lifestyle following GDM diagnosis.

44,PMC7947790,"Growth hormone deficiency (GHD) in adults is due to a reduced growth hormone (GH) secretion by the anterior pituitary gland which leads to a well-known syndrome characterized by decreased cognitive function and quality of life (QoL), decreased bone mineral density (BMD), increased central adiposity with a reduction in lean body mass, decreased exercise tolerance, hyperlipidemia and increased predisposition to atherogenesis. Considering some similar features between aging and GHD, it was thought that the relative GH insufficiency of the elderly person could make an important contribution to the fragility of elderly. GH stimulation tests are able to differentiate GHD in elderly patients (EGHD) from the physiological reduction of GH secretion that occurs with aging. Although there is no evidence that rhGH replacement therapy increases the risk of developing Diabetes Mellitus (DM), reducing insulin sensitivity and inducing cardiac hypertrophy, long-term monitoring is, however, also mandatory in terms of glucose metabolism and cardiovascular measurements. In our experience comparing the impact of seven years of rhGH treatment on metabolic and cardiovascular parameters in GHD patients divided in two groups [adult (AGHD) and elderly (EGHD) GHD patients], effects on body composition are evident especially in AGHD, but not in EGHD patients. The improvements in lipid profile were sustained in all groups of patients, and they had a lower prevalence of dyslipidemia than the general population. The effects on glucose metabolism were conflicting, but approximately unchanged. The risk of DM type 2 is, however, probably increased in obese GHD adults with impaired glucose homeostasis at baseline, but the prevalence of DM in GHD is like that of the general population. The increases in glucose levels, BMI, and SBP in GHD negatively affected the prevalence of Metabolic Syndrome (MS) in the long term, especially in AGHD patients. Our results are in accordance to other long-term studies in which the effects on body composition and lipid profile are prominent.",2021 Feb 25,Impact of Long-Term Growth Hormone Replacement Therapy on Metabolic and Cardiovascular Parameters in Adult Growth Hormone Deficiency: Comparison Between Adult and Elderly Patients,Frontiers in Endocrinology
45,PMC6780236,"Diabetes, a silent killer, is one of the most widely prevalent conditions of the present time. According to the 2017 International Diabetes Federation (IDF) statistics, the global prevalence of diabetes among the age group of 20–79 years is 8.8%. In addition, 1 in every 2 persons is unaware of the condition. This unawareness and ignorance lead to further complications. Pre-diabetes is the preceding condition of diabetes, and in most of the cases, this ultimately leads to the development of diabetes. Diabetes can be classified into three types, namely type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and gestational diabetes. The diagnosis of both pre-diabetes and diabetes is based on glucose criteria; the common modalities used are fasting plasma glucose (FPG) test and oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). A glucometer is commonly used by diabetic patients to measure blood glucose levels with fast and rather accurate measurements. A few of the more advanced and minimally invasive modalities include the glucose-sensing patch, SwEatch, eyeglass biosensor, breath analysis, etc. Despite a considerable amount of data being collected and analyzed regarding diabetes, the actual molecular mechanism of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is still unknown. Both genetic and epigenetic factors are associated with T2DM. The complications of diabetes can predominantly be classified into two categories: microvascular and macrovascular. Retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy are grouped under microvascular complications, whereas stroke, cardiovascular disease, and peripheral artery disease (PAD) belong to macrovascular complications. Unfortunately, until now, no complete cure for diabetes has been found. However, the treatment of pre-diabetes has shown significant success in preventing the further progression of diabetes. To prevent pre-diabetes from developing into T2DM, lifestyle intervention has been found to be very promising.

46,PMC6048751,"Combined central diabetes insipidus and cerebral salt wasting syndrome is a rare clinical finding. However, when this happens, mortality is high due to delayed diagnosis and/or inadequate treatment.
A 42-year-old white man was referred to neurosurgery due to a non-functional pituitary macroadenoma. He underwent a partial resection of the tumor on July 2, 2015. On the day following surgery he presented polyuria with sodium 149 mEq/L, plasma osmolality 301 mOsm/kg, and urine osmolality 293 mOsm/kg. He started nasal desmopressin 0.05 mg/day with good response. He was already on dexamethasone 4 mg and levothyroxine 75 mcg due to hypopituitarism after surgery. On July 9 he became confused. Cerebral computed tomography was performed with no significant changes. His natremia dropped to 128 mEq/L with development of polyuria despite maintenance of desmopressin dose. His hemoglobin and hematocrit rose from 9.1 g/L to 11.6 g/L and 27.5 to 32.5, respectively. His thyroid function was normal and he was on hydrocortisone 30 mg/day. At 12 p.m. 150 mg/hydrocortisone infusion was initiated, but sodium did not increase. Plasma and urine osmolality were 264 mOsm/kg and 679 mOsm/kg, respectively. At 4 p.m. hydrocortisone was increased and hypertonic saline replacement started. Two hours later he was dehydrated with polyuria and vomiting, and natremia of 124 mEq/L. Hyponatremia was very resistant to treatment despite hypertonic saline replacement, hence desmopressin was suspended. The following day, urine spot analysis showed that natriuresis was 63 mEq/L with serum sodium 132 mEq/L. This was interpreted as a cerebral salt wasting syndrome and control was achieved with aggressive hypertonic saline replacements and fludrocortisone 0.1 mg/three times a day. 
We present a rare case of a patient with diabetes insipidus and cerebral salt wasting syndrome, who was successfully treated. Hyponatremia in a patient with diabetes insipidus may erroneously be interpreted as inadequate diabetes insipidus control or as syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion, leading to therapeutic errors. Thus, all clinical and analytical data should be evaluated together for early and correct diagnosis.",2018 Jul 17,A challenging coexistence of central diabetes insipidus and cerebral salt wasting syndrome: a case report,Journal of Medical Case Reports
47,PMC6947162,"Hypopituitarism includes all clinical conditions that result in partial or complete failure of the anterior and posterior lobe of the pituitary gland’s ability to secrete hormones. The aim of management is usually to replace the target-hormone of hypothalamo-pituitary-endocrine gland axis with the exceptions of secondary hypogonadism when fertility is required, and growth hormone deficiency (GHD), and to safely minimise both symptoms and clinical signs. Adrenocorticotropic hormone deficiency replacement is best performed with the immediate-release oral glucocorticoid hydrocortisone (HC) in 2–3 divided doses. However, novel once-daily modified-release HC targets a more physiological exposure of glucocorticoids. GHD is treated currently with daily subcutaneous GH, but current research is focusing on the development of once-weekly administration of recombinant GH. Hypogonadism is targeted with testosterone replacement in men and on estrogen replacement therapy in women; when fertility is wanted, replacement targets secondary or tertiary levels of hormonal settings. Thyroid-stimulating hormone replacement therapy follows the rules of primary thyroid gland failure with L-thyroxine replacement. Central diabetes insipidus is nowadays replaced by desmopressin. Certain clinical scenarios may have to be promptly managed to avoid short-term or long-term sequelae such as pregnancy in patients with hypopituitarism, pituitary apoplexy, adrenal crisis, and pituitary metastases.",2019 Dec 5,Management of Hypopituitarism,Journal of Clinical Medicine
48,PMC7270854,"Evidence suggests that mobile health app use is beneficial for the prevention and management of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and its associated complications; however, population-based research on specific determinants of health app use in people with and without T2D is scarce.
This cross-sectional study aimed to provide population-based evidence on rates and determinants of health app use among adults with and without T2D, thereby covering a prevention perspective and a diabetes management perspective, respectively.
The study population included 2327 adults without a known diabetes diagnosis and 1149 adults with known T2D from a nationwide telephone survey in Germany conducted in 2017. Rates of smartphone ownership and health app use were estimated based on weighted sample proportions. Among smartphone owners, determinants of health app use were identified for both groups separately in multivariable logistic regression models. Sociodemographic factors, diabetes-related factors or indicators, psychological and health-related factors, and physician-provided information were selected as potential determinants.
Among participants without known diabetes, 74.72% (1690/2327) were smartphone owners. Of those, 49.27% (717/1690) used health apps, most often to improve regular physical activity. Among participants with T2D, 42.26% (481/1149) were smartphone owners. Of those, 41.1% (171/481) used health apps, most commonly to target a healthy diet. Among people without known diabetes, determinants significantly (all P values <.05) associated with an increased likelihood of health app use compared with their reference group were as follows: younger and middle age of 18 to 44 or 45 to 64 years (odds ratios [ORs] 3.89; P<.001 and 1.76; P=.004, respectively), overweight or obesity (ORs 1.58; P<.001 and 2.07; P<.001, respectively), hypertension diagnosis (OR 1.31; P=.045), former or current smoking (ORs 1.51; P=.002 and 1.58; P<.001, respectively), perceiving health as very good (OR 2.21; P<.001), other chronic diseases (OR 1.48; P=.002), and having received health advice from a physician (OR 1.48; P<.001). A slight or high perceived diabetes risk (ORs 0.78; P=.04 and 0.23; P<.001, respectively) was significantly associated with a decreased likelihood of health app use. Among people with T2D, younger and middle age (18-64 years; OR 1.84; P=.007), female gender (OR 1.61; P=.02), and using a glucose sensor in addition or instead of a glucose meter (OR 2.74; P=.04) were significantly positively associated with health app use.
In terms of T2D prevention, age, diabetes-related risk factors, psychological and health-related factors, and medical health advice may inform app development for specific target groups. In addition, health professionals may encourage health app use when giving advice on health behaviors. Concerning T2D management, only a few determinants seem relevant for explaining health app use among people with T2D, indicating a need for more future research on which people with T2D use health apps and why.",2020 May 20,Health App Use and Its Correlates Among Individuals With and Without Type 2 Diabetes: Nationwide Population-Based Survey,JMIR Diabetes

This study reports a first identified AVPR2 mutation in Taiwan and demonstrates our effort to understand the pathogenesis caused by applying computational structural analysis tools. The CNDI condition of an 8-month-old male patient was confirmed according to symptoms, family history, and DNA sequence analysis. The patient was identified to have a valine 279 deletion–mutation in the AVPR2 gene. Cellular experiments using mutant protein transfected cells revealed that mutated AVPR2 is expressed successfully in cells and localized on cell surfaces. We further analyzed the pathogenesis of the mutation at sub-molecular levels via long-term molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and structural analysis. The MD simulations showed while the structure of the extracellular ligand-binding domain remains unchanged, the mutation alters the direction of dynamic motion of AVPR2 transmembrane helix 6 toward the center of the G-protein binding site, obstructing the binding of G-protein, thus likely disabling downstream signaling. This study demonstrated that the computational approaches can be powerful tools for obtaining valuable information on the pathogenesis induced by mutations in G-protein-coupled receptors. These methods can also be helpful in providing clues on potential therapeutic strategies for CNDI.",2021 Mar 15,Valine-279 Deletion–Mutation on Arginine Vasopressin Receptor 2 Causes Obstruction in G-Protein Binding Site: A Clinical Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus Case and Its Sub-Molecular Pathogenic Analysis,Biomedicines

Glycated albumin (GA) and 1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG) are indicators that reflect short-term glucose levels. This study was aimed at investigating whether the 1,5-AG/GA index (AGI) is a suitable indicator for early FT1DM identification. 
 A total of 226 subjects were enrolled, all with glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) < 8.7%. FT1DM was diagnosed based on the 2012 Japan Diabetes Society criteria. 
 The AGI level was 0.54 (0.17–1.36) in the whole group. It was lower in FT1DM patients (0.16 [0.10–0.25]). Among the participants whose HbA1c did not exceed 7.0%, the AGI of FT1DM decreased significantly compared to type 1A diabetes (T1ADM) and latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) patients (0.16 [0.12–0.26] vs. 0.46 [0.24–0.72] vs. 0.46 [0.24–0.72] P < 0.05). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve showed that AGI can be used to distinguish FT1DM and T1ADM patients with HbA1c < 8.7%. Diagnosing FT1DM based on AGI ≤ 0.3 only can help narrow down suspected FT1DM by up to 26.87%. If we diagnosed FT1DM when AGI was ≤0.3 and HbA1c was ≤7.0%, the success rate further increased to 86.57%, among which 85.00% of FT1DM and 87.23% of T1ADM patients were successfully identified. Therefore, using the combination criteria of AGI and HbA1c would improve the differential diagnosis efficacy by 61.11% compared with the AGI criterion only.

53,PMC6457074,"Hypernatraemia is a serious condition that can potentially become life threatening. It is known that lithium is associated with polyuria and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, risk factors for hypernatraemia. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that lithium treatment was a risk factor for hypernatraemia.
We performed a retrospective cohort study in the Swedish region of Norrbotten into the effects and potential adverse effects of lithium treatment and other mood stabilizers (LiSIE). For this particular study, we included all patients who had experienced at least one episode with a sodium concentration ⩾150 mmol/L between 1997 and 2013. Medical records were reviewed regarding past or current lithium exposure, diabetes insipidus and other potential risk factors for hypernatraemia.
Of 2463 patients included, 185 (7.5%) had experienced 204 episodes of hypernatraemia within the 17-year review period. In patients 65 years or older, infections dominated as the cause with 51%. In patients younger than 65 years, intoxications, particularly with alcohol, dominated as the cause with 35%. In the whole sample, dehydration accounted for 12% of episodes, 25% of which in the context of suspected or confirmed nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Of all episodes, 25% resulted in death, with infection being the most common cause of death in 62% of cases.
In our sample, infections and harmful use of substances including alcohol were the most common causes of hypernatraemia. Both current and past use of lithium also led to episodes of hypernatraemia, when associated with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.

54,PMC8621893,"Type-1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is one of the most well-defined and complex metabolic disorders, characterized by hyperglycemia, with a constantly increasing incidence in children and adolescents. While current knowledge regarding the molecules related to the pathogenesis and diagnosis of T1DM is vast, the discovery of new molecules, such as micro ribonucleic acids (micro-RNAs, miRNAs), as well as their interactions with T1DM, has spurred novel prospects in the diagnosis of the disease. This review aims at summarizing current knowledge regarding miRNAs’ biosynthesis and action pathways and their role as gene expression regulators in T1DM. MiRNAs follow a complex biosynthesis pathway, including cleaving and transport from nucleus to cytoplasm. After assembly of their final form, they inhibit translation or cause messenger RNA (mRNA) degradation, resulting in the obstruction of protein synthesis. Many studies have reported miRNA involvement in T1DM pathogenesis, mainly through interference with pancreatic b-cell function, insulin production and secretion. They are also found to contribute to β-cell destruction, as they aid in the production of autoreactive agents. Due to their elevated accumulation in various biological specimens, as well as their involvement in T1DM pathogenesis, their role as biomarkers in early preclinical T1DM diagnosis is widely hypothesized, with future studies concerning their diagnostic value deemed a necessity.",2021 Nov 10,Micro-RNA Implications in Type-1 Diabetes Mellitus: A Review of Literature,International Journal of Molecular Sciences

We obtained data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink for adults with and without type 2 diabetes mellitus diagnosed 2000–2006. The outcome was the first CVD event during 2007–2017 and the following components: aortic aneurysm, cerebrovascular accidents, heart failure, myocardial infarction, peripheral vascular disease and other CVD‐related conditions. Flexible parametric survival models were used to estimate ethnicity‐specific adjusted hazard ratios.

59,PMC5938666,"Ginseng, one of the oldest traditional Chinese medicinal herbs, has been used widely in China and Asia for thousands of years. Ginsenosides extracted from ginseng, which is derived from the roots and rhizomes of Panax ginseng C. A. Meyer, have been used in China as an adjuvant in the treatment of diabetes mellitus. Owing to the technical complexity of ginsenoside production, the total ginsenosides are generally extracted. Accumulating evidence has shown that ginsenosides exert antidiabetic effects. In vivo and in vitro tests revealed the potential of ginsenoside Rg1, Rg3, Rg5, Rb1, Rb2, Rb3, compound K, Rk1, Re, ginseng total saponins, malonyl ginsenosides, Rd, Rh2, F2, protopanaxadiol (PPD) and protopanaxatriol (PPT)-type saponins to treat diabetes and its complications, including type 1 diabetes mellitus, type 2 diabetes mellitus, diabetic nephropathy, diabetic cognitive dysfunction, type 2 diabetes mellitus with fatty liver disease, diabetic cerebral infarction, diabetic cardiomyopathy, and diabetic erectile dysfunction. Many effects are attributed to ginsenosides, including gluconeogenesis reduction, improvement of insulin resistance, glucose transport, insulinotropic action, islet cell protection, hepatoprotective activity, anti-inflammatory effect, myocardial protection, lipid regulation, improvement of glucose tolerance, antioxidation, improvement of erectile dysfunction, regulation of gut flora metabolism, neuroprotection, anti-angiopathy, anti-neurotoxic effects, immunosuppression, and renoprotection effect. The molecular targets of these effects mainly contains GLUTs, SGLT1, GLP-1, FoxO1, TNF-α, IL-6, caspase-3, bcl-2, MDA, SOD, STAT5-PPAR gamma pathway, PI3K/Akt pathway, AMPK-JNK pathway, NF-κB pathway, and endoplasmic reticulum stress.

60,PMC7804125,"Based on questionnaires from 197,825 non-diabetic participants in a large Japanese cohort, we determined impact of (1) habit of exercise, (2) habit of active physical activity (PA) and (3) walking pace on new-onset of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Unadjusted and multivariable-adjusted logistic regression models were used to determine the odds ratio of new-onset diabetes mellitus incidence in a 3-year follow-up. There were two major findings. First, habits of exercise and active PA were positively associated with incidence of diabetes mellitus. Second, fast walking, even after adjusting for multiple covariates, was associated with low incidence of diabetes mellitus. In the subgroup analysis, the association was also observed in participants aged ≥ 65 years, in men, and in those with a body mass index ≥ 25. Results suggest that fast walking is a simple and independent preventive factor for new-onset of diabetes mellitus in the health check-up and guidance system in Japan.

61,PMC4192804,"We report the rare case of an adult who was diagnosed with recurrent multisystem Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) involving the pituitary stalk and lung who present with central diabetes insipidus and was successfully treated with systemic steroids and chemotherapy. A 49-year-old man visited our hospital due to symptoms of polydipsia and polyuria that started 1 month prior. Two years prior to presentation, he underwent excision of right 6th and 7th rib lesions for the osteolytic lesion and chest pain, which were later confirmed to be LCH on pathology. After admission, the water deprivation test was done and the result indicated that he had central diabetes insipidus. Sella magnetic resonance imaging showed a mass on the pituitary stalk with loss of normal bright spot at the posterior lobe of the pituitary. Multiple patchy infiltrations were detected in both lung fields by computed tomography (CT). He was diagnosed with recurrent LCH and was subsequently treated with inhaled desmopressin, systemic steroids, vinblastine, and mercaptopurine. The pituitary mass disappeared after two months and both lungs were clear on chest CT after 11 months.

This was a single-centre retrospective medical record review of patients with a diagnosis of NDI followed between 1985 and 2017. We collected available data on growth, weight, school performance, complications and comorbidities.
We identified 36 patients with available data and a clinical diagnosis of NDI, which was genetically confirmed in 33 of them. Patients presented at a median age of 0.6 years and median length of follow-up was 9.5 years. Chief symptoms at presentation were faltering growth, vomiting/feeding concerns, polyuria/polydipsia, febrile illness and hypernatraemic dehydration. Median weight standard deviation scores (SDS) improved from −2.1 at presentation to 0.2 at last follow-up. In contrast, height SDS remained essentially unchanged at −1.1 at presentation and −0.9 at last follow-up. Most patients were treated with prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors and thiazides, yet weaned off during school age without an obvious change in urine output. Median estimated glomerular filtration rate at last follow-up was 81 mL/min/1.73 m2. Urological complications were noted in 15 patients, constipation in 11 and learning difficulties in 5. Median age at resolution of nocturnal enuresis was 11 years. Estimated median daily fluid intake at median age of 13 years was 3800 mL/m2.
The overall prognosis in inherited NDI is favourable with regular treatment. As expected, most complications were related to polyuria.

64,PMC3931392,"Wolfram syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in WFS1 and is characterized by insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy, and deafness. To investigate the cause of β-cell failure, we used induced pluripotent stem cells to create insulin-producing cells from individuals with Wolfram syndrome. WFS1-deficient β-cells showed increased levels of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress molecules and decreased insulin content. Upon exposure to experimental ER stress, Wolfram β-cells showed impaired insulin processing and failed to increase insulin secretion in response to glucose and other secretagogues. Importantly, 4-phenyl butyric acid, a chemical protein folding and trafficking chaperone, restored normal insulin synthesis and the ability to upregulate insulin secretion. These studies show that ER stress plays a central role in β-cell failure in Wolfram syndrome and indicate that chemical chaperones might have therapeutic relevance under conditions of ER stress in Wolfram syndrome and other forms of diabetes.",2014 Feb 13,β-Cell Dysfunction Due to Increased ER Stress in a Stem Cell Model of Wolfram Syndrome,Diabetes
65,PMC8491600,"Diabetes mellitus, commonly referred to as diabetes, is a combination of many metabolic diseases. Insulin deficiency in our body is the main cause of diabetes. Insulin is one of the most well studied proteins, yet the genesis of its discovery was not getting much attention so far. Nevertheless, the history of the discovery of insulin is an exemplary of solving observational and scientific riddles, drudgery, patience and even professional turmoil. It is an inspiration for all medical personnel and scientists who are practising in the field of molecular medicine. Additionally, the genetic and epigenetic regulation of different types of diabetes needs to be addressed because of the widespread nature of the disease. Diabetes not only involves genetic predisposition but environmental factors, lifestyle etc. can be the major contributor for its inception. Nonetheless, viral infections at an early age are also found to trigger the onset of type I diabetes.

66,PMC7996474,"Diabetes insipidus (DI) is an endocrine condition involving the posterior pituitary peptide hormone, antidiuretic hormone (ADH). ADH exerts its effects on the distal convoluted tubule and collecting duct of the nephron by upregulating aquaporin-2 channels (AQP2) on the cellular apical membrane surface. DI is marked by expelling excessive quantities of highly dilute urine, extreme thirst, and craving for cold water. The two main classifications of DI are central diabetes insipidus (CDI), characterized by a deficiency of the posterior pituitary gland to release ADH, and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI), characterized by the terminal distal convoluted tubule and collecting duct resistance to ADH. The two less common classifications include dipsogenic DI, characterized by excessive thirst due to a low osmotic threshold, and gestational DI, characterized by increased concentration of placental vasopressinase during pregnancy. Treatment of DI is dependent on the disease classification, but severe complications may arise if not tended to appropriately. The most important step in symptom management is maintaining fluid intake ahead of fluid loss with emphasis placed on preserving the quality of life. The most common treatment of CDI and gestational DI is the administration of synthetic ADH, desmopressin (DDAVP). Nephrogenic treatment, although more challenging, requires discontinuation of medications as well as maintaining a renal-friendly diet to prevent hypernatremia. Treatment of dipsogenic DI is mainly focused on behavioral therapy aimed at regulating water intake and/or administration of antipsychotic pharmaceutical therapy. Central and nephrogenic subtypes of DI share a paradoxical treatment in thiazide diuretics.",2021 Feb 23,"Diabetes Insipidus: Pathogenesis, Diagnosis, and Clinical Management",Cureus

We carried out quantitative proteomic analysis using serum samples from 8‐ and 16‐week‐old LEA and control Brown Norway (BN) rats (n = 4/group). Differentially expressed proteins were validated by multiple reaction monitoring analysis using the sera collected from 8‐, 16‐, and 24‐week‐old LEA (n = 4/each group) and BN rats (n = 5/each group). Among the validated proteins, we also examined the possible relevance of the human homolog of serine protease inhibitor A3 (SERPINA3) to type 2 diabetes mellitus.
The use of 2‐D fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis analysis and the following liquid chromatography‐multiple reaction monitoring analysis showed that the serum levels of five proteins were differentially changed between LEA rats and BN rats at all three time‐points examined. Among the five proteins, SERPINA3N was increased significantly in the sera of LEA rats compared with age‐matched BN rats. The serum level of SERPINA3 was also found to be significantly higher in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients than in healthy control participants. Furthermore, glycated hemoglobin, fasting insulin and estimated glomerular filtration rate were independently associated with the SERPINA3 levels.
These findings suggest a possible role for SERPINA3 in the development of the early stages of type 2 diabetes mellitus, although further replication studies and functional investigations regarding their role are required.",2017 Mar 27,"Proteomic analysis of serum biomarkers for prediabetes using the Long‐Evans Agouti rat, a spontaneous animal model of type 2 diabetes mellitus",Journal of Diabetes Investigation
68,PMC7880854,"The co-existence of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) with diabetes mellitus (DM) in a patient that presents in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is rare and, to our knowledge, has not been described even in case reports. We report the case of a 16-year-old male with known NDI who presented to the pediatric emergency department (ED) for one day with generalized weakness and decreased appetite, found to be in moderate DKA from new-onset DM. The initial management of his dehydration and hyperosmolar state presented a unique challenge. Fluid resuscitation with isotonic fluids in a patient with NDI poses a risk of worsening hypernatremia, which can lead to seizures and death. However, the use of hypotonic fluids has the potential to lower serum osmolality too quickly, which can result in cerebral edema. Nephrology, endocrinology, and the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) consultants were notified of this patient, and a discussion was coordinated between sub-specialists to determine the appropriate fluid resuscitation. The patient was allowed to drink free water in addition to receiving intravenous fluids (IVF) of dextrose 5% with 0.2% sodium chloride at a rate of one-and-a-half maintenance (150 mL/hr) in the ED prior to transfer to the PICU where insulin infusion was initiated.

69,PMC4974775,"This study introduced a web-based educational intervention for Australian women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). The aim was to improve knowledge on healthy diet and lifestyle in GDM. Evaluation of the intervention explored women’s knowledge and understanding of GDM, healthy diet, healthy food, and healthy lifestyle, after using the web-based program compared to women receiving standard clinic-based GDM education.
A total of 116 women, aged 18–45 years old, newly diagnosed with GDM, participated (Intervention (n) = 56 and control (n) = 60). Women were randomly allocated to the intervention or control groups and both groups attended a standard GDM education class. Group 1(Intervention) additionally used an online touch screen/computer program. All women completed a questionnaire following the computer program and/or the education class. All questions evaluating levels of knowledge had more than one correct answer and scores were graded from 0 to 1, with each correct component receiving a score, eg. 0.25 per each correct answer in a 4 answer question. Chi-square test was performed to compare the two groups regarding knowledge of GDM.
Findings indicated that the majority of women in the intervention group reported correct answers for “types of carbohydrate foods” for pregnant women with GDM, compared to the control group (62.5 % vs 58.3 %, respectively). Most women in both groups had an excellent understanding of “fruits and vegetables” (98.2 % vs 98.3 %), and the majority of women in the intervention group understood that they should exercise daily for 30 min, compared to the control group (92.9 % vs 91.7 %). Both groups had a good understanding across all categories, however, the majority of women in the intervention group scored all correct answers (score = 1) in term of foetal effects (17.9 % vs 13.3 %, respectively), maternal predictors (5.4 % vs 5 %), care requirements (39.3 % vs 23.3 %), GDM perceptions (48.2 % vs 46.7 %) and GDM treatment (67.9 % vs 61.7 %), compared to women in the control group.
The study suggested that both approaches, standard education and standard education plus web-based program, resulted in excellent knowledge scores, but not statistically significant difference between groups. Multiple and immediate access to the web-based education program at home may prove useful as a source of reference for women with GDM.

70,PMC5512820,"Since the first position statement on diabetes and cardiovascular prevention published in 2014 by the Brazilian Diabetes Society, the current view on primary and secondary prevention in diabetes has evolved as a result of new approaches on cardiovascular risk stratification, new cholesterol lowering drugs, and new anti-hyperglycemic drugs. Importantly, a pattern of risk heterogeneity has emerged, showing that not all diabetic patients are at high or very high risk. In fact, most younger patients who have no overt cardiovascular risk factors may be more adequately classified as being at intermediate or even low cardiovascular risk. Thus, there is a need for cardiovascular risk stratification in patients with diabetes. The present panel reviews the best current evidence and proposes a practical risk-based approach on treatment for patients with diabetes.
The Brazilian Diabetes Society, the Brazilian Society of Cardiology, and the Brazilian Endocrinology and Metabolism Society gathered to form an expert panel including 28 cardiologists and endocrinologists to review the best available evidence and to draft up-to-date an evidence-based guideline with practical recommendations for risk stratification and prevention of cardiovascular disease in diabetes. The guideline includes 59 recommendations covering: (1) the impact of new anti-hyperglycemic drugs and new lipid lowering drugs on cardiovascular risk; (2) a guide to statin use, including new definitions of LDL-cholesterol and in non-HDL-cholesterol targets; (3) evaluation of silent myocardial ischemia and subclinical atherosclerosis in patients with diabetes; (4) hypertension treatment; and (5) the use of antiplatelet therapy.
Diabetes is a heterogeneous disease. Although cardiovascular risk is increased in most patients, those without risk factors or evidence of sub-clinical atherosclerosis are at a lower risk. Optimal management must rely on an approach that will cover both cardiovascular disease prevention in individuals in the highest risk as well as protection from overtreatment in those at lower risk. Thus, cardiovascular prevention strategies should be individualized according to cardiovascular risk while intensification of treatment should focus on those at higher risk.",2017 Jul 14,"Brazilian guidelines on prevention of cardiovascular disease in patients with diabetes: a position statement from the Brazilian Diabetes Society (SBD), the Brazilian Cardiology Society (SBC) and the Brazilian Endocrinology and Metabolism Society (SBEM)",Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome

In the previous prevalence study, 847 people older than 18 years were randomly selected from all over the Basque Country and were invited to answer a medical questionnaire, followed by a physical examination and an oral glucose tolerance test. In the reassessment, the same variables were collected and the resulting cohort comprised 517 individuals of whom 43 had diabetes at baseline. The cumulative incidence of diabetes was 4.64% in 7 years and the raw incidence rate was 6.56 cases/1000 person-years (95%CI: 4.11–9.93). Among the incident cases, 59% were undiagnosed. The most strongly associated markers by univariate analyses were age > 60 years, dyslipidaemia, prediabetes and insulin resistance. We also found association with hypertension, obesity, family history of diabetes and low education level. Multivariate analysis adjusted for age and sex showed that a set of risk factors assessed together (dyslipidaemia, waist-to-hip-ratio and family history of diabetes) had great predictive value (AUC-ROC = 0.899, 95%CI: 0.846–0.953, p = 0.942), which suggests the need for early intervention before the onset of prediabetes.",2021 Feb 4,"Incidence of diabetes mellitus and associated risk factors in the adult population of the Basque country, Spain",Scientific Reports

Anonymized medical data on patients with diabetes mellitus aged ≥65 years for the period from January 2010 to December 2019 were extracted from the EBM Provider database. The primary end‐point was a composite of cardiovascular events, whereas the other end‐points included severe hypoglycemia and fracture. The association between cardiovascular events and HbA1c at the index date (i.e., approximately 10 months after initial diabetes mellitus diagnosis) was evaluated using the Cox proportional hazards model.
Among the 3,186,751 patients in the database, 3,946 older adults with diabetes mellitus were eligible for inclusion and were subsequently grouped according to HbA1c quartiles at the index date. Cardiovascular events occurred in 142 patients. Patients with HbA1c in the highest quartile had significantly higher risk of hospitalization for cardiovascular disease than those with HbA1c in the lowest quartile (hazard ratio 1.948; 95% confidence interval 1.252–3.031, P = 0.003). However, the events risk was similar across subgroups with HbA1c <7.2%. The incidence of hypoglycemia and fracture was not significantly associated with the level of glycemic control.
Among older adults with diabetes mellitus, those with poor glycemic control were at higher risk for cardiovascular events compared with those with better glycemic control. However, strict glycemic control had no effect on cardiovascular risk in patients with HbA1c <7.2%.
We investigated the relationship between glycated hemoglobin and cardiovascular events in older adults with diabetes mellitus using administrative medical databases in Japan. Among approximately 4,000 older patients without a history of dementia, cancer or cardiovascular disease, those with glycated hemoglobin in the highest quartile had a significantly higher risk of hospitalization for cardiovascular disease than those with glycated hemoglobin in the lowest quartile.

However, there are currently no convenient ways to assess ER stress in beta cells, raising the need for circulating ER stress markers indicative of beta cell health. Here we show that pancreatic stone protein/regenerating protein (PSP/reg) is a potential biomarker for ER stressed beta cells. PSP/reg levels are elevated in cell culture and mouse models of Wolfram syndrome, a prototype of ER stress-induced diabetes. Moreover, PSP/reg expression is induced by the canonical chemical inducers of ER stress, tunicamycin and thapsigargin. Circulating PSP/reg levels are also increased in some patients with Wolfram syndrome. Our results therefore reveal PSP/reg as a potential biomarker for beta cells under chronic ER stress, as is the case in Wolfram syndrome.",2019 Mar 26,Pancreatic stone protein/regenerating protein is a potential biomarker for endoplasmic reticulum stress in beta cells,Scientific Reports

We report, to our knowledge, the first case of Fournier’s gangrene caused by C. ramosum in a female patient with multiple underlying conditions.
A 44-year-old woman with a 6-year history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus after total pancreatectomy and an 11-year history of central diabetes insipidus developed a pain in the genital area after a month of urinary catheter use. The lower abdominal pain worsened gradually over 2 weeks, and the pain, general fatigue, and loss of appetite prompted the patient’s hospital admission. As she had severe edema in her pelvic and bilateral femoral areas, ceftriaxone was started empirically after collecting two sets of blood cultures. On hospital day 2, CT examination revealed the presence of necrotizing faciitis in the genital and pelvic areas, and the antibiotics were changed to a combination of meropenem, vancomycin, and clindamycin. Gram-positive cocci and gram-positive rods were isolated from blood cultures, which were finally identified as Streptococcus constellatus and C. ramosum using superoxide dismutase and 16S rDNA sequencing. An emergent surgery was performed on hospital day 2 to remove the affected tissue. Despite undergoing debridement and receiving combined antimicrobial chemotherapies, the patient’s clinical improvement remained limited. The patient’s condition continued to deteriorate, and she eventually died on hospital day 8. In the present case, the underlying diabetes mellitus, urinary incontinence due to central diabetes insipidus, undernutrition, and edema served as the predisposing conditions.

79,PMC6323654,"Diabetes mellitus is a major chronic disease, which is connected to direct and indirect costs and productivity losses. However, its effects on labour market participation are not straightforward to identify, nor are they consistently included in cost-of-illness studies. First, this study aims to synthesise existing evidence regarding the impact of diabetes on labour market outcomes that imply a complete absence of work. Second, the analysis takes a particular look at relevant methodological choices and the resulting quality of the studies included.
We conducted a systematic literature research (PubMed, Embase, PsychINFO), by applying a standard screening, selection and results extraction process, which considered all types of studies including cross-sectional and longitudinal approaches. Risk-of-bias and quality within the studies were assessed and results were compared. We dedicated special attention to the modelling of potential reverse causality between diabetes and labour market outcomes and the consideration of comorbidities and complications.
Overall, 30 studies satisfied our inclusion criteria. We identified four main labour participation outcomes: absence of employment, unemployment, early retirement, and disability pension. The studies reviewed show a negative impact of diabetes on the labour market participation outcomes considered. However, only a few studies controlled for endogeneity, differentiated between type 1 and type 2 diabetes or modelled the impact of comorbidities. We report how modelling choices affect the directions and interpretations of the effects.
The available evidence mainly suggests a negative impact of diabetes on several outcomes indicating labour market participation. The methodological limitations identified can guide future research with respect to both outcomes and methods. This study provides therefore an empirical contribution to the discussion on how to model the economic impact of diabetes.

80,PMC5781289,"Depression is a prevalent, independent predictor of mortality in patients with heart failure (HF). Depression is also common in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), which is itself an important risk factor for HF. However, association of depression with incident HF in T2DM is undefined. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the predictive value of depression in predicting incident HF in a community-based cohort of asymptomatic patients with T2DM.
We prospectively recruited 274 asymptomatic T2DM patients ≥ 65 years (age 71 ± 4 year, 56% men) with preserved EF and no ischemic heart disease from a community-based population. The Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9) was used to detect depression, and LV dysfunction was sought with a comprehensive echocardiogram, including LV hypertrophy (LVH) and subclinical diastolic function (E/e′). Over a median follow-up of 1.5 years (range 0.5–3), 20 patients were lost to follow-up and 254 individuals were followed for outcomes.
At baseline, depression was present in 9.5%, LVH was identified in 26% and reduced E/e′ in 11%. Over a median follow-up of 1.5 years, 37 of 245 patients developed new-onset HF and 3 died, giving an event rate of 107/1000 person-years. In a competing-risks regression analysis, depression (adjusted HR 2.54, 95% CI 1.18–5.46; p = 0.017) was associated with incident HF and had incremental predictive power to clinical, biochemical and echocardiographic variables.

Thus, this systematic review and meta-analysis was aimed to synthesize the pooled estimate prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes mellitus, impaired fasting glucose and its associated factors in Ethiopia. The databases Medline, Hinari, Google Scholar, and Google search were used to find potential studies published from January 2013 until January 2021. Extracted data were entered into the excel spreadsheet. The random effects model with Der Simonian-Laird weights was used to assess the pooled estimate of prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes, impaired fasting glucose, and its associated factors. The Cochrane Q-test and I2 statistics were used to screen for statistical heterogeneity. A funnel plot and Egger's statistical test were also used to search for any publication bias (small study effect). After extensive searching of articles on different databases, a total of nine studies were included for this systematic review and meta-analysis. In random effects model, the pooled prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes mellitus and impaired fasting glucose was 5.75%, 95% CI (3.90–7.59%), and 8.94%, 95% CI (2.60–15.28%), respectively. Regarding the associated factors, participants family history of diabetes was significantly associated with diabetes status. The pooled odds of developing diabetes mellitus among participants with a family history of diabetes mellitus were about 3.56 times higher than those without a family history of diabetes mellitus (OR = 3.56, 95% CI (2.23, 5.68)). In this review, the higher prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes mellitus and impaired fasting glucose was observed among adults in Ethiopia.

82,PMC5744728,"Determining risk factors for diabetes insipidus (DI) after pituitary surgery is important in improving patient care. Our objective is to determine the factors associated with DI after pituitary surgery.
We reviewed records of patients who underwent pituitary surgery from 2011 to 2015 at Philippine General Hospital. Patients with preoperative DI were excluded. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed and a predictive model was generated. The discrimination abilities of the predictive model and individual variables were assessed using the receiving operator characteristic curve.
A total of 230 patients were included. The rate of postoperative DI was 27.8%. Percent change in serum Na (odds ratio [OR], 1.39; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.15 to 1.69); preoperative serum Na (OR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.40); and performance of craniotomy (OR, 5.48; 95% CI, 1.60 to 18.80) remained significantly associated with an increased incidence of postoperative DI, while percent change in urine specific gravity (USG) (OR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.33 to 0.87) and meningioma on histopathology (OR, 0.05; 95% CI, 0.04 to 0.70) were significantly associated with a decreased incidence.

83,PMC8024941,"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is associated with several maternal complications in pregnancy, including preeclampsia, preterm labor, need for induction of labor, and cesarean delivery as well as increased long-term risks of type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular disease. Intrauterine exposure to GDM raises the risk for complications in offspring as well, including stillbirth, macrosomia, and birth trauma, and long-term risk of metabolic disease. One of the strongest risk factors for GDM is the occurrence of GDM in a prior pregnancy. Preliminary data from epidemiologic and bariatric surgery studies suggest that reducing body weight before pregnancy can prevent the development of GDM, but no adequately powered trial has tested the effects of a maternal lifestyle intervention before pregnancy to reduce body weight and prevent GDM recurrence.
The principal aim of the Gestational Diabetes Prevention/Prevención de la Diabetes Gestacional is to determine whether a lifestyle intervention to reduce body weight before pregnancy can reduce GDM recurrence. This two-site trial targets recruitment of 252 women with overweight and obesity who have previous histories of GDM and who plan to have another pregnancy in the next 1–3 years. Women are randomized within site to a comprehensive pre-pregnancy lifestyle intervention to promote weight loss with ongoing treatment until conception or an educational control group. Participants are assessed preconceptionally (at study entry, after 4 months, and at brief quarterly visits until conception), during pregnancy (at 26 weeks’ gestation), and at 6 weeks postpartum. The primary outcome is GDM recurrence, and secondary outcomes include fasting glucose, biomarkers of cardiometabolic disease, prenatal and perinatal complications, and changes over time in weight, diet, physical activity, and psychosocial measures.
The Gestational Diabetes Prevention /Prevención de la Diabetes Gestacional is the first randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effects of a lifestyle intervention delivered before pregnancy to prevent GDM recurrence. If found effective, the proposed lifestyle intervention could lay the groundwork for shifting current treatment practices towards the interconception period and provide evidence-based preconception counseling to optimize reproductive outcomes and prevent GDM and associated health risks.

Canagliflozin, a widely used orally active inhibitor of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2), is a new addition to the therapeutic armamentarium of glucose-lowering drugs. This review summarizes findings from different clinical and observational studies of canagliflozin 300 mg in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). By inhibiting SGLT2, canagliflozin reduces reabsorption of filtered glucose, thereby increasing urinary glucose excretion in patients with T2DM. Canagliflozin 300 mg has been shown to be effective in lowering glycated hemoglobin, fasting plasma glucose, and postprandial glucose in patients with T2DM. Canagliflozin 300 mg also demonstrated significant reductions in body weight and blood pressure and has a low risk of causing hypoglycemia, when not used in conjunction with insulin and insulin secretagogues. Canagliflozin 300 mg was generally well tolerated in clinical studies.

There are important differences in the pathophysiology of CVD in T1DM and T2DM. Hyperglycaemia appears to have a more profound effect on cardiovascular risk in T1DM than T2DM, and other risk factors appear to cause a synergistic rather than additive effect, so achievement of treatment targets for all recognized risk factors is crucial to reducing cardiovascular risk.

We review the impact of diabetes on establishing, during childhood and adolescence, the premises for cardiovascular diseases later in life. Interestingly, it seems that hyperglycemia is not the only factor that establishes an increased cardiovascular risk in adolescence. Other factors have been recognized to play a role in triggering the onset of latent cardiovascular diseases in the pediatric population. Among these cardiovascular risk factors, some are modifiable: glucose variability, hypoglycemia, obesity, insulin resistance, waist circumference, hypertension, dyslipidemia, smoking alcohol, microalbuminuria and smoking. Others are unmodifiable, such as diabetes duration and family history. Among the etiological factors, subclinical endothelial dysfunction represents one of the earliest key players of atherosclerosis and it can be detected during early ages in patients with diabetes. A better assessment of cardiovascular risk in pediatric population still represents a challenge for clinicians, and thus further efforts are required to properly identify and treat pediatric patients who may suffer from cardiovascular disease later in early adulthood.",2020 Jul 12,The Impact of Diabetes Mellitus on Cardiovascular Risk Onset in Children and Adolescents,International Journal of Molecular Sciences

The aim of this study is to assess the 10‐year clinical outcome of new‐generation biodegradable polymer‐based sirolimus‐eluting stents (Yukon Choice PC) versus permanent polymer‐based everolimus‐eluting stents (XIENCE) in patients with and without diabetes mellitus.
In a prespecified subgroup analysis, outcomes of patients with or without diabetes mellitus treated with drug‐eluting stents were compared. The primary end point of this analysis was major adverse cardiac event, the composite of death, myocardial infarction, or target lesion revascularization. The analysis includes a total of 1951 patients (560 patients with and 1391 patients without diabetes mellitus) randomized to treatment with Yukon Choice PC (n=1299) or Xience (n=652). Regarding the primary end point, at 10 years patients with diabetes mellitus showed significantly higher major adverse cardiac event rates than patients without diabetes mellitus (P<0.001; hazard ratio [HR], 1.41; 95% CI, 1.22–1.63).

This study aimed to determine whether diabetes mellitus and high body mass index are risk factors for COVID-19 in pregnancy and whether gestational diabetes mellitus is associated with COVID-19 diagnosis.
INTERCOVID was a multinational study conducted between March 2020 and February 2021 in 43 institutions from 18 countries, enrolling 2184 pregnant women aged ≥18 years; a total of 2071 women were included in the analyses. For each woman diagnosed with COVID-19, 2 nondiagnosed women delivering or initiating antenatal care at the same institution were also enrolled. The main exposures were preexisting diabetes mellitus, high body mass index (overweight or obesity was defined as a body mass index ≥25 kg/m2), and gestational diabetes mellitus in pregnancy. The main outcome was a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 based on a real-time polymerase chain reaction test, antigen test, antibody test, radiological pulmonary findings, or ≥2 predefined COVID-19 symptoms at any time during pregnancy or delivery. Relationships of exposures and COVID-19 diagnosis were assessed using generalized linear models with a Poisson distribution and log link function, with robust standard errors to account for model misspecification. Furthermore, we conducted sensitivity analyses: (1) restricted to those with a real-time polymerase chain reaction test or an antigen test in the last week of pregnancy, (2) restricted to those with a real-time polymerase chain reaction test or an antigen test during the entire pregnancy, (3) generating values for missing data using multiple imputation, and (4) analyses controlling for month of enrollment. In addition, among women who were diagnosed with COVID-19, we examined whether having gestational diabetes mellitus, diabetes mellitus, or high body mass index increased the risk of having symptomatic vs asymptomatic COVID-19.
COVID-19 was associated with preexisting diabetes mellitus (risk ratio, 1.94; 95% confidence interval, 1.55–2.42), overweight or obesity (risk ratio, 1.20; 95% confidence interval, 1.06–1.37), and gestational diabetes mellitus (risk ratio, 1.21; 95% confidence interval, 0.99–1.46). The gestational diabetes mellitus association was specifically among women requiring insulin, whether they were of normal weight (risk ratio, 1.79; 95% confidence interval, 1.06–3.01) or overweight or obese (risk ratio, 1.77; 95% confidence interval, 1.28–2.45). A somewhat stronger association with COVID-19 diagnosis was observed among women with preexisting diabetes mellitus, whether they were of normal weight (risk ratio, 1.93; 95% confidence interval, 1.18–3.17) or overweight or obese (risk ratio, 2.32; 95% confidence interval, 1.82–2.97). When the sample was restricted to those with a real-time polymerase chain reaction test or an antigen test in the week before delivery or during the entire pregnancy, including missing variables using imputation or controlling for month of enrollment, the observed associations were comparable.

The diabetes status was defined as no diabetes (HbA1c < 6.5% or non-fasting blood glucose <11.1 mmol/l), subjects with known or undetected diabetes mellitus and HbA1c ≤ 7% (well-controlled diabetes), and subjects with known or undetected diabetes mellitus and HbA1c > 7% (poorly-controlled diabetes). The caries status was clinically assessed using the half-mouth method and the Decayed Missing Filled Surfaces (DMFS) index and its component scores were determined. Covariate-adjusted linear mixed models were evaluated. Rates in change in DMFS were significantly higher in subjects with poorly-controlled diabetes compared to subjects without diabetes. Subjects with poorly- and well-controlled diabetes had significantly higher rates in change in Missing Surfaces (MS) compared to subjects without diabetes. For the DFS, rates in change were significantly lower for subjects with well-controlled diabetes and higher for subjects with poorly-controlled diabetes as compared to subjects without diabetes. Concordantly, all rates in change increased proportional to HbA1c levels. Effects were even more pronounced in subjects with diabetes duration of ≥5 years.

92,PMC8495622,"Women’s metabolism during pregnancy undergoes numerous changes that can lead to gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). The cause and pathogenesis of GDM, a heterogeneous disease, are not completely clear, but GDM is increasing in prevalence and is associated with the modern lifestyle. Most diagnoses of GDM are made via the guidelines from the International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups (IADSPG), which involve an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) between 24 and 28 weeks of pregnancy. Diagnosis in this stage of pregnancy can lead to short- and long-term implications for the mother and child. Therefore, there is an urgent need for earlier GDM markers in order to enable prevention and earlier treatment. Routine GDM biomarkers (plasma glucose, insulin, C-peptide, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance, and sex hormone-binding globulin) can differentiate between healthy pregnant women and those with GDM but are not suitable for early GDM diagnosis.

93,PMC8278111,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is one of the major chronic diseases, whose prevalence is increasing dramatically worldwide and can lead to a range of serious complications. Wnt ligands (Wnts) and their activating Wnt signalling pathways are closely involved in the regulation of various processes that are important for the occurrence and progression of T2DM and related complications. However, our understanding of their roles in these diseases is quite rudimentary due to the numerous family members of Wnts and conflicting effects via activating the canonical and/or non‐canonical Wnt signalling pathways. In this review, we summarize the current findings on the expression pattern and exact role of each human Wnt in T2DM and related complications, including Wnt1, Wnt2, Wnt2b, Wnt3, Wnt3a, Wnt4, Wnt5a, Wnt5b, Wnt6, Wnt7a, Wnt7b, Wnt8a, Wnt8b, Wnt9a, Wnt9b, Wnt10a, Wnt10b, Wnt11 and Wnt16. Moreover, the role of main antagonists (sFRPs and WIF‐1) and coreceptor (LRP6) of Wnts in T2DM and related complications and main challenges in designing Wnt‐based therapeutic approaches for these diseases are discussed.

Diabetes insipidus can manifest during pregnancy, induced by increased vasopressinase activity secreted by placental trophoblasts and usually manifests in the third trimester. This presentation elucidates not only the intricate balance between the physiology of pregnancy and hormonal homeostasis, but also the importance of post-partum care as the physiological changes of pregnancy still hold pathological potential in the weeks immediately following delivery.
Diabetes insipidus (DI) is a rare complication of pregnancy occurring in 1 in 30 000 pregnancies.
It is associated with excessive vasopressinase activity, secreted by placental trophoblasts, which increases the rate of degradation of anti-diuretic hormone.
It is responsive to synthetic desmopressin 1-deanimo-8-d-arginine vasopressin as this form is not degraded by placental vasopressinase.
Vasopressinase is proportional to placental weight, which is increased in pregnancies conceived with assisted reproductive techniques including in vitro fertilisation.

95,PMC6461273,"Implementation of dietary and lifestyle interventions prior to and early in pregnancy in high risk women has been shown to reduce the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) development later in pregnancy. Although numerous risk factors for GDM have been identified, the ability to accurately identify women before or early in pregnancy who could benefit most from these interventions remains limited. As nulliparous women are an under-screened population with risk profiles that differ from their multiparous counterparts, development of a prediction model tailored to nulliparous women may facilitate timely preventive intervention and improve maternal and infant outcomes. We aimed to develop and validate a model for preconception and early pregnancy prediction of gestational diabetes mellitus based on clinical risk factors for nulliparous women. A risk prediction model was built within a large California birth cohort including singleton live birth records from 2007–2012. Model accuracy was assessed both internally and externally, within a cohort of women who delivered at University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics between 2009–2017, using discrimination and calibration. Differences in predictive accuracy of the model were assessed within specific racial/ethnic groups. The prediction model included five risk factors: race/ethnicity, age at delivery, pre-pregnancy body mass index, family history of diabetes, and pre-existing hypertension. The area under the curve (AUC) for the California internal validation cohort was 0.732 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.728, 0.735), and 0.710 (95% CI 0.672, 0.749) for the Iowa external validation cohort. The model performed particularly well in Hispanic (AUC 0.739) and Black women (AUC 0.719).

96,PMC7449009,"Although important achievements have been done in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) treatment and glycemic control, new strategies may take advantage of non-pharmacological approaches and of other potential determinants of health (e.g., socioeconomic status, education, diabetes knowledge, physical activity, and self-care behavior). However, the relationships between these factors are not totally clear and have not been studied in the context of large urban settings. This study aimed to explore the relationship between these determinants of glycemic control (GC) in a low-income urban population from Mexico City, focused in exploring potential the mediation of self-care behaviors in the association between diabetes knowledge and GC.
A multicenter cross-sectional study was conducted in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) from 28 primary care outpatient centers located in Mexico City. Using multivariable-adjusted models, we determined the associations between diabetes knowledge, self-care behaviors, and GC. The mediation analyses to determine the pathways on glycemic control were done using linear regression models, where the significance of indirect effects was calculated with bootstrapping.
The population (N = 513) had a mean age of 53.8 years (standard deviation: 11.3 yrs.), and 65.9% were women. Both socioeconomic status and level of education were directly associated with diabetes knowledge. Using multivariable-adjusted linear models, we found that diabetes knowledge was associated with GC (β: -0.102, 95% Confidence Interval [95% CI] -0.189, − 0.014). Diabetes knowledge was also independently associated with self-care behavior (for physical activity: β: 0.181, 95% CI 0.088, 0.273), and self-care behavior was associated with GC (for physical activity: β: -0.112, 95% CI -0.194, − 0.029). The association between diabetes knowledge and GC was not observed after adjustment for self-care behaviors, especially physical activity (β: -0.084, 95% CI -0.182, 0.014, p-value: 0.062). Finally, the mediation models showed that the effect of diabetes knowledge on GC was 17% independently mediated by physical activity (p-value: 0.049).
Socioeconomic and educational gradients influence diabetes knowledge among primary care patients with type 2 diabetes.

The aim of our study was to: 1) analyze the evolution of the incidence of childhood type 1 diabetes in Romania between 1996 and 2015, and: 2) to search for differences amongst age groups, gender, geographic regions and month of diagnosis.
Data on all new cases of type 1 diabetes, aged <15 years, obtained from two independent sources, were included in the study. The statistical methods included modeling of the incidence rates, adjusting for age, sex, calendar year, geographic region and seasonality.
The study group was composed of 5422 children, with overall completeness of ascertainment estimated at 93.7%. The incidence rate (per 100.000 person-years) rose continuously, from 4.7 [95% confidence interval (CI) 3.9-5.7] in 1996 to 11.0 (95% CI 9.9-12.2) in 2015, by a yearly rate of 5.1%, highest in the youngest and lowest in the oldest children. The mean incidence was significantly higher (p<0.0001) in Transylvania (7.9, 95% CI 7.6-8.3) than in Moldavia (6.5, 95% CI 6.2-6.9) and Muntenia (7.0, 95% CI 6.7-7.3), probably due to differences regarding ethnicity and lifestyle.

98,PMC5583950,"The present meta‐analysis was carried out to assess the association between exposure to the level of atmospheric particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5; fine particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 μm) and type 2 diabetes mellitus or gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).
We searched the Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane and Web of Science databases to obtain articles according to the responding literature search strategies. Among a total of 279 identified articles, 55 were reviewed in depth, of which 10 articles (11 cohort studies) satisfied the inclusion criteria. Only cohort studies that disclosed the association between PM2.5 and type 2 diabetes mellitus or GDM were included in this article. A fixed‐effects model was selected if P > 0.1 and I 2 < 50%; otherwise, a random‐effects model would be used to calculate the total effect value. Subgroup analysis was further carried out according to the types of diabetes mellitus (type 2 diabetes mellitus and GDM). The relative risk was used to estimate the association between PM2.5 and diabetes mellitus.
The positive associations between PM2.5 and the incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus were found in the long‐term exposure period (relative risk 1.25, 95% confidence interval 1.10–1.43), which showed that with every 10‐μg/m3 increase in PM2.5, the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus would increase by 25% in the long‐term exposure. Although the significant associations were not identified between maternal exposure to PM2.5 and GDM in the first trimester, the second trimester and the entire pregnancy periods, we could conclude that maternal exposure to PM2.5 in the entire pregnancy period would be more likely to lead to developing GDM (relative risk 1.162, 95% confidence interval 0.806–1.675) than the other two periods.
Long‐term exposure to PM2.5 would be more likely to lead to developing type 2 diabetes mellitus, but more studies would be required to confirm the association between PM2.5 and GDM. It might be a wise to take effective measures to reduce PM2.5 exposure in vulnerable populations, especially for pregnant women.",2017 May 3,Association between particulate matter 2.5 and diabetes mellitus: A meta‐analysis of cohort studies,Journal of Diabetes Investigation

We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, the Cochrane Library databases and other databases for case–control studies related to risk factors for new‐onset diabetes mellitus after kidney transplantation published between January 2005 and July 2019. A meta‐analysis of data on risk factors for new‐onset diabetes mellitus after kidney transplantation from the included studies was carried out. A narrative review of risk factors for new‐onset diabetes mellitus after kidney transplantation was also carried out.
A total of 24 case–control studies were included in the meta‐analysis, with a total of 7,140 patients. There were 1,598 patients with new‐onset diabetes mellitus after kidney transplantation, and 5,542 patients without new‐onset diabetes mellitus after kidney transplantation. The meta‐analysis results showed that age, polycystic kidney disease, family history of diabetes, body mass index, acute rejection, tacrolimus use, hepatitis B virus infection, hepatitis C virus infection and hypertension were associated with new‐onset diabetes mellitus after kidney transplantation, whereas sex, sirolimus use, cyclosporin A use, steroid use and cytomegalovirus infection were not associated with new‐onset diabetes mellitus after kidney transplantation.
Older age, body mass index, family history of diabetes, tacrolimus use, history of hypertension, polycystic kidney disease, acute rejection, hepatitis B virus infection and hepatitis C virus infection are risk factors for new‐onset diabetes mellitus after kidney transplantation. Therefore, the clinical implications of these factors warrant attention.

101,PMC7660865,"The normal rate of subclinical vascular aging from adolescence to young adulthood has not been well‐characterized. We conducted a 5‐year longitudinal study among adolescents with normal‐weight, obesity, and/or type 2 diabetes mellitus to examine trajectories of early vascular aging.
Adolescents (mean [SD] age 17.6 [3.5]; 35.3% male) had either normal weight (n=141), obesity (n=156), or type 2 diabetes mellitus (n=151) at baseline. Primary metrics used for early vascular aging included measures of vascular structure (carotid intima‐media thickness [cIMT]; common, internal, and bulb) and arterial stiffness (carotid‐femoral pulse wave velocity, and augmentation index). Longitudinal (5‐year) outcomes were examined using generalized estimating equations adjusting for baseline value, sex, race, and age. Compared with participants with normal weight, those with obesity had greater positive change in common cIMT (0.05 mm [0.03, 0.06]; P<0.001), bulb cIMT (0.02 mm [0.00, 0.05]; P=0.033), internal cIMT (0.03 mm [0.01, 0.05]; P<0.001), and pulse wave velocity carotid‐femoral (0.38 m/sec [0.14, 0.61]; P=0.001), and those with type 2 diabetes mellitus had greater positive change in common cIMT (0.05 mm [0.04, 0.07]; P<0.001), bulb cIMT (0.06 mm [0.04, 0.09]; P<0.001), internal cIMT (0.04 mm [0.02, 0.07]; P<0.001), augmentation index (4.67% [2.20, 7.13]; P<0.001), and pulse wave velocity carotid‐femoral (0.74 m/sec [0.46, 1.02]; P<0.001). Higher baseline systolic blood pressure was associated with greater positive change in common cIMT (0.007 mm [0.003, 0.011]; P<0.001), bulb cIMT (0.009 mm [0.002, 0.016]; P=0.01), internal cIMT (0.008 mm [0.003, 0.013]; P=0.001), and pulse wave velocity carotid‐femoral (0.066 m/sec [0.002, 0.130]; P=0.042).

We report a male patient affected by X-linked AHC who presented with central diabetes insipidus and schwannoma in adulthood, which has not been described in association with AHC.
A 36-day-old male infant who presented with severe dehydration was admitted to the intensive care unit. His laboratory findings showed hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, hypoglycemia, and metabolic acidosis.

104,PMC7524078,"Despite mounting evidence of the positive relationship between diabetes mellitus (DM) and heart failure (HF), the entire context of the magnitude of risk for HF in relation to DM remains insufficiently understood. The principal reason is because new‐onset HF (HF occurring in participants without a history of HF) and recurrent HF (HF re‐occurring in patients with a history of HF) are not discriminated. This meta‐analysis aims to comprehensively and separately assess the risk of new‐onset and recurrent HF depending on the presence or absence of DM. We systematically searched cohort studies that examined the relationship between DM and new‐onset or recurrent HF using EMBASE and MEDLINE (from 1 Jan 1950 to 28 Jul 2019). The risk ratio (RR) for HF in individuals with DM compared with those without DM was pooled with a random‐effects model. Seventy‐four and 38 eligible studies presented data on RRs for new‐onset and recurrent HF, respectively. For new‐onset HF, the pooled RR [95% confidence interval (CI)] of 69 studies that examined HF as a whole [i.e. combining HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF)] was 2.14 (1.96–2.34). The large between‐study heterogeneity (I 2 = 99.7%, P < 0.001) was significantly explained by mean age [pooled RR (95% CI) 2.60 (2.38–2.84) for mean age < 60 years vs. pooled RR (95% CI) 1.95 (1.79–2.13) for mean age ≥ 60 years] (P < 0.001). Pooled RRs (95% CI) of seven and eight studies, respectively, that separately examined HFpEF and HFrEF risk were 2.22 (2.02–2.43) for HFpEF and 2.73 (2.71–2.75) for HFrEF. The risk magnitudes between HFpEF and HFrEF were not significantly different in studies that examined both HFpEF and HFrEF risks (P = 0.86). For recurrent HF, pooled RR (95% CI) of the 38 studies was 1.39 (1.33–1.45). The large between‐study heterogeneity (I 2 = 80.1%, P < 0.001) was significantly explained by the proportion of men [pooled RR (95% CI) 1.53 (1.40–1.68) for < 65% men vs. 1.32 (1.25–1.39) for ≥65% men (P = 0.01)] or the large pooled RR for studies of only participants with HFpEF [pooled RR (95% CI), 1.73 (1.32–2.26) (P = 0.002)]. Results indicate that DM is a significant risk factor for both new‐onset and recurrent HF. It is suggested that the risk magnitude is large for new‐onset HF especially in young populations and for recurrent HF especially in women or individuals with HFpEF. DM is associated with future HFpEF and HFrEF to the same extent.",2020 Jul 29,Diabetes mellitus and risk of new‐onset and recurrent heart failure: a systematic review and meta‐analysis,ESC Heart Failure
105,PMC7450332,"Metastasis to the pituitary gland is extremely rare (∼2% of sellar masses). Clinical, biochemical, and radiologic characteristics of pituitary metastasis are poorly defined and can be difficult to diagnose before surgery. We present an unusual case with pituitary metastasis as the first manifestation of renal cell carcinoma (RCC). A 70-year-old male presented with acute onset of weakness, dizziness, diplopia, and progressively worsening headache. The initial CT head revealed a heterogeneous sellar mass measuring 2.8 × 1.9 × 1.7 cm. A follow-up MRI showed the sellar mass invading the right cavernous sinus. The presumptive diagnosis was a pituitary macroadenoma. Physical examination revealed bilateral 6th cranial nerve palsy and episodes of intermittent binocular horizontal diplopia. Hormonal testing noted possible secondary adrenal insufficiency (AM serum cortisol: 3.3 mcg/dL, ACTH: 8 pg/mL), secondary hypothyroidism (TSH: <0.01 mIU/L, FT4: 0.7 ng/dL), secondary hypogonadism (testosterone: 47 ng/dL, LH: 1.3 mIU/mL, and FSH: 2.3 mIU/mL), and elevated serum prolactin (prolactin: 56.8 ng/ml, normal: 4.0–15.2 ng/ml). IGF-1 level was normal at 110 ng/mL (47–192 ng/mL). The patient was discharged on levothyroxine and hydrocortisone therapy with plans for close surveillance. However, his condition worsened over the next three months, and he was subsequently readmitted with nausea, vomiting, and hypernatremia secondary to diabetes insipidus. Repeat MRI pituitary showed an interval increase in the size of the sellar mass with suprasellar extension and a new mass effect on the optic chiasm. The sellar mass was urgently resected via a trans-sphenoidal approach. The tumor was negative for neuroendocrine markers and pituitary hormone panel, ruling out the diagnosis of pituitary adenoma and triggered workup for metastatic renal cell carcinoma, clear cell type. The diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma was confirmed by the diffuse and strong staining for renal cell carcinoma markers (Pax-8, RCC-1, and CD10). A follow-up CT scan noted large right renal mass measuring 11 × 10 × 11 cm. The patient underwent a cytoreductive robotic right radical nephrectomy for WHO/ISUP histologic grade II clear cell RCC, stage pT2b pNX pM1. He subsequently received fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy to the pituitary gland. He is presently stable with no radiological evidence of progression or new intracranial disease on subsequent imaging. Pituitary metastasis most commonly occurs from breast, lung, or gastrointestinal tumors but also rarely from renal cell carcinoma. Biochemical findings such as panhypopituitarism, acute clinical signs such as headache, visual symptoms, and diabetes insipidus and interval increase in sellar mass in a short time interval should raise suspicion for sellar metastasis.",2020 Aug 18,Symptomatic Pituitary Metastasis as Initial Manifestation of Renal Cell Carcinoma: Case Report and Review of Literature,Case Reports in Endocrinology
106,PMC7779271,"To investigate the genetic etiology and evaluate the diagnostic application of next‐generation sequencing for diabetes/persistent hyperglycemia in children and adolescents.
Patients with diabetes/persistent hyperglycemia, presenting with at least one other clinical manifestation (other than diabetes) or with a family history of diabetes, were recruited. The clinical and laboratory characteristics of the patients were recorded. Next‐generation sequencing was carried out, and candidate variants were verified by Sanger sequencing. Variant pathogenicity was further evaluated according to the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics guidelines.
This study included 101 potential probands, 36 of whom were identified as positive by genetic testing. A further 51.2 and 20.9% of variants were determined to be pathogenic or likely pathogenic, respectively. Variants associated with the disease were primarily identified in 21 genes and three regions of copy number variants. Among the 39 variants in 21 genes, 61.5% (24/39) were novel. The genetic diagnosis of 23 patients was confirmed based on genetic evidence and associated clinical manifestations. We reported GCK variants (21.7%, 5/23) as the most common etiology in our cohort. Different clinical manifestations were observed in one family with WFS1 variants.
Our findings support the use of next‐generation sequencing as a standard method in patients with diabetes/persistent hyperglycemia and provide insights into the etiologies of these conditions.

Scoping review.
Guided by Arksey and O’Malley’s scoping review framework, this review mapped literature on the global implementation of the framework for the management of TB and DM comorbidity, globally. An extensive literature search for peer-reviewed studies, theses, studies in the press and a list of references from the selected studies was conducted to source-eligible studies. PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science, Science Direct, the EBSCOhost platform (academic search complete, health source: nursing/academic edition, CINAHL with full text), Scopus and the WHO library were used to source the literature. We performed title screening of articles using keywords in the databases, after which two independent reviewers (RS and PV) screened abstracts and full articles. Studies from August 2011 to May 2021 were included in this review and the screening was guided by the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Findings were analysed using the thematic content analysis approach and results presented in the form of a narrative report. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis extension was used as a checklist and for explaining the scoping review process.
This review found evidence of the WHO TB-DM collaborative framework’s implementation in 35 countries across the globe. TB-DM comorbidity was identified in patients through bidirectional screening of both patients with TB and patients with DM in rural and urban settings.
Due to the paucity of evidence on mechanisms of collaboration, we recommend further research in other implementing countries to identify techniques used for diagnosis and integration of TB and DM services, in order to ensure that effective and joint management of TB-DM comorbidity in populations is achieved.",2021 Nov 16,Implementation of the WHO’s collaborative framework for the management of tuberculosis and diabetes: a scoping review,BMJ Open

We report the first case of a 20-year-old man suffering from hypothalamopituitary histiocytosis and diabetes mellitus with serum anti-insulin receptor antibodies.
 A 20-year-old patient was admitted for the evaluation of growth delay and hyperphagia. HbA1c level and fasting blood glucose were in the normal range.

Association of vinblastine and purinethol was started followed by a second-line therapy by cladribine. During the follow-up, the patient was admitted for recurrence of hyperglycemic states and extreme insulin resistance. The screening for serum anti-insulin receptor antibodies was positive. Each episode of hyperglycemia appeared to be correlated with tumoral activity and increase in serum anti-insulin receptor antibodies and appeared to be improved when the disease was controlled by chemotherapy.

109,PMC5687125,"The past two decades have witnessed many advances in the prevention, treatment, and control of diabetes mellitus (DM) and its complications. Increased screening has led to a greater recognition of type 2 diabetes mellitus (type 2 DM) and prediabetes; however, Hispanics/Latinos, the largest minority group in the US, have not fully benefited from these advances. The Hispanic/Latino population is highly diverse in ancestries, birth places, cultures, languages, and socioeconomic backgrounds, and it populates most of the Western Hemisphere. In the US, the prevalence of DM varies among Hispanic/Latino heritage groups, being higher among Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, and Dominicans, and lower among South Americans. The risk and prevalence of diabetes among Hispanics/Latinos are significantly higher than in non-Hispanic Whites, and nearly 40% of Hispanics/Latinos with diabetes have not been formally diagnosed. Despite these striking facts, the representation of Hispanics/Latinos in pharmacological and non-pharmacological clinical trials has been suboptimal, while the prevalence of diabetes in these populations continues to rise. This review will focus on the epidemiology, etiology and prevention of type 2 DM in populations of Latin American origin. We will set the stage by defining the terms Hispanic, Latino, and Latin American, explaining the challenges identifying Hispanics/Latinos in the scientific literature and databases, describing the epidemiology of diabetes—including type 2 DM and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM)—and cardiovascular risk factors in Hispanics/Latinos in the US and Latin America, and discussing trends, and commonalities and differences across studies and populations, including methodology to ascertain diabetes. We will discuss studies on mechanisms of disease, and research on prevention of type 2 DM in Hispanics/Latinos, including women with GDM, youth and adults; and finalize with a discussion on lessons learned and opportunities to enhance research, and, consequently, clinical care oriented toward preventing type 2 DM in Hispanics/Latinos in the US and Latin America.",2017 Nov 10,From Sea to Shining Sea and the Great Plains to Patagonia: A Review on Current Knowledge of Diabetes Mellitus in Hispanics/Latinos in the US and Latin America,Frontiers in Endocrinology
110,PMC6448951,"Sleep duration is a risk factor for incident diabetes mellitus and CHD. The primary aim of the present study was to investigate, in sex-specific analyses, the role of incident diabetes as the possible biological mechanism for the reported association between short/long sleep duration and incident CHD. Considering that diabetes is a major risk factor for CHD, we hypothesised that any association with sleep duration would not hold for cases of incident CHD occurring before incident diabetes (‘non-diabetes CHD’) but would hold true for cases of incident CHD following incident diabetes (‘diabetes-CHD’).
A total of 6966 men and 9378 women aged 45–73 years from the Malmö Diet Cancer Study, a population-based, prospective cohort, who had answered questions on habitual sleep duration and did not have a history of prevalent diabetes or CHD were included in the analyses. Incident cases of diabetes and CHD were identified using national registers. Sex-specific Cox proportional hazards regression models were stratified by BMI and adjusted for known covariates of diabetes and CHD.
Mean follow-up times for incident diabetes (n = 1137/1016 [men/women]), incident CHD (n = 1170/578), non-diabetes CHD (n = 1016/501) and diabetes-CHD (n = 154/77) were 14.2–15.2 years for men, and 15.8–16.5 years for women. In men, short sleep duration (< 6 h) was associated with incident diabetes (HR 1.35, 95% CI 1.01, 1.80), CHD (HR 1.41, 95% CI 1.06, 1.89) and diabetes-CHD (HR 2.34, 95% CI 1.20, 4.55). Short sleep duration was not associated with incident non-diabetes CHD (HR 1.35, 95% CI 0.98, 1.87). Long sleep duration (≥ 9 h) was associated with incident diabetes (HR 1.37, 95% CI 1.03, 1.83), CHD (HR 1.33, 95% CI 1.01, 1.75) and diabetes-CHD (HR 2.10, 95% CI 1.11, 4.00). Long sleep duration was not associated with incident non-diabetes CHD (HR 1.33, 95% CI 0.98, 1.80). In women, short sleep duration was associated with incident diabetes (HR 1.53, 95% CI 1.16, 2.01), CHD (HR 1.46, 95% CI 1.03, 2.07) and diabetes-CHD (HR 2.88, 95% CI 1.37, 6.08). Short sleep duration was not associated with incident non-diabetes CHD (HR 1.29, 95% CI 0.86, 1.93).
The associations between sleep duration and incident CHD directly reflect the associations between sleep duration and incident diabetes. Incident diabetes may thus be the explanatory mechanism for the association between short and long sleep duration and incident CHD.

112,PMC6215627,"Despite lithium being the most efficacious treatment for bipolar disorder, its use has been decreasing at least in part due to concerns about its potential to cause significant nephrotoxicity. Whilst the ability of lithium to cause nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is well established, its ability to cause chronic kidney disease is a much more vexing issue, with various studies suggesting both positive and negative causality. Despite these differences, the weight of evidence suggests that lithium has the potential to cause end stage kidney disease, albeit over a prolonged period.
A search strategy for this review was developed to identify appropriate studies, sourced from the electronic databases EMBASE, PubMed (NLM) and MEDLINE. Search terms included lithium with the AND operator to combine with nephrotoxicity or nephropathy or chronic kidney disease or nephrogenic diabetes insipidus or renal and pathophysiology.
The risks for the development of lithium induced nephropathy are less well defined but appear to include the length of duration of therapy as well as increasing age, as well as episodes of over dosage/elevated lithium levels. Whilst guidelines exist for the routine monitoring of lithium levels and renal function, it remains unclear when nephrological evaluation should occur, as well as when cessation of lithium therapy is appropriate balancing the significant attendant mental health risks as well as the potential for progression to occur despite cessation of therapy against the risks and morbidity of bipolar disorder itself.

114,PMC7081600,"The prevalence of patients with concomitant cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus (DM) is increasing rapidly. We aimed to compare the effectiveness of current cardiac rehabilitation (CR) programs across seven European countries between elderly cardiac patients with and without DM.
1633 acute and chronic coronary artery disease (CAD) patients and patients after valve intervention with an age 65 or above who participated in comprehensive CR (3 weeks to 3 months, depending on centre) were included. Peak oxygen uptake (VO2 peak), body mass index, resting systolic blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) were assessed before start of CR, at termination of CR (variable time point), and 12 months after start of CR, with no intervention after CR. Baseline values and changes from baseline to 12-month follow-up were compared between patients with and without DM using mixed models, and mortality and hospitalisation rates using logistic regression.
430 (26.3%) patients had DM. Patients with DM had more body fat, lower educational level, more comorbidities, cardiovascular risk factors, and more advanced CAD. Both groups increased their VO2 peak over the study period but with a significantly lower improvement from baseline to follow-up in patients with DM. In the DM group, change in HbA1c was associated with weight change but not with change in absolute VO2 peak. 12-month cardiac mortality was higher in patients with DM.
While immediate improvements in VO2 peak after CR in elderly patients with and without DM were similar, 12-month maintenance of this improvement was inferior in patients with DM, possibly related to disease progression. Glycemic control was less favourable in diabetic patients needing insulin in the short- and long-term.

115,PMC6278280,"The use of medicinal plants for the management of diabetes mellitus is on the rise in the developing countries, including South Africa. There is increasing scientific evidence that supports the claims by the traditional healers. In this review, we compare the families of previously reported anti-diabetic plants in the Eastern Cape by rating the anti-diabetic activity, mode of action and also highlight their therapeutic potentials based on the available evidence on their pharmacology and toxicity. Forty-five plants mentioned in ethnobotanical surveys were subjected to a comprehensive literature search in the available electronic databases such as PubMed, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar and Elsevier, by using “plant name” and “family” as the keywords for the primary searches to determine the plants that have been scientifically investigated for anti-diabetic activity. The search returned 25 families with Asteraceae highly reported, followed by Asphodelaceae and Alliaceae. Most of the plants have been studied for their anti-diabetic potentials in vivo and/or in vitro, with most of the plants having a higher percentage of insulin release and inhibition against carbohydrate digesting enzymes as compared with insulin mimetic and peripheral glucose uptake. Almost all the investigated plants also inhibit oxidative stress as part of their hypoglycemic activity with less toxicity. However, the isolation of their bioactive molecules is still lacking. This review provides a resource to enable thorough assessments of the therapeutic profiles of available medicinal plants used for the management of diabetes in the Eastern Cape, South Africa. Further studies such as the identification of the active ingredients of potent plants still need to be carried out; this may lead to new molecules in drug discovery and development.",2018 Oct 25,"Medicinal Plants Used for the Traditional Management of Diabetes in the Eastern Cape, South Africa: Pharmacology and Toxicology",Molecules
116,PMC4277290,"Wolfram syndrome (WFS) is inherited as an autosomal recessive disease with main clinical features of diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy, diabetes insipidus and deafness. However, various neurological defects may also be detected. The aim of this study was to evaluate aspects of brain structure and function using PET-CT (positron emission tomography and computed tomography) and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) in pediatric patients with WFS. Regional changes in brain glucose metabolism were measured using standardized uptake values (SUVs) based on images of (18F) fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in 7 WFS patients aged 10.1–16.0 years (mean 12.9±2.4) and in 20 healthy children aged 3–17.9 years (mean 12.8±4.1). In all patients the diagnosis of WFS was confirmed by DNA sequencing of the WFS1 gene. Hierarchical clustering showed remarkable similarities of glucose uptake patterns among WFS patients and their differences from the control group. SUV data were subsequently standardized for age groups <13 years old and>13 years old to account for developmental differences. Reduced SUVs in WFS patients as compared to the control group for the bilateral brain regions such as occipital lobe (−1.24±1.20 vs. −0.13±1.05; p = 0.028) and cerebellum (−1.11±0.69 vs. −0.204±1.00; p = 0.036) were observed and the same tendency for cingulate (−1.13±1.05 vs. −0.15±1.12; p = 0.056), temporal lobe (−1.10±0.98 vs. −0.15±1.10; p = 0.057), parietal lobe (−1.06±1.20 vs. −0.08±1.08; p = 0.058), central region (−1.01±1.04 vs. −0.09±1.06; p = 0.060), basal ganglia (−1.05±0.74 vs. −0.20±1.07; p = 0.066) and mesial temporal lobe (−1.06±0.82 vs. −0.26±1.08; p = 0.087) was also noticed. After adjusting for multiple hypothesis testing, the differences in glucose uptake were non-significant.

117,PMC7202837,"Diabetes mellitus is associated with poor prognosis in patients with COVID-19. On the other hand, COVID-19 contributes to worsening of dysglycemia in people with diabetes mellitus over and above that contributed by stress hyperglycemia. Herein, we have reviewed the two-way interactions between COVID-19 and diabetes mellitus.
We have performed an extensive literature search for articles in PubMed, EMBASE and Google Scholar databases till April 25, 2020, with the following keywords: “COVID-19”, “SARS-CoV-2”, “diabetes”, “diabetes mellitus”, “SARS”, “infection” and “management of diabetes mellitus” with interposition of the Boolean operator “AND”.
Compromised innate immunity, pro-inflammatory cytokine milieu, reduced expression of ACE2 and use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system antagonists in people with diabetes mellitus contribute to poor prognosis in COVID-19. On the contrary, direct β-cell damage, cytokine-induced insulin resistance, hypokalemia and drugs used in the treatment of COVID-19 (like corticosteroids, lopinavir/ritonavir) can contribute to worsening of glucose control in people with diabetes mellitus.
The two-way interaction between COVID-19 and diabetes mellitus sets up a vicious cycle wherein COVID-19 leads to worsening of dysglycemia and diabetes mellitus, in turn, exacerbates the severity of COVID-19. Thus, it is imperative that people with diabetes mellitus take all necessary precautions and ensure good glycemic control amid the ongoing pandemic.",2020 May 6,COVID-19 and diabetes mellitus: An unholy interaction of two pandemics,Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome
118,PMC4770143,"Collagen IV is a major component of basement membranes, and mutations in COL4A1, which encodes collagen IV alpha chain 1, cause a multisystemic disease encompassing cerebrovascular, eye and kidney defects. However, COL4A1 renal disease remains poorly characterized and its pathomolecular mechanisms are unknown. We show that Col4a1 mutations in mice cause hypotension and renal disease, including proteinuria and defects in Bowman's capsule and the glomerular basement membrane, indicating a role for Col4a1 in glomerular filtration. Impaired sodium reabsorption in the loop of Henle and distal nephron despite elevated aldosterone levels indicates that tubular defects contribute to the hypotension, highlighting a novel role for the basement membrane in vascular homeostasis by modulation of the tubular response to aldosterone. Col4a1 mutations also cause diabetes insipidus, whereby the tubular defects lead to polyuria associated with medullary atrophy and a subsequent reduction in the ability to upregulate aquaporin 2 and concentrate urine. Moreover, haematuria, haemorrhage and vascular basement membrane defects confirm an important vascular component. Interestingly, although structural and compositional basement membrane defects occurred in the glomerulus and Bowman's capsule, no tubular basement membrane defects were detected. By contrast, medullary atrophy was associated with chronic ER stress, providing evidence for cell-type-dependent molecular mechanisms of Col4a1 mutations. These data show that both basement membrane defects and ER stress contribute to Col4a1 renal disease, which has important implications for the development of treatment strategies for collagenopathies.

120,PMC6245229,"Many common genetic polymorphisms are associated with glycemic traits and type 2 diabetes (T2D), but knowledge about genetic determinants of glycemic traits in pregnancy is limited. We tested genetic variants known to be associated with glycemic traits and T2D in the general population for associations with glycemic traits in pregnancy and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Participants in two cohorts (Genetics of Glucose regulation in Gestation and Growth [Gen3G] and Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcome [HAPO]) underwent oral glucose tolerance testing at 24–32 weeks’ gestation. We built genetic risk scores (GRSs) for elevated fasting glucose and insulin, reduced insulin secretion and sensitivity, and T2D, using variants discovered in studies of nonpregnant individuals. We tested for associations between these GRSs, glycemic traits in pregnancy, and GDM. In both cohorts, the fasting glucose GRS was strongly associated with fasting glucose. The insulin secretion and sensitivity GRSs were also significantly associated with these traits in Gen3G, where insulin measurements were available. The fasting insulin GRS was weakly associated with fasting insulin (Gen3G) or C-peptide (HAPO). In HAPO (207 GDM case subjects), all five GRSs (T2D, fasting glucose, fasting insulin, insulin secretion, and insulin sensitivity) were significantly associated with GDM. In Gen3G (43 GDM case subjects), both the T2D and insulin secretion GRSs were associated with GDM; effect sizes for the other GRSs were similar to those in HAPO. Thus, despite the profound changes in glycemic physiology during pregnancy, genetic determinants of fasting glucose, fasting insulin, insulin secretion, and insulin sensitivity discovered outside of pregnancy influence GDM risk.",2018 Sep 26,Genetic Determinants of Glycemic Traits and the Risk of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus,Diabetes
121,PMC7406536,"Recent developments in the field of genetics have accelerated our understanding of the aetiology of complex diseases. Type 2 diabetes mellitus and cancer are no exception, with large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) facilitating exploration of the underlying pathology. Here, we discuss how genetics studies can be used to investigate the relationship between these complex diseases. Observational epidemiological studies consistently report that people with type 2 diabetes have a higher risk of several types of cancer. Indeed, type 2 diabetes and cancer share many common risk factors, such as obesity, ageing, poor diet and low levels of physical activity. However, questions remain regarding the biological mechanisms that link these two diseases. Large-scale GWAS of type 2 diabetes and cancer allow us to consider the evidence for shared genetic architecture. Several shared susceptibility genes have been identified, yet tissue specificity and direction of effect must be taken into account when considering common genetic aetiology. We also consider how GWAS, and associated techniques such as Mendelian randomisation, allow us to dissect the link between the two diseases and address questions such as ‘Does type 2 diabetes cause cancer or is the increased risk observed driven by higher adiposity or another associated metabolic feature?’

122,PMC4400507,"It is clinically useful to distinguish between two types of hereditary nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI): a ‘pure’ type characterized by loss of water only and a complex type characterized by loss of water and ions. Patients with congenital NDI bearing mutations in the vasopressin 2 receptor gene, AVPR2, or in the aquaporin-2 gene, AQP2, have a pure NDI phenotype with loss of water but normal conservation of sodium, potassium, chloride and calcium. Patients with hereditary hypokalemic salt-losing tubulopathies have a complex phenotype with loss of water and ions. They have polyhydramnios, hypercalciuria and hypo- or isosthenuria and were found to bear KCNJ1 (ROMK) and SLC12A1 (NKCC2) mutations. Patients with polyhydramnios, profound polyuria, hyponatremia, hypochloremia, metabolic alkalosis and sensorineural deafness were found to bear BSND mutations. These clinical phenotypes demonstrate the critical importance of the proteins ROMK, NKCC2 and Barttin to transfer NaCl in the medullary interstitium and thereby to generate, together with urea, a hypertonic milieu. This editorial describes two new developments: (i) the genomic information provided by the sequencing of the AQP2 gene is key to the routine care of these patients, and, as in other genetic diseases, reduces health costs and provides psychological benefits to patients and families and (ii) the expression of AQP2 mutants in Xenopus oocytes and in polarized renal tubular cells recapitulates the clinical phenotypes and reveals a continuum from severe loss of function with urinary osmolalities <150 mOsm/kg H2O to milder defects with urine osmolalities >200 mOsm/kg H2O.",2012 Mar 28,Aquaporin-2: new mutations responsible for autosomal-recessive nephrogenic diabetes insipidus—update and epidemiology,Clinical Kidney Journal

To describe electrolyte abnormalities after transsphenoidal hypophysectomy and to investigate possible associations between postoperative hypernatremia and clinical and surgical variables as well as with postoperative outcome.
One hundred and twenty‐seven client‐owned dogs.
Dogs with pituitary corticotroph adenomas that underwent transsphenoidal hypophysectomy were retrospectively included. Plasma sodium and potassium concentrations were measured −2, +2, +8, +24, and +48 hours from hypophysectomy. Clinical (breed, age, body weight, skull type, urinary cortisol/creatinine ratio, percentage of suppression to dexamethasone) and surgical variables (duration of anesthesia and surgery, pituitary dimensions) were compared to the development of hypernatremia.
Postoperative hypernatremia developed in 46.5% (57/127) of dogs and hyponatremia in 6.3% (8/127). Plasma sodium concentration increased after surgery and peaked at 8 hours after surgery, normalizing after 24 to 48 hours. Plasma potassium concentration increased without exceeding the reference limit.
No significant associations were found between clinical and surgical variables and hypernatremia, or between hypernatremia and postoperative death, long‐term survival or recurrence.
Surgery time was significantly longer in dogs that developed persistent diabetes insipidus (P = .02) and persistent diabetes insipidus occurred more frequently in dogs with enlarged pituitary glands (P = .01).
Hypernatremia remains a frequent postoperative complication after transsphenoidal hypophysectomy but did not appear to have an impact on postoperative outcome.

124,PMC4828552,"Objective. In pediatric central diabetes insipidus (CDI), etiology diagnosis and pituitary function monitoring are usually delayed. This study aimed to illustrate the importance of regular follow-up and pituitary function monitoring in pediatric CDI. Methods. The clinical, hormonal, and neuroradiological characteristics of children with CDI at diagnosis and during 1.5–2-year follow-up were collected and analyzed. Results. The study included 43 CDI patients. The mean interval between initial manifestation and diagnosis was 22.29 ± 3.67 months (range: 2–108 months). The most common complaint was polyuria/polydipsia. Causes included Langerhans cell histiocytosis, germinoma, and craniopharyngioma in 2, 5, and 4 patients; the remaining were idiopathic. No significant changes were found during the 1.5–2 years after CDI diagnosis. Twenty-three of the 43 cases (53.5%) had ≥1 anterior pituitary hormone deficiency. Isolated growth hormone deficiency was the most frequent abnormality (37.5%) and was not associated with pituitary stalk diameter. Multiple pituitary hormone deficiencies were found in 8 cases with pituitary stalk diameter > 4.5 mm. Conclusion. Diagnosis of CDI is usually delayed. CDI with a pituitary stalk diameter > 4.5 mm carries a higher risk of multiple pituitary hormone deficiencies.

We evaluated our institution’s incidence of DI following pituitary adenoma resection and assessed for preoperative risk factors that were associated with postoperative DI.
A retrospective review of 271 patients who underwent endoscopic endonasal resection of a pituitary adenoma between July 2010 and December 2016 by a single neurosurgical provider was completed.
All cases were from a single-center, academic institution.
Patients with a pituitary adenoma diagnosis confirmed on histology were included in the study. Those with previous surgery by a different provider were excluded.
The incidence of DI at our institution was 16.6% (45 of 271 patients), with only 4% (11 patients) having permanent DI. The presence of visual abnormalities (CI 1.29 to 4.75), suprasellar extension (CI 1.36 to 6.88), and maximal tumor diameter (1.02 to 1.08) was significantly associated with an increased incidence of postoperative DI (P < 0.05). Hyperprolactinemia, tumor functionality, and cerebrospinal fluid exposure were not associated with higher rates of postoperative DI (P > 0.05).
Pituitary adenoma patients presenting with visual abnormalities, suprasellar extension, or large tumors are at higher risk of developing DI postoperatively. These patients warrant closer postoperative monitoring as well as adequate preoperative counseling to decrease their postsurgical morbidity.

Although plasma arginine vasopressin (AVP) was undetectable after administration of hypertonic saline, urinary output was within normal range (1.5 to 2.2 L/day). The urine osmolality became above plasma levels during the hypertonic saline test. Hormonal provocative tests revealed partial glucocorticoid deficiency. Soon after the glucocorticoid therapy was begun, moderate polyuria (from 3.5–4.0 liters daily) occurred. At this time, plasma AVP was undetectable, and urine osmolality was consistently below plasma levels during the hypertonic saline test.

127,PMC6405678,"Diabetes mellitus is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and has been associated with 2‐ to 4‐fold higher mortality. Diabetes mellitus–related mortality has not been reassessed in individuals receiving routine care in the United States in the contemporary era of CVD risk reduction.
We retrospectively studied 963 648 adults receiving care in the US Veterans Affairs Healthcare System from 2002 to 2014; mean follow‐up was 8 years. We estimated associations of diabetes mellitus status and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) with all‐cause and CVD mortality using covariate‐adjusted incidence rates and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression. Of participants, 34% had diabetes mellitus. Compared with nondiabetic individuals, patients with diabetes mellitus had 7.0 (95% CI, 6.7–7.4) and 3.5 (95% CI, 3.3–3.7) deaths/1000‐person‐years higher all‐cause and CVD mortality, respectively. The age‐, sex‐, race‐, and ethnicity‐adjusted hazard ratio for diabetes mellitus–related mortality was 1.29 (95% CI, 1.28–1.31), and declined with adjustment for CVD risk factors (hazard ratio, 1.18 [95% CI, 1.16–1.19]) and glycemia (hazard ratio, 1.03 [95% CI, 1.02–1.05]). Among individuals with diabetes mellitus, CVD mortality increased as HbA1c exceeded 7% (hazard ratios, 1.11 [95% CI, 1.08–1.14], 1.25 [95% CI, 1.22–1.29], and 1.52 [95% CI, 1.48–1.56] for HbA1c 7%–7.9%, 8%–8.9%, and ≥9%, respectively, relative to HbA1c 6%–6.9%). HbA1c 6% to 6.9% was associated with the lowest mortality risk irrespective of CVD history or age.
Diabetes mellitus remains significantly associated with all‐cause and CVD mortality, although diabetes mellitus–related excess mortality is lower in the contemporary era than previously. We observed a gradient of mortality risk with increasing HbA1c >6% to 6.9%, suggesting HbA1c remains an informative predictor of outcomes even if causality cannot be inferred.

It has been reported that the average retinal thickness in WFS patients decreases with the progression of the disease. Aim: To investigate retinal thickness and wolframin expression disorders in Wolfram syndrome 1 gene knockout (Wfs1KO) mice compared to their wild-type (WT) littermates. Materials and methods: Both bulbs with optic nerves of three mice Wfs1WT and three Wfs1KO were taken for the histopathological examination. A strain of knockout mice with mutation in exon 8 was used. Results: No expression of wolframin protein in the retina and neurodegeneration of the optic nerve of Wfs1KO mice as compared among Wfs1WT mice was observed. The mean central retinal thickness was thinner and the retinal thickness/longitudinal diameter ratio was significantly lower in hte Wfs1KO as compared to the Wfs1WT mice. In four (67%) eyeballs of Wfs1KO mice, intra-retinal neovessels were observed.

We recruited patients <14 years of age with T1DM from 33 medical centers in 25 major cities of China between January 2012 and March 2015. All patients completed a questionnaire that was conducted by their pediatric endocrinologists at all centers.
A total of 1,603 children (755 males and 848 females) with T1DM participated in this survey. Of these, 834 (52.03%) of the patients exhibited diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) at onset, while 769 patients (47.97%) did not exhibit DKA (non-DKA) at onset. There was a higher proportion of females (55.71%) in the cohort of patients exhibiting DKA at onset than in the non-DKA cohort (49.33%). The mean age of patients exhibiting DKA at presentation was 7.12 ± 0.14 years; this was significantly younger than that in non-DKA group (7.79 ± 0.15 years; P < 0.005). The frequency of DKA in 3 years old, 3-7 years old, and 7 years old or more was 77.21%, 26.17%, and 37.62%, respectively. Upon initial diagnosis, 29.4%, 15.2% and 11.8% of patients showed positivity for glutamic acid decarboxylase antibody (GADA), Insulin autoantibodies (IAA), or islet cell antibody (ICA), respectively.

A total of 134 hospitalized type 2 diabetes mellitus patients were assessed by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment method, and divided into 65 MCI and 69 controls. Levels of variables, Gal3 and Aβ42, were investigated in relation with cognitive function in both type 2 diabetes mellitus patients with MCI and high‐fat diet/streptozotocin induced type 2 diabetes mellitus rats.
Significantly higher levels of serum Gal3 and lower levels of plasma Aβ42 (all P < 0.05) were found in the MCI type 2 diabetes mellitus group as compared with the non‐MCI type 2 diabetes mellitus control. Partial correlation analysis showed that Gal3 is negatively correlated with both MMSE score (r = −0.51, P < 0.01) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment score (r = −0.47, P < 0.001) after adjustment for glycated hemoglobin, homoeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance and Aβ42 in all type 2 diabetes mellitus patients, with a stronger effect seen in the MCI type 2 diabetes mellitus group after further analysis with MCI strata. A simple logistic regression model showed that Gal3 and Aβ42 are significantly associated with MCI type 2 diabetes mellitus patients after adjustment with the covariates sex, age, body mass index, glycated hemoglobin, homoeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance and antidiabetic drugs. Serum and brain Gal3 levels were significantly increased in high‐fat diet/streptozotocin diabetic rats, which correlate to the impairment of learning and memory ability. Gal3 inhibitor modified citrus pectin decreased serum and brain Gal3 levels in diabetic rats, accompanied by the amelioration of learning and memory impairment.

134,PMC3806620,"We used an unbiased genome-wide approach to identify exonic variants segregating with diabetes in a multigenerational Finnish family. At least eight members of this family presented with diabetes with age of diagnosis ranging from 18 to 51 years and a pattern suggesting autosomal dominant inheritance. We sequenced the exomes of four affected members of this family and performed follow-up genotyping of additional affected and unaffected family members. We uncovered a novel nonsynonymous variant (p.Trp314Arg) in the Wolfram syndrome 1 (WFS1) gene that segregates completely with the diabetic phenotype. Multipoint parametric linkage analysis with 13 members of this family identified a single linkage signal with maximum logarithm of odds score 3.01 at 4p16.2-p16.1, corresponding to a region harboring the WFS1 locus. Functional studies demonstrate a role for this variant in endoplasmic reticulum stress, which is consistent with the β-cell failure phenotype seen in mutation carriers. This represents the first compelling report of a mutation in WFS1 associated with dominantly inherited nonsyndromic adult-onset diabetes.",2013 Oct 18,Autosomal Dominant Diabetes Arising From a Wolfram Syndrome 1 Mutation,Diabetes
135,PMC7054376,"The aim of this study was to describe the characteristics and outcomes of pregnancies in a national cohort of teenage (<20 years) and young adult women (≥20 years) with and without childhood-onset (<15 years) type 1 diabetes. We hypothesised that, owing to poor glycaemic control during the teenage years, pregnancy outcomes would be poorer in teenage mothers with type 1 diabetes than young adult mothers with type 1 diabetes and mothers without diabetes.
The Brecon Register of childhood-onset type 1 diabetes diagnosed in Wales since 1995 was linked to population-based datasets in the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) Databank, creating an electronic cohort (e-cohort) of legal births (live or stillbirths beyond 24 weeks’ gestation) to women aged less than 35 years between 1995 and 2013 in Wales. Teenage pregnancy rates were calculated based on the number of females in the same birth cohort in Wales. Pregnancy outcomes, including pre-eclampsia, preterm birth, low birthweight, macrosomia, congenital malformations, stillbirths and hospital admissions during the first year of life, were obtained from electronic records for the whole Welsh population. We used logistic and negative binomial regression to compare outcomes among teenage and young adult mothers with and without type 1 diabetes.
A total of 197,796 births were eligible for inclusion, including 330 to girls and women with childhood-onset type 1 diabetes, of whom 68 were teenagers (age 14–19 years, mean 17.9 years) and 262 were young adults (age 20–32 years, mean 24.0 years). The mean duration of diabetes was 14.3 years (9.7 years for teenagers; 15.5 years for young adults). Pregnancy rates were lower in teenagers with type 1 diabetes than in teenagers without diabetes (mean annual teenage pregnancy rate between 1999 and 2013: 8.6 vs 18.0 per 1000 teenage girls, respectively; p < 0.001). In the background population, teenage pregnancy was associated with deprivation (p < 0.001), but this was not the case for individuals with type 1 diabetes (p = 0.85). Glycaemic control was poor in teenage and young adult mothers with type 1 diabetes (mean HbA1c based on closest value to conception: 81.3 and 80.2 mmol/mol [9.6% and 9.5%], respectively, p = 0.78). Glycaemic control improved during pregnancy in both groups but to a greater degree in young adults, who had significantly better glycaemic control than teenagers by the third trimester (mean HbA1c: 54.0 vs 67.4 mmol/mol [7.1% vs 8.3%], p = 0.01). All adverse outcomes were more common among mothers with type 1 diabetes than mothers without diabetes. Among those with type 1 diabetes, hospital admissions during the first year of life were more common among babies of teenage vs young adult mothers (adjusted OR 5.91 [95% CI 2.63, 13.25]). Other outcomes were no worse among teenage mothers with type 1 diabetes than among young adult mothers with diabetes.
Teenage girls with childhood-onset type 1 diabetes in Wales are less likely to have children than teenage girls without diabetes. Teenage pregnancy in girls with type 1 diabetes, unlike in the background population, is not associated with social deprivation. In our cohort, glycaemic control was poor in both teenage and young adult mothers with type 1 diabetes. Pregnancy outcomes were comparable between teenage and young adult mothers with type 1 diabetes, but hospital admissions during the first year of life were five times more common among babies of teenage mothers with type 1 diabetes than those of young adult mothers with diabetes.

136,PMC4528293,"Boundaries between monogenic and complex genetic diseases are becoming increasingly blurred, as a result of better understanding of phenotypes and their genetic determinants. This had a large impact on the way complex disease genetics is now being investigated. Starting with conventional approaches like familial linkage, positional cloning and candidate genes strategies, the scope of complex disease genetics has grown exponentially with scientific and technological advances in recent times. Despite identification of multiple loci harboring common and rare variants associated with complex diseases, interpreting and evaluating their functional role has proven to be difficult. Information from monogenic diseases, especially related to the intermediate traits associated with complex diseases comes handy. The significant overlap between traits and phenotypes of monogenic diseases with related complex diseases provides a platform to understand the disease biology better. In this review, we would discuss about one such complex disease, type 2 diabetes, which shares marked similarity of intermediate traits with different forms of monogenic diabetes.",2015 Aug 7,New insights from monogenic diabetes for “common” type 2 diabetes,Frontiers in Genetics
137,PMC8387910,"Diabetes is currently a growing concern of the age. Prevention and treatment of diabetes is a global health priority. Adiponectin is an adipocyte derived protein hormone that enhances insulin sensitivity and ameliorates diabetes by enhancing fatty acid oxidation and glucose uptake in skeletal muscle and reducing glucose production in the liver. Low serum adiponectin concentrations are associated with diabetes, central obesity, insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome. Adiponectin gene is located on chromosome 3q27, where a locus of susceptibility to diabetes was mapped. Several cross-sectional studies showed that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in adiponectin gene (ADIPOQ) were associated with diabetes. SNPs in ADIPOQ help in assessing the association of common variants with levels of adiponectin and the risk of diabetes. Two common SNPs, rs2241766 and rs1501299, have been linked significantly to type 1 diabetes mellitus which endow the world with a block of haplotypes. Experimental evidences also suggest that rs1501299, rs2241766, rs266729, rs17366743, rs17300539, rs182052, rs822396, rs17846866, rs3774261 and rs822393 are significantly associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus which is the predominant form of the disease. In addition, rs2241766 and rs266729 are extensively associated with gestational diabetes, a condition that develops in women during pregnancy. Therefore not a particular single mutation but a number of SNPs in adiponectin gene could be a risk factor for developing diabetes among the individuals worldwide. This study firmly suggests that adiponectin plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of type 1, type 2 and gestational diabetes mellitus.

138,PMC6518727,"Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (DI) secondary to a urinary tract obstruction is a rare condition. Herein, we report a case of partial nephrogenic DI due to obstructive uropathy in a patient with Castleman’s disease.
A 78-year-old man underwent computed tomography (CT) at his local hospital because of persistent edema of the leg and polyuria (both lasting approximately 2 months); retroperitoneal fibrosis was detected on the CT scan. An abdominal CT scan showed bilateral hydronephrosis, and a surgical biopsy of the para-aortic lymph node revealed Castleman’s disease. To resolve the hydronephrosis, a double J stent was inserted; however, his polyuria continued. As his serum osmolality (311 mOsm/kg) was greater than 300 mOsm/kg, and his serum sodium level was 149 mEq/L, a water deprivation test was not performed. On a vasopressin challenge test, his urine was not sufficiently concentrated to the expected range, indicating partial nephrogenic DI. He was treated with hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg/day), and his urine output gradually decreased to within the normal range. The patient recovered uneventfully and underwent treatment for Castleman’s disease.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of partial nephrogenic DI due to obstructive uropathy associated with Castleman’s disease.

The clinical signs of CNDI include polyuria, compensatory polydipsia, dehydration, electrolyte disorder, and developmental retardation without prompt treatment. In this study we report a rare case of CNDI caused by a single base transition in AQP2 gene. A 4.5 years old male patient suffered from oral dryness, polydipsia, and polyuria for more than 3 years. Laboratory examinations showed hypernatremia, hyperchloremia, and decreased urine osmolality and specific gravity. Ultrasound and MRI found bilateral upper ureteral dilatation and hydronephrosis. Furthermore, sequencing analysis found a C>T transition leading to a T108M missense mutation of AQP2. The patient was given low sodium diet and treated with hydrochlorothiazide followed by amiloride with indomethacin. The patient's clinical course improved remarkably after 1 year of treatment. This study reports the first case of CNDI featuring T108M missense mutation alone.

We hypothesized GDM and MH disorders will disproportionately affect individuals from Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic backgrounds.
A systematic methodology was developed, and a protocol was published in PROSPERO (CRD42020210863) and a systematic review of publications between 1st January 1990 and 30th January 2021 was conducted. Multiple electronic databases were explored using keywords and MeSH terms. The finalised dataset was analysed using statistical methods such as random-effect models, subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis. These were used to determine odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) to establish prevalence using variables of PND, anxiety, PTSD and stress to name a few.
Sixty studies were finalised from the 20,040 data pool. Forty-six studies were included systematically with 14 used to meta-analyze GDM and MH outcomes. A second meta-analysis was conducted using 7 studies to determine GDM risk among Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic women with pre-existing MH disorders. The results indicate an increased risk with pooled adjusted OR for both reflected at 1.23, 95% CI of 1.00–1.50 and 1.29, 95% CI of 1.11–1.50 respectively.
The available studies suggest a MH sequalae with GDM as well as a sequalae of GDM with MH among Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic populations. Our findings warrant further future exploration to better manage these patients.

141,PMC8687525,"Ac3IV (Ac-CYIQNCPRG-NH2) is an enzymatically stable vasopressin analogue that selectively activates Avpr1a (V1a) and Avpr1b (V1b) receptors. In the current study we have employed streptozotocin (STZ) diabetic transgenic Ins1Cre/+;Rosa26-eYFP and GluCreERT2;Rosa26-eYFP mice, to evaluate the impact of sustained Ac3IV treatment on pancreatic islet cell morphology and transdifferentiation. Twice-daily administration of Ac3IV (25 nmol/kg bw) to STZ-diabetic Ins1Cre/+;Rosa26-eYFP mice for 12 days increased pancreatic insulin (p<0.01) and significantly reversed the detrimental effects of STZ on pancreatic islet morphology. Such benefits were coupled with increased (p<0.01) beta-cell proliferation and decreased (p<0.05) beta-cell apoptosis. In terms of islet cell lineage tracing, induction of diabetes increased (p<0.001) beta- to alpha-cell differentiation in Ins1Cre/+;Rosa26-eYFP mice, with Ac3IV partially reversing (p<0.05) such transition events. Comparable benefits of Ac3IV on pancreatic islet architecture were observed in STZ-diabetic GluCreERT2;ROSA26-eYFP transgenic mice. In this model, Ac3IV provoked improvements in islet morphology which were linked to increased (p<0.05-p<0.01) transition of alpha- to beta-cells. Ac3IV also increased (p<0.05-p<0.01) CK-19 co-expression with insulin in pancreatic ductal and islet cells. Blood glucose levels were unchanged by Ac3IV in both models, reflecting the severity of diabetes induced.

142,PMC8660199,"Yuquan Pill (YQP), a Chinese patent medicine for the treatment of diabetes, is widely used in the treatment of diabetes and its complications in China. However, the efficacy of YQP on type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has not been completely assessed. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of YQP in the treatment of T2DM. 
 We systematically searched 9 databases for specific keywords from inception to Oct 2021. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving YQP in the treatment of T2DM without language limitation. The study conformed to the Cochrane Handbook and Review Manager software was used for data analysis. The weighted mean differences (WMDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to measure treatment effects. 
 The final analysis included 10 publications. Analysis showed that the combination of YQP and conventional treatment was more effective than conventional treatment alone with regard to the levels of fasting blood glucose (WMD = −0.83; 95% CI [−1.01,−0.66]; p < 0.00001), two-hour postprandial glucose (WMD = −1.40; 95% CI [−1.49,−1.31]; p < 0.00001), glycosylated hemoglobin (WMD = −0.87; 95% CI [−1.26, −0.49]; p < 0.00001), total cholesterol (WMD = −0.50; 95% CI [−0.61, −0.39]; p < 0.00001), c-reactive protein (WMD = −0.58; 95%CI [−0.88, −0.28]; p=0.0002), and overall effective rate (RR = 1.21; 95% CI [1.12, 1.31]; p < 0.00001). 
 Evidence suggested that YQP might improve glucose and lipid metabolism and inflammation in patients with T2DM. Serious adverse events were not reported.

143,PMC8584125,"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is one of the most common metabolic diseases in pregnant women. Its early diagnosis seems to have a significant impact on the developing fetus, the course of delivery, and the neonatal period. It may also affect the later stages of child development and subsequent complications in the mother. Therefore, the crux of the matter is to find a biopredictor capable of singling out women at risk of developing GDM as early as the very start of pregnancy. Apart from the well-known molecules with a proven and clear-cut role in the pathogenesis of GDM, e.g., adiponectin and leptin, a potential role of newer biomolecules is also emphasized. Less popular and less known factors with different mechanisms of action include: galectins, growth differentiation factor-15, chemerin, omentin-1, osteocalcin, resistin, visfatin, vaspin, irisin, apelin, fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4), fibroblast growth factor 21, and lipocalin-2. The aim of this review is to present the potential and significance of these 13 less known biomolecules in the pathogenesis of GDM. It seems that high levels of FABP4, low levels of irisin, and high levels of under-carboxylated osteocalcin in the serum of pregnant women can be used as predictive markers in the diagnosis of GDM.

144,PMC8790444,"Lymphocytic hypophysitis (LYH) is an important condition to consider in the differential diagnosis of patients with a pituitary mass. The main clinical manifestations of LYH include headache, symptoms related to sellar compression, hypopituitarism, diabetes insipidus and hyperprolactinemia. Headache, which is a frequent complaint of patients with LYH, is thought to be related to the occupying effect of the pituitary mass and is rapidly resolved with a good outcome after timely and adequate glucocorticoid treatment or surgery.
Here, we report a patient with LYH whose initial symptom was headache and whose pituitary function assessment showed the presence of secondary hypoadrenalism, central hypothyroidism and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Pituitary magnetic resonance imaging showed symmetrical enlargement of the pituitary gland with suprasellar extension in a dumbbell shape with significant homogeneous enhancement after gadolinium enhancement. The size of the gland was approximately 17.7 mm × 14.3 mm × 13.8 mm. The pituitary stalk was thickened without deviation, and there was an elevation of the optimal crossing. The lesion grew bilaterally toward the cavernous sinuses, and the parasternal dural caudal sign was visible.

Health status was measured with Seattle Angina Questionnaire (SAQ), 12‐item Short‐Form Health Survey, and EuroQol‐Visual Analogue Scale at baseline hospitalization, 1‐month, and 12‐months post‐AMI. At baseline, patients with diabetes mellitus had significantly worse SAQ‐angina frequency (81±22 versus 86±19), SAQ‐physical limitations (77±28 versus 85±23), SAQ‐quality of life (55±25 versus 57±23), 12‐item Short‐Form Health Survey mental (44±13 versus 46±12)/physical functioning (41±12 versus 46±12), and EuroQol‐Visual Analogue Scale (61±22 versus 66±21) than those without diabetes mellitus. Over time, both groups (with and without diabetes mellitus) improved considerably and the differences in health status scores progressively narrowed (except for 12‐item Short‐Form Health Survey physical functioning). In the linear‐mixed effects models, adjusted for sociodemographics, cardiovascular risk factors, comorbidities, clinical characteristics, psychosocial factors, healthcare use, and AMI treatment, diabetes mellitus was associated with worse health status at baseline but not after discharge, and the association did not vary by sex.
At baseline, young adults with diabetes mellitus had poorer health status than those without diabetes mellitus. After AMI, however, they experienced significant improvements and diabetes mellitus was not associated with worse angina, SAQ‐physical limitations, mental functioning, and quality of life, after adjustment for baseline covariates.

The causes of hypopituitarism in the reported studies varied and combined pituitary hormone deficiency including central diabetes insipidus is much common in this population. This retrospective cross-sectional study was performed to analyze the clinical characteristics and related factors with NAFLD and cirrhosis in Chinese adult hypopituitary/panhypopituitary patients.
To analyze the clinical characteristics of and related risk factors for NAFLD in Chinese adult hypopituitary patients.
Adult Chinese patients with hypopituitarism and/or panhypopituitarism were enrolled at the Pituitary Center of Peking Union Medical College Hospital between August 2012 and April 2018. According to abdominal ultrasonography, these patients were divided into an NAFLD (-) group and an NAFLD (+) group, and the latter was further divided into an NAFLD group and a cirrhotic group. The data, such as patient characteristics, diagnosis, and treatment, were extracted from medical records, and statistical analysis was performed.
A total of 36 male and 14 female adult Chinese patients with hypopituitarism were included in this retrospective study; 43 (87.0%) of these patients exhibited growth hormone (GH) deficiency, and 39 (78.3%) had diabetes insipidus. A total of 27 (54.0%) patients were diagnosed with NAFLD, while seven patients were cirrhotic. No significant differences were noted in serum GH or insulin-like growth factor 1 among patients with cirrhosis, subjects with NAFLD, and those without NAFLD. However, plasma osmolality and serum sodium concentration of the cirrhotic patients were 314.9 mOsm/kgH2O and 151.0 mmol/L, respectively, which were significantly higher than those of the NAFLD patients (P = 0.036 and 0.042, respectively). Overweight/obesity and insulin resistance were common metabolic disorders in this population. The body mass index (BMI) and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance parameters of the cirrhotic patients were 27.7 kg/m2 and 9.57, respectively, which were significantly higher than those of the patients without NAFLD (P = 0.011 and 0.044, respectively). A correlation analysis was performed, and fasting insulin concentration was positively associated with plasma osmolality in patients with NAFLD, after adjusting for gender, age, and BMI (r = 0.540, P = 0.046), but no correlation was noted in patients without NAFLD.
NAFLD is common in patients with hypopituitarism. Plasma osmolality and serum sodium levels of hypopituitary patients with cirrhosis are higher than those of subjects with NAFLD, and fasting insulin concentration is positively associated with plasma osmolality in patients with NAFLD, which suggests that hyperosmolality might be a contributor to the worsening of NAFLD in hypopituitary patients.",2019 Apr 14,Clinical characteristics of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in Chinese adult hypopituitary patients,World Journal of Gastroenterology

151,PMC7546937,"Latin America is the scenario of great inequalities where about 32 million human beings live with diabetes. Through this review, we aimed at describing the current state of the prevalence, awareness, treatment, and control of diabetes mellitus and completion of selected guidelines of care across Latin America and identify opportunities to advance research that promotes better health outcomes.
The prevalence of diabetes mellitus has been consistently increasing across the region, with some variation: higher prevalence in Mexico, Haiti, and Puerto Rico and lower in Colombia, Ecuador, Dominican Republic, Peru, and Uruguay. Prevalence assessment methods vary, and potentially underestimating the real number of persons with diabetes. Diabetes unawareness varies widely, with up to 50% of persons with diabetes who do not know they may have the disease. Glycemic, blood pressure, and LDL-C control and completion of guidelines to prevent microvascular complications are not consistently assessed across studies, and the achievement of control goals is suboptimal. On the other hand, multiple interventions, point-of-care/rapid assessment tools, and alternative models of health care delivery have been proposed and tested throughout Latin America.
The prevalence of diabetes mellitus continues to rise across Latin America, and the number of those with the disease may be underestimated.

152,PMC7048897,"To develop an evidence-based expert group opinion on the role of insulin motivation to overcome insulin distress during different stages of insulin therapy and to propose a practitioner’s toolkit for insulin motivation in the management of diabetes mellitus (DM).
Insulin distress, an emotional response of the patient to the suggested use of insulin, acts as a major barrier to insulin therapy in the management of DM. Addressing patient-, physician- and drug-related factors is important to overcome insulin distress. Strengthening of communication between physicians and patients with diabetes and enhancing the patients' coping skills are prerequisites to create a sense of comfort with the use of insulin. Insulin motivation is key to achieving targeted goals in diabetes care. A group of endocrinologists came together at an international meeting held in India to develop tool kits that would aid a practitioner in implementing insulin motivation strategies at different stages of the journey through insulin therapy, including pre-initiation, initiation, titration and intensification. During the meeting, emphasis was placed on the challenges and limitations faced by both physicians and patients with diabetes during each stage of the journey through insulinization.
After review of evidence and discussions, the expert group provided recommendations on strategies for improved insulin acceptance, empowering behavior change in patients with DM, approaches for motivating patients to initiate and maintain insulin therapy and best practices for insulin motivation at the pre-initiation, initiation, titration and intensification stages of insulin therapy.
In the management of DM, bringing in positive behavioral change by motivating the patient to improve treatment adherence helps overcome insulin distress and achieve treatment goals.",2020 Jan 24,A Practitioner’s Toolkit for Insulin Motivation in Adults with Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Evidence-Based Recommendations from an International Expert Panel,Diabetes Therapy
153,PMC6793600,"Evidence suggests that olfactory impairment (OI) may be a degenerative neurologic complication of diabetes; however, the association is not yet well established. The objective of this work was to systematically review existing literature on the association between diabetes and OI in adults, with meta‐analysis of evaluable studies.
A literature search encompassing 358 abstracts from the last 75 years in PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane was performed. English‐language articles investigating adults with diabetes and OI in comparison to control groups with original data and ≥7 subjects were included. The Newcastle‐Ottawa scale was applied for quality assessment. Two investigators independently reviewed all articles. For meta‐analysis, the odds ratio of OI in diabetes compared with control groups was calculated using the fixed effects model.
The initial search yielded 358 abstracts, from which 21 articles were reviewed and 11 articles (n = 6,747) were included. Studies included were case‐control (64%) or cross‐sectional (36%) with evidence level 3b. On the Newcastle‐Ottawa scale, the mean quality assessment score for case‐control and cross‐sectional studies was 7.4 (maximum of 9) and 7.0 (maximum of 10), respectively. A statistically significant association between diabetes and olfaction compared with controls was found in 6 (55%) of the 11 articles. Four studies were eligible for meta‐analysis, which yielded an overall odds of having OI with diabetes as 1.58 times more likely than in control groups (95% CI [1.16, 2.16]; I 2 = 10.3%).
The reviewed studies support a significant association between diabetes and OI. Further studies are warranted to characterize this association.

154,PMC6721899,"Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) is one of the principal defects leading to polyuria-polydipsia syndrome (PPS). In the absence of other evident causes (drug interaction, electrolytic disorders or inherited disease), obstructive uropathy is the most likely aetiology. Direct arginine vasopressin (AVP) assessment during water deprivation test (WDT) remains the gold standard in PPS differential diagnosis despite well characterised limitations in this procedure. A new WDT method using copeptin as reliable surrogate of AVP is proposed. This case represents the first report of an NDI due to idiopathic urethral stricture in an adult and it would like to be explicative of the importance of a correct differential diagnosis of PPS and of the risk related to a prolonged WDT procedure in a frail patient. A 48-year-old male patient presenting with polyuria and polydipsia lasting one month was diagnosed with NDI. Copeptin values were clearly elevated both at baseline and after osmotic stimulus. WDT was complicated by development of acute kidney injury. Abdomen ultrasound demonstrated bilateral hydronephrosis, trabeculated bladder and a residual urine volume of 819 cc, in presence of normal kidney size and prostatic gland. A cysto-urethrography showed a sub-stenosis of 35 mm involving the membranous urethral tract. The patient underwent to balloon dilatation and urethrotomy with complete restitutio ad integrum. In our knowledge, this is the first report of idiopathic urethral stricture complicated by NDI in adult. PPS workup requires a global medical evaluation by an endocrinologist. In the suspicion of NDI, urinary tract obstruction should be considered. WDT remains a cornerstone in the differential diagnosis of PPS and the availability of biomarkers including copeptin may simplify the diagnostic process.",2019 Jul 4,Idiopathic Urethral Stricture and Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus: The Odd Couple,Cureus

156,PMC8308075,"Although the gut microbiota (GM) are associated with various diseases, their role in gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) remains uncharacterized. Further study is urgently needed to expose the real relationship between GM and GDM.
We performed a prospective study in 33 pregnant Chinese individuals [15, GDM; 18, normal glucose tolerance (NGT)] to observe the fecal microbiota by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing at 24–28 weeks of gestational age after a standard 75 g oral glucose tolerance test. Linear regression analysis was employed to assess the relationships between the GM and GDM clinical parameters.
Sequencing showed no difference in the microbiota alpha diversity but a significant difference in the beta diversity between the GDM and NGT groups, with the relative abundances of Ruminococcus bromii, Clostridium colinum, and Streptococcus infantis being higher in the GDM group (P < 0.05). The quantitative PCR results validated the putative bacterial markers of R. bromii and S. infantis. Moreover, a strong positive correlation was found between S. infantis and blood glucose levels after adjusting for body mass index (P < 0.05).
Three abnormally expressed intestinal bacteria (R. bromii, C. colinum, and S. infantis) were identified in GDM patients. S. infantis may confer an increased risk of GDM. Hence, the GM may serve as a potential therapeutic target for GDM.

157,PMC7841227,"Sphenoid sinus fungal ball (FB) is a noninvasive fungal infection affecting predominantly immunocompetent middle-aged female patients. Common clinical manifestations include headaches, postnasal drip, and nasal discharge. In this case report, we present a 56-year-old female with a 10-year history of occasional dizziness, vertigo, nystagmus, feeling disoriented and feeling her eyes moving rapidly. Complaints of restlessness, insomnia, anxiety, stress and anger were also present. Due to the nonspecific nature of her symptoms, a diagnosis of sphenoid sinus FB was overlooked. Definitive diagnosis was established after performing a nasal endoscopy and subsequent histopathological examination of the collected sinus tissues. The histopathology report disclosed Aspergillosis FB with chronic sinusitis. Due to the decade long delay in diagnosis and proper treatment, septal wall collapse occurred, with the patient developing diabetes insipidus with hyponatremia that led to a massive seizure and fall, resulting in multiple disc herniations. Surgical removal of the FA elicited a complete resolution of her symptoms and a full recovery.
Although fungal rhinosinusitis is a well recognized spectrum of diseases by ENT specialists, through this case report we hope to draw attention to this particular pathological entity within fungal infections, while simultaneously underlining the broad spectrum of symptoms with which it may manifest and the importance of including FA infections when considering the differential diagnosis in patients with long-standing chronic sinusitis.",2021 Jan 26,Unusual case presentation of fungal ball infection causing diabetes insipidus and seizure disorder,Radiology Case Reports

159,PMC5411739,"Wolfram syndrome (WS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by early-onset optic atrophy and diabetes mellitus, which can be associated with more extensive central nervous system and endocrine complications. The majority of patients harbour pathogenic WFS1 mutations, but recessive mutations in a second gene, CISD2, have been described in a small number of families with Wolfram syndrome type 2 (WFS2). The defining diagnostic criteria for WFS2 also consist of optic atrophy and diabetes mellitus, but unlike WFS1, this phenotypic subgroup has been associated with peptic ulcer disease and an increased bleeding tendency. Here, we report on a novel homozygous CISD2 mutation (c.215A > G; p.Asn72Ser) in a Moroccan patient with an overlapping phenotype suggesting that Wolfram syndrome type 1 and type 2 form a continuous clinical spectrum with genetic heterogeneity. The present study provides strong evidence that this particular CISD2 mutation disturbs cellular Ca2+ homeostasis with enhanced Ca2+ flux from the ER to mitochondria and cytosolic Ca2+ abnormalities in patient-derived fibroblasts. This Ca2+ dysregulation was associated with increased ER-mitochondria contact, a swollen ER lumen and a hyperfused mitochondrial network in the absence of overt ER stress. Although there was no marked alteration in mitochondrial bioenergetics under basal conditions, culture of patient-derived fibroblasts in glucose-free galactose medium revealed a respiratory chain defect in complexes I and II, and a trend towards decreased ATP levels. Our results provide important novel insight into the potential disease mechanisms underlying the neurodegenerative consequences of CISD2 mutations and the subsequent development of multisystemic disease.",2017 Mar 6,A novel CISD2 mutation associated with a classical Wolfram syndrome phenotype alters Ca2+ homeostasis and ER-mitochondria interactions,Human Molecular Genetics
160,PMC7351819,"We aimed to examine whether crude mortality and mortality relative to the general population below 50 years of age have improved in recent years in those with type 1 diabetes.
Individuals with type 1 diabetes aged below 50 and at least 1 year old at any time between 2004 and 2017 in Scotland were identified using the national register. Death data were obtained by linkage to Scottish national death registrations. Indirect age standardisation was used to calculate sex-specific standardised mortality ratios (SMRs). Poisson regression was used to test for calendar-time effects as incidence rate ratios (IRRs).
There were 1138 deaths in 251,143 person-years among 27,935 people with type 1 diabetes. There was a significant decline in mortality rate over time (IRR for calendar year 0.983 [95% CI 0.967, 0.998], p = 0.03), but the SMR remained approximately stable at 3.1 and 3.6 in men and 4.09 and 4.16 in women for 2004 and 2017, respectively. Diabetic ketoacidosis or coma (DKAoC) accounted for 22% of deaths and the rate did not decline significantly (IRR 0.975 [95% CI 0.94, 1.011], p = 0.168); 79.3% of DKAoC deaths occurred out of hospital. Circulatory diseases accounted for 27% of deaths and did decline significantly (IRR 0.946 [95% CI 0.914, 0.979], p = 0.002).
Absolute mortality has fallen, but the relative impact of type 1 diabetes on mortality below 50 years has not improved. There is scope to improve prevention of premature circulatory diseases and DKAoC and to develop more effective strategies for enabling people with type 1 diabetes to avoid clinically significant hyper- or hypoglycaemia.

Literature research was conducted in Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and ClinicalTrials.gov for studies published between the date of inception and June 2019. Randomized placebo-controlled trials conducted in type 1and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T1DM/T2DM) were included. Random-effects model and meta-regression analysis were accordingly used.

Significantly weight elevation (effect size (ES) = 0.33 kg, 95% CI, 0.03 to 0.61 kg) was observed in patients with placebo treatments in T1DM subgroup while significantly HbA1c reduction (ES = − 0.12%, 95% CI, − 0.16 to − 0.07%) and weight reduction (ES = − 0.40 kg, 95% CI, − 0.50 to − 0.29 kg) were observed in patients with placebo treatments in T2DM subgroup. Greater HbA1c reduction was observed in patients with injectable placebo treatments (ES = − 0.22%, 95% CI, − 0.32 to − 0.11%) versus oral types (ES = − 0.09%, 95% CI, − 0.14 to − 0.04%) in T2DM (P = 0.03). Older age (β = − 0.01, 95% CI, − 0.02 to − 0.01, P < 0.01) and longer diabetes duration (β = − 0.02, 95% CI, − 0.03 to − 0.21 × 10−2, P = 0.03) was significantly associated with more HbA1c reduction by placebo in T1DM. However, younger age (β = 0.02, 95% CI, 0.01 to 0.03, P = 0.01), lower male percentage (β = 0.01, 95% CI, 0.22 × 10−2, 0.01, P < 0.01), higher baseline BMI (β = − 0.02, 95% CI, − 0.04 to − 0.26 × 10−2, P = 0.02), and higher baseline HbA1c (β = − 0.09, 95% CI, − 0.16 to − 0.01, P = 0.02) were significantly associated with more HbA1c reduction by placebo in T2DM. Shorter diabetes duration (β = 0.06, 95% CI, 0.06 to 0.10, P < 0.01) was significantly associated with more weight reduction by placebo in T2DM.

162,PMC8354491,"Periodontal disease, a chronic inflammation induced by bacteria, is closely linked with diabetes mellitus. Many complications associated with diabetes are related to epigenetic changes. However, the exact epigenetic changes whereby diabetes affects periodontal disease remain largely unknown. Thus, we sought to investigate the role of diabetes‐dependent epigenetic changes of gingival tissue in the susceptibility to periodontal disease.
We studied the effect of streptozotocin‐induced diabetes in minipigs on gingival morphological and epigenetic tissue changes. Accordingly, we randomly divided six minipigs into two groups: streptozotocin‐induced diabetes group, n = 3; and non‐diabetes healthy control group, n = 3. After 85 days, all animals were killed, and gingival tissue was collected for histology, deoxyribonucleic acid methylation analysis and immunohistochemistry.
A diabetes mellitus model was successfully created, as evidenced by significantly increased blood glucose levels, reduction of pancreatic insulin‐producing β‐cells and histopathological changes in the kidneys. The gingival tissues in the diabetes group presented acanthosis of both gingival squamous epithelium and sulcular/junctional epithelium, and a significant reduction in the number and length of rete pegs. Deoxyribonucleic acid methylation analysis showed a total of 1,163 affected genes, of which 599 and 564 were significantly hypermethylated and hypomethylated, respectively. Immunohistochemistry staining showed that the hypomethylated genes – tumor necrosis factor‐α and interleukin‐6 – were positively expressed under the junctional epithelium area in the diabetes group.
Diabetes mellitus induces morphological and epigenetic changes in periodontal tissue, which might contribute to the increased susceptibility of periodontal diseases in patients with diabetes.

From January 2013 to August 2013, we carried out a cross‐sectional study involving 11,956 permanent residents aged ≥35 years from the general population in the Liaoning province of China (response rate 85.3%). Each participant completed a questionnaire, had a physical examination, and underwent an electrocardiogram and echocardiogram. AF was diagnosed on the basis of the electrocardiogram findings. Logistic regression analyses were carried out to estimate the associations between diabetes mellitus and AF. The associations were also analyzed in hypertensive and normotensive subgroups.
There was a higher prevalence of AF in participants with diabetes mellitus than those without diabetes mellitus (1.2 vs 0.5%; P = 0.004). In the hypertensive subgroup, the prevalence of AF in participants with diabetes mellitus was significantly higher than in participants without diabetes mellitus (1.5 vs 0.6%; P = 0.008); however, the prevalences were similar in the normotensive subgroup (0.3 vs 0.4%; P = 1.000). Similar trends were present in both men and women. After adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors, the independent association between diabetes mellitus and AF remained in the total sample (odds ratio 2.33, 95% confidence interval 1.20–4.54) and hypertensive subgroup (odds ratio 3.15, 95% confidence interval 1.52–6.56), but not in the normotensive subgroup (odds ratio 0.64, 95% confidence interval 0.08–5.31).

164,PMC7078094,"Pharmacological levels of glucagon‐like peptide‐1 (GLP‐1) can decelerate gastric emptying (GE) and reduce postprandial glucose levels. Most previous studies have used liquid meals to evaluate GE. We evaluated the effects of GLP‐1 receptor agonists (GLP‐1 RAs) on GE and postprandial glucose excursion in Japanese type 2 diabetes mellitus patients using a combination of solid and liquid meals.
In this single‐center, prospective, open‐label study, nine healthy individuals and 17 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus consumed a 460‐kcal combination of a solid and liquid meal labeled with 13C‐acetic acid. GE was measured from t = 0 to 150 min in a continuous 13C breath test. Eight participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus were administered GLP‐1 RAs, and we examined the relationship between GE and blood glucose excursion.
There were no differences in the average GE coefficient (GEC) and lag time between the healthy and type 2 diabetes mellitus groups. However, the type 2 diabetes mellitus group showed larger GEC variations (P < 0.05). The coefficient of variation of R‐R intervals was a significant predictor of GEC in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients (P < 0.01). The short‐acting GLP‐1 RA reduced the GEC at 1 month (P = 0.012), whereas the long‐acting GLP‐1 RA did not significantly change the GEC after treatment. A positive relationship was observed between postprandial glucose excursion from T 0 min to T 60 min and the GEC (r 2 = 0.75; P < 0.01).
The reduction in GE rate by the administration of GLP‐1 RAs can predict the improvement in postprandial glucose excursion in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients. 
The purpose of this research was to evaluate the effect of glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonists on gastric emptying and postprandial glucose excursion in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus using both liquid and solid meals.

Adjusted Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the association of diabetes mellitus with clinical outcomes. Among 5028 patients with HF and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF; EF <40%) and 1139 patients with HF and preserved EF (HFpEF; EF ≥50%), the prevalences of type 2 diabetes mellitus were 40.2% and 45.0%, respectively (P=0.003). In both HFrEF and HFpEF cohorts, diabetes mellitus (versus no diabetes mellitus) was associated with smaller indexed left ventricular diastolic volumes and higher mitral E/e′ ratio. There was a predominance of eccentric hypertrophy in HFrEF and concentric hypertrophy in HFpEF. Patients with diabetes mellitus had lower Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire scores in both HFpEF and HFrEF, with more prominent differences in HFpEF (P interaction<0.05). In both HFpEF and HFrEF, patients with diabetes mellitus had more HF rehospitalizations (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.05–1.54; P=0.014) and higher 1‐year rates of the composite of all‐cause mortality/HF hospitalization (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.05–1.41; P=0.011), with no differences between HF phenotypes (P interaction>0.05).
In HFpEF and HFrEF, type 2 diabetes mellitus is associated with smaller left ventricular volumes, higher mitral E/e′ ratio, poorer quality of life, and worse outcomes, with several differences noted between HF phenotypes.

A total of 11,103 people of either sex older than 60 years were enrolled from 17 districts of Shanghai. The EQ-5D-3L was used to assess the HRQoL of older people. The Wilcoxon rank sum test and t-test were used to compare the difference in HRQoL between people with or without diabetes. After univariate regression, multiple linear regression and ordinal logistic regression were conducted to evaluate the influence of diabetes mellitus and other confounding variables on the EQ VAS scores and on the five dimensions of the EQ-5D.
Twelve percent of all participants had diabetes mellitus, and the proportion was almost the same between men and women. The EQ VAS scores of people with diabetes mellitus were approximately 3.70 points lower than those of people without diabetes (95% CI = -4.40,  -2.99, p < 0.001) after adjusting for confounding variables. People with diabetes mellitus had increased problems with mobility (OR = 1.57, 95% CI = 1.33, 1.85), self-care (OR = 1.65, 95% CI = 1.35, 2.01), usual activities (OR = 1.78, 95% CI = 1.51, 2.11), pain/discomfort (OR = 1.42, 95% CI = 1.24, 1.64), and anxiety/depression (OR = 1.33, 95% CI = 1.07, 1.64).

Few studies have addressed the diagnostic performance of this test. The aim of this retrospective cohort study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the standard water deprivation test, including plasma arginine vasopressin (AVP) measurements, in 40 consecutive patients with polyuria. We compared initial test results with the final clinical diagnosis, i.e., no DI, central DI, or nephrogenic DI. The median length of follow-up was 8 years. In a subset of ten patients, the novel marker copeptin (CP) was measured in plasma. Using the final diagnosis as a gold standard, a threshold for urine osmolality of >800 mOsmol/kg after water deprivation yielded a sensitivity and specificity of 96 and 100%, respectively, for diagnosing PP. Sensitivity increased to 100% if the cut-off value for urine osmolality was set at 680 mOsmol/kg. Plasma AVP levels did not differ between patient groups and did not differentiate among central DI, nephrogenic DI, or PP. In all three patients with central DI, plasma CP was <2.5 pmol/l with plasma osmolality >290 mOsmol/kg, and >2.5 pmol/l in patients without DI. The optimal cut-off value for differentiating PP from DI during a water deprivation test was urine osmolality >680 mOsmol/kg.

168,PMC6439528,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is associated with several microvascular and macrovascular complications, such as retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, and cardiovascular diseases. The pathogenesis of these complications is complex, and involves metabolic and hemodynamic disturbances, including hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and immune dysfunction. These disturbances initiate several damaging processes, such as increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, inflammation, and ischemia. These processes mainly exert their damaging effect on endothelial and nerve cells, hence the susceptibility of densely vascularized and innervated sites, such as the eyes, kidneys, and nerves. Since the oral cavity is also highly vascularized and innervated, oral complications can be expected as well. The relationship between DM and oral diseases has received considerable attention in the past few decades. However, most studies only focus on periodontitis, and still approach DM from the limited perspective of elevated blood glucose levels only. In this review, we will assess other potential oral complications as well, including: dental caries, dry mouth, oral mucosal lesions, oral cancer, taste disturbances, temporomandibular disorders, burning mouth syndrome, apical periodontitis, and peri-implant diseases. Each oral complication will be briefly introduced, followed by an assessment of the literature studying epidemiological associations with DM. We will also elaborate on pathogenic mechanisms that might explain associations between DM and oral complications.

People with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (ICD code: E11) and heart failure (ICD code: I50) (N = 14 723) were older, more often women and presented with longer diabetes duration compared with those without heart failure. After adjustment for age, gender and diabetes duration, people with heart failure showed lower HbA1c, higher BMI and more intense insulin therapy. Analysis revealed that people with heart failure were more often treated with insulin, and more frequently received anti‐hypertensives and lipid‐lowering medication. They presented with lower systolic and diastolic BP. People with heart failure more frequently showed a history of comorbidities.
Heart failure is common in diabetes mellitus, but the prevalence in the DPV is lower frequent than expected. The reason for improved metabolic control in heart failure may be intensified therapy with insulin, lipid‐lowering medication and anti‐hypertensives in this cohort.
Heart failure is a common comorbidity of diabetes mellitus. Prevalence data from intervention studies do not represent real‐world data because the people in studies are often pre‐specified with relation to several underlying diseases. For Germany, data on heart failure prevalence among people with Type 2 diabetes mellitus from large representative cohorts are currently unavailable. Data on diabetes treatment and therapeutic regimens regarding other comorbidities in people with Type 2 diabetes and heart failure are rare.
The Prospective Diabetes Registry (DPV) delivers data from nearly 290 000 people with Type 2 diabetes in specialized diabetes care and thus represents real‐world data.
The DPV provides data on clinical situation, diabetes treatment and therapeutic regimens regarding other comorbidities in people with Type 2 diabetes and heart failure from all over Germany.
The DPV is commonly used to document the real‐world treatment of people with diabetes and either heart failure or other comorbidities. The DPV clearly shows insufficient treatment of dyslipidaemia in people with diabetes and heart failure.",2019 Feb 27,Heart failure among people with Type 2 diabetes mellitus: real‐world data of 289 954 people from a diabetes database,Diabetic Medicine
170,PMC4497633,"In August 2011, the World Health Organization and the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease launched the Collaborative Framework for Care and Control of Tuberculosis (TB) and diabetes mellitus (DM) to guide policy makers and implementers in combatting the epidemics of both diseases. Progress has been made, and includes identifying how best to undertake bidirectional screening for both diseases, how to provide optimal treatment and care for patients with dual disease and the most suitable framework for monitoring and evaluation. Key programmatic challenges include the following: whether screening should be directed at all patients or targeted at those with high-risk characteristics; the most suitable technologies for diagnosing TB and diabetes in routine settings; the best time to screen TB patients for DM; how to provide an integrated, coordinated approach to case management; and finally, how to persuade non-communicable disease programmes to adopt a cohort analysis approach, preferably using electronic medical records, for monitoring and evaluation. The link between DM and TB and the implementation of the collaborative framework for care and control have the potential to stimulate and strengthen the scale-up of non-communicable disease care and prevention programmes, which may help in reducing not only the global burden of DM but also the global burden of TB.",2015 Aug,Diabetes mellitus and tuberculosis: programmatic management issues,The International Journal of Tuberculosis and Lung Disease
171,PMC8804633,"Diabetes and related metabolic disorders such as obesity and cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are a growing global issue. Equipping individuals with the necessary ‘knowledge, skills and confidence to self-manage their health’ (ie, patient activation (PAct)) may lead to improvements in health outcomes. It is unclear whether existing evidence allows us to assume a causal relationship. We aim to synthesise and critically appraise evidence on the relationship between PAct and self-management behaviours and clinical outcomes of people living with diabetes and related metabolic disorders.
The protocol is based on guidance on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Protocols. We will search Medline, Embase, CENTRAL, PsycInfo, Web of Science and CINAHL using search terms related to PAct, diabetes, pre-diabetes, obesity and CVD. Any quantitative study design is eligible provided studies assess the association between PAct and clinical outcomes and/or self-management behaviours of diabetes and related metabolic disorders. Outcomes include behavioural (eg, diet) and clinical (eg, blood pressure) outcomes. Two reviewers will independently screen titles/abstracts and full texts and assess risk of bias using the revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomised trials or the Risk of Bias Assessment Tool for Nonrandomised Studies (RoBANS).
One reviewer will extract data, with independent checking by a second reviewer. We will critically assess the level of evidence available for assuming a causal association between PAct and outcomes. Data permitting, we will use the Hunter-Schmidt random-effects method to meta-analyse correlations across studies.
Ethical approval is not required. The review will be disseminated in the form of a peer-reviewed journal article, at conferences and other presentations. The findings of the review will be of interest to clinical commissioning groups, policymakers and intervention deliverers/developers.

172,PMC8101261,"The notion that in diabetes pancreatic β-cells express endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress markers indicative of increased unfolded protein response (UPR) signaling is no longer in doubt. However, what remains controversial is whether this increase in ER stress response actually contributes importantly to the β-cell failure of type 2 diabetes (akin to ‘terminal UPR’), or whether it represents a coping mechanism that represents the best attempt of β-cells to adapt to changes in metabolic demands as presented by disease progression. Here an intercontinental group of experts review evidence for the role of ER stress in monogenic and type 2 diabetes in an attempt to reconcile these disparate views. Current evidence implies that pancreatic β-cells require a regulated UPR for their development, function and survival, as well as to maintain cellular homeostasis in response to protein misfolding stress. Prolonged ER stress signaling, however, can be detrimental to β-cells, highlighting the importance of “optimal” UPR for ER homeostasis, β-cell function and survival.",2021 Apr 22,Pathological β-Cell Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress in Type 2 Diabetes: Current Evidence,Frontiers in Endocrinology
173,PMC6626957,"An elevated heart rate has been reported to be associated with an increased incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus. We investigated whether heart rate independently and interactively with body mass index or blood pressure was associated with the incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus in a rural Chinese population.
We measured the association between heart rate and type 2 diabetes mellitus in the Tongxiang China Kadoorie Biobank prospective cohort study using Cox proportional hazard models. Analyses included 53,817 participants without any history of diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular or rheumatic heart disease at baseline. Incident type 2 diabetes mellitus cases were identified through linkage with established Disease Registries and the China National Health Insurance System.
After a mean follow‐up period of 6.9 years, 1,766 people had developed type 2 diabetes mellitus with an incidence of 4.75 per 1,000 person‐years. Multivariable‐adjusted hazard ratios and for type 2 diabetes mellitus across increasing quintiles of heart rate were 1.00 (reference), 1.24 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05–1.45), 1.21 (95% CI 1.03–1.41), 1.24 (95% CI 1.05–1.47) and 1.49 (95% CI 1.28–1.74), respectively, with a P trend <0.001.

Early diagnosis of CNDI is important to avoid recurrent episodes of severe dehydration. We present a Danish male suffering from typical symptoms and diagnosed with CNDI at the age of 7 months. Gene sequencing of this proband and his mother revealed a novel variant in the gene encoding the antidiuretic hormone receptor (AVPR2). The variant is a deletion of nucleotide c.151 in exon 2 of AVPR2 (GenBank NM_000054.4:c.151del). This 1bp deletion is predicted to cause a frameshift that results in tryptophan replacing valine at position 51 in AVPR2 and a premature stop codon three codons downstream (p.Val51Trpfs*3) likely resulting in faulty expression of the receptor. Identification of disease-causing variants such as the one described here contributes to precise diagnosis, especially in carriers and newborns, thus preventing the long-term physical and intellectual disability observed in some CNDI-patients.",2020 Oct 14,Novel Variant of AVPR2 Giving Rise to X-Linked Congenital Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus in a 7-Month-Old Danish Boy,Case Reports in Nephrology and Dialysis

The electronic databases PubMed, Embase, and Wanfang Data were searched for eligible relevant studies up to May 2016, and the reference lists of the retrieved articles were used for additional manual search. All the articles included in this pooled analysis were determined according to the preset inclusion and exclusion criteria. Meta‐analysis of pooled data was performed using Review Manager 5.3.
A total of 15 studies were included for further combined analysis. The results showed that patients with type 1 diabetes had a significantly higher prevalence of hearing loss than controls (odds ratio = 49.08, 95% confidence interval = 12.03–200.31, P < 0.00001); standardized mean of differences (SMD) of pure tone audiometry at 4,000 Hz between diabetes and controls was 0.87 (Z = 2.22, P = 0.03, I2 = 95%); SMD of the latency time was 0.54 (Z = 2.69, P = 0.007, I2 = 78%) for waves III and 0.61 (Z = 2.38, P = 0.02, I2 = 86%) for wave V, respectively; and SMD of the interpeak latency time was 0.41 (Z = 2.84, P = 0.005, I2 = 39%) for waves I to III and 0.61 (Z = 2.67, P = 0.008, I2 = 81%) for waves I to V, respectively, between diabetics and controls.

Hypophysitis related to primary Sjögren syndrome (pSS) is uncommon. We describe the unusual case of a patient with infundibuloneurohypophysitis associated with pSS successfully treated with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF).
We describe a case of a 60-year-old man with a medical history of pSS presented with central diabetes insipidus and panhypopituitarism. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a thickening of the pituitary stalk and intense enhancement of the posterior pituitary, pituitary stalk, and hypothalamus. We diagnosed infundibuloneurohypophysitis associated with pSS. Hormonal replacement was started immediately and MMF was introduced without corticosteroids.
After 9 months of treatment, MRI of the pituitary revealed a complete regression of the nodular thickening of the pituitary stalk, with normal enhancement and appearance of the pituitary. The pituitary axes had completely recovered, whereas the diabetes insipidus was partially restored.
Our findings suggest that MMF is an effective alternative to corticosteroids for the treatment of lymphocytic hypophysitis associated with an autoimmune disease.

Individuals living with type 1 (N = 110) and type 2 (N = 100) diabetes were surveyed at the Diabetes Centre at University Hospital Galway (Ireland). A questionnaire was used to record respondent’s perceptions and concerns about living with diabetes and developing associated long-term health complications, especially diabetes-induced osteopathy. Participants’ responses revealed a variety of perspectives. Individuals with type 1 diabetes had a deeper understanding of the aetiology of diabetes and were more concerned about its complications than individuals with type 2 diabetes. The most recognized complications identified by the participants were retinopathy (92% type 1; 83% type 2), amputations (80% type 1; 70% type 2) and nephropathy (83% type 1; 63% type 2). Diabetes-related osteopathy was under-recognized, with 37% (type 1) and 23% (type 2) of respondents identifying bone fractures as a diabetes-related complication.

178,PMC6651977,"Wolfram syndrome (WS), a rare genetic disorder, is considered the best prototype of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) diseases. Classical WS features are childhood-onset diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy, deafness, diabetes insipidus, neurological signs, and other abnormalities. Two causative genes (WFS1 and WFS2) have been identified. The transmission of the disease takes place in an autosomal recessive mode but autosomal dominant mutations responsible for WS-related disorders have been described. Prognosis is poor, death occurs at the median age of 39 years with a major cause represented by respiratory failure as a consequence of brain stem atrophy and neurodegeneration. The aim of this narrative review is to focus on etiology, pathogenesis and natural history of WS for an adequate patient management and for the discussion of future therapeutic interventions.
WS requires a multidisciplinary approach in order to be successfully treated. A prompt diagnosis decreases morbidity and mortality through prevention and treatment of complications. Being a monogenic pathology, WS represents a perfect model to study the mechanisms of ER stress and how this condition leads to cell death, in comparison with other prevalent diseases in which multiple factors interact to produce the disease manifestations. WS is also an important disease prototype to identify drugs and molecules associated with ER homeostasis. Evidence indicates that specific metabolic diseases (type 1 and type 2 diabetes), neurodegenerative diseases, atherosclerosis, inflammatory pathologies and also cancer are closely related to ER dysfunction.
Therapeutic strategies in WS are based on drug repurposing (i.e., investigation of approved drugs for novel therapeutic indications) with the aim to stop the progression of the disease by reducing the endoplasmic reticulum stress. An extensive understanding of WS from pathophysiology to therapy is fundamental and more studies are necessary to better manage this devastating disease and guarantee the patients a better quality of life and longer life expectancy.",2019 Jul 23,"Wolfram syndrome, a rare neurodegenerative disease: from pathogenesis to future treatment perspectives",Journal of Translational Medicine

The files of 24 patients that underwent neurosurgery for sellar lesions, or tumor near the hypothalamus or pituitary gland at the Department of Neurosurgery, King Abdulaziz University Hospital, Jeddah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia were retrospectively reviewed between January 2011 to December 2014. A total of 24 patients were studied, and were divided into 2 groups namely; DI and non-DI. Patient characteristics were studied using descriptive statistics. The differences in proportion between the 2 groups were found out using Z-test for proportion in 2 populations. The mean differences in the hormonal abnormalities for the 2 groups were assessed using independent t-test. All statistics are considered statistically significant when p<0.05.
During hospitalization, 13 (54.2%) out of 24 patient that underwent neurosurgery had manifestations of DI, which was transient in 5 (38.8%) and permanent in 8 (61.2%). The DI subgroup contained higher prevalence of prolactinoma, craniopharyngioma, pre-operative panhypopituitarism, and macroadenoma in MRI imaging and transphenoidal surgery. Furthermore, urine osmolality was significantly lower in the DI group post-operatively with a significant p=0.023.

Our sample included 2668 adults in the Jackson Heart Study with complete baseline data on 6 of 7 American Heart Association CVH metrics (body mass index, healthy diet, smoking, total cholesterol, blood pressure, and physical activity). Incident diabetes mellitus was defined as fasting glucose ≥126 mg/dL, physician diagnosis, use of diabetes mellitus drugs, or glycosylated hemoglobin ≥6.5%. A summary CVH score from 0 to 6, based on presence/absence of ideal CVH metrics, was derived for each participant. Cox regression was used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios. Mean age was 55 years (65% women) with 492 incident diabetes mellitus events over 7.6 years (24.6 cases/1000 person‐years). Three quarters of participants had only 1 or 2 ideal CVH metrics; no participant had all 6. After adjustment for demographic factors (age, sex, education, and income) and high‐sensitivity C‐reactive protein, each additional ideal CVH metric was associated with a 17% diabetes mellitus risk reduction (hazard ratio, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.74–0.93).

182,PMC7664589,"Initial studies found increased severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), in patients with diabetes mellitus. Furthermore, COVID-19 might also predispose infected individuals to hyperglycaemia. Interacting with other risk factors, hyperglycaemia might modulate immune and inflammatory responses, thus predisposing patients to severe COVID-19 and possible lethal outcomes. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is part of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS), is the main entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2; although dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) might also act as a binding target. Preliminary data, however, do not suggest a notable effect of glucose-lowering DPP4 inhibitors on SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility. Owing to their pharmacological characteristics, sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors might cause adverse effects in patients with COVID-19 and so cannot be recommended. Currently, insulin should be the main approach to the control of acute glycaemia. Most available evidence does not distinguish between the major types of diabetes mellitus and is related to type 2 diabetes mellitus owing to its high prevalence. However, some limited evidence is now available on type 1 diabetes mellitus and COVID-19. Most of these conclusions are preliminary, and further investigation of the optimal management in patients with diabetes mellitus is warranted.
The pathophysiology of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) and diabetes mellitus are interlinked, and diabetes mellitus is associated with severe COVID-19 outcomes. This Review highlights new advances in diabetes mellitus and COVID-19, considering disease mechanisms and clinical management of patients with diabetes mellitus in the ongoing pandemic.
Underlying diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases are considered risk factors for increased coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease severity and worse outcomes, including higher mortality.
Potential pathogenetic links between COVID-19 and diabetes mellitus include effects on glucose homeostasis, inflammation, altered immune status and activation of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS).
During the COVID-19 pandemic, tight control of glucose levels and prevention of diabetes complications might be crucial in patients with diabetes mellitus to keep susceptibility low and to prevent severe courses of COVID-19.
Evidence suggests that insulin and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors can be used safely in patients with diabetes mellitus and COVID-19; metformin and sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors might need to be withdrawn in patients at high risk of severe disease.
Pharmacological agents under investigation for the treatment of COVID-19 can affect glucose metabolism, particularly in patients with diabetes mellitus; therefore, frequent blood glucose monitoring and personalized adjustment of medications are required.
As COVID-19 lacks definitive treatment so far, patients with diabetes mellitus should follow general preventive rules strictly and monitor glucose levels more frequently, engage in physical activity, eat healthily and control other risk factors.",2020 Nov 13,COVID-19 and diabetes mellitus: from pathophysiology to clinical management,Nature Reviews.

These risks however, are not well established in pituitary surgery.
We conducted a systematic review of associations between preoperative characteristics and postoperative complications of endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery according to the PRISMA guidelines. Risk of bias was assessed through the QUIPS tool.
In total 23 articles were included, containing 5491 patients (96% pituitary adenoma). There was a wide variety regarding the nature and number of risk factors, definitions, measurement and statistics employed, and overall quality of mainly retrospective studies was low. Consistent significant associations were older age for complications in general, and intraventricular extension for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks. Associations identified in some but not all studies were younger age, increased BMI, female gender, and learning curve for CSF leaks; increased tumor size for complications in general; and Rathke’s cleft cysts for diabetes insipidus. Mortality (incidence rate 1%) was not addressed as a risk factor.
Based on current literature, of low to medium quality, it is not possible to comprehensively quantify risk factors for complications. Nevertheless, older age and intraventricular extension were associated with increased postoperative complications. Future research should aim at prospective data collection, reporting of outcomes, and uniformity of definitions. Only then a proper risk analysis can be performed for endoscopic pituitary surgery.

The study included 33 sera of diabetes insipidus patients and 10 control sera obtained from 10 healthy persons. In all patients the secretion of pituitary hormones and thyroid autoantibodies was assessed. Human pituitaries were obtained during autopsy and homogenized in 0.01 mol/l pH 7.4 phosphate buffer. In addition, for the autoantibody evaluation, the electrophoretic method of separation in polyacrylamide gel and western blot were employed. Among the 33 subjects, in 23 patients the presence of autoantibodies against the pituitary was shown. Sera of 15 patients reacted with the pituitary microsomal fraction protein of 55 kDa.

Consecutive patients aged <65 years admitted to comprehensive stroke centers for acute ischemic stroke between 2003 and 2013 were identified from the Ontario Stroke Registry. Multinomial logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted odds ratio (OR [95% CI]) of in‐hospital mortality or direct discharge to long‐term or continuing care. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate the adjusted hazards ratio (aHR [95% CI]) of long‐term mortality, readmission for stroke/transient ischemic attack, admission to long‐term care, and incident dementia. Predefined sensitivity analyses examined stroke outcomes among young (aged 18–49 years) and midlife (aged 50–65 years) subgroups.

Urban residents (AOR: 2.181; 95% CI: 1.274, 3.733), primary education (AOR:2.286; 95% CI: 1.396, 3.745), without previous history of abortion (AOR: 0.097; 95% CI: 0.048, 0.196), with history of late gestational age in weeks (29-32) (AOR: 0.393; 95% CI: 0.213, 0.723), with no history of coffee drinking (AOR: 2.704; 95% CI: 1.044, 7.006), and adequate dietary diversity (AOR: 2.740; 95% CI: 1.585, 4.739) were significantly associated with gestational diabetes mellitus. 
 In Hadiya Zone public Hospitals, the prevalence of gestational diabetes mellitus among women attending antenatal treatment was higher compared to other studies conducted. The urban residents, primary schooling, no prior history of abortion, late gestational age, no history of coffee drinking, and sufficient dietary diversity were significantly linked with gestational diabetes mellitus. To enhance maternal and child health, reinforcing screening, treatment, and prevention strategies for gestational diabetes mellitus is essential.",2021 Apr 5,"Prevalence and Risk Factors of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus among Women Attending Antenatal Care in Hadiya Zone Public Hospitals, Southern Nation Nationality People Region",BioMed Research International
190,PMC8772767,"Almost 90% of congenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) cases are caused by mutations in the arginine vasopressin receptor 2 gene, which has X-linked recessive inheritance. Although NDI is commonly diagnosed in early infancy based on its characteristic findings, clinical diagnosis can be delayed when no other family members have been diagnosed with NDI because several findings of NDI are nonspecific.
A 3-month-old boy diagnosed with NDI presenting with osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS) was admitted for poor weight gain after birth and poor feeding during the week prior to admission.
On admission, the initial blood examination showed hypernatremia (158 mmol/L), and treatment with intravenous fluids over the next 2 days further elevated the serum sodium level (171 mmol/L). After admission, polyuria was recognized, and polyuria in his grandmother and mother since childhood without a diagnosis of NDI was found. Magnetic resonance imaging showed multifocal, symmetrical lesions, including the lateral pons, on diffusion- and T2-weighted imaging, which led to a diagnosis of ODS.
The infusion was stopped, and the patient was fed milk diluted 2-fold with water.
The serum sodium level gradually decreased to 148 mmol/L over the course of 1 week. Low-sodium milk was started at 4 months of age and maintained a serum sodium level of approximately 140 mmol/L, which was within the normal range. The developmental quotient was 94 at 4 years of age.
ODS is an encephalopathy resulting from extreme fluctuations in serum sodium concentration and plasma osmolality. ODS due to hypernatremia has been reported in several patients, although it usually occurs during rapid correction of hyponatremia. Consequences of the central nervous system are a critical complication of NDI that affects prognosis. These consequences can be avoided with treatment. Early blood examination or polyuria in the patient, mother, or another family member and hypernatremic dehydration with good urine output should lead to an early diagnosis and prevent central nervous system consequences.",2022 Jan 21,Congenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus presenting as osmotic demyelination syndrome in infancy: A case report,Medicine

We describe the case of a 56-year-old man with acute renal failure and tuberoinfundibular hypophysitis due to IgG4-RD. Steroid therapy lowered the serum IgG4 level and ameliorated renal dysfunction, bilateral hydronephrosis and retroperitoneal fibrosis. However, polyuria from post-obstructive diuresis and unmasked central diabetes insipidus ensued. The patient's polyuria continued despite the administration of a therapeutic dose of glucocorticoid; the patient's pituitary swelling and anterior pituitary dysfunction were partially ameliorated. The pituitary swelling recurred seven months later. In patients with IgG4-RD, the manifestation of polyuria after steroid therapy should prompt suspicion of post-obstructive diuresis and the unmasking of central diabetes insipidus.",2017 Jan 1,Overlap of Post-obstructive Diuresis and Unmasked Diabetes Insipidus in a Case of IgG4-related Retroperitoneal Fibrosis and Tuberoinfundibular Hypophysitis: A Case Report and Review of the Literature,Internal Medicine
192,PMC4890838,"Maternal diabetes mellitus is associated with an increased risk of offspring congenital heart defects (CHD); however, the causal mechanism is poorly understood. We further investigated this association in a Danish nationwide cohort.
In a national cohort study, we identified 2 025 727 persons born from 1978 to 2011; among them were 7296 (0.36%) persons exposed to maternal pregestational diabetes mellitus. Pregestational diabetes mellitus was identified by using the National Patient Register and individual-level information on all prescriptions filled in Danish pharmacies. Persons with CHD (n=16 325) were assigned to embryologically related cardiac phenotypes. The CHD prevalence in the offspring of mothers with pregestational diabetes mellitus was 318 per 10 000 live births (n=232) in comparison with a baseline risk of 80 per 10 000; the adjusted relative risk for CHD was 4.00 (95% confidence interval, 3.51–4.53). The association was not modified by year of birth, maternal age at diabetes onset, or diabetes duration, and CHD risks associated with type 1 (insulin-dependent) and type 2 (insulin-independent) diabetes mellitus did not differ significantly. Persons born to women with previous acute diabetes complications had a higher CHD risk than those exposed to maternal diabetes mellitus without complications (relative risk, 7.62; 95% confidence interval, 5.23–10.6, and relative risk, 3.49; 95% confidence interval, 2.91–4.13, respectively; P=0.0004). All specific CHD phenotypes were associated with maternal pregestational diabetes mellitus (relative risk range, 2.74–13.8).
The profoundly increased CHD risk conferred by maternal pregestational diabetes mellitus neither changed over time nor differed by diabetes subtype. The association with acute pregestational diabetes complications was particularly strong, suggesting a role for glucose in the causal pathway.",2016 Jun 6,Prepregnancy Diabetes and Offspring Risk of Congenital Heart Disease: A Nationwide Cohort Study,Circulation
193,PMC8634022,"This ambidirectional cohort study aimed to assess the performance of combining hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) to fasting plasma glucose (FPG) for estimation of progression rate to diabetes mellitus (DM) and to explore the risk factors of DM in patients with impaired fasting glucose (IFG).
Patients with IFG were eligible for this study. IFG was defined as FPG of 100–125 mg/dL. Progression rates to DM were estimated using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Risk factors of DM were explored by Cox regression analysis.
3011 patients were enrolled with median follow-up time of 8 years (range: 6 months–29 years). Progression rates to DM in patients with FPG 100–109 mg/dL and 110–125 mg/dL were 2.64 and 4.79 per 100 person-years. After adjusting covariables, compared with patients with FPG 100–109 mg/dL plus normal HbA1c (<5.7%), hazard ratios (95% CI) of patients with FPG 110–125 plus normal HbA1c, FBG 100–109 plus abnormal HbA1c (5.7%–6.49%), and FPG 110–125 plus abnormal HbA1c were 5.89 (2.37 to 14.63), 16.30 (8.59 to 30.92), and 33.84 (16.41 to 69.78), respectively. Body mass index ≥27.5 kg/m2, serum triglyceride level ≥150 mg/dL, family history of DM, and low level of high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol were independently associated with risk of DM in patients with IFG.
Patients with both IFG and abnormal HbA1c had higher risk of DM than patients with IFG alone. Therefore, performing HbA1c in combination with FPG helps to identify subgroups of people with IFG at highest risk of DM. These patients should have the highest priority in diabetes prevention programs, especially in countries with low and limited resources.",2021 Nov 29,Hemoglobin A1c in combination with fasting plasma glucose trumps fasting plasma glucose alone as predictive indicators for diabetes mellitus: an ambidirectional cohort study of Thai people with impaired fasting glucose,BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care
194,PMC4749865,"Arginine-vasopressin (AVP) stimulates the redistribution of water channels, aquaporin-2 (AQP2) from intracellular vesicles into the plasma membrane of renal collecting duct principal cells. By this AVP directs 10% of the water reabsorption from the 170 L of primary urine that the human kidneys produce each day. This review discusses molecular mechanisms underlying the AVP-induced redistribution of AQP2; in particular, it provides an overview over the proteins participating in the control of its localization. Defects preventing the insertion of AQP2 into the plasma membrane cause diabetes insipidus. The disease can be acquired or inherited, and is characterized by polyuria and polydipsia. Vice versa, up-regulation of the system causing a predominant localization of AQP2 in the plasma membrane leads to excessive water retention and hyponatremia as in the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), late stage heart failure or liver cirrhosis. This article briefly summarizes the currently available pharmacotherapies for the treatment of such water balance disorders, and discusses the value of newly identified mechanisms controlling AQP2 for developing novel pharmacological strategies. Innovative concepts for the therapy of water balance disorders are required as there is a medical need due to the lack of causal treatments.",2016 Feb 11,The Trafficking of the Water Channel Aquaporin-2 in Renal Principal Cells—a Potential Target for Pharmacological Intervention in Cardiovascular Diseases,Frontiers in Pharmacology

In this review, we explore past, present, and potential future advances in our understanding of the mechanisms that promote β-cell death in diabetes, with a focus on the primary literature. We first review discoveries of insulin insufficiency, β-cell loss, and β-cell death in human diabetes. We discuss findings in humans and mouse models of diabetes related to autoimmune-associated β-cell loss and the roles of autoreactive T cells, B cells, and the β cell itself in this process. We review discoveries of the molecular mechanisms that underlie β-cell death-inducing stimuli, including proinflammatory cytokines, islet amyloid formation, ER stress, oxidative stress, glucotoxicity, and lipotoxicity. Finally, we explore recent perspectives on β-cell death in diabetes, including: (1) the role of the β cell in its own demise, (2) methods and terminology for identifying diverse mechanisms of β-cell death, and (3) whether non-canonical forms of β-cell death, such as regulated necrosis, contribute to islet inflammation and β-cell loss in diabetes. We believe new perspectives on the mechanisms of β-cell death in diabetes will provide a better understanding of this pathological process and may lead to new therapeutic strategies to protect β cells in the setting of diabetes.",2021 Nov 22,"β-Cell Death in Diabetes: Past Discoveries, Present Understanding, and Potential Future Advances",Metabolites

The study included 138 patients with gestational diabetes mellitus and 152 healthy pregnant women. Venous blood was separated, and the DNA was extracted. The rs2975760 and rs3792267SNP polymorphisms of CAPN10 were detected using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The frequencies of different genotypes in patients with gestational diabetes mellitus and healthy pregnant women were determined, and the relationship between different SNP genotypes and the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus was analyzed.
There were no significant differences in the frequencies of the TT, CT and CC genotypes of rs2975760 and the frequencies of the GG, AG and AA genotypes of rs3792267 between the women with gestational diabetes and the controls. Expression of rs2975760 and rs3792267 were not associated with the risk of gestational diabetes in the dominant model, recessive model, and additive model. However, grade B and grade D diabetes in the CC and TC genotypes of rs2975760 were significantly different from those in the TT genotype (P<0.05). Grade B and grade D diabetes in the AA and AG genotypes of rs3792267 were significantly different compared with those in the GG genotype (P<0.05), and allele A was significantly increased compared with allele G (P<0.05).

197,PMC4073245,"Diabetes mellitus is one of the diseases considered to be the main constituents of the global non–communicable disease (NCD) pandemic. Despite the large impact that NCDs are predicted to have, particularly in developing countries, estimates of disease burden are sparse and inconsistent. This systematic review transparently estimates prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus in Southern Asia, its association with urbanization and provides insight into the policy challenges facing the region.
The databases Medline and PubMed were searched for population–based studies providing estimates of diabetes prevalence in the Southern Asia region. Studies using WHO diagnostic criteria of fasting plasma glucose (FPG) ≥7.0mmol/L and/or 2h–plasma glucose (2hPG) ≥11.1mmol/L were included. Data from eligible studies was extracted into bubble graphs, and trend lines were applied to UNPD figures to estimate age–specific prevalence in the regional population. Estimates specific to sex, area of residency, and diagnostic method were compared and trends analysed.
A total of 151 age–specific prevalence estimates were extracted from 39 studies. Diabetes prevalence was estimated to be 7.47% for 2005 and 7.60% for 2010. Prevalence was strongly associated with increased age, male gender and urban residency (P < 0.001).
Diabetes prevalence in Southern Asia is high and predicted to increase in the future as life expectancy rises and the region continues to urbanise. Countries in this region need to improve NCD surveillance and monitoring so policies can be informed with the best evidence. Programs for prevention need to be put in place, and health system capacity and access needs to be assessed and increased to deal with the predicted rise in NCD prevalence.",2014 Jun,Urbanization and prevalence of type 2 diabetes in Southern Asia: A systematic analysis,Journal of Global Health
198,PMC7042557,"Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder that majorly affects the endocrine gland, and it is symbolized by hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance owing to deficient insulin secretory responses and beta cell dysfunction. This ailment affects as many as 451 million people worldwide, and it is also one of the leading causes of death. In spite of the immense advances made in the development of orthodox antidiabetic drugs, these drugs are often considered not successful for the management and treatment of T2DM due to the myriad side effects associated with them. Thus, the exploration of medicinal herbs and natural products as therapeutic sources for the treatment of T2DM is promoted because they have little or no side effects. Bioactive molecules isolated from natural sources have been proven to lower blood glucose levels via regulating one or more of the following mechanisms: improvement of beta cell function, insulin resistance, glucose (re)absorption, and glucagon-like peptide-1 homeostasis. In recent times, the mechanisms of action of different bioactive molecules with antidiabetic properties and phytochemistry are gaining a lot of attention in the area of drug discovery.

199,PMC7503727,"Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), one of the most common metabolic disorders, is caused by a combination of two primary factors: defective insulin secretion by pancreatic β-cells and the inability of insulin-sensitive tissues to respond appropriately to insulin. Because insulin release and activity are essential processes for glucose homeostasis, the molecular mechanisms involved in the synthesis and release of insulin, as well as in its detection are tightly regulated. Defects in any of the mechanisms involved in these processes can lead to a metabolic imbalance responsible for the development of the disease. This review analyzes the key aspects of T2DM, as well as the molecular mechanisms and pathways implicated in insulin metabolism leading to T2DM and insulin resistance. For that purpose, we summarize the data gathered up until now, focusing especially on insulin synthesis, insulin release, insulin sensing and on the downstream effects on individual insulin-sensitive organs. The review also covers the pathological conditions perpetuating T2DM such as nutritional factors, physical activity, gut dysbiosis and metabolic memory. Additionally, because T2DM is associated with accelerated atherosclerosis development, we review here some of the molecular mechanisms that link T2DM and insulin resistance (IR) as well as cardiovascular risk as one of the most important complications in T2DM.",2020 Aug 30,Pathophysiology of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus,International Journal of Molecular Sciences
200,PMC5159460,"Central diabetes insipidus (CDI), characterized by polyuria and polydipsia, is caused by deficiency of arginine vasopressin (AVP), an antidiuretic hormone which acts on V2 receptors in kidney to promote reabsorption of free water. CDI is classified into three subtypes; idiopathic, secondary and familial. A previous study suggests that infundibulo-neurohypophysitis might be an underlying cause of idiopathic CDI. Among secondary CDI, the tumors in the central nervous system such as craniopharyngioma and germ cell tumors are the most frequent causes. Familial CDI is inherited mostly in an autosomal dominant mode, and the number of causal mutations in the AVP gene locus reported so far exceeds 80. CDI is treated with desmopressin, an analogue of vasopressin, and the tablet is preferred to the nasal form because it is easier to administer. It is also shown that the oral disintegrating tablet formula increases QOL and decreases the incidence of hyponatremia in CDI patients. In some CDI patients, the osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus do not function and patients do not sense thirst.

All deaths and diseases recorded in Brazil during this period were analyzed. Surveys of the general adult population using random sampling procedures evaluating self-reported physical activity in all life domains in Brazil were included. The total number and the age-standardized rates of deaths, and population-attributable fraction (PAF) for diabetes mellitus attributed to physical inactivity in the years 1990, 2006, and 2016 were estimated. Socioeconomic Development Index (SDI) was used as an indicator of socioeconomic status of Brazilian states.
In relation to mortality due to diabetes mellitus attributed to physical inactivity, 736 deaths were estimated in 1990, 1337 deaths were estimated in 2006, and 1897 in 2016, which represented, in 1990, an age-standardized mortality rate (per 100,000 inhabitants) of 1.2, 2.1 in 2006, and 1.1 in 2016. Approximately 3.0% (PAF) of deaths due to diabetes mellitus could be avoided if the Brazilian population were physically active. In 2006 and 2016, Brazilian states with worst socioeconomic indicators had higher age-standardized mortality rate by diabetes mellitus due to physical inactivity.

We examined the contribution of a diabetes polygenic score (PGS) to the onset of diabetes in the context of modifiable known risk factors for diabetes.
Our sample consisted of 15,190 respondents in the United States-based Health and Retirement Study, a longitudinal study with up to 22 years of follow-up. We performed multivariate Cox regression models stratified by race (non-Hispanic white and non-Hispanic black) with time-varying covariates.
We observed 4217 (27.76%) cases of incident diabetes over the survey period. The diabetes PGS was statistically significantly associated with diabetes onset for both non-Hispanic whites (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.38, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.30, 1.46) and non-Hispanic blacks (HR = 1.22, 95% CI = 1.06, 1.40) after adjusting for a range of known risk factors for diabetes, highlighting the critical role genetic endowment might play. Nevertheless, genetics do not downplay the role that modifiable characteristics could still play in diabetes management; even with the inclusion of the diabetes PGS, several behavioral and lifestyle characteristics remained significant for both race groups.

205,PMC5789627,"Gestational diabetes insipidus (GDI) is a rare endocrine complication during pregnancy that is associated with vasopressinase overproduction from the placenta. Although increased vasopressinase is associated with placental volume, the regulation of placental growth in the later stage of pregnancy is not well known.
A 16-year-old pregnant woman was urgently transferred to our hospital because of threatened premature labor when the Kumamoto earthquakes hit the area where she lived. During her hospitalization, she complained of gradually increasing symptoms of polyuria and polydipsia. The serum level of arginine vasopressin (AVP) was 1.7 pg/mL, which is inconsistent with central DI. The challenge of diagnostic treatment using oral 1-deamino-8-D-AVP (DDAVP) successfully controlled her urine and allowed for normal delivery. DDAVP tablets were not necessary to control her polyuria thereafter. Based on these observations, clinical diagnosis of GDI was confirmed. Pathophysiological analyses revealed that vasopressinase expression was more abundant in the GDI patient’s syncytiotrophoblast in placenta compared with that in a control subject. Serum vasopressinase was also observed during gestation and disappeared soon after delivery. Vasopressinase is reportedly identical to oxytocinase or insulin regulated aminopeptidase (IRAP), which is an abundant cargo protein associated with the glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) storage vesicle. Interestingly, the expression and subcellular localization of GLUT4 appeared to occur in a vasopressinase (IRAP)-dependent manner.
Because placental volume may be associated with vasopressinase overproduction in GDI, vasopressinase (IRAP)/GLUT4 association appears to contribute to the growth of placenta in this case.",2018 Jan 30,The clinical course and pathophysiological investigation of adolescent gestational diabetes insipidus: a case report,BMC Endocrine Disorders

A total of 1186 eyes (593 individuals), 956 type 1 DM eyes (478 patients), and 230 control eyes (115 healthy volunteers) were included in this study. DR stage was graded according to the International Classification. OCTA imaging was performed with a commercially available device (Cirrus HD-OCT). Vessel density (VD), perfusion density (PD), and foveal avascular zone (FAZ) area, perimeter and circularity measurements were quantified in the SCP and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed for each OCTA parameter.
VD and PD (in both 3 × 3 and 6 × 6 mm captures) were inversely associated with DR stage (P < 0.001 in all cases) in a multiple regression analysis after controlling by age, gender, signal strength index, axial length, and DM duration. Greater FAZ area and perimeter and conversely lower circularity measurements were observed as DR severity increased in both scanning protocols (P < 0.05 in all cases).
In type 1 DM individuals, OCTA provides an objective, continuous, and reliable method for accurate quantification of VD, PD, and FAZ parameters in the SCP, which ultimately correlate with DR stages.

209,PMC6264623,"The 20–70% participation of diabetes patients in lifestyle interventions (LSI) worldwide seems to be rather sub-optimal, in spite of all intents of such interventions to delay further progress of the disease. Positive effects through LSI are expected in particular for patients who suffer less from diabetes-related limitations or other chronic diseases. Seeing that diabetes prevalence and with it mortality are increasing, LSI have become an inherent part of diabetes treatment standards. Various qualitative studies have been carried out to identify participation barriers for LSI. However, these have not resulted in more detailed knowledge about the relative importance of factors with an inhibiting impact on participation. Since it cannot be assumed that all of the influencing factors have equivalent values, it is necessary to investigate their individual importance with regard to a positive or negative decision about participating. There are no systematic reviews on patient preferences for LSI programs in diabetes prevention. As a result, the main objectives of this systematic review are to (i) identify existing patient preference elicitation studies related to LSI for diabetic patients, (ii) summarize the methods applied and findings, and (iii) appraise the reporting and methodological quality of such studies.
We will perform systematic literature searches to identify suitable studies from 14 electronic databases. Retrieved study records will be included based on predefined eligibility criteria as defined in this protocol. We will run abstract and full-text screenings and then extract data from all selected studies by filling in a predefined data extraction spreadsheet. We will undertake a descriptive, narrative synthesis of findings to address the study objectives, since no pooling for quantified preferences is for methodological reasons implementable. We will pay special attention to aspects of methodological quality of preference elicitation by applying established evaluation criteria of the ISPOR and some own developed criteria for different elicitation techniques. All critical stages within the screening, data extraction, and synthesis processes will be conducted by two pairs of authors. This protocol adheres to PRISMA and PRISMA-P standards.
The proposed systematic review will provide an overview of the methods used and current practice in the elicitation and quantification of patients’ preferences for diabetes prevention lifestyle interventions. Furthermore, the methodological quality of the identified studies will be appraised as well.

210,PMC8082012,"Background: The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) showed that lifestyle change or metformin is equally efficacious in preventing diabetes in women who have had gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Few studies have investigated the relationship between education and willingness to engage in either intervention and between education and preferred decision-making style.
Methods: Within a large health system, we surveyed insured women 18–64 years old with a history of GDM, identified through the electronic health record. We estimated preference for decision-making style and interest in DPP lifestyle change and/or metformin by educational level, using multivariate logistic regression models controlling for age, race, and ethnicity.
Results: Our sample (n = 264) was 36% Latino, 29% Asian, 28% non-Latino white, and 5% African American, with a mean age of 37 years. In terms of education, 31% had a postgraduate degree, 41% were college graduates, and 29% did not graduate from college. In multivariate analyses, willingness to engage in either intervention did not vary by education. Women who did not graduate from college were more likely to leave medical decisions to their provider (p = 0.004) compared to women with a college or postgraduate degree. However, regardless of education, over 80% of women preferred to make medical decisions themselves or jointly with their provider.
Conclusions: Most women prefer to play an active role in their own medical decisions and have an interest in both evidence-based diabetes prevention strategies. This suggests that shared decision-making is appropriate for many women with a history of GDM and different levels of educational attainment.",2021 Apr 27,"Educational Attainment, Decision-Making Preferences, and Interest in Evidence-Based Diabetes Prevention among Women with a History of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus",Women's Health Reports

Diabetes insipidus (DI) is a clinical syndrome characterized by polyuria and polydipsia that result from a deficiency of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), central DI, or resistance to ADH, nephrogenic DI. In otherwise healthy patients with DI, normal thirst mechanism, and free access to water, the thirst system can maintain plasma osmolality in the near-normal range. However, in cases where DI presents with adipsia, cognitive impairment, or restricted access to water, true hypernatremia may occur, leading to severe morbidity and mortality.
We report a case of a 2-year-old boy who had global developmental delay and post-brain debulking surgery involving the hypothalamic region, which resulted in central DI and thirst center dysfunction. We describe the clinical presentation, the current understanding of adipsic DI, and a new practical approach for management. The main guidelines of treatment include (1) fixed desmopressin dosing that allows minimal urinary breakthroughs in-between the doses; (2) timely diaper weight-based replacement of water; (3) bodyweight-based fluid correction 2 times a day, and (4) providing the nutritional and water requirements in a way similar to any healthy child but at fixed time intervals.
This plan of management showed good effectiveness in controlling plasma sodium level and volume status of a child with adipsic DI without interfering with his average growth.

212,PMC1189073,"Congenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) is a disease characterized by failure of the kidney to concentrate urine in response to vasopressin. Human kindreds with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus have been found to harbor mutations in the vasopressin receptor 2 (Avpr2) gene or the vasopressin-sensitive water channel aquaporin-2 (Aqp2) gene. Development of a treatment is rendered difficult due to the lack of a viable animal model. Through forward genetic screening of ethylnitrosourea-mutagenized mice, we report the identification and characterization of a mouse model of NDI, with an F204V mutation in the Aqp2 gene. Unlike previously attempted murine models of NDI, our mice survive to adulthood and more exactly recapitulate the human disorder. Previous in vitro experiments using renal cell lines suggest recessive Aqp2 mutations result in improper trafficking of the mutant water pore. Using these animals, we have directly proven this hypothesis of improper AQP2 translocation as the molecular defect in nephrogenic diabetes insipidus in the intact organism. Additionally, using a renal cell line we show that the mutated protein, AQP2-F204V, is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and that this abnormal localization can be rescued by wild-type protein. This novel mouse model allows for further mechanistic studies as well as testing of pharmacological and gene therapies for NDI.
Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) is a disease marked by excessive urination and thirst. Normally, the hypothalamus senses situations where water is limited and signals to the kidney to increase water reabsorption from urine. The signaling molecule secreted by the hypothalamus is arginine vasopressin (AVP), which binds to a specific protein on the surface of kidney cells, AVP receptor (AVPR2). AVP binding to its receptor on kidney cells begins a series of biochemical events that ultimately results in the insertion of a protein, aquaporin 2 (AQP2), into the outer surface of the kidney cell. As its name suggests, AQP2 facilitates the reuptake of water from the urinary space into the cell, thus concentrating the urine and conserving water. Congenital NDI is caused by mutations in either the water channel, AQP2, or in the receptor, AVPR2. While these mutations have been studied extensively in the lab, work in live animals has been very limited. This report describes the first viable mouse model of NDI. Previous models have been attempted by targeted mutation, i.e., genes known to be involved in the disease have been altered in the mouse, a so-called reverse genetic approach. Reverse genetic approaches have so far failed to produce a viable mouse model of NDI. Here the authors take a forward genetic approach in which genes are mutated at random and animals are screened for disease-like properties. As well as proving hypotheses that come from lab studies, this model opens the door to the testing of gene therapy or other therapies for treatment of NDI.",2005 Aug 19,Diabetes Insipidus in Mice with a Mutation in Aquaporin-2 ,PLoS Genetics
213,PMC6400165,"Many studies have reported that socioeconomically disadvantaged people or people who live in deprived areas are more vulnerable to diabetes complications. However, few such studies were carried out in China. The present study examined the spatial association between the incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus and neighborhood deprivation in Zhejiang, China, from a spatial epidemiology perspective.
Type 2 diabetes mellitus data (2012–2016) in the present study were derived from a population‐based diabetes registry system maintained by Zhejiang Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Principal components analysis was used to combine different socioeconomic variables together into a composited Neighborhood Deprivation Index. We applied the global Moran's I and Anselin's local Moran's I statistics to explore the spatial patterns of type 2 diabetes mellitus incidence and Neighborhood Deprivation Index.
Type 2 diabetes mellitus incidence (Moran's I: 0.531, P < 0.001) and Neighborhood Deprivation Index (Moran's I: 0.772, P < 0.001) showed positive statistically significant global Moran's I index values, showing a tendency towards clustering. The local Moran's I analyses showed that type 2 diabetes mellitus incidence hot spots were mainly located in urban centers, and type 2 diabetes mellitus incidence cold spots appeared in the provincial capital area (Hangzhou city) and western and south‐western regions of Zhejiang; the hot spots of the less deprived areas were concentrated in urban centers (except Lishui city), and the cold spots of the most deprived areas were clustered in western and south‐western regions of Zhejiang.
The study showed that the incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus was higher in affluent areas than the deprived areas across the study period.

214,PMC7477517,"The Japanese government started a nationwide screening program for metabolic syndrome (MetS) to prevent cardiovascular diseases and diabetes in 2008. Although impaired fasting glucose (IFG) is a strong predictor for type 2 diabetes mellitus, the program does not follow up IFG in non‐MetS individuals. This study aimed to examine the risk and the population attributable fraction (PAF) of MetS and IFG for incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Japanese workers (3,417 men and 714 women) aged 40–64 years without a history of diabetes were prospectively followed. MetS was defined as either abdominal obesity plus two or more metabolic risk factors, or being overweight in the case of normal waist circumference plus three or more metabolic risk factors. IFG was defined as fasting blood glucose 100–125 mg/dL.
During a mean 6.3 years, 240 type 2 diabetes mellitus cases were identified. Compared with those without MetS and IFG, the multivariable‐adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence interval) of non‐MetS individuals with IFG, MetS individuals without IFG and MetS individuals with IFG for type 2 diabetes mellitus were 4.9 (3.4–7.1), 2.4 (1.6–3.5) and 8.3 (5.9–11.5), respectively. The corresponding PAFs for type 2 diabetes mellitus incidence were 15.6, 9.1 and 29.7%, respectively.
IFG represented a higher risk and PAF than MetS for type 2 diabetes mellitus incidence in middle‐aged Japanese individuals. The coexistence of MetS and IFG showed the highest risk and PAF for type 2 diabetes mellitus incidence. The current Japanese MetS screening program should be reconsidered to follow up non‐MetS individuals with IFG.

216,PMC3920918,"The WFS1 gene, encoding a transmembrane glycoprotein of the endoplasmic reticulum called wolframin, is mutated in Wolfram syndrome, an autosomal recessive disorder defined by the association of diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy, and further organ abnormalities. Disruption of the WFS1 gene in mice causes progressive β-cell loss in the pancreas and impaired stimulus-secretion coupling in insulin secretion. However, little is known about the physiological functions of this protein. We investigated the immunohistochemical expression of wolframin in human placenta throughout pregnancy in normal women and diabetic pregnant women. In normal placenta, there was a modulation of wolframin throughout pregnancy with a strong level of expression during the first trimester and a moderate level in the third trimester of gestation. In diabetic women, wolframin expression was strongly reduced in the third trimester of gestation. The pattern of expression of wolframin in normal placenta suggests that this protein may be required to sustain normal rates of cytotrophoblast cell proliferation during the first trimester of gestation. The decrease in wolframin expression in diabetic placenta suggests that this protein may participate in maintaining the physiologic glucose homeostasis in this organ.",2014 Jan 23,Modulation of Wolframin Expression in Human Placenta during Pregnancy: Comparison among Physiological and Pathological States,BioMed Research International

However, limited data is available from sub-Sahara African communities to assess and monitor the disease burden. The study aimed to determine the prevalence and associated factors of diabetes in Hosanna, Ethiopia.
A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 634 randomly selected adults in Hosanna. The study participants were recruited by multi-stage stratified sampling. A face-to-face interview using a structured questionnaire was administered by trained nurses. Anthropometry, blood pressure and fasting blood glucose levels were measured. Diabetes mellitus was considered when the fasting blood glucose level was ≥126 mg/dl on two separate measurements or when the participant self-reported a previous diagnosis of diabetes by healthcare providers or when the participant was currently receiving treatment for diabetes. Multi-variable binary logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with diabetes mellitus.
The overall prevalence of diabetes was found to be 5.7% (95% CI; 4.0–7.7), out of which more than one third (36%) were not aware of it prior to the survey. Nearly two thirds (61.1%) of the diabetic participants were also found to be hypertensive. In the multi-variable analysis, diabetes was associated with current alcohol use, sitting on average of more than 8 hours/day, abnormal BMI and being hypertensive.
The prevalence of diabetes among the adult population in the town is alarming. If appropriate measures to address the burden are not emplaced, it might result in serious complications to the patients and unnecessarily high costs to the health system of the country.

218,PMC8369721,"Wolfram syndrome (WFS) is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disease whose main cause is mutations in the WFS1 and CISD2 genes. Its characteristic clinical manifestations are diabetes insipidus, diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy and deafness.
In this study, two patients from this particular family underwent complete routine biochemical and ophthalmic tests. Blood, urine, routine stool test, visual acuity (VA) examination, visual field assessment, funduscope, optical coherence tomography and periorbital magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were performed for each patient to evaluate whether the nerve fiber layer around the optic nerve head was atrophied and next-generation sequencing of target genes was performed in two patients.
When the patients were diagnosed with Wolfram syndrome, their genetic analyses suggested unique three-site compound heterozygous mutations (c.2314C > T + c.2194C > T + c.2171C > T) in exon 8 of both patients’ chromosome 4. One mutation (c.2314C > T) was a novel mutation in the known reports of Wolfram syndrome. As a degenerative genetic disease, the types of gene mutations in the Chinese population are generally homozygous mutations at the unit point or compound heterozygous mutations at two nucleotide change sites. However, the two patients reported in this study are the first known cases of compound heterozygous mutations with three mutation sites coexisting on the WFS1 gene in China or even globally.

219,PMC7576644,"Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) belong to a new group of anticancer drugs targeting T-cell proteins involved in the activation of immune response toward malignancies. Their introduction into clinical practice was a milestone in modern cancer treatment. However, the significant advantage of ICIs over conventional chemotherapy in terms of therapeutic efficacy is accompanied by new challenges related to specific side effects. ICI-induced immune system activation could lead to the loss of self-tolerance, presenting as autoimmune inflammation and dysfunction of various tissues and organs. Thus, the typical side effects of ICIs include immune-related adverse events (irAEs), among which endocrine irAEs, affecting numerous endocrine glands, have been commonly recognized. This review aimed to outline the current knowledge regarding ICI-induced endocrine disorders from a clinical perspective.

Practical guidelines for monitoring, diagnosis, and treatment of ICI-related endocrine toxicities are also offered. Rising awareness of endocrine irAEs among oncologists, endocrinologists, and other health professionals caring for patients receiving ICIs could contribute to better safety and efficacy.

220,PMC8740476,"The alarming rise in the worldwide prevalence of obesity and associated type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have reached epidemic portions. Diabetes in its many forms and T2DM have different physiological backgrounds and are difficult to classify. Bariatric surgery (BS) is considered the most effective treatment for obesity in terms of weight loss and comorbidity resolution, improves diabetes, and has been proven superior to medical management for the treatment of diabetes. The term metabolic surgery (MS) describes bariatric surgical procedures used primarily to treat T2DM and related metabolic conditions. MS is the most effective means of obtaining substantial and durable weight loss in individuals with obesity. Originally, BS was used as an alternative weight-loss therapy for patients with severe obesity, but clinical data revealed its metabolic benefits in patients with T2DM. MS is more effective than lifestyle or medical management in achieving glycaemic control, sustained weight loss, and reducing diabetes comorbidities. New guidelines for T2DM expand the use of MS to patients with a lower body mass index.
Evidence has shown that endocrine changes resulting from BS translate into metabolic benefits that improve the comorbid conditions associated with obesity, such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, and T2DM. Other changes include bacterial flora rearrangement, bile acids secretion, and adipose tissue effect.

221,PMC5333130,"NF-E2-related factor-2 (Nrf2) regulates cellular responses to oxidative and electrophilic stress. Loss of Keap1 increases Nrf2 protein levels, and Keap1-null mice die of oesophageal hyperkeratosis because of Nrf2 hyperactivation. Here we show that deletion of oesophageal Nrf2 in Keap1-null mice allows survival until adulthood, but the animals develop polyuria with low osmolality and bilateral hydronephrosis. This phenotype is caused by defects in water reabsorption that are the result of reduced aquaporin 2 levels in the kidney. Renal tubular deletion of Keap1 promotes nephrogenic diabetes insipidus features, confirming that Nrf2 activation in developing tubular cells causes a water reabsorption defect. These findings suggest that Nrf2 activity should be tightly controlled during development in order to maintain renal homeostasis. In addition, tissue-specific ablation of Nrf2 in Keap1-null mice might create useful animal models to uncover novel physiological functions of Nrf2.

For fine-mapping, we sequenced WFS1 exons, splice junctions, and conserved noncoding sequences in samples from 24 type 2 diabetic case and 68 control subjects, selected tagging SNPs, and genotyped these in 959 U.K. type 2 diabetic case and 1,386 control subjects. The same genomic regions were sequenced in samples from 1,235 type 2 diabetic case and 1,668 control subjects to compare the frequency of rarer variants between case and control subjects.
Of 31 tagging SNPs, the strongest associated was the previously untested 3′ untranslated region rs1046320 (P = 0.008); odds ratio 0.84 and P = 6.59 × 10−7 on further replication in 3,753 case and 4,198 control subjects. High correlation between rs1046320 and the original strongest SNP (rs10010131) (r2 = 0.92) meant that we could not differentiate between their effects in our samples. There was no difference in the cumulative frequency of 82 rare (minor allele frequency [MAF] <0.01) nonsynonymous variants between type 2 diabetic case and control subjects (P = 0.79). Two intermediate frequency (MAF 0.01–0.05) nonsynonymous changes also showed no statistical association with type 2 diabetes.
We identified six highly correlated SNPs that show strong and comparable associations with risk of type 2 diabetes, but further refinement of these associations will require large sample sizes (>100,000) or studies in ethnically diverse populations.

To evaluate the role of vildagliptin in the management of type 2 diabetes.
Clear evidence shows that vildagliptin improves glycemic control (measured by glycosylated hemoglobin and blood glucose levels) more than placebo in adults with type 2 diabetes, either as monotherapy or in combination with metformin. Vildagliptin is as effective as pioglitazone and rosiglitazone, and slightly less effective than metformin, although better tolerated. Further glycemic control is achieved when adding vildagliptin to metformin, pioglitazone, or glimepride. There is evidence that vildagliptin improves beta-cell function and insulin sensitivity. Vildagliptin does not appear to be associated with weight gain or with a higher risk of hypoglycemia than placebo or other commonly used oral antidiabetic agents. Economic evidence is currently lacking.
Vildagliptin improves glycemic control with little if any weight gain or hypoglycemia in adult patients with type 2 diabetes when given alone or in combination with metformin, thiazolidinediones, or sulfonylureas.

Compared with women without GDM, women with GDM are twice as likely to develop perinatal or postpartum depression. Lifestyle interventions for GDM are generally limited to physical activity and/or nutrition, often focus separately on the mother or the child and take place either during or after pregnancy, while their results are inconsistent. To increase efficacy of intervention, the multifactorial origins of GDM and the tight link between mental and metabolic as well as maternal and child health need to be heeded. This calls for an interdisciplinary transgenerational approach starting in, but continuing beyond pregnancy.
This randomised controlled trial will assess the effect of a multidimensional interdisciplinary lifestyle and psychosocial intervention aimed at improving the metabolic and mental health of 200 women with GDM and their offspring.

225,PMC4090211,"Lithium, an effective antipsychotic, induces nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) in ∼40% of patients. The decreased capacity to concentrate urine is likely due to lithium acutely disrupting the cAMP pathway and chronically reducing urea transporter (UT-A1) and water channel (AQP2) expression in the inner medulla. Targeting an alternative signaling pathway, such as PKC-mediated signaling, may be an effective method of treating lithium-induced polyuria. PKC-alpha null mice (PKCα KO) and strain-matched wild type (WT) controls were treated with lithium for 0, 3 or 5 days. WT mice had increased urine output and lowered urine osmolality after 3 and 5 days of treatment whereas PKCα KO mice had no change in urine output or concentration. Western blot analysis revealed that AQP2 expression in medullary tissues was lowered after 3 and 5 days in WT mice; however, AQP2 was unchanged in PKCα KO. Similar results were observed with UT-A1 expression. Animals were also treated with lithium for 6 weeks. Lithium-treated WT mice had 19-fold increased urine output whereas treated PKCα KO animals had a 4-fold increase in output. AQP2 and UT-A1 expression was lowered in 6 week lithium-treated WT animals whereas in treated PKCα KO mice, AQP2 was only reduced by 2-fold and UT-A1 expression was unaffected. Urinary sodium, potassium and calcium were elevated in lithium-fed WT but not in lithium-fed PKCα KO mice. Our data show that ablation of PKCα preserves AQP2 and UT-A1 protein expression and localization in lithium-induced NDI, and prevents the development of the severe polyuria associated with lithium therapy.",2014 Jul 9,Absence of PKC-Alpha Attenuates Lithium-Induced Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus,PLoS ONE

A mixed-method approach combining quantitative and qualitative methods was used. Information needs for different topics and estimated associated factors were described using logistic regression models. Additionally, a qualitative content analysis was performed.
Monocentre study.
Information needs were assessed and analysed in 138 consecutive participants with DM who took part in the German Diabetes Study (54% type 2 diabetes, 64% male, mean age 46.3±12.3 years, known diabetes duration <1 year).
Most participants displayed a need for information in all topics provided, especially in diabetes research (86%) and treatment/therapy (80%). Regarding those topics, participants wished for information regarding new treatments that simplify their everyday life. In general, participants preferred topics that focus on the management or handling of DM over topics related to clinical factors of DM, such as causes and complications. A low current level of information and treatment with antihyperglycaemic medication were significantly associated with higher information needs, and diabetes-related comorbidity and higher mental component summary score in the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) with lower information needs.
People with recently diagnosed DM display high information needs, which differ according to the current level of information, mode of diabetes treatment, diabetes-related comorbidity and mental component summary score in the SF-36. There appears to be a preference for information, which can help to simplify life with diabetes and for information that corresponds to their level of knowledge.

This disease is characterized by polyuria and compensatory polydypsia. The diverse underlying causes of DI can be central defects, in which no functional arginine vasopressin (AVP) is released from the pituitary or can be a result of defects in the kidney (nephrogenic DI, NDI). NDI is a disorder in which patients are unable to concentrate their urine despite the presence of AVP. This antidiuretic hormone regulates the process of water reabsorption from the prourine that is formed in the kidney. It binds to its type-2 receptor (V2R) in the kidney induces a cAMP-driven cascade, which leads to the insertion of aquaporin-2 water channels into the apical membrane. Mutations in the genes of V2R and aquaporin-2 often lead to NDI. We investigated a structure model of V2R in its bound and unbound state regarding protein stability using a novel protein energy profile approach. Furthermore, these techniques were applied to the wild-type and selected mutations of aquaporin-2.

Some reports of irreversible chronic kidney disease and renal failure were difficult to attribute to lithium treatment since chronic kidney disease and renal failure exist in the population at large. In recent years, large-scale epidemiological studies have convincingly shown that lithium treatment elevates the risk of chronic kidney disease and renal failure. Most patients do not experience renal side effects. The most common side effect of polyuria only weakly predicts increasing creatinine or reduced kidney function. Among those patients who do experience decrease in creatinine clearance, some may require continuation of lithium treatment even as their creatinine increases. Other patients may be able to switch to a different mood stabilizer medication, but kidney function may continue to deteriorate even after lithium cessation. Most, but not all, evidence today recommends using a lower lithium plasma level target for long-term maintenance and thereby reducing risks of severe nephrotoxicity.",2015 Jun 5,Lithium nephrotoxicity,International Journal of Bipolar Disorders
229,PMC6998152,"Over the past few decades, the prevalence of Diabetes Mellitus (DM) has risen rapidly in Iran and other low and middle-income countries. We investigated the prevalence of DM, pre-diabetes, undiagnosed and uncontrolled diabetes and its relationship with some associated socioeconomic factors in the Yazd Greater Area in Iran.
Yazd Health Study is a longitudinal study conducted to determine the prevalence of non-communicable disease and related risk factors. In a two-step cluster sampling, 10,000 adults aged 20–69 years (200 clusters) were selected. In the recruitment phase, DM was considered if the patients had been either diagnosed DM by a physician or had fasting blood glucose ≥ 126 mg/dL. Chi square test was used for categorical variables to evaluate the differences and logistic regression model was applied to determine the predictors of diabetes.. P-value < 0.05 considered statistically significant.
Of the 9965 individuals recruited, the crude self-reported prevalence of DM was 14.1% (95% CI: 13.4–14.7). The prevalence was higher in women than men (15.6 vs.12.4%), significantly. The age-standardized prevalence of DM was 8%. The prevalence was 14.9% in Yazd local people and 8.6% in those residents migrated from other provinces (P < 0.0001). We showed a significant association between DM prevalence and age, education, marital status, unemployment, insurance status, and positive family history (P < 0.0001). The prevalence of DM diagnosed by phycisians was 16.1% in participants (age-standardized prevalence: 8.3%). The subset analysis showed that 4.8% of patients were not aware of their disease. The prevalence of pre-diabetes was 25.8%. Of those with diabetes, 58.3% were not adequately controlled, which is not statistically significant with socio-economic status.
The current study showed a high prevalence of DM in Yazd Greater Area which is closely related to some socio-demographic factors. The high prevalence of pre-diabetes is alarming. Effective strategies for DM prevention should be introduced. The majority of people with diabetes are aware, but half of them are not controlled. The ineffective care plan currently in use, should be reviewed. Patients needs to be encouraged to improve their lifestyle. Active follow-up of patients is recommended to ensure continuity of care.",2020 Feb 3,"Epidemiology of diabetes mellitus, pre-diabetes, undiagnosed and uncontrolled diabetes in Central Iran: results from Yazd health study",BMC Public Health

231,PMC4931192,"Diabetes can be simply classified into type 1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Zinc transporter 8 (ZnT8), a novel islet autoantigen, is specifically expressed in insulin‐containing secretory granules of β‐cells. Genetic studies show that the genotypes of SLC30A8 can determine either protective or diabetogenic response depending on environmental and lifestyle factors. The ZnT8 protein expression, as well as zinc content in β‐cells, was decreased in diabetic mice. Thus, ZnT8 might participate in insulin biosynthesis and release, and subsequently involved deteriorated β‐cell function through direct or indirect mechanisms in type 1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus. From a clinical feature standpoint, the prevalence of ZnT8A is gradiently increased in type 2 diabetes mellitus, latent autoimmune diabetes in adults and type 1 diabetes mellitus. The frequency and epitopes of ZnT8‐specific T cells and cytokine release by ZnT8‐specific T cells are also different in diabetic patients and healthy controls. Additionally, the response to ZnT8 administration is also different in type 1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus. In the present review, we summarize the literature about clinical aspects of ZnT8 in the pathogenesis of diabetes, and suggest that ZnT8 might play a different role between type 1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus.",2016 Jan 9,Different role of zinc transporter 8 between type 1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus,Journal of Diabetes Investigation
232,PMC5850161,"Previous reports on whether smoking is associated with insulin resistance and diabetes mellitus have yielded inconsistent findings. We aimed to evaluate the relationship between cigarette smoking and incident diabetes mellitus in the Jackson Heart Study.
Jackson Heart Study participants enrolled at baseline without prevalent diabetes mellitus (n=2991) were classified by self‐report as current smokers, past smokers (smoked ≥400 cigarettes/life and no longer smoking), or never smokers. We quantified smoking intensity by number of cigarettes smoked daily; we considered ≥20 cigarettes per day (1 pack) “high‐intensity.” We defined diabetes mellitus as fasting glucose ≥126 mg/dL, hemoglobin A1c ≥6.5% or International Federation of Clinical Chemistry units HbA1c 48 mmol/mol, or use of diabetes mellitus medication. We estimated the adjusted associations of smoking status, intensity, and dose (pack‐years) with incident diabetes mellitus using Poisson regression models. At baseline there were 361 baseline current (1–10 cigarettes per day [n=242]; ≥20 [n=119]), 502 past, and 2128 never smokers. From Visit 1 to Visit 3 (mean 8.0±0.9 years), 479 participants developed incident diabetes mellitus. After adjustment for covariates, baseline current smokers who smoked less than a pack/d and past smokers had similar rates of incident diabetes mellitus compared with never smokers (incidence rate ratios 1.04, 95% confidence interval, 0.69–1.58 and 1.08, 95% confidence interval, 0.82–1.42, respectively). Baseline current high‐intensity smokers had a 79% (95% confidence interval, 1.14–2.81) higher incidence of diabetes mellitus compared with never smokers. Smoking dose (per 10 pack‐years) was also associated with a higher incidence of diabetes mellitus (incidence rate ratios 1.10, 95% confidence interval, 1.03–1.19) in adjusted models.

233,PMC5798333,"We report a disease-causing mutation in the β-cell–enriched MAFA transcription factor. Strikingly, the missense p.Ser64Phe MAFA mutation was associated with either of two distinct phenotypes, multiple insulin-producing neuroendocrine tumors of the pancreas—a condition known as insulinomatosis—or diabetes mellitus, recapitulating the physiological properties of MAFA both as an oncogene and as a key islet β-cell transcription factor. The implication of MAFA in these human phenotypes will provide insights into how this transcription factor regulates human β-cell activity as well as into the mechanisms of Maf-induced tumorigenesis.
The β-cell–enriched MAFA transcription factor plays a central role in regulating glucose-stimulated insulin secretion while also demonstrating oncogenic transformation potential in vitro. No disease-causing MAFA variants have been previously described. We investigated a large pedigree with autosomal dominant inheritance of diabetes mellitus or insulinomatosis, an adult-onset condition of recurrent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia caused by multiple insulin-secreting neuroendocrine tumors of the pancreas. Using exome sequencing, we identified a missense MAFA mutation (p.Ser64Phe, c.191C>T) segregating with both phenotypes of insulinomatosis and diabetes. This mutation was also found in a second unrelated family with the same clinical phenotype, while no germline or somatic MAFA mutations were identified in nine patients with sporadic insulinomatosis. In the two families, insulinomatosis presented more frequently in females (eight females/two males) and diabetes more often in males (12 males/four females). Four patients from the index family, including two homozygotes, had a history of congenital cataract and/or glaucoma. The p.Ser64Phe mutation was found to impair phosphorylation within the transactivation domain of MAFA and profoundly increased MAFA protein stability under both high and low glucose concentrations in β-cell lines. In addition, the transactivation potential of p.Ser64Phe MAFA in β-cell lines was enhanced compared with wild-type MAFA. In summary, the p.Ser64Phe missense MAFA mutation leads to familial insulinomatosis or diabetes by impacting MAFA protein stability and transactivation ability. The human phenotypes associated with the p.Ser64Phe MAFA missense mutation reflect both the oncogenic capacity of MAFA and its key role in islet β-cell activity.",2018 Jan 16,MAFA missense mutation causes familial insulinomatosis and diabetes mellitus,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America
234,PMC4004888,"Congenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (CNDI) is an inherited disorder characterized by renal tubular insensitivity to antidiuretic hormone, resulting in an inability to concentrate urine. We report on an infant boy with CNDI who showed growth failure during treatment with sodium restriction. At the age of 4 mo, he was diagnosed as having CNDI, judging from fever with hypernatremia (serum Na 153 mEq/L), diluted urine (urine osmolarity 193 mOsm/kg), high antidiuretic hormone (plasma antidiuretic hormone 53 pg/mL), and normal renal function (serum creatinine 0.3 mg/dL). His length and weight were mean +0.4 and –1.1 SD, respectively, at that time. He was treated with sodium restriction (sodium intake; 0.53 mEq/kg/day) using low sodium formula in addition to trichlormethiazide, spironolactone, and mefenamic acid. Growth failure developed: his length and weight were mean –2.4 and –3.3 SD, respectively, at the age of 10 mo. After withdrawal of sodium restriction to 1.5 mEq/kg/day of sodium intake without any change of caloric intake and medication, catch-up growth was observed. At the age of 39 mo, the patient’s height and weight were mean –0.8 and –0.6 SD, respectively.

A retrospective review of medical and pathological records of AHT patients from the Chinese PLA General Hospital were examined from January 1, 2005 to May 1, 2017. Clinical data, treatments, and outcomes were investigated.
Five female patients were identified (median age, 42.6 years). Symptoms included central diabetes insipidus, hypopituitarism, hyperprolactinemia, headache, and hypothalamic syndrome. The following hormonal deficits were noted: follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, adrenocorticotropic hormone, thyroid stimulating hormone, and growth hormone. One patient underwent high-dose methylprednisolone pulse treatment (HDMPT) and azathioprine plus intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), and two patients underwent HDMPT and two rounds of replacement therapy. During follow-up, one patient died because of non-compliance with therapy and the others were in remission or they recovered.

236,PMC6973648,"Improvements in sensor accuracy, greater convenience and ease of use, and expanding reimbursement have led to growing adoption of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). However, successful utilization of CGM technology in routine clinical practice remains relatively low.

Although unified recommendations for use of key CGM metrics have been established in three separate peer-reviewed articles, formal adoption by diabetes professional organizations and guidance in the practical application of these metrics in clinical practice have been lacking.

237,PMC7335534,"Exposure to road traffic noise has been linked to cardiometabolic complications, such as elevated blood pressure and glucose dysregulation. However, epidemiologic evidence linking road traffic noise to diabetes mellitus and hypertension remains scarce. We examined associations between road traffic noise and the incidence of diabetes mellitus and hypertension in Toronto, Canada.
Using the Ontario Population Health and Environment Cohort, we conducted a retrospective, population‐based cohort study of long‐term residents of Toronto, aged 35 to 100 years, who were registered for provincial publicly funded health insurance, and were without a history of hypertension (n=701 174) or diabetes mellitus (n=914 607). Road traffic noise exposure levels were assessed by the equivalent continuous A‐weighted sound pressure level (dBA) for the 24‐hour day and the equivalent continuous A‐weighted sound pressure level for the night (11 pm–7am). Noise exposures were assigned to subjects according to their annual residential postal codes during the 15‐year follow‐up. We used random‐effect Cox proportional hazards models adjusting for personal and area‐level characteristics. From 2001 to 2015, each interquartile range increase in the equivalent continuous A‐weighted sound pressure level (dBA) for the 24‐hour day (10.0 dBA) was associated with an 8% increase in incident diabetes mellitus (95% CI, 1.07–1.09) and a 2% increase in hypertension (95% CI, 1.01–1.03). We obtained similar estimates with the equivalent continuous A‐weighted sound pressure level for the night (11 pm–7am). These results were robust to all sensitivity analyses conducted, including further adjusting for traffic‐related air pollutants (ultrafine particles and nitrogen dioxide). For both hypertension and diabetes mellitus, we observed stronger associations with the equivalent continuous A‐weighted sound pressure level (dBA) for the 24‐hour day among women and younger adults (aged <60 years).

238,PMC5669141,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor control is a cornerstone of diabetes mellitus management. Little is known about relationships of objectively measured sedentary time and physical activity with major CVD risk factor control in individuals with diabetes mellitus. We examined associations of objectively measured sedentary time and moderate‐to‐vigorous physical activity with reaching major CVD risk factor control goals among US Hispanic/Latino adults with diabetes mellitus.
This cross‐sectional analysis included 1699 participants with diabetes mellitus from the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (2008–2011). Logistic regression models were used to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) of meeting the following 5 major CVD risk factor control goals: hemoglobin A1c <7.0%; systolic/diastolic blood pressure <140/80 mm Hg; triglycerides <150 mg/dL; low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol <100 mg/dL; and high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol >40/50 mg/dL for men/women. After adjustment for covariates including moderate‐to‐vigorous physical activity, less sedentary time was associated with increased odds of reaching hemoglobin A1c (OR=1.76 [95% CI: 1.10, 2.82]) and triglyceride control goals (OR=2.16 [1.36, 3.46]), and reaching ≥3 CVD risk factor control goals (OR=2.08 [1.34, 3.23]) (all ORs for comparisons of extreme tertiles of sedentary time). Moderate‐to‐vigorous physical activity was not associated with reaching any CVD risk factor control goals. Substituting 60‐min/day of sedentary time with light‐intensity physical activity was associated with increased odds of reaching hemoglobin A1c (OR=1.18 [1.04, 1.35]), high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (OR=1.17 [1.04, 1.32]), and triglyceride (OR=1.20 [1.05, 1.36]) control goals.

239,PMC8565416,"Sarcopenia has recently been recognized as another complication associated with diabetes, but its early screening still lacks clinical markers. Here, we aimed to investigate the relationship between serum levels of pentosidine, which is an advanced glycation end‐product, and sarcopenia in Chinese middle‐aged and elderly men with type 2 diabetes mellitus and evaluate whether pentosidine could be used as a kind of screening maker.
A total of 182 male type 2 diabetes mellitus patients aged ≥50 years were selected in the cross‐sectional study for whole‐body dual‐energy X‐ray measurement and calculating the appendicular skeletal muscle mass index. At the same time, handgrip strength and gait speed were assessed. According to the updated consensus on Asian sarcopenia in 2019, the patients were divided into the sarcopenia group (n = 83) and non‐sarcopenia group (n = 99). Serum pentosidine levels in the two groups were detected using enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay.
Serum pentosidine was significantly higher in the sarcopenia group (191.27 pmol/mL) than in the non‐sarcopenia group (34.93 pmol/mL). Serum pentosidine was negatively correlated with appendicular skeletal muscle mass index and handgrip strength (r = −0.30 and −0.25, respectively; P < 0.05), but not gait speed. The prevalence of sarcopenia increased as the quartile of serum pentosidine increased (P < 0.05). The association between pentosidine and the prevalence of sarcopenia was still significant after additional adjustments (odds ratio 1.01, P < 0.05).
Pentosidine is an independent risk factor for sarcopenia in Chinese middle‐aged and elderly men with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The detection of serum pentosidine levels in clinics might be helpful for the monitoring of type 2 diabetes mellitus complicated with sarcopenia.

240,PMC8801697,"Diabetes mellitus is emerging as an epidemic worldwide, and the incidence and prevalence of diabetes have drastically changed in China over the past 30 years, but data on its mortality rate are scarce. This study aimed to analyze the time trends of mortality rates among patients with diabetes in the rural and urban population in China between 1987 and 2019.
The research data come from China’s annual report on national health statistics and the Chinese Health Statistics Yearbook. Age-standardized mortality rates were calculated by using the direct method based on the World Standard Population from the WHO. Joinpoint regression analysis was employed to estimate the annual percent change and average annual percentage changes of mortality rates of diabetes mellitus.
An overall trend for increment in diabetes mortality was observed. The crude mortality rates and age-standardized mortality rates of diabetes for urban and rural residents in China showed a significant increasing trend between 1987 and 2019. Mortality due to diabetes in urban areas has been higher than in rural areas for 30 years. However, due to the rapid increase of rural diabetes mortality in the past decade, the gap between the two gradually narrowed. The age-standardized mortality rates of diabetes increased by about 38.5% in urban areas and 254.9% in rural areas over the whole study period. In addition, the age-standardized mortality rate of females with diabetes was higher than that of males, but this pattern began to change in urban areas in 2012. Finally, the age-standardized mortality rates in the elderly population in China are higher with a faster growth rate, especially in rural areas.
The mortality rate of diabetes is on the rise in China. The rapid growth of the mortality rate of diabetes in rural areas leads to the reduction of the urban–rural gap. Male mortality rates in urban areas have surpassed those of women. At the same time, the mortality rate of diabetes showed obvious elder-group orientation. As China’s population ages, the burden of death and disability caused by diabetes and its complications will continue to increase. These results indicate that diabetes has become a significant public health problem in China. Such an effect increases the demand for strategies aimed at the prevention and treatment of diabetes mellitus. In addition to the prevention and intervention of diabetes in high-risk groups, it is also necessary to establish diabetes screening networks to identify patients with mild symptoms. Early detection and timely intervention can effectively reduce the incidence and mortality of diabetes.",2022 Jan 17,"Trends in Diabetes Mortality in Urban and Rural China, 1987–2019: A Joinpoint Regression Analysis",Frontiers in Endocrinology
241,PMC7849457,"A 62-year-old patient with metastatic hypopharyngeal carcinoma underwent treatment with nivolumab, following which he developed symptoms suggestive of diabetes insipidus. Nivolumab was stopped and therapy with methylprednisolone was started. During corticosteroid therapy, the patient presented himself in poor health condition with fungal infection and glycemic decompensation. Methylprednisolone dose was tapered off, leading to the resolution of mycosis and the restoration of glycemic compensation, nevertheless polyuria and polydipsia persisted. Increase in urine osmolarity after desmopressin administration was made diagnosing central diabetes insipidus as a possibility. The neuroradiological data by pituitary MRI scan with gadolinium was compatible with coexistence of metastatic localization and infundibulo-neurohypophysitis secondary to therapy with nivolumab. To define the exact etiology of the pituitary pathology, histological confirmation would have been necessary; however, unfortunately, it was not possible. In the absence of histological confirmation, we believe it is likely that both pathologies coexisted.

242,PMC6203969,"Diabetes mellitus is a common co-existing disease in the critically ill. Diabetes mellitus may reduce the risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), but data from previous studies are conflicting. The objective of this study was to evaluate associations between pre-existing diabetes mellitus and ARDS in critically ill patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF).
An ancillary analysis of a global, multi-centre prospective observational study (LUNG SAFE) was undertaken. LUNG SAFE evaluated all patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) over a 4-week period, that required mechanical ventilation and met AHRF criteria. Patients who had their AHRF fully explained by cardiac failure were excluded. Important clinical characteristics were included in a stepwise selection approach (forward and backward selection combined with a significance level of 0.05) to identify a set of independent variables associated with having ARDS at any time, developing ARDS (defined as ARDS occurring after day 2 from meeting AHRF criteria) and with hospital mortality. Furthermore, propensity score analysis was undertaken to account for the differences in baseline characteristics between patients with and without diabetes mellitus, and the association between diabetes mellitus and outcomes of interest was assessed on matched samples.
Of the 4107 patients with AHRF included in this study, 3022 (73.6%) patients fulfilled ARDS criteria at admission or developed ARDS during their ICU stay. Diabetes mellitus was a pre-existing co-morbidity in 913 patients (22.2% of patients with AHRF). In multivariable analysis, there was no association between diabetes mellitus and having ARDS (OR 0.93 (0.78–1.11); p = 0.39), developing ARDS late (OR 0.79 (0.54–1.15); p = 0.22), or hospital mortality in patients with ARDS (1.15 (0.93–1.42); p = 0.19). In a matched sample of patients, there was no association between diabetes mellitus and outcomes of interest.
In a large, global observational study of patients with AHRF, no association was found between diabetes mellitus and having ARDS, developing ARDS, or outcomes from ARDS.

244,PMC7722981,"Type 1 diabetes mellitus is believed to result from destruction of the insulin-producing β-cells in pancreatic islets that is mediated by autoimmune mechanisms. The classic view is that autoreactive T cells mistakenly destroy healthy (‘innocent’) β-cells. We propose an alternative view in which the β-cell is the key contributor to the disease. By their nature and function, β-cells are prone to biosynthetic stress with limited measures for self-defence. β-Cell stress provokes an immune attack that has considerable negative effects on the source of a vital hormone. This view would explain why immunotherapy at best delays progression of type 1 diabetes mellitus and points to opportunities to use therapies that revitalize β-cells, in combination with immune intervention strategies, to reverse the disease. We present the case that dysfunction occurs in both the immune system and β-cells, which provokes further dysfunction, and present the evidence leading to the consensus that islet autoimmunity is an essential component in the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes mellitus. Next, we build the case for the β-cell as the trigger of an autoimmune response, supported by analogies in cancer and antitumour immunity. Finally, we synthesize a model (‘connecting the dots’) in which both β-cell stress and islet autoimmunity can be harnessed as targets for intervention strategies.
This Review examines the evidence that β-cells are active participants in the dialogue with the immune system during the development of type 1 diabetes mellitus. The authors suggest that therapies targeting β-cell health, vitality and function might prove essential, in combination with immunotherapy, to change the course of events leading to β-cell destruction.
Autoreactive T cells are part of the normal T cell repertoire.
β-Cells are poorly equipped to survive an inflammatory milieu and participate in their own destruction.
Metabolic activity drives β-cell dysfunction and destruction.
Inflammation triggers profound metabolic, epigenetic and autoantigenic changes, which expose β-cells to the immune system.
The immune response to distressed β-cells might be one with ‘good intentions’, as infected tissues or tumours provoke the immune system in similar ways.
Immunotherapy might be insufficient to cure type 1 diabetes mellitus; β-cell therapy might contribute to reducing β-cell immunogenicity and islet autoimmunity.",2020 Dec 8,Type 1 diabetes mellitus as a disease of the β-cell (do not blame the immune system?),Nature Reviews. Endocrinology
245,PMC5835456,"Previously, a study using a narrowly defined (physical base) frailty scale reported that both good and bad (U‐shaped curve) glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels were frailty risk factors in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, no such studies in Japan have shown this. We aimed to evaluate the frailty risk factors including HbA1c in elderly Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus using a broadly defined (both physical and psychosocial base) frailty scale, the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS).
We randomly enrolled 132 elderly patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (aged ≥65 years) and categorized the patients into nine stages of frailty using CFS. Because no patient had CFS 9, patients with a CFS score of 1–4 and 5–8 were defined as non‐frail and frail, respectively. We attempted to identify the risk factors of frailty by investigating the association between CFS stage and various patient factors.
Multiple regression analysis showed that an increase in age, low levels of albumin, high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, HbA1c, total cholesterol, and bodyweight were statistically significant and strong independent risk factors for frailty, suggesting that reverse metabolism owing to malnutrition in elderly type 2 diabetes mellitus patients might be involved.
HbA1c level was not a U‐shaped risk for frailty, suggesting that relatively good glycemic control might be more important for frailty than poor control in elderly type 2 diabetes mellitus patients.",2017 Jul 23,Low glycated hemoglobin level is associated with severity of frailty in Japanese elderly diabetes patients,Journal of Diabetes Investigation
246,PMC4080339,"X-linked nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (X-NDI) is a disease caused by inactivating mutations of the vasopressin (AVP) type 2 receptor (V2R) gene. Loss of V2R function prevents plasma membrane expression of the AQP2 water channel in the kidney collecting duct cells and impairs the kidney concentration ability. In an attempt to develop strategies to bypass V2R signaling in X-NDI, we evaluated the effects of secretin and fluvastatin, either alone or in combination, on kidney function in a mouse model of X-NDI. The secretin receptor was found to be functionally expressed in the kidney collecting duct cells. Based on this, X-NDI mice were infused with secretin for 14 days but urinary parameters were not altered by the infusion. Interestingly, secretin significantly increased AQP2 levels in the collecting duct but the protein primarily accumulated in the cytosol. Since we previously reported that fluvastatin treatment increased AQP2 plasma membrane expression in wild-type mice, secretin-infused X-NDI mice received a single injection of fluvastatin. Interestingly, urine production by X-NDI mice treated with secretin plus fluvastatin was reduced by nearly 90% and the urine osmolality was doubled. Immunostaining showed that secretin increased intracellular stores of AQP2 and the addition of fluvastatin promoted AQP2 trafficking to the plasma membrane. Taken together, these findings open new perspectives for the pharmacological treatment of X-NDI.",2014 Feb 12,Combination of secretin and fluvastatin ameliorates the polyuria associated with X-linked nephrogenic diabetes insipidus in mice,Kidney International

248,PMC4045430,"Diabetes Insipidus (DI) is either due to deficient secretion of arginine vasopressin (central) or to tubular unresponsiveness (nephrogenic). Drug induced DI is a well-known entity with an extensive list of medications. Polyuria is generally defined as urine output exceeding 3 liters per day in adults. It is crucial to identify the cause of diabetes insipidus and to implement therapy as early as possible to prevent the electrolyte disturbances and the associated mortality and morbidity. It is very rare to have an idiosyncratic effect after a short use of a medication, and physicians should be aware of such a complication to avoid volume depletion. The diagnosis of diabetes insipidus is very challenging because it relies on laboratory values, urine output, and the physical examination of the patient. A high clinical suspicion of diabetes insipidus should be enough to initiate treatment. The complications related to DI are mostly related to the electrolyte imbalance that can affect the normal physiology of different organ systems.",2013 Mar 24,Diabetes Insipidus: A Challenging Diagnosis with New Drug Therapies,ISRN Nephrology
249,PMC6617012,"Diabetes mellitus has become a serious and growing public health concern. It has high morbidity and mortality because of its complications, such as diabetic nephropathy, diabetic cardiovascular complication, diabetic neuropathy, diabetic retinopathy, and diabetic hepatopathy. Epidemiological studies revealed that the consumption of tea was inversely associated with the risk of diabetes mellitus and its complications. Experimental studies demonstrated that tea had protective effects against diabetes mellitus and its complications via several possible mechanisms, including enhancing insulin action, ameliorating insulin resistance, activating insulin signaling pathway, protecting islet β-cells, scavenging free radicals, and decreasing inflammation. Moreover, clinical trials also confirmed that tea intervention is effective in patients with diabetes mellitus and its complications. Therefore, in order to highlight the importance of tea in the prevention and management of diabetes mellitus and its complications, this article summarizes and discusses the effects of tea against diabetes mellitus and its complications based on the findings from epidemiological, experimental, and clinical studies, with the special attention paid to the mechanisms of action.",2019 Jun 10,Effects and Mechanisms of Tea for the Prevention and Management of Diabetes Mellitus and Diabetic Complications: An Updated Review,Antioxidants
250,PMC4566335,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity are increasingly common and major global health problems. The Edmonton obesity staging system clearly pointed towards increased mortality proportionate to the severity of obesity. Obesity itself triggers insulin resistance and thereby poses the risk of T2DM. Both obesity and T2DM have been associated with higher morbidity and mortality and this calls for institution of effective therapies to deal with the rising trend of complications arising out of this dual menace. Although lifestyle changes form the cornerstone of therapy for both the ailments, sustained results from this modalities is far from satisfactory. While Look AHEAD (action for HEAalth in diabetes) study showed significant weight loss, reduction in glycated hemoglobin and higher remission rate of T2DM at 1st year following intensive lifestyle measures; recurrence and relapse rate bounced back in half of subjects at 4 years, thereby indicating that weight loss and glycemic control is difficult to maintain in the long term with lifestyle interventions. Same recurrence phenomenon was also observed with pharmacotherapy with rimonabant, sibutramine and orlistat. Bariatric surgery has been seen to associate with substantial and sustained weight loss in morbidly obese patients. Interestingly, bariatric surgeries also induce higher rates of short and long-term diabetes remission. Although the exact mechanism behinds this diabetes remission are not well understood; improved insulin action, beta-cell function and complex interplay of hormones in the entero-insular axis appears to play a major role.

252,PMC7494983,"The prevalence of diabetes and its related complications are increasing significantly globally. Collected evidence suggested that several genetic and environmental factors contribute to diabetes mellitus. Associated complications such as retinopathy, neuropathy, nephropathy and other cardiovascular complications are a direct result of diabetes. Epigenetic factors include deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation and histone post-translational modifications. These factors are directly related with pathological factors such as oxidative stress, generation of inflammatory mediators and hyperglycemia. These result in altered gene expression and targets cells in the pathology of diabetes mellitus without specific changes in a DNA sequence. Environmental factors and malnutrition are equally responsible for epigenetic states. Accumulated evidence suggested that environmental stimuli alter the gene expression that result in epigenetic changes in chromatin. Recent studies proposed that epigenetics may include the occurrence of ‘metabolic memory’ found in animal studies. Further study into epigenetic mechanism might give us new vision into the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus and related complication thus leading to the discovery of new therapeutic targets. In this review, we discuss the possible epigenetic changes and mechanism that happen in diabetes mellitus type 1 and type 2 separately.

This cross‐sectional study enrolled 1,328 participants with type 1 diabetes (n = 177), type 2 diabetes (n = 645) and without diabetes (n = 506). Sarcopenia was defined as a low grip strength and slow gait speed with low skeletal muscle mass index, whereas dynapenia was defined as low strengths of grip and knee extension with a normal skeletal muscle mass index. Participants without sarcopenia and dynapenia were defined as robust.
Among participants aged ≥65 years, sarcopenia and dynapenia were observed in 12.2% and 0.5% of individuals without diabetes, 42.9% and 11.4% of type 1 diabetes patients, and 20.9% and 13.9% of type 2 diabetes patients. In both type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes patients, sarcopenic patients were significantly older and thinner, and showed a significantly higher rate of diabetic neuropathy than robust patients. In patients with type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes, dynapenic patients were older, and showed a higher rate of diabetic neuropathy and lower estimated glomerular filtration rate than robust patients. Patients complicated with sarcopenia and dynapenia showed a significantly lower physical quality of life and higher rate of incidental falls than robust patients.

256,PMC8776149,"Background: Wolfram syndrome (WS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder that is characterized by the presence of diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy and hearing loss, all of which are crucial elements for the diagnosis. WS is variably associated with diabetes insipidus, neurological disorders, urinary tract anomalies, endocrine dysfunctions and many other systemic manifestations. Since Wolfram and Wagener first described WS in 1938, new phenotypic/genotypic variants of the syndrome have been observed and the clinical picture has been significantly enriched. To date, two main subtypes of WS that associated with two different mutations are known: WS type 1 (WS1), caused by the mutation of the wolframine gene (WS1; 606201), and WS type 2 (WS2), caused by the mutation of the CISD2 gene (WS2; 604928). Methods: A systematic review of the literature was describe the phenotypic characteristics of WS2 in order to highlight the key elements that differentiate it from the classic form. Conclusion: WS2 is the rarest and most recently identified subtype of WS; its clinical picture is partially overlapping with that of WS1, from which it traditionally differs by the absence of diabetes insipidus and the presence of greater bleeding tendency and peptic ulcers.",2022 Jan 12,Wolfram Syndrome Type 2: A Systematic Review of a Not Easily Identifiable Clinical Spectrum,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health

This international Phase 3 study randomized adults with T2D on metformin with/without sulphonylurea. They received DAPA + SAXA or INS for 24 weeks (short‐term) with a 28‐week (long‐term) extension. Week 52 exploratory endpoints included adjusted mean change from baseline in glycated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and body weight, and a proportion of patients achieving optimal glycaemic response without hypoglycaemia and without requiring rescue medication.
Of the 1163 patients enrolled, 643 received treatment; 600 (DAPA + SAXA, 306; INS, 294) entered the long‐term phase. At 52 weeks, HbA1c [adjusted least squares (LS) mean; 95% confidence interval (CI)] decreased more with DAPA + SAXA (−1.5% [−1.6%, −1.4%]) than with INS (−1.3% [−1.4%, −1.1%]); the LS mean difference (95% CI) was −0.25% (−0.4%, −0.1%; P = 0.009).

258,PMC8757839,"Background: Decompensated diabetes is associated with a higher prevalence and severity of periodontitis and poorer response to periodontal therapy. It is conceivable that periodontal therapy may cause systemic and local complications in this type of patients. The aim of the present study was to identify and describe the best available evidence for the treatment of periodontitis in decompensated diabetics.
Material and methods: An expert committee including participants from different areas gathered to discuss and develop a treatment guideline under the guidance of the Cochrane Associate Center, Faculty of Dentistry, University of Chile. In total, four research questions were prepared. The questions prepared related to decompensated diabetic patients (glycated hemoglobin >8) were, (1) Does the exposure to periodontal treatment increase the risk of infectious or systemic complications? (2) Does the antibiotic treatment or prophylaxis, compared to not giving it, reduce infectious complications? (3) Does the exposure to periodontal treatment, compared to no treatment, reduce the glycated hemoglobin levels (HbA1c)? Last question was related to diabetic patients, (4) Does the exposure to a higher level of HbA1c, compared to stable levels, increase the risk of infectious complications? Based on these questions, a search strategy was developed using MEDLINE and EPISTEMONIKOS. Only systematic reviews were considered.
Results: For question 1, the search yielded 12 records in EPISTEMONIKOS and 23 in MEDLINE. None of these studies addressed the question. For question 2, the search yielded 58 records in EPISTEMONIKOS and 11 in MEDLINE. None of these studies addressed the question. For question 3, the search yielded 16 records in EPISTEMONIKOS and 11 in MEDLINE. Thirteen addressed the question. For question 4, the search yielded 7 records in EPISTEMONIKOS and 9 in MEDLINE. One addressed the question.
Conclusions: In decompensated diabetic patients, there is lack of scientific information about risk of infectious or systemic complications as a result of periodontal treatment and about the impact of antibiotic treatment or prophylaxis on reduction if infectious complications. A defined HbA1c threshold for dental and periodontal treatment in diabetic patients has yet to be determined. Finally, periodontal treatment does have an impact on HbA1c levels.",2021 Apr 16,Periodontal Treatment Protocol for Decompensated Diabetes Patients,Frontiers in Oral Health
259,PMC7098994,"There has been an appreciable increase in the number of people in Africa with metabolic syndrome and Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) in recent years as a result of a number of factors. Factors include lifestyle changes, urbanisation, and the growing consumption of processed foods coupled with increasing levels of obesity. Currently there are 19 million adults in Africa with diabetes, mainly T2DM (95%), estimated to grow to 47 million people by 2045 unless controlled. This has a considerable impact on morbidity, mortality and costs in the region. There are a number of issues to address to reduce the impact of T2DM including improving detection rates and current access to services alongside addressing issues of adherence to prescribed medicines. There are also high rates of co-morbidities with infectious diseases such as HIV and tuberculosis in patients in Africa with T2DM that require attention.

260,PMC8169344,"To define the target value for the percentage coefficient of variation for glucose (%CV) as a measure of glycemic variability (GV) in Chinese diabetes patients.
This retrospective study included 3,007 diabetes patients who underwent continuous glucose monitoring for 3 days. Type 2 diabetes was divided into groups according to the received treatment: group 1, non‐insulinotropic agent (n = 138); group 2, insulinotropic agent (n = 761); group 3, basal insulin therapy (n = 100); group 4, premixed insulin (n = 784); and group 5, intensive insulin therapy (n = 612). Type 1 diabetes patients were included as group 6 (n = 612). %CV and percentage of time per day within, below (3.9mmol/L; TBR3.9) and above (10.0 mmol/L) the target glucose range (3.9–10.0 mmol/L) were computed. TBR3.9 ≥4% was defined as excessive hypoglycemia.
Type 2 diabetes with a premixed or intensive insulin regimen had an increased %CV compared with those receiving oral therapy or basal insulin. The upper limit of %CV in group 1 was 33%, which was adopted as the threshold to define excessive GV. For each treatment group, the percentage of people with TBR3.9 ≥4% was significantly greater in the subgroup with %CV >33% than ≤33% (P < 0.001). In participants who achieved TBR3.9 <4%, the time per day spent within the target glucose range of 3.9–10.0 mmol/L > 70% and time per day above 10.0 mmol/L <25%, the 95th percentile of %CV was 32.70%. Further receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that the cut‐off values of %CV for predicting TBR3.9 ≥4% varied by the type of diabetes and glycated hemoglobin categories.

261,PMC6755275,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a long-term metabolic disorder characterized by high blood sugar levels, insulin resistance and a relative lack of insulin. A previous study has reported that an association exists between γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and the hippocampus. The current study therefore aimed to assess the effect of the GABA receptor (GABA-R) on the long-term potentiation (LTP) and depotentiation of the hippocampal CA1 region in mice with T2DM. Mice were divided into four groups: A normal group consisting of healthy mice and a GABA-R, negative control and blank group all comprising T2DM mice. The weight and blood glucose level of all mice were measured and GABA-R mRNA and protein expression were detected. A hydroxyl free radical (OH-) kit was used to determine the hippocampal OH-content. Using an electrophysiological experiment, the population spike (PS) slope was observed every 5 min. The results revealed that as GABA-R levels increased, the weight, blood glucose level and OH− content of the T2DM mice significantly decreased, and the neuron microstructures in the mice hippocampal tissue improved. The PS slope also significantly increased and the level of depotentiation improved. The results of the current study support the theory that the upregulation of GABA-R protects the neuronal ultrastructure and promotes LTP and depotentiation in the hippocampal CA1 region by inhibiting the accumulation of OH− in T2DM mice.",2019 Aug 8,Upregulation of GABA receptor promotes long-term potentiation and depotentiation in the hippocampal CA1 region of mice with type 2 diabetes mellitus,Experimental and Therapeutic Medicine
262,PMC7923125,"An 11-year-old girl presented with acute lower limb weakness, dehydration, hypernatraemia and secondary rhabdomyolysis on a background of an 8-month history of polyuria. Radiological investigations revealed a suprasellar tumour which was diagnosed on biopsy as a non-metastatic germinoma. Further endocrinological investigations confirmed panhypopituitarism and she commenced desmopressin, hydrocortisone and thyroxine. Her chemotherapeutic regime consisted of etoposide, carboplatin and ifosfamide, the latter of which required 4 litres of hyperhydration therapy daily. During the first course of ifosfamide, titration of oral desmopressin was trialled but this resulted in erratic sodium control leading to disorientation. Based on limited literature, we then trialled an arginine-vasopressin (AVP) infusion. A sliding scale was developed to adjust the AVP dose, with an aim to achieve a urine output of 3–4 mL/kg/h. During the second course of ifosamide, AVP infusion was commenced at the outset and tighter control of urine output and sodium levels was achieved. In conclusion, we found that an AVP infusion during hyperhydration therapy was required to achieve eunatraemia in a patient with cranial diabetes insipidus. Developing an AVP sliding scale requires individual variation; further reports/case series are required to underpin practice.
Certain chemotherapeutic regimens require large fluid volumes of hyperhydration therapy which can result in significant complications secondary to rapid serum sodium shifts in patients with diabetes insipidus.
The use of a continuous AVP infusion and titrating with a sliding scale is more effective than oral desmopressin in regulating plasma sodium and fluid balance during hyperhydration therapy.
No adverse effects were found in our patient using a continuous AVP infusion.
Adjustment of the AVP infusion rate depends on urine output, fluid balance, plasma sodium levels and sensitivity/response of the child to titrated AVP doses.",2021 Feb 17,Arginine-vasopressin infusion in a child with cranial diabetes insipidus during hyperhydration therapy with chemotherapy: a therapeutic challenge,"Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism Case Reports"
263,PMC4682130,"Hypokalemia (low serum potassium level) is a common electrolyte imbalance that can cause a defect in urinary concentrating ability, i.e., nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI), but the molecular mechanism is unknown. We employed proteomic analysis of inner medullary collecting ducts (IMCD) from rats fed with a potassium-free diet for 1 day. IMCD protein quantification was performed by mass spectrometry using a label-free methodology. A total of 131 proteins, including the water channel AQP2, exhibited significant changes in abundance, most of which were decreased. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that many of the down-regulated proteins were associated with the biological processes of generation of precursor metabolites and energy, actin cytoskeleton organization, and cell-cell adhesion. Targeted LC-MS/MS and immunoblotting studies further confirmed the down regulation of 18 selected proteins. Electron microscopy showed autophagosomes/autophagolysosomes in the IMCD cells of rats deprived of potassium for only 1 day. An increased number of autophagosomes was also confirmed by immunofluorescence, demonstrating co-localization of LC3 and Lamp1 with AQP2 and several other down-regulated proteins in IMCD cells. AQP2 was also detected in autophagosomes in IMCD cells of potassium-deprived rats by immunogold electron microscopy. Thus, enhanced autophagic degradation of proteins, most notably including AQP2, is an early event in hypokalemia-induced NDI.",2015 Dec 17,Autophagic degradation of aquaporin-2 is an early event in hypokalemia-induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus,Scientific Reports
264,PMC6123026,"Protein preload improves postprandial glycemia by stimulating secretion of insulin and incretin hormones. However, it requires a large dose of protein to produce a significant effect. The present study was carried out to investigate the postprandial glucose‐lowering effect of a premeal protein‐enriched, dietary fiber‐fortified bar (PFB), which contains moderate amounts of protein, in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus or normal glucose tolerance (NGT).
The participants (15 type 2 diabetes mellitus and 15 NGT) were randomly assigned to either a premeal or postmeal PFB group and underwent two mixed meal tolerance tests, 1 week apart in reverse order. Plasma levels of glucose, insulin, glucagon‐like peptide‐1 and glucose‐dependent insulinotropic polypeptide were measured.
During the mixed meal tolerance tests, the incremental area under the curve from 0 to 180 min of plasma glucose levels was lower with premeal PFB than with postmeal PFB in the type 2 diabetes mellitus (14,723 ± 1,310 mg min/dL vs 19,642 ± 1,367 mg min/dL; P = 0.0002) and NGT participants (3,943 ± 416 mg min/dL vs 4,827 ± 520 mg min/dL, P = 0.0296). In the type 2 diabetes mellitus participants, insulinogenic index and the incremental area under the curve from 0 to 180 min of plasma total glucagon‐like peptide‐1 levels were higher with premeal PFB than with postmeal PFB, but not in the NGT participants. There was no difference in postprandial glucose‐dependent insulinotropic polypeptide levels between premeal and postmeal PFB in both groups.
Acute administration of premeal PFB decreased postprandial glucose excursion in both type 2 diabetes mellitus and NGT participants. In the type 2 diabetes mellitus participants, premeal PFB augmented the early‐phase insulin secretion, possibly through enhancing glucagon‐like peptide‐1 secretion.",2018 Mar 30,"Postprandial glucose‐lowering effect of premeal consumption of protein‐enriched, dietary fiber‐fortified bar in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus or normal glucose tolerance",Journal of Diabetes Investigation

 Seventy-nine patients with CDI (CDI group) hospitalized from July 2012 to March 2017 and 43 healthy children (control group) were enrolled in this study. All cases underwent MRI examination including T1-weighted three-dimensional magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo (T1WI-3D-MP RAGE) imaging sequences. The pituitary volume, the signal intensity of posterior pituitary, and the morphology of pituitary stalk were measured between two groups. The medical history, urine testing, imaging of hypothalamic-pituitary region, and hormone levels were also recorded. 
 Age and gender were matched between the CDI and control groups. The height and BMI in the CDI group were less and the urine volume in 24 h was higher than those in the control group. The signal intensity of the posterior pituitary was higher in the control group, whereas the pituitary volume was smaller in the CDI group. In the CDI group, 44 cases presented with morphological changes of the pituitary stalk. Clinical symptoms mainly included polydipsia, polyuria, short stature, and vomiting. All patients were confirmed by water deprivation vasopressin test. Forty-four CDI children were associated with hypopituitarism, including 33 cases of PSIS with multiple pituitary hormone deficiencies (MPHD) and 11 cases of growth hormone deficiency (IGHD).

The effect on anterior pituitary gland can be associated with growth hormone deficiency, hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, premature menopause, erectile dysfunction, and infertility. HIV can cause pituitary apoplexy, and this should be treated as an endocrine emergency. Importantly, HIV can be associated with pituitary lymphoma and pituitary cancer. Therefore, joined management between HIV physicians, clinical biochemists and endocrinologists may help in establishing pituitary dysfunction.",2021 May 19,HIV and the Pituitary Gland: Clinical and Biochemical Presentations,Journal of Laboratory Physicians
267,PMC7352830,"Women diagnosed with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are more likely to later develop diabetes. Evidence from some previous reviews suggests that low vitamin D status during pregnancy increases the risk of developing GDM, but whether vitamin D during pregnancy also influences the risk of diabetes post GDM is less well studied. Thus, the aim of this systematic literature review was to summarize the current available literature on that topic. This review considered observational studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Five databases were searched. The risk of bias of the included studies was assessed. A total of six studies were included: three observational studies and three RCTs. Findings were inconsistent across the six included studies. However, when considering RCTs only, the findings more strongly suggested that vitamin D supplementation during and after pregnancy did not have an influence on markers of diabetes development or diabetes development post GDM. This systematic review highlights inconsistent findings on the associations between vitamin D supplementation or concentration during and after pregnancy and markers of diabetes development or diabetes development post GDM; and although results from randomized interventional studies more strongly suggested no associations, the conclusion holds a high degree of uncertainty.",2020 Jun 10,The Role of Vitamin D in the Development of Diabetes Post Gestational Diabetes Mellitus: A Systematic Literature Review,Nutrients
268,PMC8344168,"Despite the increased fracture risk, bone mineral density (BMD) is variable in type 1 (T1D) and type 2 (T2D) diabetes mellitus. We aimed at comparing independent BMD predictors in T1D, T2D and control subjects, respectively.
Cross-sectional case-control study enrolling 30 T1D, 39 T2D and 69 age, sex and body mass index (BMI) – matched controls that underwent clinical examination, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (BMD at the lumbar spine and femoral neck) and serum determination of HbA1c and parameters of calcium and phosphate metabolism.
T2D patients had similar BMD compared to T1D individuals (after adjusting for age, BMI and disease duration) and to matched controls, respectively. In multiple regression analysis, diabetes duration – but not HbA1c- negatively predicted femoral neck BMD in T1D (β= -0.39, p = 0.014), while BMI was a positive predictor for lumbar spine (β = 0.46, p = 0.006) and femoral neck BMD (β = 0.44, p = 0.007) in T2D, besides gender influence. Age negatively predicted BMD in controls, but not in patients with diabetes.
Long-standing diabetes and female gender particularly increase the risk for low bone mass in T1D. An increased body weight partially hinders BMD loss in T2D. The impact of age appears to be surpassed by that of other bone regulating factors in both T1D and T2D patients.",2021 Aug 6,Bone mineral density predictors in long-standing type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus,BMC Endocrine Disorders

270,PMC8398612,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is the most widespread form of diabetes, characterized by chronic hyperglycaemia, insulin resistance, and inefficient insulin secretion and action. Primary care in T2DM is pharmacological, using drugs of several groups that include insulin sensitisers (e.g., biguanides, thiazolidinediones), insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulphonylureas, meglinides), alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, and the newest incretin-based therapies and sodium–glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors. However, their long-term application can cause many harmful side effects, emphasising the importance of the using natural therapeutic products. Natural health substances including non-flavonoid polyphenols (e.g., resveratrol, curcumin, tannins, and lignans), flavonoids (e.g., anthocyanins, epigallocatechin gallate, quercetin, naringin, rutin, and kaempferol), plant fruits, vegetables and other products (e.g., garlic, green tea, blackcurrant, rowanberry, bilberry, strawberry, cornelian cherry, olive oil, sesame oil, and carrot) may be a safer alternative to primary pharmacological therapy. They are recommended as food supplements to prevent and/or ameliorate T2DM-related complications. In the advanced stage of T2DM, the combination therapy of synthetic agents and natural compounds with synergistic interactions makes the treatment more efficient. In this review, both pharmaceutical drugs and selected natural products, as well as combination therapies, are characterized.

271,PMC6901769,"To determine the association between sociodemographic, clinical, and health literacy and the presence of depressed mood and their relationships to diabetes self-management among type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients in Saudi Arabia.
A total of 352 T2DM patients from 2 public tertiary hospitals in Saudi Arabia participated in this descriptive cross-sectional study between December 2016 and February 2017. All respondents answered a 4-part questionnaire, which includes demographic data, Diabetes Self-Management Questionnaire (DSMQ), 36-item test based Short Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults, and a 2-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2). The Chi-square test and logistic regression analysis were conducted to determine the relationship and significant predictors for self-management among T2DM patients.
The analysis showed that majority of the participants had low to marginal functional health literacy. The overall DSM-16 score was good, indicating more effective self-care, while 20% of the participants had a score of 2 or more in the PHQ-2 indicating presence of depressed mood. No significant association was found between DSM and health literacy among the study participants while age, gender, educational level, employment status, and level of the depressive symptom were significantly associated with differences in the level of functional literacy of the participants.
The study shows that nearly half of the T2DM patients that exhibited low level of functional health literacy had low diabetes self-management. Our findings also show that gender significantly affects diabetes self-management in which odds are a lot higher among females than males with diabetes self-management.

272,PMC5006133,"Wolfram syndrome (WS) is a rare autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the presentation of early onset type I diabetes mellitus and optic atrophy with later onset diabetes insipidus and deafness. WFS1 gene was identified on chromosome 4p16.1 as the gene responsible for WS disease given that most of the WS patients were found to carry mutations in this gene. This study was carried out to investigate the molecular spectrum of WFS1 gene in Jordanian families. Molecular and clinical characterization was performed on five WS patients from two unrelated Jordanian families. Our data indicated that WS patients of the first family harbored two deletion mutations (V415del and F247fs) located in exon 8 and exon 7 respectively, with a compound heterozygous pattern of inheritance; while in the second family, we identified a novel nonsense mutation (W185X) located in exon 5 in the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain with a homozygous pattern of inheritance. This mutation can be considered as loss of function mutation since the resulting truncated protein lost both the transmembrane domain and the C-terminal domain. Additionally, the W185X mutation lies within the CaM binding domain in wolframin protein which is thought to have a role in the regulation of wolframin function in response to calcium levels.",2016 Jul 16,Identification of a novel WFS1 homozygous nonsense mutation in Jordanian children with Wolfram syndrome,Meta Gene
273,PMC7044264,"Purpose: To increase knowledge for the early differential diagnosis and accurate therapeutic strategies for pediatric patients with sellar or suprasellar region (SSR) lesions who initially present with central diabetes insipidus (CDI).
Methods: This is a retrospective review of 55 pediatric patients (≤14 years old) with identified lesions in the SSR who initially presented with CDI at a large pituitary center between 2012 and 2018. The following data were summarized: demographic, clinical, endocrine, and neuroimaging data, intraoperative findings, histopathological findings, treatments, and prognosis.
Results: In our group, the etiologies of the SSR lesions included germ cell tumors (GCTs, 74.5%), Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH, 18.2%), and craniopharyngioma (CP, 7.3%). Almost all patients (50/55, 90.9%) showed anterior pituitary dysfunction [multiple axes dysfunction (38), and isolated axis dysfunction (14)], while the GH/IGF-I axis was the most affected. Most GCT patients presented with various clinical manifestations besides CDI and had elevated β-HCG, whereas LCH and CP patients mostly presented few non-specific symptoms besides CDI and most had normal level tumor markers. Sellar MRI demonstrated that posterior pituitary bright spot disappearance occurred in all patients, and pituitary stalk thickening was observed in 96.7% of patients. Treatment varied due to the different etiologies of the SSR lesions. After follow-up for 35.4 ± 20.2 months, the proportions of patients who needed AVP (arginine vasopressin) for GCT, LCH, and CP were 86.5, 100, and 75%, respectively, and the proportions of patients who needed HRT were 89.2, 50, and 75%, respectively.
Conclusion: For pediatric SSR lesions that first manifest as CDI, we should comprehensively consider clinical characteristics and imaging features to aid in their early differential diagnosis. Tumor markers and surgical histopathology are also great complements for the differential diagnosis. Additionally, various treatment strategies should be adopted according to different causes to improve the child's prognosis and quality of life.",2020 Feb 20,Clinical Characteristics of Pediatric Patients With Sellar and Suprasellar Lesions Who Initially Present With Central Diabetes Insipidus: A Retrospective Study of 55 Cases From a Large Pituitary Center in China,Frontiers in Endocrinology

275,PMC8162450,"Individualization of therapy based on a person’s specific type of diabetes is one key element of a “precision medicine” approach to diabetes care. However, applying such an approach remains difficult because of barriers such as disease heterogeneity, difficulties in accurately diagnosing different types of diabetes, multiple genetic influences, incomplete understanding of pathophysiology, limitations of current therapies, and environmental, social, and psychological factors. Monogenic diabetes, for which single gene mutations are causal, is the category most suited to a precision approach. The pathophysiological mechanisms of monogenic diabetes are understood better than those of any other form of diabetes. Thus, this category offers the advantage of accurate diagnosis of nonoverlapping etiological subgroups for which specific interventions can be applied. Although representing a small proportion of all diabetes cases, monogenic forms present an opportunity to demonstrate the feasibility of precision medicine strategies. In June 2019, the editors of Diabetes Care convened a panel of experts to discuss this opportunity. This article summarizes the major themes that arose at that forum. It presents an overview of the common causes of monogenic diabetes, describes some challenges in identifying and treating these disorders, and reports experience with various approaches to screening, diagnosis, and management. This article complements a larger American Diabetes Association effort supporting implementation of precision medicine for monogenic diabetes, which could serve as a platform for a broader initiative to apply more precise tactics to treating the more common forms of diabetes.",2020 Nov 12,Monogenic Diabetes: From Genetic Insights to Population-Based Precision in Care.

276,PMC8116627,"Congenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by renal inability to concentrate urine. We utilized a multicenter strategy to investigate the genotype and phenotype in a cohort of Chinese children clinically diagnosed with NDI from 2014 to 2019. Ten boys from nine families were identified with mutations in AVPR2 or AQP2 along with dehydration, polyuria–polydipsia, and severe hypernatremia. Genetic screening confirmed the diagnosis of seven additional relatives with partial or subclinical NDI. Protein structural analysis revealed a notable clustering of diagnostic mutations in the transmembrane region of AVPR2 and an enrichment of diagnostic mutations in the C-terminal region of AQP2. The pathogenic variants are significantly more likely to be located inside the domain compared with population variants. Through the structural analysis and in silico prediction, the eight mutations identified in this study were presumed to be disease-causing. The most common treatments were thiazide diuretics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Emergency treatment for hypernatremia dehydration in neonates should not use isotonic saline as a rehydration fluid. Genetic analysis presumably confirmed the diagnosis of NDI in each patient in our study.

277,PMC7046769,"Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM), which is correlated with changes in the gut microbiota, is a risk factor for neonatal inborn errors of metabolism (IEMs). Maternal hyperglycemia exerts epigenetic effects on genes that encode IEM-associated enzymes, resulting in changes in the neonatal blood metabolome. However, the relationship between maternal gut microbiota and the neonatal blood metabolome remains poorly understood. This study aimed at understanding the connections between maternal gut microbiota and the neonatal blood metabolome in GDM. 1H-NMR-based untargeted metabolomics was performed on maternal fecal samples and targeted metabolomics on the matched neonatal dry blood spots from a cohort of 40 pregnant women, including 22 with GDM and 18 controls. Multi-omic association methods (including Co-Inertia Analysis and Procrustes Analysis) were applied to investigate the relationship between maternal fecal metabolome and the neonatal blood metabolome. Both maternal fecal metabolome and the matched neonatal blood metabolome could be separated along the vector of maternal hyperglycemia. A close relationship between the maternal and neonatal metabolomes was observed by multi-omic association approaches. Twelve out of thirty-two maternal fecal metabolites with altered abundances from 872 1H- NMR features (Bonferroni-adjusted P < 0.05) in women with GDM and the controls were identified, among which 8 metabolites contribute (P < 0.05 in a 999-step permutation test) to the close connection between maternal and the neonatal metabolomes in GDM. Four of these eight maternal fecal metabolites, including lysine, putrescine, guanidinoacetate, and hexadecanedioate, were negatively associated (Spearman rank correlation, coefficient value < −0.6, P < 0.05) with maternal hyperglycemia. Biotin metabolism was enriched (Bonferroni-adjusted P < 0.05 in the hypergeometric test) with the four-hyperglycemia associated fecal metabolites. The results of this study suggested that maternal fecal metabolites contribute to the connections between maternal fecal metabolome and the neonatal blood metabolome and may further affect the risk of IEMs.",2020 Feb 27,Integrated metabolome analysis reveals novel connections between maternal fecal metabolome and the neonatal blood metabolome in women with gestational diabetes mellitus,Scientific Reports
278,PMC4161373,"Wolfram syndrome (WFS) is a recessive neurologic and endocrinologic degenerative disorder, and is also known as DIDMOAD (Diabetes Insipidus, early-onset Diabetes Mellitus, progressive Optic Atrophy and Deafness) syndrome. Most affected individuals carry recessive mutations in the Wolfram syndrome 1 gene (WFS1). However, the phenotypic pleiomorphism, rarity and molecular complexity of this disease complicate our efforts to understand WFS. To address this limitation, we aimed to describe complications and to elucidate the contributions of WFS1 mutations to clinical manifestations in Japanese patients with WFS.
The minimal ascertainment criterion for diagnosing WFS was having both early onset diabetes mellitus and bilateral optic atrophy. Genetic analysis for WFS1 was performed by direct sequencing.
Sixty-seven patients were identified nationally for a prevalence of one per 710,000, with 33 patients (49%) having all 4 components of DIDMOAD. In 40 subjects who agreed to participate in this investigation from 30 unrelated families, the earliest manifestation was DM at a median age of 8.7 years, followed by OA at a median age of 15.8 years. However, either OA or DI was the first diagnosed feature in 6 subjects. In 10, features other than DM predated OA. Twenty-seven patients (67.5%) had a broad spectrum of recessive mutations in WFS1. Two patients had mutations in only one allele. Eleven patients (27.5%) had intact WFS1 alleles. Ages at onset of both DM and OA in patients with recessive WFS1 mutations were indistinguishable from those in patients without WFS1 mutations. In the patients with predicted complete loss-of-function mutations, ages at the onsets of both DM and OA were significantly earlier than those in patients with predicted partial-loss-of function mutations.
This study emphasizes the clinical and genetic heterogeneity in patients with WFS.

Decreased production and/or loss of function of EPCs are associated with diabetic vasculopathy. The molecular mechanisms by which diabetes impairs EPCs remain unclear. We conducted microarray experiments followed by integrative regulatory analysis on cells isolated from Akita diabetic mice (18-weeks after onset of diabetes) and age-matched non-diabetic controls. Two types of cells were isolated from mice bone marrow; Lin+ cells and Lin-/VEGF-R2+ EPCs. RNA was hybridized to mouse WG-6 V2 beadchips followed by comprehensive gene network analysis and computational validation of the obtained results. In total, 80 genes were exclusively DE between non-diabetic Lin-/VEGF-R2+ EPCs and diabetic Lin-/VEGF-R2+ EPCs, of which the 3 genes Clcnka, Pik3c2a, and Ptf1a are known to be associated with diabetic complications. Further analysis led to the establishment of a TF-miRNA mediated regulatory network specific to diabetic Lin-/VEGF-R2+ EPCs and to identify 11 central-hub TFs (Tbp, Ahr, Trp53, Gata1, Foxo1, Foxo4, Yy1, Max, Pparg, Myc, Cebpa), and 2 miRNAs (mir-139-5p, mir-709) that might act as putative genomic drivers of diabetic pathogenesis in Lin-/VEGF-R2+ EPCs. Moreover, we identified multiple TF-miRNA co-regulatory network motifs for which we validated their contribution to diabetic Lin-/VEGF-R2+ EPCs in terms of statistical significance and relevance to biological evidence. Our findings suggest that diabetic Lin-/VEGF-R2+ EPCs have specifically altered signature genes and miRNAs that render their capacity to proliferate and differentiate.",2018 Jul 11,Identification of novel diabetes impaired miRNA-transcription factor co-regulatory networks in bone marrow-derived Lin-/VEGF-R2+ endothelial progenitor cells,PLoS ONE

CDI is treated with desmopressin (DDAVP). Rarely reported in the literature, opioids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) can induce hyponatremia in individuals treated for CDI.
A 10-year-old boy with septo-optic dysplasia and CDI was treated with DDAVP 1.6 mg orally TID maintaining normal sodium levels. Post admission for a femur fracture, he was discharged on ibuprofen and hydromorphone. Sodium was 136 mmol/l two days before discharge.
He returned to the ED after having a seizure at home. He was euvolemic and mildly lethargic. Sodium was low at 108 mmol/l. DDAVP and hydromorphone were held and he was fluid restricted, but the sodium remained low. Sodium began to rise when Ibuprofen was stopped. Intermittent small doses of DDAVP were given to facilitate gradual correction of hyponatremia. At discharge, sodium had normalized.
Hyponatremia has occasionally been described as a side effect of opioids and rarely of NSAIDs in patients with CDI. Stimulation of the thirst centre may play a role with opioids while a decrease in urine output may be the mechanism with NSAIDs.

However, the effect of habitual dietary intake on gut dysbiosis in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus has not yet been explicated. This study investigated whether alteration of the gut microbiota was influenced by dietary intake of sucrose in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
In this cross‐sectional study, 97 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and 97 healthy individuals were matched by age and sex, and then, fecal samples were obtained. Next‐generation sequencing of the 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid gene was carried out, and functional profiles for the gut microbiota were analyzed. We selected the top 30 gut microbial genera and top 20 functional profiles for the gut microbiota specified by the weighted average difference method. The association between gut microbial genera or functional profiles and habitual dietary intake was investigated by Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient, and then, clustering analysis was carried out to clarify the impact of habitual dietary intake.
The Actinobacteria phylum was highly abundant in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whereas the Bacteroidetes phylum was less abundant. Diabetic‐type gut microbes, specifically Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium, were altered by sucrose intake at the genus level. Furthermore, sucrose intake was associated with glycolysis/gluconeogenesis in the diabetic‐type functional profiles of the gut microbiota.
The gut microbiota and functional profiles for the gut microbiota in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were significantly different from those in healthy individuals. Furthermore, we showed that sucrose intake was closely associated with these differences.

Patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) have a higher mortality rate than non-DM patients if they get COVID-19. Recent studies have indicated that patients with a history of diabetes can increase the risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. Additionally, patients without any history of diabetes can acquire new-onset DM when infected with COVID-19. Thus, there is a need to explore the bidirectional link between these two conditions, confirming the vicious loop between “DM/COVID-19”. This narrative review presents (1) the bidirectional association between the DM and COVID-19, (2) the manifestations of the DM/COVID-19 loop leading to cardiovascular disease, (3) an understanding of primary and secondary factors that influence mortality due to the DM/COVID-19 loop, (4) the role of vitamin-D in DM patients during COVID-19, and finally, (5) the monitoring tools for tracking atherosclerosis burden in DM patients during COVID-19 and “COVID-triggered DM” patients.

There was a significant increase in the levels of transforming growth factor β (TGFβ1) and TGFβ2 and decrease in programmed death-1 (PD-1), PD ligand 1 (PD-L1), pro-inflammatory cytokines, and anti-inflammatory cytokines in type 1 diabetes patients compared with the NGT subjects (all P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in C-reactive protein (CRP) and blood routine indicators between the two groups. Type 1 diabetes was further divided into T1ADM and FT1DM subgroups. FT1DM patients had much higher CRP levels than T1ADM patients (4.90 [0.95–26.05] mg/L vs 0.39 [0.20–0.74] mg/L, P < 0.01). Blood routine results showed that the number of leukocytes was significantly increased in FT1DM compared with that in T1ADM (9.2 [5.1–18.8] × 109 cells/L vs 5.4 [4.5–6.7] × 109 cells/L, P < 0.01). In FT1DM patients, neutrophil% was increased, and lymphocyte% was declined significantly, compared with that in T1ADM patients (neutrophil%: 80.2 [59.2–85.2]% vs 59.5 [54.8–64.0]%; lymphocyte%: 18.3 [10.1–32.3]% vs 32.6 [26.8–35.9]%; both P < 0.01). However, there was no difference between FT1DM and T1ADM in cytokine profile except for the decrease in CTLA-4 in T1ADM (P < 0.05).
Compared with T1ADM, CRP and leukocytes’ levels were increased significantly in FT1DM, with an increase in neutrophil% and decline in lymphocyte%, suggesting that FT1DM may have more abrupt onset and occur as a more serious subtype of type 1 diabetes mellitus.",2021 Nov 30,Classic Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus and Fulminant Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus: Similarity and Discrepancy of Immunological Characteristics and Cytokine Profile,"Diabetes, Metabolic Syndrome and Obesity: Targets and Therapy"
289,PMC8493412,"The risk of major amputation is higher after urgently planned endovascular therapy for chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). The aim of this nationwide cohort study was to compare outcomes between patients with and without DM following urgently planned open revascularization for CLTI from 2010 to 2014. Out of 1537 individuals registered in the Swedish Vascular Registry, 569 were registered in the National Diabetes Register. A propensity score adjusted Cox regression analysis was conducted to compare outcome between the groups with and without DM. Median follow-up was 4.3 years and 4.5 years for patients with and without DM, respectively. Patients with DM more often had foot ulcers (p = 0.034) and had undergone more previous amputations (p = 0.001) at baseline. No differences in mortality, cardiovascular death, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), or major amputation were observed between groups. The incidence rate of stroke was 70% higher (95% CI: 1.11–2.59; p = 0.0137) and the incidence rate of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) 39% higher (95% CI: 1.00–1.92; p = 0.0472) among patients with DM in comparison to those without. Open vascular surgery remains a first-line option for a substantial number of patients with CLTI, especially for limb salvage in patients with DM. The higher incidence rates of stroke and AMI among patients with DM following open vascular surgery for infrainguinal CLTI require specific consideration preoperatively with the aim of optimizing medical treatment to improve cardiovascular outcome postoperatively.",2021 May 18,Diabetes mellitus was not associated with lower amputation-free survival after open revascularization for chronic limb-threatening ischemia – A nationwide propensity score adjusted analysis,"Vascular Medicine (London, England)"
290,PMC4673622,"Antidiuretic hormone or arginine vasopressin (AVP) increases water reabsorption in the collecting ducts of the kidney. Three decades ago, experimental models have shown that AVP may increase calcium reabsorption in rat kidney. The objective of this study was to assess whether AVP modulates renal calcium excretion in humans. We analyzed calcium, potassium, and sodium fractional excretion in eight patients affected by insipidus diabetes (nephrogenic or central) under acute vasopressin receptor agonist action and in 10 patients undergoing oral water load test affected or not by inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). Synthetic V2 receptor agonist (dDAVP) reduced significantly calcium fractional excretion from 1.71% to 0.58% (P < 0.05) in patients with central diabetes insipidus. In patients with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (resistant to AVP), calcium fractional excretion did not change significantly after injection (0.48–0.68%, P = NS). In normal subjects undergoing oral water load test, calcium fractional excretion increased significantly from 1.02% to 2.54% (P < 0.05). Patients affected by SIADH had a high calcium fractional excretion at baseline that remained stable during test from 3.30% to 3.33% (P = NS), possibly resulting from a reduced calcium absorption in renal proximal tubule. In both groups, there was a significant correlation between urine output and calcium renal excretion. In humans, dDAVP decreases calcium fractional excretion in the short term. Conversely, water intake, which lowers AVP concentration, increases calcium fractional excretion. The correlation between urine output and calcium excretion suggests that AVP-related antidiuresis increases calcium reabsorption in collecting ducts.",2015 Nov 30,Vasopressin regulates renal calcium excretion in humans,Physiological Reports

DEPICT‐1 and ‐2 were randomized, double‐blind, parallel‐group, 24‐week studies, with 28‐week extension periods. Adults with T1D and HbA1c 7.5%‐10.5% were randomized (1:1:1) to receive dapagliflozin 5 mg, 10 mg or placebo. The short‐ and long‐term efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin were examined in an exploratory pooled analysis of both studies.
Efficacy analyses included 530, 529 and 532 and safety analysis included 548, 566 and 532 patients in the dapagliflozin 5 mg, 10 mg and placebo groups, respectively. Baseline characteristics were similar between treatment groups. At week 24, reductions were seen with dapagliflozin 5 and 10 mg compared with placebo in HbA1c (−0.40%, −0.43% vs. 0.00%) and body weight (−2.45, −2.91 vs. 0.11 kg). HbA1c and body weight reductions versus placebo were also seen after 52 weeks of treatment. There was no imbalance in occurrence of severe hypoglycaemic events between groups. The proportion of patients experiencing definite diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) was higher with dapagliflozin 5 mg (4.0%) and 10 mg (3.5%) compared with placebo (1.1%) over 52 weeks; most events were of mild or moderate severity, and all resolved with treatment.
Over 52 weeks, dapagliflozin provided glycaemic and weight benefits, with no increased frequency of severe hypoglycaemia compared with placebo.

Because of the heterogeneity of clinical presentation, diagnosis is often challenging and delayed. Currently, Interferon alpha is the first line treatment that is associated with a better survival. The prognosis is relatively poor, especially in case of neurological and cardiovascular involvement. Herein, we report the case of a 64-year-old Tunisian female patient presenting an aggressive form of ECD revealed by diabetes insipidus and cerebellar ataxia with a diagnosis delay of 4 years. The assessment of disease extent had also shown associated asymptomatic cardiac and bone involvement. Pegylated Interferon alpha was started at high dose allowing disease stabilization.

293,PMC7992003,"Diabetes is a leading cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Despite numerous treatments for cardiovascular disease (CVD), for patients with diabetes, these therapies provide less benefit for protection from CVD. These considerations spur the concept that diabetes-specific, disease-modifying therapies are essential to identify especially as the diabetes epidemic continues to expand. In this context, high levels of blood glucose stimulate the flux via aldose reductase (AR) pathway leading to metabolic and signaling changes in cells of the cardiovascular system. In animal models flux via AR in hearts is increased by diabetes and ischemia and its inhibition protects diabetic and non-diabetic hearts from ischemia-reperfusion injury. In mouse models of diabetic atherosclerosis, human AR expression accelerates progression and impairs regression of atherosclerotic plaques. Genetic studies have revealed that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the ALD2 (human AR gene) is associated with diabetic complications, including cardiorenal complications. This Review presents current knowledge regarding the roles for AR in the causes and consequences of diabetic cardiovascular disease and the status of AR inhibitors in clinical trials. Studies from both human subjects and animal models are presented to highlight the breadth of evidence linking AR to the cardiovascular consequences of diabetes.",2021 Mar 11,Aldose Reductase: An Emerging Target for Development of Interventions for Diabetic Cardiovascular Complications,Frontiers in Endocrinology
294,PMC3429832,"Diabetes insipidus (DI) is characterized by excessive urination and thirst. This disease results from inadequate output of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) from the pituitary gland or the absence of the normal response to ADH in the kidney. We present a case of transient central DI in a patient who underwent a cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). A 44-yr-old male underwent a CABG operation. An hour after the operation, the patient developed polyuria and was diagnosed with central DI. The patient responded to desmopressin and completely recovered five days after surgery. It is probable that transient cerebral ischemia resulted in the dysfunction of osmotic receptors in the hypothalamus or hypothalamus-pituitary axis during CPB. It is also possible that cardiac standstill altered the left atrial non-osmotic receptor function and suppressed ADH release. Therefore, we suggest that central DI is a possible cause of polyuria after CPB.",2012 Aug 22,A Case of Transient Central Diabetes Insipidus after Aorto-Coronary Bypass Operation,Journal of Korean Medical Science
295,PMC7876560,"Hundreds of common genetic variants acting through distinguishable physiologic pathways influence the risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D). It is unknown to what extent the physiology underlying gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is distinct from that underlying T2D. In this study of >5,000 pregnant women from three cohorts, we aimed to identify physiologically related groups of maternal variants associated with GDM using two complementary approaches that were based on Bayesian nonnegative matrix factorization (bNMF) clustering. First, we tested five bNMF clusters of maternal T2D-associated variants grouped on the basis of physiology outside of pregnancy for association with GDM. We found that cluster polygenic scores representing genetic determinants of reduced β-cell function and abnormal hepatic lipid metabolism were associated with GDM; these clusters were not associated with infant birth weight. Second, we derived bNMF clusters of maternal variants on the basis of pregnancy physiology and tested these clusters for association with GDM. We identified a cluster that was strongly associated with GDM as well as associated with higher infant birth weight. The effect size for this cluster’s association with GDM appeared greater than that for T2D. Our findings imply that the genetic and physiologic pathways that lead to GDM differ, at least in part, from those that lead to T2D.",2020 Oct 13,Genetic Loci and Physiologic Pathways Involved in Gestational Diabetes Mellitus Implicated Through Clustering,Diabetes

297,PMC8169352,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus is closely linked to increased levels of free fatty acids (FFAs) in obese individuals, although which FFA is most associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus is unclear. This study aimed to identify the specific FFAs that best predict the occurrence of type 2 diabetes mellitus in obese individuals, and assess their potential application value.
Participants were divided into three groups: a normal weight group (n = 20), an obese group (n = 10) and a type 2 diabetes mellitus group (n = 10). FFAs in serum samples were determined by ultra‐high‐pressure liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry, and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis models were used to study the FFA profile among the three groups.
Compared with the normal weight group, 14 FFAs (C8:0/10:0/14:0/16:1/18:1/20:2/ 20:3 /20:4/ 20:5/ 22:6/7:0/9:0/11:0 and C13:0) were significantly increased in the obese group, and nine FFAs (C14:0, C18:1, C20:1, C 18:2, C20:2, C20:3, C18:3, C20:5 and C22:6) were significantly increased in the type 2 diabetes mellitus group. Subsequently, the Venn diagram results showed that six FFAs (C14:0, C18:1, C20:2, C20:3, C20:5 and C22:6) were significantly increased in both the obese and type 2 diabetes mellitus groups. Among these six, C22:6 was finally identified as an independent risk factor for type 2 diabetes mellitus, and had a great potential to predict the susceptibility to type 2 diabetes mellitus (area under the curve 0.803).
C22:6 can be an independent risk factor for type 2 diabetes mellitus, and it has a great potential to predict the susceptibility to type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Thus, the aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to summarize the existing evidence on the bidirectional prospective association between periodontal disease and diabetes mellitus by accounting for the risk of bias of the original studies. The literature search was conducted on the electronic data sources PubMed and Web of Science up to February 9th, 2021. We included observational studies, which investigated the prospective association between diabetes mellitus and periodontal disease or vice versa. The risk of bias of the primary studies was evaluated by applying the Quality in Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) tool. Random effects models were used to calculate summary relative risk (SRR) with 95% CI. Subgroup analyses were applied to investigate heterogeneity and the robustness of the finding. In total, 15 studies were included . The SRR for incident diabetes mellitus was 1.26 (95% CI 1.12, 1.41; I2: 71%, n = 10; participants = 427,620; identified cases = 114,361), when comparing individuals with periodontitis to individuals without periodontitis. The SRR for incident periodontitis was 1.24 (95% CI 1.13, 1.37; I2: 92%, n = 7; participants = 295,804; identified cases: > 22,500), comparing individuals with diabetes to individuals without diabetes. There were no significant differences between subgroups after stratification for risk of bias. The findings show a positive bidirectional association between periodontal disease and diabetes mellitus, and thus, underline the need for screening of patients with periodontitis regarding diabetes mellitus and vice versa. The main limitation of the study is the high unexplained heterogeneity between the studies including the different assessment methods of the disease diagnosis.",2021 Jul 1,Bidirectional association between periodontal disease and diabetes mellitus: a systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies,Scientific Reports

It aims to evaluate the effect of a late first-trimester (>12 gestational weeks) degree of adherence to a MedDiet pattern—based on six food targets—on a composite of materno-foetal outcomes (CMFCs). The CMFCs were defined as having emergency C-section, perineal trauma, pregnancy-induced hypertension and preeclampsia, prematurity, large-for-gestational-age, and/or small-for-gestational-age. A total of 874 women were stratified into three groups according to late first-trimester compliance with six food targets: >12 servings/week of vegetables, >12 servings/week of fruits, <2 servings/week of juice, >3 servings/week of nuts, >6 days/week consumption of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), and ≥40 mL/day of EVOO. High adherence was defined as complying with 5–6 targets; moderate adherence 2–4 targets; low adherence 0–1 targets. There was a linear association between high, moderate, and low adherence, and a lower risk of GDM, CMFCs, urinary tract infections (UTI), prematurity, and small-for-gestational-age (SGA) newborns (all p < 0.05).

We aimed to investigate the association between serum prostate‐specific antigen concentrations and the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus in a cohort study of a Chinese population.
We designed a cohort study that comprised 16,811 initially non‐diabetic Chinese men who received annual health checkups between 2009 and 2016. The outcome of this study was type 2 diabetes mellitus, identified by medical diagnosis, self‐reportage, medication use, fasting glucose, 2‐h post oral glucose or glycated hemoglobin measurements. Cox proportional hazards models were carried out to evaluate the association.
During a median follow‐up period of 3.8 years (interquartile range 1.91–5.73 years), 1,260 participants developed incident type 2 diabetes mellitus. The multivariable model, adjusted for various potential confounders, showed that serum prostate‐specific antigen concentrations were inversely related to type 2 diabetes mellitus risk (P for trend = 0.014). Compared with the lowest quartile of serum prostate‐specific antigen, the hazard ratio and 95% confidence intervals of type 2 diabetes mellitus risk for quartile 2–4 were 0.84 (0.66–1.07), 0.75 (0.59–0.94) and 0.77 (0.62–0.96), respectively. Subgroup analyses suggested the inverse relationship was more prominent in overweight or obese participants (P for interaction = 0.013).
High serum prostate‐specific antigen concentration was associated with a low risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus in Chinese men. Future studies are required to confirm these findings and investigate underlying mechanisms.
This cohort study investigated the association between serum prostate‐specific antigen level and the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus in a Chinese population.

As the prevalence of diabetes increases in all age groups worldwide, diabetes and its complications cause an emerging public health burden. NLRP3 inflammasome is a complex of several proteins that play a critical role in inflammatory response and various diseases, including diabetes and its complications. Accumulating evidences indicate that NLRP3 inflammasome contributes to the development of diabetes and diabetic complications and that NLRP3 inflammation inactivation is beneficial in treating these illnesses. Emerging evidences suggest the critical role of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in regulating NLRP3 inflammasome activity in various diseases. LncRNAs are non-coding RNAs exceeding 200 nucleotides in length. Its dysregulation has been linked to the development of diseases, including diabetes.

307,PMC7395898,"In light of the most challenging public health crisis of modern history, COVID-19 mortality continues to rise at an alarming rate. Patients with co-morbidities such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes mellitus (DM) seem to be more prone to severe symptoms and appear to have a higher mortality rate. In this review, we elucidate suggested mechanisms underlying the increased susceptibility of patients with diabetes to infection with SARS-CoV-2 with a more severe COVID-19 disease. The worsened prognosis of COVID-19 patients with DM can be attributed to a facilitated viral uptake assisted by the host’s receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). It can also be associated with a higher basal level of pro-inflammatory cytokines present in patients with diabetes, which enables a hyperinflammatory “cytokine storm” in response to the virus. This review also suggests a link between elevated levels of IL-6 and AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway and their role in exacerbating diabetes-induced complications and insulin resistance. If further studied, these findings could help identify novel therapeutic intervention strategies for patients with diabetes comorbid with COVID-19.",2020 Aug 2,COVID-19 and diabetes mellitus: how one pandemic worsens the other,Reviews in Endocrine & Metabolic Disorders

The outcome was the development of new-onset diabetes mellitus at 1 to 12 months after partial pancreatectomy. We used a logistic regression model and calculated the scores of each predictor. To determine test performance, we assessed discrimination ability using the receiver operating characteristic curve and calibration with a calibration plot and the Hosmer-Lemeshow test. We also performed internal validation using the bootstrap method. Of 681 patients, 125 (18.4%) had new-onset diabetes mellitus after partial pancreatectomy. The developed prediction model had a possible range of 0 to 46 points. The median score was 13, and the interquartile range was 9 to 22. The C-statistics of the receiver operating characteristic curve on the score to predict the outcome was .70 (95% confidence interval [CI], .65–.75). Regarding the test performance, the Hosmer-Lemeshow test was not significant (P = .17), and calibration was good. In the bootstrapped cohorts, the C-statistics was .69 (95% CI, .62–.76). We developed a preoperative prediction model for new-onset diabetes mellitus after partial pancreatectomy. This would provide important information for surgeons and patients when deciding whether to perform partial pancreatectomy.",2021 Jun 18,Development of a preoperative prediction model for new-onset diabetes mellitus after partial pancreatectomy: A retrospective cohort study,Medicine
309,PMC7315067,Neonatal diabetes is a rare cause of hyperglycemia in the neonatal period. It is caused by mutations in genes that encode proteins playing critical roles in normal functions of pancreatic beta cells. Neonatal diabetes is divided into temporary and permanent subtypes. Treatment is based on the correction of fluid-electrolyte disturbances and hyperglycemia. Patients respond to insulin or sulfonylurea treatment according to the mutation type. Close glucose monitoring and education of caregivers about diabetes are vital.,2018 Jun 7,Neonatal Diabetes Mellitus,The Medical Bulletin of Sisli Etfal Hospital
310,PMC7066728,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) comprises the vast majority of all diabetes cases in adults, with alarmingly increasing prevalence over the past few decades worldwide. A particularly heavy healthcare burden of diabetes is noted in Europe, where 8.8% of the population aged 20–79 years is estimated to have diabetes according to the International Diabetes Federation. Multiple risk factors are implicated in the pathogenesis of T2DM with complex underlying interplay and intricate gene-environment interactions. Thus, intense research has been focused on studying the role of T2DM risk factors and on identifying vulnerable groups for T2DM in the general population which can then be targeted for prevention interventions.
For this narrative review, we conducted a comprehensive search of the existing literature on T2DM risk factors, focusing on studies in adult cohorts from European countries which were published in English after January 2000.
Multiple lifestyle-related and sociodemographic factors were identified as related to high T2DM risk, including age, ethnicity, family history, low socioeconomic status, obesity, metabolic syndrome and each of its components, as well as certain unhealthy lifestyle behaviors. As Europe has an increasingly aging population, multiple migrant and ethnic minority groups and significant socioeconomic diversity both within and across different countries, this review focuses not only on modifiable T2DM risk factors, but also on the impact of pertinent demographic and socioeconomic factors.
In addition to other T2DM risk factors, low socioeconomic status can significantly increase the risk for prediabetes and T2DM, but is often overlooked. In multinational and multicultural regions such as Europe, a holistic approach, which will take into account both traditional and socioeconomic/socioecological factors, is becoming increasingly crucial in order to implement multidimensional public health programs and integrated community-based interventions for effective T2DM prevention.",2020 Mar 12,Sociodemographic and lifestyle-related risk factors for identifying vulnerable groups for type 2 diabetes: a narrative review with emphasis on data from Europe,BMC Endocrine Disorders
311,PMC7262667,"Individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have an increased risk of bone fragility fractures compared to nondiabetic subjects. This increased fracture risk may occur despite normal or even increased values of bone mineral density (BMD), and poor bone quality is suggested to contribute to skeletal fragility in this population. These concepts explain why the only evaluation of BMD could not be considered an adequate tool for evaluating the risk of fracture in the individual T2DM patient. Unfortunately, nowadays, the bone quality could not be reliably evaluated in the routine clinical practice. On the other hand, getting further insight on the pathogenesis of T2DM-related bone fragility could consent to ameliorate both the detection of the patients at risk for fracture and their appropriate treatment. The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the increased risk of fragility fractures in a T2DM population are complex. Indeed, in T2DM, bone health is negatively affected by several factors, such as inflammatory cytokines, muscle-derived hormones, incretins, hydrogen sulfide (H2S) production and cortisol secretion, peripheral activation, and sensitivity. All these factors may alter bone formation and resorption, collagen formation, and bone marrow adiposity, ultimately leading to reduced bone strength. Additional factors such as hypoglycemia and the consequent increased propensity for falls and the direct effects on bone and mineral metabolism of certain antidiabetic medications may contribute to the increased fracture risk in this population. The purpose of this review is to summarize the literature evidence that faces the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying bone fragility in T2DM patients.",2020 May 22,Pathophysiology and Management of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Bone Fragility,Journal of Diabetes Research
312,PMC7447663,"Our study aimed to map endocrine toxicity spectrum of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs).
We obtained data from VigiBase, between January 1, 2011 and March 6, 2019. All endocrine adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were classified by group queries according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities. Disproportionality analysis was performed with information component (IC) and reporting odds ratio (ROR). We used IC to identify meaningful endocrinopathies associated with ICIs and ROR to compare differences between ICI subgroups of ADRs. IC025 (lower end of the 95% confidence interval of IC) is considered significant if larger than 0.
In all, 6089 reports for endocrinopathies associated with ICIs were involved, with a male to female ratio of 1.5:1. The disproportionality analysis indicated significance of not only common endocrinopathies: thyroid dysfunction, hypophysitis/hypopituitarism, adrenal insufficiency, T1DM, fulminant T1DM (IC025: 4.12–6.62), but also rare endocrinopathies: hypoparathyroidism, diabetes insipidus, hypogonadism (IC025: 1.56–2.04). Increased risk of ADR reporting emerged in anti-CTLA-4 (e.g., hypophysitis/hypopituitarism, adrenal insufficiency) or in anti-PD-1/PD-L1 (e.g., thyroid dysfunction, T1DM, fulminant T1DM). In general, combination therapy (anti-CTLA-4 plus anti-PD-1/PD-L1) had a stronger association with endocrinopathies than monotherapy (ROR: 2.8, 95% CI: 2.5–3.1). Onset time of common endocrinopathies differed between different ICI therapies, typically within 12 weeks in anti-CTLA-4 monotherapy but diffusely ranging from 0 to 48 weeks in anti-PD-1 monotherapy.
Our study shows rising reporting frequencies of endocrinopathies caused by ICIs, especially aggravated in combination therapy. Clinicians should be early aware of latent endocrine toxicity and different onset time of endocrinopathies when implementing ICI therapies.",2020 Jun 7,"Mapping endocrine toxicity spectrum of immune checkpoint inhibitors: a disproportionality analysis using the WHO adverse drug reaction database, VigiBase",Endocrine
313,PMC4933982,"IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is a rare but increasingly recognised condition, emerging as a clinical entity following the observation of the associations of autoimmune pancreatitis. IgG4-RD is characterised by extensive infiltration of IgG4-positive plasma cells into multiple organs and raised serum IgG4 levels. Clinical manifestations of IgG4 disease classically include autoimmune pancreatitis, lacrimal or salivary gland infiltration (formerly known as Mikulicz disease) and retroperitoneal fibrosis. More rarely, IgG4 disease can cause pituitary hypophysitis. Although most frequently described in middle-aged males, the epidemiology and pathogenesis of the disease remain largely undefined. Nevertheless, an understanding of the wide variety of clinical manifestations of this multi-system condition is undeniably important given the often excellent outcomes following treatment. We describe an unusual presentation of IgG4 disease with isolated diabetes insipidus secondary to pituitary hypophysitis. The patient in question subsequently developed chest pain secondary to mediastinal lymphadenopathy and tubulo-interstitial nephritis leading to renal dysfunction. He was successfully treated with oral steroids and had regular follow-up, and remains well at follow-up 2 years later.
IgG4 disease, although rare, is increasing in prevalence largely due to increased recognition of its clinical manifestations, including autoimmune pancreatitis, lacrimal or salivary gland infiltration, retroperitoneal fibrosis and, more rarely, lymphocytic hypophysitis presenting as diabetes insipidus.
IgG4 disease is highly treatable, and symptoms may show complete resolution with administration of steroids, highlighting the importance of correct and timely diagnosis.
Causes of lymphocytic hypophysitis are varied and not distinguishable radiologically. Given the difficulty in biopsying the pituitary, careful attention must be paid to the systemic clinical presentation to provide clues as to the underlying disorder.",2016 Jul 6,IgG4-related hypophysitis presenting as diabetes insipidus with tubulo-interstital nephritis and mediastinal lymphadenopathy,"Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism Case Reports"
314,PMC8824792,"Previous guidelines for the treatment of people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) have relied heavily upon rigid algorithms for the sequential addition of pharmacotherapies to achieve target glycemic control. More recent guidelines advocate a personalized approach for diabetes treatment, to improve patient satisfaction, quality of life, medication adherence and overall health outcomes. Clinicians should work with patients to develop personalized goals for their treatment, including targeted glycemic control, weight management, prevention and treatment of associated comorbidities and avoidance of complications such as hypoglycemia. Factors that affect the intensity of treatment and choice of pharmacotherapy should include medical and patient influences. Medical considerations include the diabetes phenotype, biomarkers including genetic tests, and the presence of comorbidities such as cardiovascular, renal, or hepatic disease. Patient factors include their treatment preference, age and life expectancy, diabetes duration, hypoglycemia fear and unawareness, psychological and social circumstances. The use of a personalized approach in the management of people with T2D can reduce the cost and failure associated with the algorithmic “one-size-fits-all” approach, to anticipate disease progression, improve the response to diabetes pharmacotherapy and reduce the incidence of diabetes-associated complications. Ultimately, the use of personalized medicine in people with T2D should improve medication adherence, patient satisfaction and quality of life to reduce diabetes distress and improve physical health outcomes.",2022 Feb 4,Personalized Type 2 Diabetes Management: An Update on Recent Advances and Recommendations,"Diabetes, Metabolic Syndrome and Obesity: Targets and Therapy"

A population-based cohort study was conducted using the database of Taiwan National Health Insurance Program. There were 27,369 subjects aged 20 to 84 years with newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus from 2000 to 2012 as the diabetes mellitus group and 107,705 sex- and age-matched subjects without diabetes mellitus as the nondiabetes mellitus group. The incidence of herpes zoster at the end of 2013 was estimated. The multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to calculate the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of herpes zoster associated with diabetes mellitus.
The overall incidence of herpes zoster was 1.16-fold higher in the diabetes mellitus group than the nondiabetes mellitus group (7.85 vs 6.75 per 1000 person-years, 95% CI 1.12–1.20). After adjustment for co-variables, the adjusted HR of herpes zoster was 1.17 for subjects with diabetes mellitus (95% CI 1.10–1.23), compared with subjects without diabetes mellitus.

The majority of documented cases are transient. To date, there are no documented cases of multiple pituitary hormone deficiencies. We present here a 6-year-old girl with growth hormone deficiency and permanent DI which developed as a complication of ETV. This patient is unique in both demonstrating multiple pituitary hormone deficiencies and the classical triphasic response of DI after ETV. We postulate that these complications were caused by compression of the pituitary stalk and hypothalamic injury during the procedure.

318,PMC8237858,"Diabetes mellitus can independently contribute to cardiovascular disease and represents a severe risk factor for premature development of cardiovascular disease. A three-fold higher mortality than the general population has been observed in type 1 diabetes mellitus whereas a two- to four-fold increased probability to develop cardiovascular disease has been observed in type 2 diabetes mellitus. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance, a non-radiative modality, is superior to all other modalities in detecting myocardial infarction. The main cardiovascular magnetic resonance sequences used include a) balanced steady-state free precession (bSSFP) for function evaluation; b) T2-W for oedema detection; c) T1 W for ischemia detection during adenosine stress; and d) late gadolinium enhanced T1-W images (LGE), evaluated 15 min after injection of paramagnetic contrast agent gadolinium, which permit the diagnosis of replacement fibrosis, which appears white in the middle of suppressed, nulled myocardium. Although LGE is the technique of choice for diagnosis of replacement fibrosis, it cannot assess diffuse myocardial fibrosis. The application of T1 mapping (native or pre contrast and post contrast) allows identification of diffuse myocardial fibrosis, which is not detectable my other means. Native T1 and Contrast-enhanced T1 mapping are involved in the extracellular volume fraction (ECV) calculation. Recently, 1H-cardiovascular magnetic resonance spectroscopy has been applied to calculate the amount of myocardial triglycerides, but at the moment it is not part of the routine assessment of diabetes mellitus. The multifaceted nature of cardiovascular magnetic resonance has the great potential of concurrent evaluation of function and myocardial ischemia/fibrosis in the same examination and represents an indispensable tool for accurate diagnosis of cardiovascular disease in diabetes mellitus.",2021 Jun 14,Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance as Pathophysiologic Tool in Diabetes Mellitus,Frontiers in Endocrinology

320,PMC8385006,"Treatment-related quality of life (QOL) is an important aspect of diabetes management. We evaluated the influence of a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, tofogliflozin, on treatment-related QOL in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
This is the prespecified subanalysis study of the “Using TOfogliflozin for Possible better Intervention against Atherosclerosis for type 2 diabetes patients (UTOPIA)” trial. Treatment-related QOL was evaluated at baseline, week 26, week 52, and week 104 after the initiation of the study using the Diabetes Therapy-Related QOL questionnaire (DTR-QOL). Among the 340 patients in the original UTOPIA study, a total of 252 patients (127, tofogliflozin group; 125, conventional treatment group) who completed the DTR-QOL questionnaire at baseline were the study subjects of the current subanalysis.
The tofogliflozin and conventional treatment groups exhibited almost comparable baseline clinical characteristics, while the use of antihypertensive drugs and lipid-lowering agents was significantly lower in the tofogliflozin treatment group than in the conventional treatment group. Tofogliflozin treatment increased the total score of DTR-QOL7 from baseline (P < 0.001), while conventional treatment did not change it. There were statistically significant differences in delta change in the total DTR-QOL7 score and DTR-QOL7 Q4, Q5, Q6, and Q7 scores from the baseline to week 104 between the treatment groups. Delta changes in HbA1c (Spearman’s correlation coefficient, ρ =  − 0.30, P < 0.001), fasting blood glucose (ρ =  − 0.16, P = 0.031), BMI (ρ =  − 0.19, P = 0.008), and waist circumference (ρ =  − 0.17, P = 0.024) at week 104 were negatively associated with delta change in the total QOL7 score.
Our data indicated that tofogliflozin treatment improved treatment-related QOL compared to conventional treatment in Japanese patients with T2DM, in accordance with the improvement of major cardiovascular risk factors.

324,PMC6011271,"With the rise in pre-mature mortality rate from non-communicable disease (NCD), there is a need for evidence-based interventions. We evaluated existing systematic reviews on effectiveness of integration of healthcare services, in particular with focus on delivery of care designed to improve health and process outcomes in people with multi-morbidity, where at least one of the conditions was diabetes or hypertension.
We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Health Evidence to November 8, 2016 and consulted experts. One review author screened titles, abstracts and two review authors independently screened short listed full-texts and selected reviews for inclusion. We considered systematic reviews evaluating integration of care, compared to usual care, for people with multi-morbidity. One review author extracted data and another author verified it. Two review authors independently evaluated risk of bias using ROBIS and AMSTAR. Inter-rater reliability was analysed for ROBIS and AMSTAR using Cohen’s kappa and percent agreement. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) checklist was used to assess reporting.
We identified five systematic reviews on integration of care. Four reviews focused on comorbid diabetes and depression and two covered hypertension and comorbidities of cardiovascular disease, depression, or diabetes. Interventions were poorly described. The health outcomes evaluated included risk of all-cause mortality, measures of depression, cholesterol levels, HbA1c levels, effect of depression on HbA1c levels, symptom improvement, systolic blood pressure, and hypertension control. Process outcomes included access and utilisation of healthcare services, costs, and quality of care. Overall, three reviews had a low and medium risk of bias according to ROBIS and AMSTAR respectively, while two reviews had high risk of bias as judged by both ROBIS and AMSTAR. Findings have demonstrated that collaborative care in general resulted in better health and process outcomes when compared to usual care for both depression and diabetes and hypertension and diabetes.
Several knowledge gaps were identified on integration of care for comorbidities with diabetes and/or hypertension: limited research on this topic for hypertension, limited reviews that included primary studies based in low-middle income countries, and limited reviews on collaborative care for communicable and NCDs.

We conducted a systematic review and meta‐analysis of observational cohort and nested case‐control cohort studies assessing the association between rising HbA1c levels and stroke risk in adults (≥18 years old) with and without type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus. Random‐effects model meta‐analyses were used to calculate pooled adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and their precision. The systematic review yielded 36 articles, of which 29 articles (comprising n=532 779 participants) were included in our meta‐analysis. Compared to non–diabetes mellitus range HbA1c (<5.7%), diabetes mellitus range HbA1c (≥6.5%) was associated with an increased risk of first‐ever stroke with average HR (95% confidence interval) of 2.15 (1.76, 2.63), whereas pre–diabetes mellitus range HbA1c (5.7–6.5%) was not (average HR [95% confidence interval], 1.19 [0.87, 1.62]). For every 1% HbA1c increment (or equivalent), the average HR (95% confidence interval) for first‐ever stroke was 1.12 (0.91, 1.39) in non–diabetes mellitus cohorts and 1.17 (1.09, 1.25) in diabetes mellitus cohorts.

This study used data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 2016 to 2018, and the percentage and total number of people ≥30 years of age with diabetes and impaired fasting glucose (IFG) were estimated.
In 2018, 13.8% of Korean adults aged ≥30 years had diabetes, and adults aged ≥65 years showed a prevalence rate of 28%. The prevalence of IFG was 26.9% in adults aged ≥30 years. From 2016 to 2018, 35% of the subjects with diabetes were not aware of their condition. Regarding comorbidities, 53.2% and 61.3% were obese and hypertensive, respectively, and 72% had hypercholesterolemia as defined by low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) ≥100 mg/dL in people with diabetes. Of the subjects with diabetes, 43.7% had both hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. With regard to glycemic control, only 28.3% reached the target level of <6.5%. Moreover, only 11.5% of subjects with diabetes met all three targets of glycosylated hemoglobin, blood pressure, and LDL-C. The percentage of energy intake from carbohydrates was higher in diabetes patients than in those without diabetes, while that from protein and fat was lower in subjects with diabetes.
The high prevalence and low control rate of diabetes and its comorbidities in Korean adults were confirmed. More stringent efforts are needed to improve the comprehensive management of diabetes to reduce diabetes-related morbidity and mortality.",2021 Jan 13,"Diabetes Fact Sheets in Korea, 2020: An Appraisal of Current Status",Diabetes & Metabolism Journal

Diabetes mellitus involves vascular inflammatory processes and is a main contributor to cardiovascular mortality. Notably, heightened levels of circulating tissue factor (TF) account for the increased thrombogenicity and put those patients at risk for thromboembolic events. Here, we sought to investigate the role of micro-RNA (miR)–driven TF expression and thrombogenicity in diabetes mellitus.
Plasma samples of patients with diabetes mellitus were analyzed for TF protein and activity as well as miR-126 expression before and after optimization of the antidiabetic treatment. We found low miR-126 levels to be associated with markedly increased TF protein and TF-mediated thrombogenicity. Reduced miR-126 expression was accompanied by increased vascular inflammation as evident from the levels of vascular adhesion molecule-1 and fibrinogen, as well as leukocyte counts. With optimization of the antidiabetic treatment miR-126 levels increased and thrombogenicity was reduced. Using a luciferase reporter system, we demonstrated miR-126 to directly bind to the F3-3′-untranslated region, thereby reducing TF expression both on mRNA and on protein levels in human microvascular endothelial cells as well as TF mRNA and activity in monocytes.
Circulating miR-126 exhibits antithrombotic properties via regulating post-transcriptional TF expression, thereby impacting the hemostatic balance of the vasculature in diabetes mellitus.",2016 May 25,Micro–RNA-126 Reduces the Blood Thrombogenicity in Diabetes Mellitus via Targeting of Tissue Factor,"Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology"
332,PMC7644661,"Physician adherence, or lack therefore, to diabetes care and follow-up guidelines may be linked to the rates of achieving suboptimal glycaemic, blood pressure and lipid targets in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In this cross-sectional study we evaluated physician adherence to the patient follow-up protocol (PFP) of the 2017 Hellenic Diabetes Association (HDA) guidelines and also assessed glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), blood pressure and lipid control achievement rates in the routine care setting in Greece.
Eligible subjects were adults with T2DM receiving oral hypoglycaemic agents (OHAs) for ≥ 1 year who had ≥ 2 HbA1c measurements in the previous year and an HbA1c target < 7%. Overall adherence at the subject level was defined as the percentage of the 62 HDA PFP items that had been met during the past year.
Between June and December 2018, 601 eligible subjects (54.6% men; mean age 65.2 years; median T2DM duration 5.9 years, of whom 96.5% had ≥ 1 medical condition/comorbidity), were enrolled into the study by 53 hospital- and office-based endocrinologists, internists and general practitioners. The main OHAs prescribed at enrolment were metformin (91.0%), dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (60.7%), sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (23.5%) and sulphonylureas (16.3%). Mean overall physician adherence to the PFP was 43.6%. Predictors of greater higher physicans’ adherence were female sex (p = 0.026), > 3 medical conditions/comorbidities (p = 0.043) and diabetic complications (p < 0.001). HbA1c, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, systolic/diastolic blood pressure and composite metabolic targets were achieved by 82.1, 57.0, 42.6 and 21.6% of subjects, respectively.
In Greek routine care, physician adherence to the PFP of the 2017 HDA guidelines is suboptimal. Future efforts should focus on identifying the barriers to an adequate adherence by physicians to the full PFP, with the aim to provide optimal patient care.

333,PMC8140905,"The year 2020 witnessed a largely unprecedented pandemic of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by SARS COV-2. Many people with COVID-19 have comorbidities, including diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular diseases, which are significantly associated with worse outcomes. Moreover, COVID-19 itself is allied with deteriorating hyperglycemia. Therefore, Bangladesh Endocrine Society has formulated some practical recommendations for management of diabetes and other endocrine diseases in patients with COVID-19 for use in both primary and specialist care settings.
The objective of the article is to develop a guideline to protect the vulnerable group with utmost preference – the elderly and those with comorbid conditions. Therefore, to ensure the adequate protective measures and timely treatment for COVID-19 patients with diabetes, other endocrine diseases or any other comorbidities.
The risk of a fatal outcome from COVID-19 may be up to 50% higher in patients with diabetes than in non-diabetics.
Patients with diabetes and COVID had CFR 7.3–9.2%, compared with 0.9–1.4% in patients without comorbidities.
Diabetic ketoacidosis may be one of the causes of mortality in COVID-19.
There is wide fluctuation of blood glucose in these patients, probably due to irregular diet, reduced exercise, increased glucocorticoids secretion, and use of glucocorticoids.
HbA1c should be <7.0% for the majority of the patients, this target may be relaxed in appropriate clinical settings.
More emphasis should be given on day-to-day blood glucose levels. Hypoglycemia (<3.9 mmol/l) must be avoided.
Frequent monitoring of blood glucose is needed in critically ill patients.

Therefore, all healthcare personnel should make the best use of updated knowledge and skills to ensure adequate protective measures and timely treatment for COVID-19 patients with diabetes, other endocrine diseases or any other comorbidities.",2021 May 18,Bangladesh Endocrine Society (BES) Position Statement for Management of Diabetes and Other Endocrine Diseases in Patients with COVID-19,"Diabetes, Metabolic Syndrome and Obesity: Targets and Therapy"
334,PMC7006078,"In order to close existing information gaps on diabetes-related health perceptions, diabetes knowledge, and information-seeking behaviors among adults in Germany, a representative population-based survey targeting the German-speaking population 18 years and older with and without diabetes was conducted. The aim of the present work was to analyze the psychometric properties of the multi-item scales, applied in the survey in order to provide guidance for decisions on the use of these measurements for future research.
Based on data from participants who completed the final survey (N = 1479 with known diabetes; N = 2327 without known diabetes) reliability and unidimensionality of multi-item scales were tested using Cronbach’s Alpha and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA).
Psychometric properties and model fit varied across scales. Cronbach’s alpha values ranged from very good to unacceptable. Model fit indices suggested evidence of a single underlying factor in some but not all scales. Adequate reliability and at least mediocre model fit were found for diabetes distress and patient-provider-relationship in people with diabetes and for perceived level of information in individuals without diabetes. Scales revealing inacceptable reliability values or not suggesting unidimensionality were e.g. diabetes-related stigmatization in both individuals with and without diabetes, self-efficacy in individuals with diabetes, and perceived personal control in those without diabetes.
Based on results of the current study, some of the scales applied in the survey can be recommended for present and future analyses of the survey data and for future surveys (e.g. diabetes distress, patient-provider-relationship in people with diabetes). Other scales should be interpreted and used with caution (e.g. depressive symptoms in people with diabetes) while others should be reformulated, interpreted only as single items, or need further investigation (e.g. diabetes-related stigmatization in people with and without diabetes). Findings provide researchers the opportunity to evaluate diabetes-specific scales in population-based studies of adults with and without diabetes.",2020 Feb 6,Psychometric properties of a nationwide survey for adults with and without diabetes: the “disease knowledge and information needs – diabetes mellitus (2017)” survey,BMC Public Health

336,PMC5586443,"Although guidelines and performance measures exist for patients with diabetes mellitus, achievement of these metrics is not well known. The Diabetes Collaborative Registry® (DCR) was formed to understand the quality of diabetes mellitus care across the primary and specialty care continuum in the United States.
We assessed the frequency of achievement of 7 diabetes mellitus–related quality metrics and variability across the Diabetes Collaborative Registry® sites. Among 574 972 patients with diabetes mellitus from 259 US practices, median (interquartile range) achievement of the quality metrics across the practices was the following: (1) glycemic control: 19% (5–47); (2) blood pressure control: 80% (67–88); (3) angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers in patients with coronary artery disease: 62% (51–69); (4) nephropathy screening: 62% (53–71); (5) eye examination: 0.7% (0.0–79); (6) foot examination: 0.0% (0.0–2.3); and (7) tobacco screening/cessation counseling: 86% (80–94). In hierarchical, modified Poisson regression models, there was substantial variability in meeting these metrics across sites, particularly with documentation of glycemic control and eye and foot examinations. There was also notable variation across specialties, with endocrinology practices performing better on glycemic control and diabetes mellitus foot examinations and cardiology practices succeeding more in blood pressure control and use of angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers.
The Diabetes Collaborative Registry® was established to document and improve the quality of outpatient diabetes mellitus care. While target achievement of some metrics of cardiovascular risk modification was high, achievement of others was suboptimal and highly variable.

The synthesis of literature findings demonstrates almost comparable clinical evidence in terms of risk factors and complications, challenges presented in diagnosing GDM, and its disease management, given the similarities of the underlying population characteristics in Southeast Asia. Evidence suggests that a large proportion of GDM risk in women may be preventable by lifestyle modifications. However, the GDM burden across countries is expected to rise, given the heterogeneity in screening approaches and diagnostic criteria, mainly influenced by economic status.

338,PMC6147595,"Loss-of-function mutations of progranulin are associated with frontotemporal dementia in humans, and its deficiency in mice is a model for this disease but with normal life expectancy and mild cognitive decline on aging. The present study shows that aging progranulin deficient mice develop progressive polydipsia and polyuria under standard housing conditions starting at middle age (6-9 months). They showed high water licking behavior and doubling of the normal daily drinking volume, associated with increased daily urine output and a decrease of urine osmolality, all maintained during water restriction. Creatinine clearance, urine urea, urine albumin and glucose were normal. Hence, there were no signs of osmotic diuresis or overt renal disease, other than a concentrating defect. In line, the kidney morphology and histology revealed a 50% increase of the kidney weight, kidney enlargement, mild infiltrations of the medulla with pro-inflammatory cells, widening of tubules but no overt signs of a glomerular or tubular pathology. Plasma vasopressin levels were on average about 3-fold higher than normal levels, suggesting that the water loss resulted from unresponsiveness of the collecting tubules towards vasopressin, and indeed aquaporin-2 immunofluorescence in collecting tubules was diminished, whereas renal and hypothalamic vasopressin were increased, the latter in spite of substantial astrogliosis in the hypothalamus. The data suggest that progranulin deficiency causes nephrogenic diabetes insipidus in mice during aging. Possibly, polydipsia in affected patients - eventually interpreted as psychogenic polydipsia - may point to a similar concentrating defect.",2018 Oct 1,Progranulin Deficient Mice Develop Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus,Aging and Disease
339,PMC5467654,"Central diabetes insipidus (DI) is a rare clinical entity characterized by low circulating levels of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) presenting with polyuria and volume depletion. Pituitary surgery is the most common cause of central DI in adults. Pituitary and hypothalamic disease, particularly invasive neoplasms, rarely cause DI, being idiopathic cases responsible for the majority of non-surgical cases. HIV patients, especially those with poor virulogical control, are prone to the development of CNS neoplasms, particularly lymphomas. These neoplasms usually become manifest with mass effects and seizures. Central DI and hypopituitarism are uncommon initial manifestations of primary CNS lymphomas. The authors describe the case of 29-year-old female, HIV-positive patient whose CNS lymphoma presented with DI.
Central diabetes insipidus has multiple causes and central nervous system lymphomas are not often considered in the differential diagnosis due to their low prevalence.
Accurate biochemical diagnosis should always be followed by etiological investigation.
The HIV population is at risk for many neoplasms, especially CNS lymphomas.
New-onset polyuria in an HIV-positive patient in the absence of focal neurological signs should raise the suspicion for a central nervous system process of neoplastic nature.

340,PMC4898825,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) shows regional differences in Germany. The purpose of the project was to compare the prevalence of prediabetes and undiagnosed T2D in two regions in Germany, the Northeast and the South, and to evaluate their associations with regional variations in lifestyle factors and hypertension.
Data from the KORA-F4 study (South Germany, 2006–2008) and the SHIP-TREND study (Northeast Germany, 2008–2012) were used. Participants aged 35–79 years without T2D with an overnight fasting of more than 8 hours and an oral glucose tolerance test were included: KORA-F4: n = 2,616 and SHIP-TREND: n = 1,968.
The prevalence of prediabetes/newly diagnosed T2D was especially high in men (about 60%) and women (about 50%) in the Northeast, followed by men (about 50%) and women (about 30%) in the South. Lifestyle factors associated with T2D varied between the regions: more participants in the Northeast were active smokers and the percentages of people with overweight or obesity were greater than in their southern counterparts. However, these differences could not explain the striking disparity in prediabetes/newly diagnosed T2D. The frequency of hypertension was also distinctly higher in the Northeast than in the South and clearly associated with prediabetes/newly diagnosed T2D. Especially in men living in the Northeast, screening individuals with blood pressure ≥ 140/90mmHg might reveal up to 70% of those with prediabetes/newly diagnosed T2D.
Knowledge about regional variability in T2D and related risk factors is important for the planning of diabetes prevention programs. In our analyses, common lifestyle factors did not nearly explain these variations between the northern SHIP-TREND and the southern KORA-F4 studies. Further examinations of regional socioeconomic, political, environmental and other aspects are needed. Meanwhile, targeted diabetes prevention strategies with a special focus on men living in the northern parts of Germany are reasonable.",2016 Jun 8,Regional Variability of Lifestyle Factors and Hypertension with Prediabetes and Newly Diagnosed Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: The Population-Based KORA-F4 and SHIP-TREND Studies in Germany,PLoS ONE

The present study aimed to test the associations between plasma tyrosine and type 2 diabetes mellitus with special attention to identifying possible cut‐off points for type 2 diabetes mellitus, and its interactive effects with low high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL‐C) and/or high triglyceride for type 2 diabetes mellitus.
From 27 May 2015 to 3 August 2016, we retrieved the medical notes of 1,898 inpatients with type 2 diabetes mellitus as the cases, and 1,522 individuals without diabetes as the controls who attended annual medical checkups from the same tertiary care center in Jinzhou, China. Logistic regression analyses were carried out to obtain odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Restricted cubic spline analysis nested in the logistic regression analysis was used to identify possible cut‐off points of tyrosine for type 2 diabetes mellitus. The additive interaction was used to estimate interactions between high tyrosine and low HDL‐C in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients.
The OR of tyrosine for type 2 diabetes mellitus did not increase until 46 μmol/L and after that point, the OR rapidly rose with increasing tyrosine in a nearly linear manner. If 46 μmol/L was used to define high tyrosine, high tyrosine was associated with an increased OR of type 2 diabetes mellitus (adjusted OR 1.88, 95% CI 1.44–2.45). The presence of low HDL‐C greatly enhanced the ORs of tyrosine for type 2 diabetes mellitus from 1.11 (95% CI 0.82–1.51) to 54.11 (95% CI 33.96–86.22) with significant additive interaction.

342,PMC7477501,"The incidence of severe hypoglycemia and its risk factors including an insulin‐sensitizing adipokine, adiponectin, were prospectively investigated in Japanese patients with type 1 or insulin‐treated type 2 diabetes.
A total of 207 participants with type 1 diabetes (mean age 55 years) and 1,396 with insulin‐treated type 2 diabetes (mean age 65 years) from the local diabetes registry were followed for 5 years (follow‐up rate 99%). Severe hypoglycemia was defined as events requiring the assistance of others for recovery from hypoglycemia.
The incidence of severe hypoglycemia was 9.2 per 100 person‐years in those with type 1 diabetes, and 2.3 per 100 person‐years in those with insulin‐treated type 2 diabetes, respectively. For type 1 diabetes, the risk was significant in those with a history of severe hypoglycemia within the previous year, slow eating and higher serum adiponectin (the highest vs the lowest in quartile hazard ratio 2.36, 95% confidence interval 1.22–4.69). For insulin‐treated type 2 diabetes, the risk included age ≥65 years, history of severe hypoglycemia within the previous year, alcohol consumption ≥60 g/day, larger insulin dose and higher serum adiponectin (the highest vs the lowest in quartile, hazard ratio 2.95, 95% confidence interval 1.22–4.69).

343,PMC7566143,"High N-terminal pro-brain-type natriuretic peptide levels have been associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). However, less is known about other cardiac stress biomarkers in this context. Here we evaluated the association of mid-regional pro-atrial natriuretic peptide (MR-proANP), C-terminal pro-arginine vasopressin (copeptin), C-terminal pro-endothelin-1 (CT-proET-1) and mid-regional pro-adrenomedullin (MR-proADM) with incident T2D and changes in glucose metabolism.
We performed a prospective cohort study using data from the population-based KORA F4/FF4 study. 1773 participants (52.3% women) with MR-proANP measurements and 960 (52.7% women) with copeptin, CT-proET-1 and MR-proADM measurements were included. We examined associations of circulating plasma levels of MR-proANP, copeptin, CT-proET-1 and MR-proADM with incident T2D, the combined endpoint of incident prediabetes/T2D and with fasting and 2 h-glucose, fasting insulin, HOMA-IR, HOMA-B and HbA1c at follow-up. Logistic and linear regression models adjusted for age, sex, waist circumference, height, hypertension, total/HDL cholesterol ratio, triglycerides, smoking, physical activity and parental history of diabetes were used to compute effect estimates.
During a median follow-up time of 6.4 years (25th and 75th percentiles: 6.0 and 6.6, respectively), 119 out of the 1773 participants and 72 out of the 960 participants developed T2D. MR-proANP was inversely associated with incident T2D (odds ratio [95% confidence interval]: 0.75 [0.58; 0.96] per 1-SD increase of log MR-proANP). Copeptin was positively associated with incident prediabetes/T2D (1.29 [1.02; 1.63] per 1-SD increase of log copeptin). Elevated levels of CT-proET-1 were associated with increased HOMA-B at follow-up, while elevated MR-proADM levels were associated with increased fasting insulin, HOMA-IR and HOMA-B at follow-up. These associations were independent of previously described diabetes risk factors.
High plasma concentrations of MR-proANP contributed to a lower risk of incident T2D, whereas high plasma concentrations of copeptin were associated with an increased risk of incident prediabetes/T2D. Furthermore, high plasma concentrations of CT-proET-1 and MR-proADM were associated with increased insulin resistance.

A 19-year-old female presented with galactorrhea, primary amenorrhea, and left hemianopsia. Complementary study detected hyperprolactinemia and a pituitary macroadenoma with cavernous sinus invasion and suprasellar growth. She was treated with cabergoline and bromocriptine without clinical or analytical improvement. Resection of the pituitary lesion was programmed and a non-contiguous lesion of the nasal mucosa was detected during the approach. This metastasis led to the diagnosis of prolactin-producing pituitary carcinoma. After partial resection, the patient was submitted to radiotherapy for residual disease with persistent symptoms. She developed growth hormone deficiency, central hypothyroidism, hypogonadism, and permanent diabetes insipidus. Six years later she was admitted for the suspicion of secondary adrenal insufficiency and thyrotoxicosis. Physical findings, laboratory data, thyroid ultrasound, and scintigraphy achieved the diagnosis of Graves’ disease and hypocortisolism. She was treated with hydrocortisone and methimazole, but central hypothyroidism recurred after antithyroid drug withdrawal. Nine years after the diagnosis of a pituitary carcinoma, she maintains treatment with bromocriptine, has a locally stable disease, with no metastases.

345,PMC5701367,"Diabetes mellitus and hypertension are risk factors for cardiovascular disease, which is the most common cause of death in the world. People with intellectual disability (ID) have been reported to have high rates of both these disorders. The aim of this study was to describe and compare prevalence ratios of diabetes mellitus and hypertension between older adults with ID and their age peers in the general population, and to describe and compare treatment patterns in these two groups.
This is a Swedish register-based study, in which we established a cohort of people aged 55+ years and who had received support for those with ID in 2012 (n = 7936). We also established a same-sized referent cohort from the general population matched by sex and year of birth. Information on diagnoses of diabetes mellitus and hypertension, and prescription of drugs for these disorders, were collected from national registers for the period 2006–2012. The two cohorts were compared using generalized linear models (GLM).
People with ID were 20% more likely than the general population to have a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, and 26% more likely to have prescription of drugs for diabetes mellitus. People in the general population were 81% more likely to have a diagnosis of hypertension, and 9% more likely to have a prescription of drugs for hypertension. Among those with diabetes, ID was associated with higher occurrence of prescription of insulin combination drugs and sulfonylureas, but lower occurrence of prescription of dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP) 4-inhibitors and exenatide/liraglutide. Among those with hypertension, ID was associated with higher occurrence of prescription of diuretics, but lower occurrence of prescription of calcium channel blockers and angiotensin II antagonists.
Treatment regimens among people with ID tended to include older types of medication compared with what was prescribed in the general population. To ensure that this is medically appropriate and not due to failure to update the treatment regimen, it is important to investigate if the people with ID and diabetes mellitus or hypertension are subjected to the same regular drug reviews that are recommended for older adults in general.

A randomized, parallel-group, open-label trial was conducted at 18 centers between February, 2011 and March, 2013. 171 outpatients with T2DM were recruited and randomly assigned to glimepiride or sitagliptin by minimization. Doses of glimepiride (0.25–1.0 mg/day) and sitagliptin (25–100 mg/day) were adjusted for hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) > 6.9 %. Analyses were performed on full analysis set (FAS) of randomized subjects taking medications as allocated, and underwent 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTTs) before and after treatment. The primary outcome was insulinogenic index to quantify early-phase insulin secretion after treatment, which was evaluated by analysis of covariance (ANCOVA).
Of 171 enrolled subjects, 68 in the sitagliptin group and 65 in the glimepiride group were included in the FAS (mean age, 64 years; baseline (HbA1c), 7.4 %). The primary outcome revealed a significantly higher insulinogenic index in the sitagliptin group than that in the glimepiride group (p = 0.036). Sitagliptin also reduced plasma glucose levels at 60 and 120 min during OGTT compared with glimepiride, while achieving a similar improvement in HbA1c during treatment. Body weight did not change in either of the two groups, and one case of hypoglycemia was observed in the glimepiride group.

It may affect one out of five pregnancies, leading to perinatal morbidity and adverse neonatal outcomes, and high risk of chronic metabolic and cardiovascular injuries in both mother and offspring. Currently, GDM diagnosis is based on evaluation of glucose homeostasis at late stages of pregnancy, but increased age and body-weight, and familiar or previous occurrence of GDM, may conditionate this criteria. In addition, an earlier and more specific detection of GDM with associated metabolic and cardiovascular risk could improve GDM development and outcomes. In this sense, 1st–2nd trimester-released biomarkers found in maternal plasma including adipose tissue-derived factors such as adiponectin, visfatin, omentin-1, fatty acid-binding protein-4 and retinol binding-protein-4 have shown correlations with GDM development. Moreover, placenta-related factors such as sex hormone-binding globulin, afamin, fetuin-A, fibroblast growth factors-21/23, ficolin-3 and follistatin, or specific micro-RNAs may participate in GDM progression and be useful for its recognition. Finally, urine-excreted metabolites such as those related with serotonin system, non-polar amino-acids and ketone bodies, may complete a predictive or early-diagnostic panel of biomarkers for GDM.",2019 Oct 30,Predictive and diagnostic biomarkers for gestational diabetes and its associated metabolic and cardiovascular diseases,Cardiovascular Diabetology
348,PMC6609950,"Diabetes is a prevalent condition in the U.S. and worldwide, with expanding impact over time as it affects progressively younger ages as well as older ages as people live longer. Costs of diabetes to those affected and to society as a whole continue to increase. Costs are realized through daily treatment regimens throughout life to control glycemia and other risk factors for complications as diabetes progresses, diabetes complications and disability and their treatments, health care visits and hospitalization, and as indirect costs via lower quality of life and lost productivity. Diagnosing diabetes is key to affording the opportunity to treat diabetes, and diabetes control is key to reducing the risk of complications. Yet the magnitude of undiagnosed diabetes and poor control of diabetes is large. And just as certain subgroups of the population are affected disproportionately by diabetes and diabetes complications, so are they affected disproportionately by undiagnosed diabetes and poor control. This review addresses the epidemiology of undiagnosed diabetes and diabetes control, largely covering their magnitude, demographic variation, trends over time, and predictors. For diabetes control, it focuses on control of A1C, blood pressure, and lipid levels, although there are many other facets of diabetes control and preventive care that also could be examined. The review is based predominantly on data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), a U.S. health survey that includes both an interview and examination component that has been conducted continuously since 1999 and episodically for decades earlier. The interview elicits self-reported health responses pertaining to diabetes and other medical conditions and an examination that measures glycemic indicators, blood pressure, and lipids, which provide much of the material presented herein. Data from other studies are also presented and described.",2019 May 10,Diabetes Diagnosis and Control: Missed Opportunities to Improve Health : The 2018 Kelly West Award Lecture,Diabetes Care
349,PMC6907272,"To evaluate the impact of treatment with recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH; Omnitrope®) on the risk of diabetes mellitus in adults with growth hormone deficiency (GHD), using data from the ongoing PATRO Adults post-marketing surveillance study.
PATRO Adults is an ongoing post-marketing surveillance study being conducted in hospitals and specialized endocrinology clinics across Europe. All enrolled patients who receive ≥1 dose of Omnitrope® are included in the safety population. Patient profiles, containing all available study database information for each specific patient, were generated for all patients with adverse events (AEs) of diabetes mellitus while participating in the study. Diabetes mellitus was confirmed if fasting plasma glucose was ≥7.0 mmol/L or 2-h plasma glucose ≥11.1 mmol/L during oral glucose tolerance test or glycated hemoglobin ≥6.5%.
Up to July 2018, 1293 patients had been enrolled in the study, and 983 (76.0%) remained active. Just under half (n = 687, 49.3%) of the patients were growth hormone (GH) treatment-naïve on entering the study, and most (n = 1128, 87.2%) had multiple pituitary hormone deficiency (MPHD). Diabetes mellitus/inadequate control (worsening) of diabetes mellitus was reported in 21 patients (22 events). The cases were newly diagnosed in 15 patients (age 29–84 years; incidence rate 3.61 per 1000 patient-years) and occurred in 6 patients with pre-existing diabetes mellitus at baseline (age 45–72 years). Most cases of newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus occurred in patients with adult-onset MPHD (n = 13); the remaining cases of new-onset diabetes mellitus occurred in a patient with childhood-onset MPHD who had previously received GH replacement therapy (n = 1), and a patient with adulthood-onset isolated GHD who was naïve to GH replacement therapy (n = 1). All cases of inadequate control/worsening of diabetes mellitus occurred in patients with adult-onset MPHD.
Based on this snapshot of data from PATRO Adults, Omnitrope® treatment is tolerated in adult patients with GHD in a real-life clinical practice setting. No signals of an increased risk for diabetes mellitus have been noted so far, although continued follow-up (both during and after rhGH therapy) is required to confirm this.

350,PMC3651298,"Wolfram Syndrome (WFS:OMIM 222300) is an autosomal recessive, progressive, neurologic and endocrinologic degenerative disorder caused by mutations in the WFS1 gene, encoding the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein wolframin, thought to be involved in the regulation of ER stress. This paper reports a cross section of data from the Washington University WFS Research Clinic, a longitudinal study to collect detailed phenotypic data on a group of young subjects in preparation for studies of therapeutic interventions.
Eighteen subjects (ages 5.9–25.8, mean 14.2 years) with genetically confirmed WFS were identified through the Washington University International Wolfram Registry. Examinations included: general medical, neurologic, ophthalmologic, audiologic, vestibular, and urologic exams, cognitive testing and neuroimaging.
Seventeen (94%) had diabetes mellitus with the average age of diabetes onset of 6.3 ± 3.5 years. Diabetes insipidus was diagnosed in 13 (72%) at an average age of 10.6 ± 3.3 years. Seventeen (94%) had optic disc pallor and defects in color vision, 14 (78%) had hearing loss and 13 (72%) had olfactory defects, eight (44%) had impaired vibration sensation. Enuresis was reported by four (22%) and nocturia by three (17%). Of the 11 tested for bladder emptying, five (45%) had elevated post-void residual bladder volume.
WFS causes multiple endocrine and neurologic deficits detectable on exam, even early in the course of the disease. Defects in olfaction have been underappreciated. The proposed mechanism of these deficits in WFS is ER stress-induced damage to neuronal and hormone-producing cells. This group of subjects with detailed clinical phenotyping provides a pool for testing proposed treatments for ER stress. Longitudinal follow-up is necessary for establishing the natural history and identifying potential biomarkers of progression.",2013 Apr 27,Phenotypic characteristics of early Wolfram syndrome,Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases
351,PMC6274679,"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a serious pregnancy complication, in which women without previously diagnosed diabetes develop chronic hyperglycemia during gestation. In most cases, this hyperglycemia is the result of impaired glucose tolerance due to pancreatic β-cell dysfunction on a background of chronic insulin resistance. Risk factors for GDM include overweight and obesity, advanced maternal age, and a family history or any form of diabetes. Consequences of GDM include increased risk of maternal cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes and macrosomia and birth complications in the infant. There is also a longer-term risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease in the child. GDM affects approximately 16.5% of pregnancies worldwide, and this number is set to increase with the escalating obesity epidemic. While several management strategies exist—including insulin and lifestyle interventions—there is not yet a cure or an efficacious prevention strategy. One reason for this is that the molecular mechanisms underlying GDM are poorly defined. This review discusses what is known about the pathophysiology of GDM, and where there are gaps in the literature that warrant further exploration.",2018 Oct 26,The Pathophysiology of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus,International Journal of Molecular Sciences
352,PMC6052323,"Lithium is widely used in the treatment of bipolar affective disorders, but often causes nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI), a condition characterized by a severe urinary concentrating defect. Lithium-induced NDI is associated with dysregulation of the amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), which is essential for renal sodium reabsorption. Sex hormones have been shown to affect the expression of aquaporin-2 (AQP2) and sodium transporters. Therefore, we evaluated whether tamoxifen (TAM), a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), would affect lithium-induced dysregulation of ENaC subunits and natriuresis. Rats were fed with lithium-containing food for 2 weeks to induce NDI and natriuresis. TAM was administered daily via gastric gavage after 1 week of lithium administration. Lithium treatment alone resulted in increased urinary sodium excretion and significant reduction of βENaC and γENaC at both RNA and protein levels. In addition, the plasma sodium level reduced after lithium treatment. Administration of TAM prevented increased urinary sodium excretion as well as attenuated the downregulation of βENaC and γENaC. Consistent with these findings, immunohistochemistry (IHC) showed stronger labeling of βENaC and γENaC subunits in the apical domain of the collecting duct cells in the cortical tissue of lithium-fed rats treated with TAM. Other major sodium transporters including NaPi-2, NKCC2, Na/K-ATPase, and NHE3, are believed not to have an effect on the increased urinary sodium excretion since their expression increased or was unchanged after treatment with lithium. In conclusion, the results demonstrated that TAM rescued the adverse effects of the lithium-induced increase in fractional excretion of sodium after the establishment of lithium-induced NDI.",2018 Jul 12,Tamoxifen Decreases Lithium-Induced Natriuresis in Rats With Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus,Frontiers in Physiology
353,PMC8534084,"Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a rapidly fatal disease. Diabetes mellitus is a major association of PDAC and is both a cause as well as a consequence of cancer. Notably, at the time of diagnosis of PDAC, more than 80% of patients have abnormal fasting blood glucose levels. Even more intriguing is the observation that a third of patients reports being diagnosed with diabetes within 3 years prior to their cancer diagnosis. This new onset diabetes, also called pancreatic cancer-related diabetes (PCRD) may be a harbinger of asymptomatic PDAC. Elucidating the mechanisms mediating PCRD will enable the identification of biomarkers for early diagnosis and/or novel molecular pathways that can be therapeutically targeted to improve patient outcomes.
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a devastating condition characterised by vague symptomatology and delayed diagnosis. About 30% of PDAC patients report a history of new onset diabetes, usually diagnosed within 3 years prior to the diagnosis of cancer. Thus, new onset diabetes, which is also known as pancreatic cancer-related diabetes (PCRD), could be a harbinger of PDAC. Diabetes is driven by progressive β cell loss/dysfunction and insulin resistance, two key features that are also found in PCRD. Experimental studies suggest that PDAC cell-derived exosomes carry factors that are detrimental to β cell function and insulin sensitivity. However, the role of stromal cells, particularly pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs), in the pathogenesis of PCRD is not known. PSCs are present around the earliest neoplastic lesions and around islets. Given that PSCs interact closely with cancer cells to drive cancer progression, it is possible that exosomal cargo from both cancer cells and PSCs plays a role in modulating β cell function and peripheral insulin resistance. Identification of such mediators may help elucidate the mechanisms of PCRD and aid early detection of PDAC. This paper discusses the concept of a novel role of PSCs in the pathogenesis of PCRD.",2021 Oct 18,Role of Pancreatic Stellate Cell-Derived Exosomes in Pancreatic Cancer-Related Diabetes: A Novel Hypothesis,Cancers
354,PMC7245758,"In current management of type 2 diabetes (T2DM), cardiovascular and renal prevention have become important targets to be achieved. In this context, a joint panel of four endocrinology societies from Brazil and Portugal was established to develop an evidence-based guideline for treatment of hyperglycemia in T2DM.
MEDLINE (via PubMed) was searched for randomized clinical trials, meta-analyses, and observational studies related to diabetes treatment. When there was insufficient high-quality evidence, expert opinion was sought. Updated positions on treatment of T2DM patients with heart failure (HF), atherosclerotic CV disease (ASCVD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and patients with no vascular complications were developed. The degree of recommendation and the level of evidence were determined using predefined criteria.
In non-pregnant adults, the recommended HbA1c target is below 7%. Higher levels are recommended in frail older adults and patients at higher risk of hypoglycemia. Lifestyle modification is recommended at all phases of treatment. Metformin is the first choice when HbA1c is 6.5–7.5%. When HbA1c is 7.5–9.0%, dual therapy with metformin plus an SGLT2i and/or GLP-1RA (first-line antidiabetic agents, AD1) is recommended due to cardiovascular and renal benefits. If an AD1 is unaffordable, other antidiabetic drugs (AD) may be used. Triple or quadruple therapy should be considered when HbA1c remains above target. In patients with clinical or subclinical atherosclerosis, the combination of one AD1 plus metformin is the recommended first-line therapy to reduce cardiovascular events and improve blood glucose control. In stable heart failure with low ejection fraction (< 40%) and glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) > 30 mL/min/1.73 m2, metformin plus an SGLT-2i is recommended to reduce cardiovascular mortality and heart failure hospitalizations and improve blood glucose control. In patients with diabetes-associated chronic kidney disease (CKD) (eGFR 30–60 mL/min/1.73 m2 or eGFR 30–90 mL/min/1.73 m2 with albuminuria > 30 mg/g), the combination of metformin and an SGLT2i is recommended to attenuate loss of renal function, reduce albuminuria and improve blood glucose control. In patients with severe renal failure, insulin-based therapy is recommended to improve blood glucose control. Alternatively, GLP-1RA, DPP4i, gliclazide MR and pioglitazone may be considered to reduce albuminuria. In conclusion, the current evidence supports individualizing anti-hyperglycemic treatment for T2DM.",2020 May 24,Portuguese-Brazilian evidence-based guideline on the management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes mellitus,Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome
355,PMC6778554,"The advent of incretin mimetics such as glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) has enriched the armamentarium for diabetes management owing to their glycaemic as well as extra-glycaemic benefits. The approval status and availability of this class of drugs vary widely across the globe. Being a relatively newer class of drug with numerous benefits, several national and international guidelines are working towards addressing clinical questions pertaining to the optimal use of GLP-1 RAs for the management of diabetes. Although the newer class of drugs are associated with significant benefits such as patient-centric approach, these drugs demand the providers to be vigilant and knowledgeable about the medication. The South Asian population is at higher risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) because of their genetic predisposition and lifestyle changes. Hence, prevention and management of T2DM and its associated complications in this population are of paramount importance.

We monitored 4,372 women with a history of GDM participating in the Nurses’ Health Study II for incident type 2 diabetes over 25 years up to 2017. Lactation history was obtained through follow-up questionnaires to calculate lactation duration. Follow-up blood samples were collected from a subset of these women at median age of 58 years through the Diabetes & Women’s Health Study.
We documented 873 incident cases of type 2 diabetes during 87,411 person-years of follow-up. Longer duration of lactation was associated with lower risk of type 2 diabetes for both total lactation (hazard ratio 1.05 [95% CI 0.83–1.34] for up to 6 months, 0.91 [0.72–1.16] for 6–12 months, 0.85 [0.67–1.06] for 12–24 months, and 0.73 [0.57–0.93] for >24 months, compared with 0 months; P-trend = 0.003) and exclusive breastfeeding (P-trend = 0.002) after adjustment for age, ethnicity, family history of diabetes, parity, age at first birth, smoking, diet quality, physical activity, and prepregnancy BMI. Longer duration of lactation was also associated with lower HbA1c, fasting plasma insulin, and C-peptide concentrations among women without type 2 diabetes at follow-up (all adjusted P-trend ≤0.04).

She was initially diagnosed to have Sheehan’s syndrome and after discharge, she was diagnosed to have a vesicovaginal fistula which initially caused a delay in diagnosing diabetes insipidus in the patient because she was having urinary incontinence. The patient had the vesicovaginal fistula repaired and was on replacement with levothyroxine, prednisone, and desmopressin. Years after her diagnosis, the patient experienced recurrent episodes of hyponatremia in the setting of desmopressin therapy. This case highlights the challenges of diagnosing diabetes insipidus in a patient with Sheehan’s syndrome and a vesicovaginal fistula, as well as the long-term management of central diabetes insipidus in a resource-limited setting.
Sheehan’s syndrome is rarely associated with diabetes insipidus, and in our patient, it was initially missed due to a vesicovaginal fistula which caused urinary incontinence.
Water intoxication is more common in young children and older adults but can occur years after initiating treatment with desmopressin in adults and should be kept in mind when treating patients with hyponatremia who have hypopituitarism associated with diabetes insipidus.

359,PMC6969696,"Pituitary-dependent hyperadrenocorticism (PDH) is the cause of approximately 80-85% of naturally occurring cases of hyperadrenocorticism(HAC) in canines and is triggered by an adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-producing pituitary adenoma or hyperplasia of the corticotroph in the pituitary anterior lobe or intermediate lobe. Transsphenoidal surgery(TSS) is an effective treatment that can directly remove pituitary tumors that cause PDH in canines under a single course of general anesthesia. However, careful evaluations of the definitive diagnosis, adenoma size and growth rate, relationship with surrounding tissue, general condition, and neurosurgical procedural skill involved in each case are important to determine TSS suitability. The basic principle is to confirm that the present HAC case is PDH, that is, an ACTH-producing adenoma or the hyperplasia of the corticotroph originating from either the pituitary anterior or intermediate lobe. Evaluations based on endocrinology, particularly plasma ACTH concentration, and imaging diagnosis, particularly MRI is essential for definitive diagnosis. Enlarged pituitary tumors can shorten the post-TSS survival time, increase the recurrence rate of clinical symptoms, and increase the risk for developing permanent central diabetes insipidus. Therefore, complete removal of adenomas of up to Grade IIIA according to the MRI-based classification system is relatively easy to achieve with TSS, and long-term remission and survival can be expected.",2020 Jan 14,"Transsphenoidal Surgery in Canines: Safety, Efficacy and Patient Selection",Veterinary Medicine : Research and Reports

Emerging data has shown increased risks of severe infections, increased in ICU admissions, longer durations of admission, and increased mortality among coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients with diabetes. We performed a subgroup analysis comparing the outcomes of patients diagnosed with DM (n = 2191) versus patients without DM (n = 8690) on our data from our study based on a nationwide, comparative, retrospective, cohort study among adult, hospitalized COVID-19 patients involving 37 hospital sites from around the Philippines. We determined distribution differences between two independent samples using Mann–Whitney U and t tests. Data on the time to onset of mortality, respiratory failure, intensive care unit (ICU) admission were used to build Kaplan–Meier curves and to compute for hazard ratios (HR). The odds ratios (OR) for longer ventilator dependence, longer ICU stay, and longer hospital stays were computed via multivariate logistic regression. Adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) and ORs (aOR) with 95% CI were calculated. We included a total of 10,881 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection (2191 have DM while 8690 did not have DM). The median age of the DM cohort was 61, with a female to male ratio of 1:1.25 and more than 50% of the DM population were above 60 years old. The aOR for mortality was significantly higher among those in the DM group by 1.46 (95% CI 1.28–1.68; p < 0.001) as compared to the non-DM group. Similarly, the aOR for respiratory failure was also significantly higher among those in the DM group by 1.67 (95% CI 1.46–1.90). The aOR for developing severe COVID-19 at nadir was significantly higher among those in the DM group by 1.85 (95% CI 1.65–2.07; p < 0.001).

361,PMC2413213,"Congenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) is characterised by an inability to concentrate urine despite normal or elevated plasma levels of the antidiuretic hormone arginine vasopressin. We report a Japanese extended family with NDI caused by an 11.2-kb deletion that includes the entire AVPR2 locus and approximately half of the Rho GTPase-activating protein 4 (ARHGAP4) locus. ARHGAP4 belongs to the RhoGAP family, Rho GTPases are critical regulators of many cellular activities, such as motility and proliferation which enhances intrinsic GTPase activity.
ARHGAP4 is expressed at high levels in hematopoietic cells, and it has been reported that an NDI patient lacking AVPR2 and all of ARHGAP4 showed immunodeficiency characterised by a marked reduction in the number of circulating CD3+ cells and almost complete absence of CD8+ cells.
PCR and sequencing were performed to identify the deleted region in the Japanese NDI patients. Immunological profiles of the NDI patients were analysed by flow cytometry. We also investigated the gene expression profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from NDI patients and healthy controls in microarray technique.
We evaluated subjects (one child and two adults) with 11.2-kb deletion that includes the entire AVPR2 locus and approximately half of the ARHGAP4. Hematologic tests showed a reduction of CD4+ cells in one adult patient, a reduction in CD8+ cells in the paediatric patient, and a slight reduction in the serum IgG levels in the adult patients, but none of them showed susceptibility to infection. Gene expression profiling of PBMC lacking ARHGAP4 revealed that expression of RhoGAP family genes was not influenced greatly by the lack of ARHGAP4.
These results suggest that loss of ARHGAP4 expression is not compensated for by other family members. ARHGAP4 may play some role in lymphocyte differentiation but partial loss of ARHGAP4 does not result in clinical immunodeficiency.",2008 May 20,Immunological profile in a family with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus with a novel 11 kb deletion in AVPR2 and ARHGAP4 genes,BMC Medical Genetics

363,PMC5065594,"Physical activity has been inconsistently associated with risk of gestational diabetes mellitus in epidemiological studies, and questions remain about the strength and shape of the dose–response relationship between the two. We therefore conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies and randomized trials on physical activity and gestational diabetes mellitus. PubMed, Embase and Ovid databases were searched for cohort studies, and randomized controlled trials of physical activity and risk of gestational diabetes mellitus, up to August 5th 2015. Summary relative risks (RRs) were estimated using a random effects model. Twenty-five studies (26 publications) were included. For total physical activity the summary RR for high versus low activity was 0.62 (95 % CI 0.41–0.94, I2 = 0 %, n = 4) before pregnancy, and 0.66 (95 % CI 0.36–1.21, I2 = 0 %, n = 3) during pregnancy. For leisure-time physical activity the respective summary RRs for high versus low activity was 0.78 (95 % CI 0.61–1.00, I2 = 47 %, n = 8) before pregnancy, and it was 0.80 (95 % CI 0.64–1.00, I2 = 17 %, n = 17) during pregnancy. The summary RR for pre-pregnancy activity was 0.70 (95 % CI 0.49–1.01, I2 = 72.6 %, n = 3) per increment of 5 h/week and for activity during pregnancy was 0.98 (95 % CI 0.87–1.09, I2 = 0 %, n = 3) per 5 h/week. There was evidence of a nonlinear association between physical activity before pregnancy and the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus, pnonlinearity = 0.005, with a slightly steeper association at lower levels of activity although further reductions in risk were observed up to 10 h/week. There was also evidence of nonlinearity for physical activity in early pregnancy, pnonlinearity = 0.008, with no further reduction in risk above 8 h/week. There was some indication of inverse associations between walking (before and during pregnancy) and vigorous activity (before pregnancy) and the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus. This meta-analysis suggests that there is a significant inverse association between physical activity before pregnancy and in early pregnancy and the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus. Further studies are needed to clarify the association between specific types and intensities of activity and gestational diabetes mellitus.

The present study aimed to clarify clinical and genetic determinants of glucosuria in individuals with diabetes mellitus.
The 24‐h urinary glucose excretion was measured in 135 hospitalized patients on admission, with continuous measurement for five consecutive days in 75 patients. Genetic and clinical factors contributing to glucosuria were studied. As a genetic factor, SLC5A2 polymorphism was genotyped. A total of 476 participants (266 participants with type 2 diabetes and 210 healthy controls) were additionally genotyped for the association study of SLC5A2 with type 2 diabetes. A meta‐analysis was carried out with the present study and previous association studies.
Multiple regression analysis showed that the independent variables of average blood glucose (β = 0.41, P = 1.4 × 10−7), estimated glomerular filtration rate (β = 0.28, P = 6.0 × 10−5), sex (β = 0.28, P = 5.7 × 10−5) and SLC5A2 rs9934336 polymorphism (β = 0.17, P = 0.02) were significantly correlated with urinary glucose excretion. The frequency of the A allele of rs9934336 tended to be lower in participants with type 2 diabetes than in controls (odds ratio 0.78, 95% confidence interval 0.53–1.13, not significant), and meta‐analysis showed a significant association between the A allele and type 2 diabetes (summary odds ratio for minor allele [A] 0.86, 95% confidence interval 0.78–0.94, P < 0.002).
Blood glucose, estimated glomerular filtration rate, sex and SLC5A2 polymorphism were independent determinants of glucosuria in diabetes mellitus.

Hence, we report the case of a 22-year-old woman with encephalitis, a pituitary mass, and adipsic diabetes insipidus. The diagnostic approach did not end on the biopsy of the lesion, which reported noncaseating granulomas; on the contrary, it was the beginning of a path to exclude other causes of the central nervous system granulomas that ended with the diagnosis of the isolated central nervous system sarcoidosis.

366,PMC6488892,"Central diabetes insipidus (CDI), a typical complication caused by pituitary stalk injury, often occurs after surgery, trauma, or tumor compression around hypothalamic structures such as the pituitary stalk and optic chiasma. CDI is linked to decreased arginine vasopressin (AVP) neurons in the hypothalamic supraoptic nucleus and paraventricular nucleus, along with a deficit in circulating AVP and oxytocin. However, little has been elucidated about the changes in AVP neurons in CDI. Hence, our study was designed to understand the role of several pathophysiologic changes such as endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and apoptosis of AVP neurons in CDI.
In a novel pituitary stalk electric lesion (PEL) model to mimic CDI, immunofluorescence and immunoblotting were used to understand the underlying regulatory mechanisms.
We reported that in CDI condition, generated by PEL, ER stress induced apoptosis of AVP neurons via activation of the PI3K/Akt and ERK pathways. Furthermore, application of N‐acetylcysteine protected hypothalamic AVP neurons from ER stress‐induced apoptosis through blocking the PI3K/Akt and ERK pathways.
Our findings showed that AVP neurons underwent apoptosis induced by ER stress, and ER stress might play a vital role in CDI condition through the PI3K/Akt and ERK pathways.",2019 Jan 24,Endoplasmic reticulum stress induces apoptosis of arginine vasopressin neurons in central diabetes insipidus via PI3K/Akt pathway,CNS Neuroscience & Therapeutics

Diet is considered the cornerstone to reduce incidence and prevalence of this disease. Algae contains fiber, polyphenols, ω-3 PUFAs, and bioactive molecules with potential antidiabetic activity. This review delves into the applications of algae and their components in T2DM, as well as to ascertain the mechanism involved (e.g., glucose absorption, lipids metabolism, antioxidant properties, etc.).

Papers in which whole alga, algal extracts, or their isolated compounds were studied in in vitro conditions, T2DM experimental models, and humans were selected and discussed. This review also focuses on meat matrices or protein concentrate-based products in which different types of alga were included, aimed to modulate carbohydrate digestion and absorption, blood glucose, gastrointestinal neurohormones secretion, glycosylation products, and insulin resistance. As microbiota dysbiosis in T2DM and metabolic alterations in different organs are related, the review also delves on the effects of several bioactive algal compounds on the colon/microbiota-liver-pancreas-brain axis.

We examined cardiovascular risk factors (CVRFs) and arterial parameters in 1809 youth with T1DM. Demographics, anthropometrics, blood pressure, and laboratory data were collected at T1DM onset and 5 years later. Pulse wave velocity and augmentation index were collected with tonometry. ANOVA or chi‐square tests were used to test for differences in measures of arterial parameters by CVRF. Area under the curve of CVRFs was entered in general linear models to explore determinants of accelerate vascular aging. Participants at the time of arterial measurement were 17.6±4.5 years old, 50% female, 76% non‐Hispanic white, and duration of T1DM was 7.8±1.9 years. Glycemic control was poor (glycated hemoglobin, 9.1±1.8%). All arterial parameters were higher in participants with glycated hemoglobin ≥9% and pulse wave velocity was higher with lower insulin sensitivity or longer duration of diabetes mellitus. Differences in arterial parameters were found by sex, age, and presence of obesity, hypertension, or dyslipidemia. In multivariable models, higher glycated hemoglobin, lower insulin sensitivity, body mass index, blood pressure, and lipid areas under the curve were associated with accelerated vascular aging.
In young people with T1DM, persistent poor glycemic control and higher levels of traditional CVRFs are independently associated with arterial aging. Improving glycemic control and interventions to lower CVRFs may prevent future cardiovascular events in young individuals with T1DM.",2019 Jun 19,Burden of Cardiovascular Risk Factors Over Time and Arterial Stiffness in Youth With Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus: The SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth Study,Journal of the American Heart Association: Cardiovascular and Cerebrovascular Disease

Here, we estimated spatiotemporal trends of type 2 diabetes mellitus burden attributable to PM2.5 pollution, including ambient particulate matter pollution (APMP) and household air pollution (HAP), from 1990–2019.
Data were obtained from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019 and were analyzed by age, sex, year, and location. Joinpoint regression analysis was applied in the analysis of temporal trends in type 2 diabetes mellitus burden over the 30 years.
Globally, PM2.5 pollution contributed to 292.5 thousand deaths and 13 million disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) in 2019. APMP ranked third among all risk factors, causing an increase in type 2 diabetes mellitus burden from 1990, whereas the impact of HAP significantly fell during the same period. Both APMP and HAP contributed the most to deaths and DALYs of type 2 diabetes mellitus among older people. However, the age-standardized death and DALY rates of type 2 diabetes mellitus attributable to APMP were greater among males and people in the middle socio-demographic index countries, especially in Southern Sub-Saharan Africa. For HAP, type 2 diabetes mellitus burden was modestly higher in females and was highest in Oceania, which was the only region with an increase from 1990.

375,PMC4398501,"We previously discovered that high copeptin is associated with incidence of diabetes mellitus (diabetes), abdominal obesity, and albuminuria. Furthermore, copeptin predicts cardiovascular events after myocardial infarction in diabetic patients, but whether it is associated with heart disease and death in individuals without diabetes and prevalent cardiovascular disease is unknown. In this study, we aim to test whether plasma copeptin (copeptin), the C-terminal fragment of arginine vasopressin prohormone, predicts heart disease and death differentially in diabetic and nondiabetic individuals.
We related plasma copeptin to a combined end point composed of coronary artery disease (CAD), heart failure (HF), and death in diabetes (n = 895) and nondiabetes (n = 4187) individuals of the Malmö Diet and Cancer Study–Cardiovascular cohort.
Copeptin significantly interacted with diabetes regarding the combined end point (P = .006). In diabetic individuals, copeptin predicted the combined end point (hazard ratio [HR] 1.32 per SD, 95% CI 1.10-1.58, P = .003) after adjustment for conventional risk factors, prevalent HF and CAD, and remained significant after additional adjustment for either fasting glucose (P = .02) or hemoglobin A1c (P = .02). Furthermore, in diabetic individuals, copeptin predicted CAD (HR 1.33 per SD, 95% CI 1.04-1.69, P = .02), HF (HR 1.62 per SD, 95% CI 1.09-2.41, P = .02), and death (HR 1.32 per SD, 95% CI 1.04-1.68, P = .02).

The aim of the study was to assess Polish women’s knowledge concerning GDM and their attitude to breastfeeding. As a research tool, an anonymous online survey that included 33 questions, grouped into three main sections—sociodemographic and obstetric variables, risk factors for GDM and neonatal adverse outcomes, and knowledge about breastfeeding—was used and administered online. A total of 410 women aged from 18 to 45 participated in this study. Based on the survey, it was demonstrated that the women had moderate knowledge concerning the maternal risk factors and adverse neonatal outcomes associated with GDM and, additionally, the short- and long-term effects of breastfeeding. Significantly deeper knowledge about GDM, including breastfeeding by GDM mothers, was observed among hyperglycemic mothers in comparison to normoglycemic mothers. However, knowledge concerning the health benefits of breastfeeding was not related to the mothers’ glycemic status.

A retrospective cohort study of women with a first diagnosis of GDM who delivered between 1991 and 2011. Women were divided into groups of good and poor glycemic control, defined as a mean daily glucose of up to 95 mg/dL (N = 230) and more than 95 mg/dL (N = 216), respectively. In addition, a control group of women without GDM (N = 352) was also analyzed. The primary outcomes were the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), obesity, hypertension, or dyslipidemia.
Mean follow-up time was 15.8 ± 5.1 years. Assessment was performed at a maternal age of 45 ± 7 years. The rates of the study outcomes in the control, GDM with good glycemic control and GDM with poor glycemic control were as follows: T2DM [19 (5.4%), 87 (38%), 127 (57%)]; hypertension [44 (13%), 42 (18%), 44 (20%)]; obesity [111 (32%), 112 (48%), 129 (58%)]; and dyslipidemia [49 (14%), 67 (29%), 106 (48%)]. Glycemic control was an independent risk factor for T2DM in multivariate Cox regression analysis (hazard ratio (HR) for poor glycemic control vs. controls 10.7 95% CI [6.0–19.0], good glycemic control vs. control HR 6.0 [3.3–10.8], and poor glycemic control vs. good glycemic control HR 1.8 [1.3–2.4]). Glycemic control was also an independent risk factor for dyslipidemia (poor glycemic control vs. controls HR 3.7 [2.3–5.8], good glycemic control vs. controls HR 2.0 [1.2–3.2], and poor glycemic control vs. good glycemic control HR 1.8 1.8 [1.3–2.6]). The fasting glucose level during oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was also an independent risk factor for these complications. The interaction term between glycemic control and the fasting value of the OGTT was not statistically significant, suggesting that the effect of glycemic control on the rate of future T2DM and dyslipidemia was not modified by the baseline severity of GDM.

378,PMC7078095,"Asprosin is a novel secreted adipokine that is induced by fasting and promotes hepatic glucose release. In healthy humans, circulating asprosin shows circadian oscillation with an acute drop coinciding with the onset of eating. The present study investigated whether this circadian oscillation still exists in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
We recruited 60 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and 60 individuals with normal glucose tolerance (NGT). All participants completed a 75‐g oral glucose tolerance test. Fasting and 2‐h postprandial serum asprosin concentrations were measured by the enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay method. Partial correlation coefficients were calculated to analyze the relationships between serum asprosin level and parameters of glucose metabolism. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to determine the association of serum asprosin level with diabetes.
Both fasting and postprandial asprosin levels were significantly higher in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The postprandial asprosin level was apparently lower than fasting asprosin level in individuals with NGT. The fasting asprosin level closely correlated with type 2 diabetes mellitus after multiple adjustment (odds ratio 2.329, P = 0.023). Asprosin correlated negatively with change in blood glucose (r = −0.502, P < 0.001) and change in C‐peptide (r = −0.467, P < 0.001) in individuals with NGT, but not in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients.
Serum asprosin level decreased coinciding with the onset of the oral glucose tolerance test in individuals with NGT, whereas this circadian oscillation was disturbed in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients. The impaired response of asprosin to glucose fluctuation in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients might be one of the reasons for the onset of type 2 diabetes mellitus.
We found that serum asprosin level decreased coinciding with the onset of the oral glucose tolerance test in individuals with normal glucose tolerance, whereas this circadian oscillation was disturbed in type 2 diabetes patients. The response of asprosin to glucose fluctuation was impaired in type 2 diabetes patients, which might be one of the reasons for the onset of type 2 diabetes.",2019 Oct 3,Increased serum level and impaired response to glucose fluctuation of asprosin is associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus,Journal of Diabetes Investigation

Our aims were to conduct a systematic review of studies investigating the measurement properties of diabetes PROMs by evaluating the methodological quality and overall level of evidence of these PROMs and to categorize them based on the outcome measures assessed.
This study was guided by the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis) guidelines. Relevant articles were retrieved from the Embase, PubMed, and PsychINFO databases. The PROMs were evaluated with the COSMIN (COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement Instruments) guidelines.
A total of 363 articles evaluating the measurement properties of PROMs for diabetes in the adult population were identified, of which 238 unique PROMs from 248 studies reported in 209 articles were validated in the type 2 diabetes population. PROMs with at least a moderate level of evidence for ≥5 of 9 measurement properties include the Chinese version of the Personal Diabetes Questionnaire (C-PDQ), Diabetes Self-Management Instrument Short Form (DSMI-20), and Insulin Treatment Appraisal Scale in Hong Kong primary care patients (C-ITAS-HK), of which the C-PDQ has a “sufficient (+)” rating for >4 measurement properties. A total of 43 PROMs meet the COSMIN guidelines for recommendation for use.
This study identified and synthesized evidence for the measurement properties of 238 unique PROMs for patients with type 2 diabetes and categorized the PROMs according to their outcome measures. These findings may assist clinicians and researchers in selecting appropriate high-quality PROMs for clinical practice and research.

Patients’ demographics, clinical data, frequencies of daily self‐monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG), glycemic control and complications were collected.
Among the 1,907 type 1 diabetes patients, the mean age was 21.2 ± 11.3 years. The mean glycated hemoglobin level was 9.35 ± 2.41%, with significant variations among age groups (P < 0.001). Conventional insulin treatment and intensive insulin treatment were used in 43 and 57% of patients, respectively. Mean glycated hemoglobin levels were significantly higher in patients treated with conventional insulin treatment compared to those treated with intensive insulin treatment (9.63 ± 2.34 vs 9.17 ± 2.46%, P = 0.002). Compared to the conventional insulin treatment group, significantly more patients in the intensive insulin treatment group achieved good glycemic control (P < 0.001), and fewer had diabetic retinopathy (P = 0.031). The prevalence of microvascular complications increased significantly with age (P < 0.001).

An adult male with metastatic medullary thyroid cancer presented with hyperglycemia, hypernatremia, hypokalemia, hypertension, acne-like rash, and diabetes insipidus (urine volume >8 L/d, osmolality 190 mOsm/kg). Serum cortisol, adrenocorticoitropic hormone, dehydroepiandrostenedione sulfate, and urinary free cortisol were elevated 8, 20, 4.4, and 340 folds, respectively. Pituitary imaging was normal. Computed tomography scan revealed jejunal intussusception and incidental abdominal aortic dissection. Sorafenib treatment was associated with Cushing’s syndrome remission, elevated progesterone (>10 fold), normalization of dehydroepiandrostenedione sulfate, but persistently elevated cortisol concentration. Newly-developed proximal lower limb weakness and decreased salivation were associated with elevated ganglionic neuronal acetylcholine receptor (alpha-3) and borderline P/Q type calcium channel antibodies.
Extreme cortisol concentration may have contributed to aortic dissection and suppressed antidiuretic hormone secretion; which combined with hypokalemia due cortisol activation of mineralocorticoid receptors, manifested as diabetes insipidus. This is the first report of paraneoplastic dysautonomia and jejunal intussusception in medullary thyroid cancer, they may be related to medullary thyroid cancer’s neuroendocrine origin and metastasis, respectively. Remission of Cushing’s syndrome without measurable reduction in cortisol concentration suggests a novel cortisol-independent mechanism of action or assay cross-reactivity.

HNF1B nephropathy is the umbrella term that includes the various kidney phenotypes of the disease, ranging from congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT), to tubular transport abnormalities, to chronic tubulointerstitial and cystic renal disease.
We describe 7 families containing 13 patients with ascertained HNF1B nephropathy. All patients underwent genetic testing and clinical, laboratory, and instrumental assessment, including renal imaging and evaluation of extrarenal HNF1B manifestations.
Significant inter- and intrafamilial variability of HNF1B nephropathy has been observed. In our cohort, HNF1B pathogenic variants presented with renal cysts and diabetes syndrome (RCAD); renal cystic phenotype mimicking autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD); autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease (ADTKD) with or without hyperuricemia and gout; CAKUT; and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI). Of note, for the first time, we describe the occurrence of medullary sponge kidney (MSK) in a family harboring the HNF1B whole-gene deletion at chromosome 17q12. Genotype characterization led to the identification of an additional 6 novel HNF1B pathogenic variants, 3 frameshift, 2 missense, and 1 nonsense.

We designed a case-control association study to inspect the susceptibility of the receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) gene 6 variants to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in 2199 patients with primary hypertension (1252 diabetic cases and 947 nondiabetic controls). The genotypes/alleles of −429T > C and 82Gly > Ser variants differed significantly between the two groups, and their associations with T2DM were significant after Bonferroni correction. Two variants, −374T > A and I/D, showed only marginal associations with T2DM. Haplotype analysis of above 4 significant variants indicated that a low-penetrance haplotype simultaneously bearing −429C and 82Ser alleles was overrepresented in cases relative to controls (4.75% vs. 1.72%, P < 0.001). Moreover, the predictive capability of 6 variants was significantly superior to available risk factors, with better goodness-of-fit. A predictive nomogram of 4 baseline risk factors and 2 variants of statistical significance was structured, with a good predictive accuracy (C-index = 0.761, P < 0.001).

A cross-sectional study was adopted in 734 newly diagnosed diabetics including 83 type 1 diabetics with positive islet-associated autoantibodies, 279 ketosis-onset diabetics without islet-associated autoantibodies and 372 non-ketotic type 2 diabetics. The clinical characteristics of HTN and MetS were compared across the three groups, and the risk factors of them were appraised in each group.
The prevalence of HTN and MetS were substantially higher in the ketosis-onset diabetics (34.4% for HTN and 58.8% for MetS) than in the type 1 diabetics (15.7% for HTN, P = 0.004; 25.3% for MetS, P < 0.001), but showed no remarkable difference compared with the type 2 diabetics (42.7% for HTN, P = 0.496; 72.3% for MetS, P = 0.079). Furthermore, the risk factors for both HTN and MetS in the ketosis-onset diabetics resembled those in the type 2 diabetics, but significantly different from those in the type 1 diabetics.
The prevalence of HTN and MetS in the ketosis-onset diabetics were magnificently higher than in the type 1 diabetics but showed no difference in comparison to the type 2 diabetics. Likewise, the clinical features and risk factors of HTN and MetS in the ketosis-onset diabetes resembled those in the type 2 diabetes but differed from those in the type 1 diabetes. Our findings indicate that ketosis-onset diabetes should be classified into type 2 diabetes rather than idiopathic type 1 diabetes.",2019 Apr 25,Prevalence and clinical characteristics of hypertension and metabolic syndrome in newly diagnosed patients with ketosis-onset diabetes: a cross-sectional study,Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome
385,PMC8724568,"Rare diseases are life-threatening or chronically debilitating low-prevalent disorders caused by pathogenic mutations or particular environmental insults. Due to their high complexity and low frequency, important gaps still exist in their prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. Since new drug discovery is a very costly and time-consuming process, leading pharmaceutical companies show relatively low interest in orphan drug research and development due to the high cost of investments compared to the low market return of the product. Drug repurposing–based approaches appear then as cost- and time-saving strategies for the development of therapeutic opportunities for rare diseases. In this article, we discuss the scientific, regulatory, and economic aspects of the development of repurposed drugs for the treatment of rare neurodegenerative disorders with a particular focus on Huntington’s disease, Friedreich’s ataxia, Wolfram syndrome, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The role of academia, pharmaceutical companies, patient associations, and foundations in the identification of candidate compounds and their preclinical and clinical evaluation will also be discussed.",2021 Dec 21,Current Drug Repurposing Strategies for Rare Neurodegenerative Disorders,Frontiers in Pharmacology
386,PMC6958624,"Highly walkable neighbourhoods may increase transport-related and leisure-time physical activity and thus decrease the risk for obesity and obesity-related diseases, such as type 2 diabetes (T2D).
We investigated the association between walkability and prevalent/incident T2D in a pooled sample from five German cohorts. Three walkability measures were assigned to participant’s addresses: number of transit stations, points of interest, and impedance (restrictions to walking due to absence of intersections and physical barriers) within 640 m. We estimated associations between walkability and prevalent/incident T2D with modified Poisson regressions and adjusted for education, sex, age at baseline, and cohort.
Of the baseline 16,008 participants, 1256 participants had prevalent T2D. Participants free from T2D at baseline were followed over a mean of 9.2 years (SD: 3.5, minimum: 1.6, maximum: 14.8 years). Of these, 1032 participants developed T2D. The three walkability measures were not associated with T2D. The estimates pointed toward a zero effect or were within 7% relative risk increase per 1 standard deviation with 95% confidence intervals including 1.

An online survey developed using a rapid Delphi method. The survey was translated into 17 different languages and disseminated electronically in 27 countries via national diabetes nurse networks.
Survey responses from 1829 diabetes nurses were included in the analysis. The responses indicated that 28% (n = 504) and 48% (n = 873) of diabetes nurses felt the COVID‐19 pandemic had impacted ‘a lot’ on the physical and psychological risks of people with diabetes, respectively. The following clinical problems were identified as having increased ‘a lot’: anxiety 82% (n = 1486); diabetes distress 65% (n = 1189); depression 49% (n = 893); acute hyperglycaemia 39% (n = 710) and foot complications 18% (n = 323). Forty‐seven percent (n = 771) of respondents identified that the level of care provided to people with diabetes had declined either extremely or quite severely. Self‐management support, diabetes education and psychological support were rated by diabetes nurse respondents as having declined extremely or quite severely during the COVID‐19 pandemic by 31% (n = 499), 63% (n = 1,027) and 34% (n = 551), respectively.
The findings show that diabetes nurses across Europe have seen significant increases in both physical and psychological problems in their patient populations during COVID‐19. The data also show that clinical diabetes services have been significantly disrupted. As the COVID‐19 situation continues, we need to adapt care systems with some urgency to minimise the impact of the pandemic on the diabetes population.",2020 Dec 30,The impact of the COVID‐19 pandemic on people with diabetes and diabetes services: A pan‐European survey of diabetes specialist nurses undertaken by the Foundation of European Nurses in Diabetes survey consortium,Diabetic Medicine
388,PMC7532466,"Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) is a rare tubulopathy characterized by urinary concentration defect due to renal resistance to vasopressin. Loss-of-function mutations of vasopressin V2 receptor (V2R) gene (AVPR2) is the most common cause of the disease. We have identified five novel mutations L86P, R113Q, C192S, M272R, and W323_I324insR from NDI-affected patients. Functional characterization of these mutants revealed that R113Q and C192S were normally localized at the basolateral membrane of polarized Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells and presented proper glycosylation maturation. On the other side, L86P, M272R, and W323_I324insR mutants were retained in endoplasmic reticulum and exhibited immature glycosylation and considerably reduced stability. All five mutants were resistant to administration of vasopressin analogues as evaluated by defective response in cAMP release. In order to rescue the function of the mutated V2R, we tested VX-809, sildenafil citrate, ibuprofen and tolvaptan in MDCK cells. Among these, tolvaptan was effective in rescuing the function of M272R mutation, by both allowing proper glycosylation maturation, membrane sorting and response to dDAVP. These results show an important proof of concept for the use of tolvaptan in patients affected by M272R mutation of V2R causing NDI.",2020 Oct 2,Characterization of five novel vasopressin V2 receptor mutants causing nephrogenic diabetes insipidus reveals a role of tolvaptan for M272R-V2R mutation,Scientific Reports
389,PMC6704511,"The global prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) has been increasing over recent decades. In Germany, the prevalence for DM type 1 and type 2 in adults is estimated at about 7.7%. Hence, diabetes has to be classified as a serious public health concern. Being diagnosed with DM and facing possible sequelae might have a negative impact on patients’ mental and physical well-being. However, diabetes not only affects patients themselves, but also their close relatives. To improve the quality of life for patients and relatives alike, the German Association of Diabetes Nurses and Education experts (VDBD) elaborated the first education program tailor-made for relatives of diabetes patients. This article describes the concept and design of the trial evaluating the efficacy of this education program called “DiaLife—Living Together with Diabetes”.
This evaluation study is a cluster randomized controlled trial, in which the study centers will be randomly assigned either to the intervention group or the control group. Study centers will recruit relatives of and patients with DM type 1 and type 2. Members of the intervention group will participate in the education program DiaLife, whereas participants randomized in the control group will act as waiting-list controls. The study will assess the efficacy of DiaLife by comparing diabetes-related knowledge between the intervention and control groups as the primary outcome for participants. As the primary outcome in patients, the Hba1c value will be assessed. In addition, diabetes-related distress, family interaction, and other secondary endpoints will be considered as secondary outcomes. Long-term efficacy will be assessed 6 and 12 months after intervention. Hierarchical regression models will be used to analyze effects over time.
While there is scientific evidence for the efficacy of education programs addressed to (diabetes) patients, there is a research gap with regard to intervention studies evaluating the efficacy of education programs designed for patients’ relatives. The study results will provide information on the efficacy of the DiaLife education program. In addition, factors that might hinder a successful implementation of an education program for relatives will be identified.

Several point mutations have been identified in human aquaporins, but their effects on the function of the respective aquaporins are mostly enigmatic. We analyzed the impact of the aquaporin 2 mutation V71M, which causes nephrogenic diabetes insipidus in humans, on aquaporin structure and activity, using the bacterial aquaglyceroporin GlpF as a model. Importantly, the sequence and structure around the V71M mutation is highly conserved between aquaporin 2 and GlpF.

It has resulted in great challenges for researchers elucidating the aetiology of diabetes and related features in other organ systems, for clinicians specifying a diagnosis that leads to improved genetic counselling, predicting of clinical course and changes in treatment, and for patients to altered treatment that has lead to coming off insulin and injections with no alternative (Glucokinase mutations), insulin injections being replaced by tablets (e.g. low dose in HNFα or high dose in potassium channel defects -Kir6.2 and SUR1) or with tablets in addition to insulin (e.g. metformin in insulin resistant syndromes). Genetic testing requires guidance to test for what gene especially given limited resources. Monogenic diabetes should be considered in any diabetic patient who has features inconsistent with their current diagnosis (unspecified neonatal diabetes, type 1 or type 2 diabetes) and clinical features of a specific subtype of monogenic diabetes (neonatal diabetes, familial diabetes, mild hyperglycaemia, syndromes). Guidance is given by clinical and physiological features in patient and family and the likelihood of the proposed mutation altering clinical care.

392,PMC8305176,"Many approaches have been used in the effective management of type 2 diabetes mellitus. A recent paradigm shift has focused on the role of adipose tissues in the development and treatment of the disease. Brown adipose tissues (BAT) and white adipose tissues (WAT) are the two main types of adipose tissues with beige subsets more recently identified. They play key roles in communication and insulin sensitivity. However, WAT has been shown to contribute significantly to endocrine function. WAT produces hormones and cytokines, collectively called adipocytokines, such as leptin and adiponectin. These adipocytokines have been proven to vary in conditions, such as metabolic dysfunction, type 2 diabetes, or inflammation. The regulation of fat storage, energy metabolism, satiety, and insulin release are all features of adipose tissues. As such, they are indicators that may provide insights on the development of metabolic dysfunction or type 2 diabetes and can be considered routes for therapeutic considerations. The essential roles of adipocytokines vis-a-vis satiety, appetite, regulation of fat storage and energy, glucose tolerance, and insulin release, solidifies adipose tissue role in the development and pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus and the complications associated with the disease.",2021 Jul 16,Diabetes Mellitus and Its Metabolic Complications: The Role of Adipose Tissues,International Journal of Molecular Sciences
393,PMC6850413,"Copeptin is secreted in an equimolar amount to arginine vasopressin (AVP) but can easily be measured in plasma or serum with a sandwich immunoassay. The main stimuli for copeptin are similar to AVP, that is an increase in osmolality and a decrease in arterial blood volume and pressure. A high correlation between copeptin and AVP has been shown. Accordingly, copeptin mirrors the amount of AVP in the circulation. Copeptin has, therefore, been evaluated as diagnostic biomarker in vasopressin‐dependent disorders of body fluid homeostasis. Disorders of body fluid homeostasis are common and can be divided into hyper‐ and hypoosmolar circumstances: the classical hyperosmolar disorder is diabetes insipidus, while the most common hypoosmolar disorder is the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD). Copeptin measurement has led to a “revival” of the direct test in the differential diagnosis of diabetes insipidus. Baseline copeptin levels, without prior thirsting, unequivocally identify patients with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. In contrast, for the difficult differentiation between central diabetes insipidus and primary polydipsia, a stimulated copeptin level of 4.9 pmol/L upon hypertonic saline infusion differentiates these two entities with a high diagnostic accuracy and is clearly superior to the classical water deprivation test. On the contrary, in the SIAD, copeptin measurement is of only little diagnostic value. Copeptin levels widely overlap in patients with hyponatraemia and emphasize the heterogeneity of the disease. Additionally, a variety of factors lead to unspecific copeptin elevations in the acute setting further complicating its interpretation. The broad use of copeptin as diagnostic marker in hyponatraemia and specifically to detect cancer‐related disease in SIADH patients can, therefore, not be recommended.",2019 May 8,Copeptin and its role in the diagnosis of diabetes insipidus and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis,Clinical Endocrinology
394,PMC3394712,"Wolfram Syndrome (WFS) is a rare autosomal recessive disease characterized by insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, optic nerve atrophy, diabetes insipidus, deafness, and neurological dysfunction leading to death in mid-adulthood. WFS is caused by mutations in the WFS1 gene, which lead to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-mediated cell death. Case studies have found widespread brain atrophy in late stage WFS. However, it is not known when in the disease course these brain abnormalities arise, and whether there is differential vulnerability across brain regions and tissue classes. To address this limitation, we quantified regional brain abnormalities across multiple imaging modalities in a cohort of young patients in relatively early stages of WFS. Children and young adults with WFS were evaluated with neurological, cognitive and structural magnetic resonance imaging measures. Compared to normative data, the WFS group had intact cognition, significant anxiety and depression, and gait abnormalities. Compared to healthy and type 1 diabetic control groups, the WFS group had smaller intracranial volume and preferentially affected gray matter volume and white matter microstructural integrity in the brainstem, cerebellum and optic radiations. Abnormalities were detected in even the youngest patients with mildest symptoms, and some measures did not follow the typical age-dependent developmental trajectory. These results establish that WFS is associated with smaller intracranial volume with specific abnormalities in the brainstem and cerebellum, even at the earliest stage of clinical symptoms. This pattern of abnormalities suggests that WFS has a pronounced impact on early brain development in addition to later neurodegenerative effects, representing a significant new insight into the WFS disease process. Longitudinal studies will be critical for confirming and expanding our understanding of the impact of ER stress dysregulation on brain development.",2012 Jul 11,Early Brain Vulnerability in Wolfram Syndrome,PLoS ONE

We analyzed data of 90 healthy volunteers and 141 patients with polyuria–polydipsia syndrome (PPS) from two prospective studies evaluating the hypertonic saline test. Our primary outcome was the incidence rate of hypertonic saline-induced hyperkalemia > 5 mmol/L.
Participants received a 250 mL bolus of 3% NaCl solution, followed by 0.15 mL/min/kg body weight continuously infused targeting a plasma sodium level of 150 mmol/L. Blood samples and clinical data were collected every 30 min.
Of the 231 participants, 16% (n = 37/231) developed hyperkalemia. The incidence of hyperkalemia was higher in healthy volunteers and in patients with primary polydipsia (25.6% (n = 23/90) and 9.9% (n = 14/141), respectively), and only occurred in 3.4% (n = 2/59) of patients with diabetes insipidus. Hyperkalemia developed mostly at or after 90-min test duration (81.1%, n => 30/37). Predictors of hyperkalemia (OR (95% CI)) were male sex (2.9 (1.2–7.4), P => 0.02), a plasma potassium at baseline > 3.9 mmol/L (5.2 (1.8–17.3), P => 0.004), normonatremia at 30-min test duration (3.2 (1.2–9.5), P => 0.03), and an increase in potassium levels already at 30-min test duration as compared to baseline (4.5 (1.7–12.3), P => 0.003).

The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between type 2 diabetes mellitus, especially uncontrolled glycemia, and intracranial plaque characteristics using high‐resolution magnetic resonance imaging.
A total of 263 patients (182 men; mean age 62.6 ± 11.5 years) with intracranial atherosclerotic plaques detected on high‐resolution magnetic resonance imaging from December 2017 to March 2019 were included in this study. Patients were divided into different groups: (i) patients with and without type 2 diabetes mellitus; (ii) diabetes patients with uncontrolled glycemia (glycated hemoglobin level ≥7.0%) and controlled glycemia; and (iii), diabetes patients with diabetes duration of <5, 5–10 and >10 years. Comparisons of plaque features between groups were made, respectively.
Type 2 diabetes mellitus was diagnosed in 118 patients (44.9%). Diabetes patients had a significantly greater prevalence of enhanced plaque, greater maximum plaque length, maximum wall thickness and more severe luminal stenosis than non‐diabetes patients. Compared with diabetes patients with controlled glycemia, those with uncontrolled glycemia had a significantly greater prevalence of enhanced plaque and greater maximum plaque length (all P < 0.05). There were no significant differences in plaque features among patients with different durations of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Uncontrolled glycemia was an independent factor for plaque enhancement after adjustment for potential confounding factors (odds ratio 5.690; 95% confidence interval 1.748–18.526; P = 0.004).
Type 2 diabetes mellitus is closely related to intracranial plaque enhancement and burden. Recently uncontrolled glycemia might play an important role in the development of enhanced plaque.

398,PMC2908146,"While isotopes are frequently used as tracers in investigations of disease physiology (i.e., 14C labeled glucose), few studies have examined the impact that disease, and disease-related alterations in metabolism, may have on stable isotope ratios at natural abundance levels. The isotopic composition of body water is heavily influenced by water metabolism and dietary patterns and may provide a platform for disease detection. By utilizing a model of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes as an index case of aberrant water homeostasis, we demonstrate that untreated diabetes mellitus results in distinct combinations, or signatures, of the hydrogen (δ2H) and oxygen (δ18O) isotope ratios in body water. Additionally, we show that the δ2H and δ18O values of body water are correlated with increased water flux, suggesting altered blood osmolality, due to hyperglycemia, as the mechanism behind this correlation. Further, we present a mathematical model describing the impact of water flux on the isotopic composition of body water and compare model predicted values with actual values.

399,PMC7848021,"One of the complications from chronic hyperglycemia and insulin resistance due to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) on the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis in men is the high prevalence of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH). Both T2DM and hypogonadism are associated with impaired bone health and increased fracture risk but whether the combination results in even worse bone disease than either one alone is not well-studied. It is possible that having both conditions predisposes men to an even greater risk for fracture than either one alone. Given the common occurrence of HH or hypogonadism in general in T2DM, a significant number of men could be at risk. To date, there is very little information on the bone health men with both hypogonadism and T2DM. Insulin resistance, which is the primary defect in T2DM, is associated with low testosterone (T) levels in men and may play a role in the bidirectional relationship between these two conditions, which together may portend a worse outcome for bone.

However, only limited information is available regarding the contribution of diabetes mellitus to IAD and the association of IAD with individual CVDs, such as coronary artery disease (CAD), stroke, and peripheral artery disease (PAD).
Methods: We addressed these issues in this cross-sectional study of 2580 participants who had simultaneous blood pressure measurements in both arms using an automated device.
Results: Compared with 1,264 nondiabetic subjects, 1316 patients with diabetes mellitus had a greater IAD (P = 0.01) and a higher prevalence of IAD of ≥ 10 mmHg (8.4% vs. 5.4%, P = 0.002). However, such difference was not significant after the adjustment for potential confounders. Among CAD, stroke, and PAD, only PAD was significantly associated with IAD in a model adjusted for the CVD risk factors. Age was found to modify the association between IAD and PAD, with the association being more prominent in the younger subgroup.
Conclusion: Thus, diabetes mellitus itself was not an independent factor associated with IAD.

401,PMC8585622,"There are over 29,000 children and young people (CYP) with Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) in England and Wales and another 726 with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). There is little effect of deprivation on the prevalence of T1DM whereas the association of deprivation on the percentage of CYP with T2DM is striking with 45% of cases drawn from the most deprived backgrounds. A number that has not changed over the last 4 years. Data from the UK and USA as well as other countries demonstrate the impact of deprivation on outcomes in diabetes mellitus with clear effects on measures of long-term control and complications. In the UK black CYP had higher glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) values compared to other groups. Within the black group, CYP from a Caribbean background had a higher mean HbA1c (77.0 mmol/mol (9.2%)) than those from Africa (70.4 mmol/mol (8.6%)). Treatment regimen (multiple daily injections or insulin pump therapy) explained the largest proportion of the variability in HbA1c followed by deprivation. Those in the least deprived areas had an average HbA1c 5.88 mmol/mol (0.5%) lower than those living in the most deprived areas. The picture is complex as UK data also show that deprivation and ethnicity is associated with less use of technology that is likely to improve diabetes control. Increased usage of pump therapy and continuous glucose monitoring was associated with a younger age of patient (less than 10 years of age), living in the least deprived areas and white ethnicity. This gap between pump usage amongst CYP with T1DM living in the most and least deprived areas has widened with time. In 2014/15 the gap was 7.9% and by 2018/19 had increased to 13.5%.

402,PMC8407907,"Central diabetes insipidus (CDI) is a common complication after pituitary surgery. However, it is most frequently transient. It is defined by the excretion of an abnormally large volume of dilute urine with increasing serum osmolality. The reported incidence of CDI after pituitary surgery ranges from 0–90%. Large tumour size, gross total resection and intraoperative cerebrospinal fluid leak usually pose an increased risk of CDI as observed with craniopharyngioma and Rathke’s cleft cysts. CDI can be associated with high morbidity and mortality if not promptly recognised and treated on time. It is also essential to rule out other causes of postoperative polyuria to avoid unnecessary pharmacotherapy and iatrogenic hyponatremia.

404,PMC5806470,"Hypernatraemia is common in inpatients and is associated with substantial morbidity. Its differential diagnosis is challenging, and delayed treatment may have devastating consequences. The most important hormone for the regulation of water homeostasis is arginine vasopressin, and copeptin, the C-terminal portion of the precursor peptide of arginine vasopressin, might be a reliable new parameter with which to assess the underlying cause of hypernatraemia.
In this prospective, multicentre, observational study conducted in two tertiary referral centres in Switzerland, 92 patients with severe hyperosmolar hypernatraemia (Na+ > 155 mmol/L) were included. After a standardised diagnostic evaluation, the underlying cause of hypernatraemia was identified and copeptin levels were measured.
The most common aetiology of hypernatraemia was dehydration (DH) (n = 65 [71%]), followed by salt overload (SO) (n = 20 [22%]), central diabetes insipidus (CDI) (n = 5 [5%]) and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) (n = 2 [2%]). Low urine osmolality was indicative for patients with CDI and NDI (P < 0.01). Patients with CDI had lower copeptin levels than patients with DH or SO (both P < 0.01) or those with NDI. Copeptin identified CDI with an AUC of 0.99 (95% CI 0.97–1.00), and a cut-off value ≤ 4.4pmol/L showed a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 99% to predict CDI. Similarly, urea values were lower in CDI than in DH or SO (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively) or NDI. The AUC for diagnosing CDI was 0.98 (95% CI 0.96–1.00), and a cut-off value < 5.05 mmol/L showed high specificity and sensitivity for the diagnosis of CDI (98% and 100%, respectively). Copeptin and urea could not differentiate hypernatraemia induced by DH from that induced by SO (P = 0.66 and P = 0.30, respectively).
Copeptin and urea reliably identify patients with CDI and are therefore helpful tools for therapeutic management in patients with severe hypernatraemia.

405,PMC8324824,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is the leading cause of chronic kidney disease and diabetic nephropathy is widely studied. In contrast, the pathobiology of diabetic urinary bladder disease is less understood despite dysfunctional voiding being common in DM. We hypothesised that diabetic cystopathy has a characteristic molecular signature. We therefore studied bladders of hyperglycaemic and polyuric rats with streptozotocin (STZ)-induced DM. Sixteen weeks after induction of DM, as assessed by RNA arrays, wide-ranging changes of gene expression occurred in DM bladders over and above those induced in bladders of non-hyperglycaemic rats with sucrose-induced polyuria. The altered transcripts included those coding for extracellular matrix regulators and neural molecules. Changes in key genes deregulated in DM rat bladders were also detected in db/db mouse bladders. In DM rat bladders there was reduced birefringent collagen between detrusor muscle bundles, and atomic force microscopy showed a significant reduction in tissue stiffness; neither change was found in bladders of sucrose-treated rats. Thus, altered extracellular matrix with reduced tissue rigidity may contribute to voiding dysfunction in people with long-term DM. These results serve as an informative stepping stone towards understanding the complex pathobiology of diabetic cystopathy.",2021 Jul 30,Experimental long-term diabetes mellitus alters the transcriptome and biomechanical properties of the rat urinary bladder,Scientific Reports

However, MRI is more sensitive and can depict subtle injuries of the hypothalamus-pituitary axis in acute and late phases. The late MR imaging findings are not well established.

407,PMC6497773,"The relationship between glycemic variability (GV) and diabetic complications has gained much interest and remains under debate. Furthermore, the association of GV with diabetic complications has not been examined in latent autoimmune diabetes of the adult (LADA). Therefore, we evaluated the relationships among several metrics of GV with diabetic retinopathy (DR) in patients with LADA and type 2 diabetes mellitus.
A total of 192 patients with LADA and 2,927 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were enrolled. After continuous glucose monitoring for 72 h, three metrics of GV including standard deviation, coefficient of variation and mean amplitude of glycemic excursions were calculated. DR was assessed by fundus photography performed with a digital non‐mydriatic camera.
The prevalence of DR was 20.3 and 26.4% in LADA and type 2 diabetes mellitus patients (P < 0.001), respectively. Generally, LADA patients had fewer cardiometabolic risk factors than type 2 diabetes mellitus patients, and all GV metrics were significantly higher in LADA than in type 2 diabetes mellitus. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, no metrics for GV were identified as independent risk factors of DR (standard deviation: P = 0.175; coefficient of variation: P = 0.769; mean amplitude of glycemic excursions: P = 0.388) in LADA. However, the standard deviation was significantly associated with DR (OR 1.15, P = 0.017) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus after adjusting for confounders. The independent relationships of coefficient of variation and mean amplitude of glycemic excursions with DR (P = 0.194 and P = 0.251, respectively) did not reach statistical significance in type 2 diabetes mellitus.
 GV is more strongly associated with DR in type 2 diabetes than in LADA, suggesting that different glucose‐lowering strategies should be used for these two types of diabetes.",2018 Nov 7,Glycemic variability assessed by continuous glucose monitoring and the risk of diabetic retinopathy in latent autoimmune diabetes of the adult and type 2 diabetes,Journal of Diabetes Investigation
408,PMC8259382,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus and breast cancer are complex, chronic, heterogeneous, and multi-factorial diseases; with common risk factors including but not limited to diet, obesity, and age. They also share mutually inclusive phenotypic features such as the metabolic deregulations resulting from hyperglycemia, hypoxic conditions and hormonal imbalances. Although, the association between diabetes and cancer has long been speculated; however, the exact molecular nature of this link remains to be fully elucidated. Both the diseases are leading causes of death worldwide and a causal relationship between the two if not addressed, may translate into a major global health concern. Previous studies have hypothesized hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, hormonal imbalances and chronic inflammation, as some of the possible grounds for explaining how diabetes may lead to cancer initiation, yet further research still needs to be done to validate these proposed mechanisms. At the crux of this dilemma, hyperglycemia and hypoxia are two intimately related states involving an intricate level of crosstalk and hypoxia inducible factor 1, at the center of this, plays a key role in mediating an aggressive disease state, particularly in solid tumors such as breast cancer. Subsequently, elucidating the role of HIF1 in establishing the diabetes-breast cancer link on hypoxia-hyperglycemia axis may not only provide an insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the association but also, illuminate on the prognostic outcome of the therapeutic targeting of HIF1 signaling in diabetic patients with breast cancer or vice versa. Hence, this review highlights the critical role of HIF1 signaling in patients with both T2DM and breast cancer, potentiates its significance as a prognostic marker in comorbid patients, and further discusses the potential prognostic outcome of targeting HIF1, subsequently establishing the pressing need for HIF1 molecular profiling-based patient selection leading to more effective therapeutic strategies emerging from personalized medicine.",2021 Jul 5,The prognostic outcome of ‘type 2 diabetes mellitus and breast cancer’ association pivots on hypoxia-hyperglycemia axis,Cancer Cell International

Cross-sectional studies suggest tungsten (W) exposure may be associated with diabetes. We assessed longitudinal associations between urinary W and fasting glucose, 2-hour glucose, insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), β-cell function (HOMA-β), and incident type 2 diabetes.
We used data from 1,609 Hispanic and non-Hispanic White adults with 20 to 74 years of age residing in rural Colorado and participating in the San Luis Valley Diabetes Study. Urinary metal exposure values were measured at baseline and natural log-transformed. We assessed longitudinal associations between urinary W and continuous outcome measures using linear-mixed effect models and associations with incident diabetes using Fine and Gray competing risks regression models (competing event = all-cause mortality). The main adjustment set of covariates included: age, sex, ethnicity, education, smoking status, hypertension, body mass index, caloric intake, alcohol intake, and urinary creatinine levels. Secondary models were further adjusted for arsenic, cadmium, and lead exposures. We assessed whether sex or ethnicity were effect modifiers.
At baseline, the median W concentration was 0.22 μg/L (interquartile range = 0.20, 0.59). In the main cross-sectional analyses, lnW levels were significantly associated with 3% higher lnHOMA-IR (95% CI = 1 to 5). In the main longitudinal models, lnW was significantly associated with 1% higher natural log-transformed fasting glucose (95% CI = <1 to 1), 3% higher natural log-transformed HOMA-IR (95% CI = 2 to 5), and 28% higher incident diabetes (subdistribution hazard ratio=1.28, 95% CI = 1.09 to 1.50).

410,PMC7592765,"Diabetes mellitus is a complex disease that affects many organ systems, leading to concerns about deteriorating population health status and ever-increasing healthcare expenditure. Many people with diabetes do not achieve optimal glycaemic control and other metabolic indices, leading to a heightened risk of developing complications. Adequate knowledge of diabetes complications is a prerequisite for risk-factor reduction and prevention of the consequences of the disease. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the knowledge of chronic complications of diabetes among persons living with type 2 diabetes mellitus in northern Ghana.
A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted among 320 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in northern Ghana. The consecutive sampling technique was employed to recruit participants from September to November 2018. Data analysis was performed using IBM statistical package for social science version 23. Descriptive statistics such as frequencies and percentages were used. Both bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis were employed to determine associations between knowledge of diabetes complications and demographic/clinical characteristics of participants, at 95% confidence interval with statistical significance at P<0.05.
The majority of participants (54.1%) had inadequate knowledge and 45.9% had adequate knowledge of diabetes complications. The factors associated with inadequate level of knowledge were female gender [AOR = 0.29 (95%CI: 0.14–0.56), p<0.001], older age [AOR = 0.45 (95%CI:0.20–0.99), p = 0.049], primary education [AOR = 0.13 (95%CI: 0.03–0.51), p = 0.004], no formal education [AOR = 0.16 (95%CI: 0.05–0.50), p = 0.002], rural dwellers [AOR = 0.50 (95%CI: 0.27–0.95), p = 0.033] and unknown family history diabetes [AOR = 0.38 (95%CI: 0.17–0.82), p = 0.014].
More than half of the studied population had inadequate knowledge of diabetes complications. Female gender, rural dwellers, and low education level were factors positively associated with inadequate knowledge of diabetes complications. A multisectoral approach is needed, where the government of Ghana together with other sectors of the economy such as the health, education and local government sectors work collaboratively in the development of locally tailored diabetes education programmes to promote healthy self-care behaviours relevant for the prevention of diabetes and its complications.",2020 Oct 28,Knowledge of chronic complications of diabetes among persons living with type 2 diabetes mellitus in northern Ghana,PLoS ONE

We investigated the relationship between U‐pH and the development of diabetes mellitus during a 10‐year period in a general population of individuals who received annual health examinations in 2006 (n = 28,990). After exclusion of individuals with missing data, and those with diabetes mellitus and/or chronic kidney disease at baseline, a total of 12,476 individuals (men/women: 8,027/4,449) who received health examinations at least once during the period from 2007 to 2016 were recruited. The recruited individuals were divided into four groups according to their U‐pH levels: groups of U‐pH ≤5.0, 5.5, 6.0 and ≥6.5.
During a 10‐year period, 521 men (6.5%) and 132 women (3.0%) had new onset of diabetes mellitus. The cumulative incidence of diabetes mellitus was 7.5% (men/women: 9.3%/4.4%) per 100 person‐years. The hazard ratios (HRs) in the U‐pH ≤5.0 (HR 1.93) and U‐pH 5.5 groups (HR 1.46) were significantly higher than that in the U‐pH ≥6.5 group as a reference for men, but not for women. After adjustment of age, obesity, fasting glucose, smoking and alcohol drinking habits, family history of diabetes mellitus, and use of drugs for hypertension and dyslipidemia, HR in the U‐pH ≤5.0 group (HR 1.39) was significantly higher than that in the U‐pH ≥6.5 group for men, but not for women.

At the age of two, he had a single lytic bone lesion in his femoral head, diagnosed as Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) by biopsy at another hospital. As no other affected organs were detected and the affected bone lesion was self-limited, he was not followed up afterward and was doing well. He was diagnosed with diabetes insipidus (DI) by confirming hypernatremia (Na: 148 mEq/l) with hyperosmolar serum (s-Osm 298 mOSM/kg) and inappropriately diluted urine (u-Osm 205 mOSM/kg). His polyuria and polydipsia improved dramatically using the perioral diuretic hormone, and other pituitary functions were not impaired. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed an enlarged pituitary stalk. Sensitive and specific biomarkers of germ cell tumors, including alpha-fetoprotein, placental alkaline phosphatase, and β-hCG in the cerebrospinal fluid, were not detected, indicating relapse of LCH.

415,PMC6311457,"The pathomechanism of primary polydipsia is poorly understood. Recent animal data reported a connection between fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF-21) and elevated fluid intake independently of hormonal control by the hormone arginine-vasopressin (AVP) and osmotic stimulation. We therefore compared circulating FGF-21 levels in patients with primary polydipsia to patients with AVP deficiency (central diabetes insipidus) and healthy volunteers. In this prospective cohort study, we analyzed FGF-21 levels of 20 patients with primary polydipsia, 20 patients with central diabetes insipidus and 20 healthy volunteers before and after stimulation with hypertonic saline infusion targeting a plasma sodium level ≥150 mmol/L. The primary outcome was the difference in FGF-21 levels between the three groups. Baseline characteristics were similar between the groups except for patients with central diabetes insipidus being heavier. There was no difference in baseline FGF-21 levels between patients with primary polydipsia and healthy volunteers (122 pg/mL (52,277) vs 193 pg/mL (48,301), but higher levels in patients with central diabetes insipidus were observed (306 pg/mL (114,484); P = 0.037). However, this was not confirmed in a multivariate linear regression analysis after adjusting for age, sex, BMI and smoking status. Osmotic stimulation did not affect FGF-21 levels in either group (difference to baseline: primary polydipsia −23 pg/mL (−43, 22); central diabetes insipidus 17 pg/mL (−76, 88); healthy volunteers −6 pg/mL (−68, 22); P = 0.45). To conclude, FGF-21 levels are not increased in patients with primary polydipsia as compared to central diabetes insipidus or healthy volunteers. FGF-21 therefore does not seem to be causal of elevated fluid intake in these patients.",2018 Dec 4,FGF-21 levels in polyuria-polydipsia syndrome,Endocrine Connections
416,PMC4626653,"Gestational diabetes insipidus (DI) is a rare complication of pregnancy, usually developing in the third trimester and remitting spontaneously 4–6 weeks post-partum. It is mainly caused by excessive vasopressinase activity, an enzyme expressed by placental trophoblasts which metabolises arginine vasopressin (AVP). Its diagnosis is challenging, and the treatment requires desmopressin. A 38-year-old Chinese woman was referred in the 37th week of her first single-gestation due to polyuria, nocturia and polydipsia. She was known to have gestational diabetes mellitus diagnosed in the second trimester, well-controlled with diet. Her medical history was unremarkable. Physical examination demonstrated decreased skin turgor; her blood pressure was 102/63 mmHg, heart rate 78 beats/min and weight 53 kg (BMI 22.6 kg/m2). Laboratory data revealed low urine osmolality 89 mOsmol/kg (350–1000), serum osmolality 293 mOsmol/kg (278–295), serum sodium 144 mmol/l (135–145), potassium 4.1 mmol/l (3.5–5.0), urea 2.2 mmol/l (2.5–6.7), glucose 3.5 mmol/l and HbA1c 5.3%. Bilirubin, alanine transaminase, alkaline phosphatase and full blood count were normal. The patient was started on desmopressin with improvement in her symptoms, and normalisation of serum and urine osmolality (280 and 310 mOsmol/kg respectively). A fetus was delivered at the 39th week without major problems. After delivery, desmopressin was stopped and she had no further evidence of polyuria, polydipsia or nocturia. Her sodium, serum/urine osmolality at 12-weeks post-partum were normal. A pituitary magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed the neurohypophyseal T1-bright spot situated ectopically, with a normal adenohypophysis and infundibulum. She remains clinically well, currently breastfeeding, and off all medication. This case illustrates some challenges in the diagnosis and management of transient gestational DI.
Gestational DI is a rare complication of pregnancy occurring in two to four out of 100 000 pregnancies. It usually develops at the end of the second or third trimester of pregnancy and remits spontaneously 4–6 weeks after delivery.
Gestational DI occurrence is related to excessive vasopressinase activity, an enzyme expressed by placental trophoblasts during pregnancy, which metabolises AVP. Its activity is proportional to the placental weight, explaining the higher vasopressinase activity in third trimester or in multiple pregnancies.
Vasopressinase is metabolised by the liver, which most likely explains its higher concentrations in pregnant women with hepatic dysfunction, such acute fatty liver of pregnancy, HELLP syndrome, hepatitis and cirrhosis. Therefore, it is important to assess liver function in patients with gestational DI, and to be aware of the risk of DI in pregnant women with liver disease.
Serum and urine osmolality are essential for the diagnosis, but other tests such as serum sodium, glucose, urea, creatinine, liver function may be informative. The water deprivation test is normally not recommended during pregnancy because it may lead to significant dehydration, but a pituitary MRI should be performed at some point to exclude lesions in the hypothalamo-pituitary region.
These patients should be monitored for vital signs, fluid balance, body weight, fetal status, renal and liver function, and treated with desmopressin. The recommended doses are similar or slightly higher than those recommended for central DI in non-pregnant women, and should be titrated individually.",2015 Sep 23,Transient diabetes insipidus in pregnancy,"Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism Case Reports"

Symptoms of hyperglycemia and risk of ketoacidosis may be missed. Further, endocrine autoimmune disease can run together in patients and families.
A 49-year-old Caucasian female with history of pituitary adenoma and Graves’ disease with history of thyroid ablation presented in the outpatient setting due to hand tingling of her right middle finger that was worse in the mornings and improved throughout the day. She also complained of excessive thirst, finding herself drinking more water than usual and waking up in the night to urinate. There was no dysuria or haematuria, and no other neurologic symptoms. She did report feeling hungry. She had no family history of diabetes, normal body mass index of 21.7, and reported taking her thyroid replacement medication every day. The differential diagnosis for her thirst included dehydration, psychogenic polydipsia, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, and anxiety. The patient had normal vital signs and was well appearing; labs were ordered for her on her way home from clinic with no medications. Labs revealed a random blood glucose level of 249 mg/dL, normal renal function, a normal B12 of 996 pg/mL, and an elevated thyroid stimulating hormone level of 25.67 u[iU]/mL. On follow up with her primary care provider 5 days later, additional labs were drawn showing A1C of 11.5%, 1+ ketonuria, a negative Acetest, and a normal basic metabolic panel, except for a fasting glucose of 248 mg/dL, and Free T3 of 2.42 pg/mL, and Free T4 of 1.7 ng/dL. Islet cell antibodies and glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies were both positive, consistent with type 1 diabetes. She was started on insulin and improved.
Given the patient’s age, this is a less common presentation of type 1 diabetes mellitus, as a part of polyglandular autoimmune syndrome type IIIa. It serves as a reminder that clinicians should remember that patients with one autoimmune disease (in this case, h/o Graves’ disease) are at higher risk for diabetes and other endocrine autoimmune diseases and should be screened appropriately.

We present the case of a 7-year-old boy with a history of excretion of large amounts of dilute urine and polydipsia since infancy. The boy had several vomiting episodes with mild dehydration during the first 3 years of life. There was no evidence of headaches, dizziness or visual problems. He drinks between 2 and 3 L/day and has 24-hour diuresis of 2 liters, now. He has prepubertal appearance with appropriate weight [+0.85 standard deviation score (SDS)] and height (+0.15 SDS) for his age. His intelligence was also normal. The water deprivation test showed low urine osmolality after 8 hours of dehydration. After desmopressin administration, urine osmolality remained low. Serum osmolality was in the normal range for sex and age before and after desmopressin administration. This indicated a nephrogenic form of diabetes insipidus. Molecular analyses revealed a P286L [p.Pro(CCC)286Leu(CTC)] mutation in the AVPR2 gene, that was inherited from his mother.

421,PMC8713061,"X-linked nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) is caused by variations in arginine vasopressin receptor 2 (AVPR2). Some patients show partial resistance to arginine vasopressin (AVP). A 19-month-old Japanese boy presented with polydipsia since infancy. His mother had a history of polydipsia during pregnancy, and his maternal granduncle also had polydipsia. Intermediate urine osmolality and markedly high plasma AVP levels were observed in the water deprivation test. Subsequent pitressin administration caused no further elevation in urine osmolality. We diagnosed the patient with partial NDI, initiated therapy with hydrochlorothiazide, and placed him on a low-sodium diet. Although his urine volume decreased by 20–30% after the initiation of therapy, progressive hydronephrosis and growth retardation developed 2 years later. We investigated his genetic background by multiplex targeted sequencing of genes associated with inherited renal diseases, including AVPR2 and aquaporin-2 (AQP2). We identified a hemizygous missense variant in AVPR2 NM_000054:c.371A>G,p.(Tyr124Cys) in the boy and a heterozygous variant in the mother at the same locus. Distinguishing partial NDI from primary polydipsia is difficult because of its mild symptoms.

423,PMC6083024,"A stable and reproducible rat injury model is not currently available to study central diabetes insipidus (CDI) and the neurohypophyseal system. In addition, a system is needed to assess the severity of CDI and measure the accompanying neurobiological alterations. In the present study, a 3D-printed lesion knife with a curved head was designed to fit into the stereotaxic instrument. The neuro-anatomical features of the brain injury were determined by in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and arginine vasopressin (AVP) immunostaining on brain sections. Rats that underwent pituitary stalk electrical lesion (PEL) exhibited a tri-phasic pattern of CDI. MRI revealed that the hyperintenseT1-weighted signal of the pituitary stalk was interrupted, and the brain sections showed an enlarged end proximal to the injury site after PEL. In addition, the number of AVP-positive cells in supraoptic nucleus (SON) and paraventricular nucleus (PVN) decreased after PEL, which confirmed the success of the CDI model. Unlike hand-made tools, the 3D-printed lesion knives were stable and reproducible. Next, we used an ordinal clustering method for staging and the k-means’ clustering method to construct a CDI index to evaluate the severity and recovery of CDI that could be used in other multiple animals, even in clinical research.

The WFS1 gene product wolframin is located in the endoplasmic reticulum. Mice lacking this gene exhibit disturbances in the processing and secretion of peptides, such as vasopressin and insulin. In the brain, high levels of the wolframin protein have been observed in the hippocampus, amygdala, and limbic structures. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of Wfs1 knockout (KO) on peptide processing in mouse hippocampus. A peptidomic approach was used to characterize individual peptides in the hippocampus of wild-type and Wfs1 KO mice.
Results: We identified 126 peptides in hippocampal extracts and the levels of 10 peptides differed between Wfs1 KO and wild-type mice at P < 0.05. The peptide with the largest alteration was little-LEN, which level was 25 times higher in the hippocampus of Wfs1 KO mice compared to wild-type mice. Processing (cleavage) of little-LEN from the Pcsk1n gene product proSAAS involves prohormone convertase 2 (PC2). Thus, PC2 activity was measured in extracts prepared from the hippocampus of Wfs1 KO mice. The activity of PC2 in Wfs1 mutant mice was significantly higher (149.9 ± 2.3%, p < 0.0001, n = 8) than in wild-type mice (100.0 ± 7.0%, n = 8). However, Western blot analysis showed that protein levels of 7B2, proPC2 and PC2 were same in both groups, and so were gene expression levels.
Conclusion: Processing of proSAAS is altered in the hippocampus of Wfs1-KO mice, which is caused by increased activity of PC2. Increased activity of PC2 in Wfs1 KO mice is not caused by alteration in the levels of PC2 protein. Our results suggest a functional link between Wfs1 and PC2. Thus, the detailed molecular mechanism of the role of Wfs1 in the regulation of PC2 activity needs further investigation.",2015 Aug 25,Prohormone convertase 2 activity is increased in the hippocampus of Wfs1 knockout mice,Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience
425,PMC8090479,"Immune-related adverse events (irAEs) affecting the endocrine glands are among the most frequent irAEs induced by immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and include hypopituitarism, primary adrenal insufficiency, thyrotoxicosis, hypothyroidism, hypoparathyroidism, and type 1 diabetes mellitus. Since the incidence and clinical features of endocrine irAEs vary according to the ICI used, it is important to understand the characteristics of these irAEs and to manage each one appropriately. Since some endocrine irAEs, including adrenal crisis and diabetic ketoacidosis, are potentially life-threatening, predicting the risk of endocrine irAEs before their onset is critical. Several autoantibodies have been detected in patients who develop endocrine irAEs, among which anti-thyroid antibodies may be predictive biomarkers of thyroid dysfunction. In this review, we describe the clinical features of each endocrine irAE induced by ICIs and discuss their potential biomarkers, including autoantibodies.",2021 Apr 27,"Clinical Characteristics, Management, and Potential Biomarkers of Endocrine Dysfunction Induced by Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors",Endocrinology and Metabolism

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of transsphenoidal hypophysectomy in treating HST and DM in cats.
Sixty‐eight client‐owned cats with HST and DM treated by transsphenoidal hypophysectomy.
Retrospective cohort study. Medical records were reviewed for glycemic control and serum insulin‐like growth factor‐1 (IGF‐1) concentrations. Postoperative complications, death within 4 weeks, and proportion achieving diabetic remission were recorded. Survival times and DM‐free intervals were calculated.
Fifty‐eight cats (85.3%) were alive 4 weeks postoperatively with 10 (15%) postoperative deaths. Complications included hypoglycemia (n = 9), electrolyte imbalance (n = 9), and transient congestive heart failure (n = 5). Fifty‐five cats (95% of 58 surviving cats [81% of all cats undergoing surgery]) had improved control of diabetes. Diabetic remission occurred in 41 cats (71% of 58 surviving cats [60% of all cats]) with insulin administration discontinued after a median of 9 days (range, 2‐120). Postoperative 4‐week serum IGF‐1 concentration nadir was significantly lower in cats achieving diabetic remission (median 20 ng/mL [15‐708] than those that did not (324 ng/mL [15‐1955]; P = .03). All cats received long‐term levothyroxine and hydrocortisone PO, alongside desmopressin (conjunctival) in 38 of 53 cats (72%). Recurrence of DM occurred in 5 of 41 cats (12%) after a median of 248 days (range, 84‐1232). Median survival time of all cats was 853 days (range, 1‐1740).

428,PMC7744927,"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is the commonest medical complication of pregnancy. The association of GDM with immediate pregnancy complications including excess fetal growth and adiposity with subsequent risk of birth trauma and with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy is well recognized. However, the associations with wide ranges of longer-term health outcomes for mother and baby, including the lifetime risks of obesity, pre-diabetes, and diabetes and cardiovascular disease have received less attention and few health systems address these important issues in a systematic way. This article reviews historical and recent data regarding prediction of GDM using demographic, clinical, and biochemical parameters. We evaluate current and potential future diagnostic approaches designed to most effectively identify GDM and extend this analysis into a critical evaluation of lifestyle and nutritional/pharmacologic interventions designed to prevent the development of GDM. The general approach to management of GDM during pregnancy is then discussed and the major final focus of the article revolves around the importance of a GDM diagnosis as a future marker of the risk of non-communicable disease (NCD), in particular pre-diabetes, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, both in mother and offspring.",2020 Dec 3,"Gestational Diabetes Mellitus—Innovative Approach to Prediction, Diagnosis, Management, and Prevention of Future NCD—Mother and Offspring",Frontiers in Endocrinology
429,PMC5670091,"A 66-year-old Caucasian male became unconscious 2 weeks after initiation of add-on therapy with empagliflozin for poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus. The inpatient had recently suffered focal pontine stroke, rendering him bedridden and requiring increased nursing care, including assistance with drinking. The patient had received empagliflozin 10 mg once daily for glycaemic control. Investigations revealed hypernatraemia (164 mmol/l), a urine glucose level of 3935 mg/dl, and a creatinine level of 2.1 mg/dl. The patient was diagnosed with severe hypernatraemic dehydration due to iatrogenic glucosuria and prerenal kidney failure. Empagliflozin was discontinued and the patient received hypotonic fluids (including 5% dextrose and free water). Over the following 4 days, glucosuria subsided, blood sodium levels and kidney function normalized and the patient regained full consciousness. He was discharged for rehabilitation 40 days after admission. A Naranjo assessment score of 6 was obtained, indicating a probable relationship between the patient’s hypernatraemic dehydration and administration of empagliflozin. In this care-dependent inpatient, who lost the ability to replace water loss autonomously because of a stroke, continuous administration of empagliflozin caused persistent glucosuria and contributed to progressive volume depletion. Excessive dehydration resulted from ignorance of both the populations that are susceptible to dehydration under sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor therapy and the drug’s mechanism of action. In patients who depend on support from others in daily tasks, including fluid intake, patients with an impaired sense of thirst and those who have lost the ability to communicate thirst, SGLT2 inhibitor therapy should not be initiated or might be (temporarily) discontinued.",2017 Nov 3,Severe Hypernatraemic Dehydration and Unconsciousness in a Care-Dependent Inpatient Treated with Empagliflozin,Drug Safety - Case Reports
430,PMC8544345,"Preexisting diabetes mellitus (DM) should be ruled out early in pregnancy in those at risk. During screening, a significant proportion of women do not reach the threshold for overt DM but fulfill the criteria used for diagnosing conventional gestational DM (cGDM). There is no consensus on the management of pregnancies with intermediate levels of hyperglycemia thus diagnosed. We have used the term early gestational DM (eGDM) for this condition and reviewed the currently available literature. Fasting plasma glucose (FPG), oral glucose tolerance test, and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) are the commonly employed screening tools in early pregnancy. Observational studies suggest that early pregnancy FPG and Hba1c correlate with the risk of cGDM and adverse perinatal outcomes. However, specific cut-offs, including those proposed by the International Association of the Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Group, do not reliably predict the development of cGDM. Emerging data, though indicate that FPG ≥ 92 mg/dL (5.1 mmol/L), even in the absence of cGDM, signals the risk for perinatal complication. Elevated HbA1c, especially a level ≥ 5.9%, also correlates with the risk of cGDM and worsened outcome. HbA1c as a diagnostic test is however besieged with the usual caveats that occur in pregnancy. The studies that explored the effects of intervention present conflicting results, including a possibility of fetal malnutrition and small-for-date baby in the early treatment group. Diagnostic thresholds and glycemic targets in eGDM may differ, and large multicenter randomized controlled trials are necessary to define the appropriate strategy.",2021 Sep 23,Early Gestational Diabetes Mellitus: Diagnostic Strategies and Clinical Implications,Medical Sciences
431,PMC6127327,"In subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), higher stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1) expression has been related to improved insulin sensitivity in thiazolidinedione-treated type 2 diabetes mellitus patients. In animal models, deficiency of the free fatty acid receptor (FFAR) 2 associated with higher and FFAR4-deficiency with lower insulin sensitivity. We hypothesized that increased FFAR2 expression and reductions in FFAR4 and SCD1 expression in SAT of type 2 diabetes mellitus patients associate positively with insulin resistance and impaired beta cell function.
Twenty-five type 2 diabetes mellitus patients and 25 glucose-tolerant humans (CON) matched for sex, age, and BMI underwent mixed-meal tests to assess insulin sensitivity (OGIS) and beta cell function (ΔAUC(C-peptide)0–180 min/ΔAUC(glucose)0–180 min) in a cross-sectional study. Gene and protein expression of SCD1 and FFAR2/4 were quantified in SAT biopsies.
Insulin sensitivity was 14% and beta cell function 71% (both p < 0.001) lower in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients. In type 2 diabetes mellitus, SCD1 mRNA was fivefold (p < 0.001) and protein expression twofold (p < 0.01) lower. While FFAR2/4 mRNA and protein expression did not differ between groups, FFAR2 protein levels correlated negatively with beta cell function only in CON (r = −0.74, p < 0.01). However, neither SCD1 nor FFAR2/4 protein expression correlated with insulin sensitivity in both groups.

Models predicting the risk (also called predictive models) of other conditions often compare people with and without diabetes, which is of little to no relevance for people already living with diabetes (called patients). This review aims to identify and synthesize findings from existing predictive models of physical and mental health diabetes-related conditions.
We will use the scoping review frameworks developed by the Joanna Briggs Institute and Levac and colleagues. We will perform a comprehensive search for studies from Ovid MEDLINE and Embase databases. Studies involving patients with prediabetes and all types of diabetes will be considered, regardless of age and gender. We will limit the search to studies published between 2000 and 2018. There will be no restriction of studies based on country or publication language. Abstracts, full-text screening, and data extraction will be done independently by two individuals. Data abstraction will be conducted using a standard methodology. We will undertake a narrative synthesis of findings while considering the quality of the selected models according to validated and well-recognized tools and reporting standards.
Predictive models are increasingly being recommended for risk assessment in treatment decision-making and clinical guidelines. This scoping review will provide an overview of existing predictive models of diabetes complications and how to apply them.

434,PMC5813383,"The purpose of this study was to identify and analyse currently available knowledge on information needs of people with diabetes mellitus, also considering possible differences between subgroups and associated factors.
Twelve databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library were searched up until June 2015. Publications that addressed self-reported information needs of people with diabetes mellitus were included. Each study was assessed by using critical appraisal tools, e.g. from the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. Extraction and content analysis were performed systematically.
In total, 1993 publications were identified and 26 were finally included. Nine main categories of information needs were identified, including ‘treatment-process’, ‘course of disease’, ‘abnormalities of glucose metabolism’ and ‘diabetes through the life cycle’. Differences between patient subgroups, such as type of diabetes or age, were sparsely analysed. Some studies analysed associations between information needs and factors such as participation preferences or information seeking. They found, for example, that information needs on social support or life tasks were associated with information seeking in Internet forums.
Information needs in people with diabetes mellitus, appear to be high, yet poorly investigated. Research is needed regarding differences between diverse diabetes populations, including gender aspects or changes in information needs during the disease course.

High-dose dexamethasone (8 mg) was administered followed by hydrocortisone, thyroxine and topical testosterone replacement. Two weeks post administration of the third cycle, he became unwell with lethargy, weight loss and nocturia. Central diabetes insipidus was diagnosed on the basis of symptoms and sodium of 149 mmol/L (135–145 mmol/L). Desmopressin nasal spray was instituted with symptom resolution and normalization of serum sodium. Three weeks later, he presented again polyuric and polydipsic. His capillary glucose was 20.8 mmol/L (ketones of 2.4 mmol), low C-peptide 0.05 nmol/L (0.4–1.5 nmol/L) and HbA1c of 7.7%. T1DM was suspected, and he was commenced on an insulin infusion with rapid symptom resolution. Insulin antibodies glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), insulin antibody-2 (IA-2) and zinc transporter-8 (ZnT8) were negative. A follow-up MRI pituitary revealed findings consistent with recovering autoimmune hypophysitis. Immunotherapy was discontinued based on the extent of these autoimmune endocrinopathies.
The most effective regime for treatment of metastatic melanoma is combination immunotherapy with nivolumab and ipilumimab, and this therapy is associated with a high incidence of autoimmune endocrinopathies.

439,PMC4579387,"Canine diabetes is a common endocrine disorder with an estimated breed-related prevalence ranging from 0.005% to 1.5% in pet dogs. Increased prevalence in some breeds suggests that diabetes in dogs is influenced by genetic factors and similarities between canine and human diabetes phenotypes suggest that the same genes might be associated with disease susceptibility in both species. Between 1-5% of human diabetes cases result from mutations in a single gene, including maturity onset diabetes of the adult (MODY) and neonatal diabetes mellitus (NDM). It is not clear whether monogenic forms of diabetes exist within some dog breeds. Identification of forms of canine monogenic diabetes could help to resolve the heterogeneity of the condition and lead to development of breed-specific genetic tests for diabetes susceptibility.
Seventeen dog breeds were screened for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in eighteen genes that have been associated with human MODY/NDM. Six SNP associations were found from five genes, with one gene (ZFP57) being associated in two different breeds.
Some of the genes that have been associated with susceptibility to MODY and NDM in humans appear to also be associated with canine diabetes, although the limited number of associations identified in this study indicates canine diabetes is a heterogeneous condition and is most likely to be a polygenic trait in most dog breeds.

A cross-sectional study was conducted among 567 adult diabetic patients selected at random from the out-patient departments of multiple healthcare institutions in Karachi categorized into two settings; Government and Private. Non-diabetics, patients having gestational diabetes, diabetes insipidus and Cushing’s syndrome and terminally ill patients were excluded. Pearson Chi-square and Mann-Whitney U test were applied as the primary statistical method.
Prevalence of home glucometer usage was 59% (n= 331).

H. pylori infection was found in 73.11% of diabetic patients versus 58.05% in non-diabetic participants, this difference was found to be significant (OR = 1.472, p = 0.0279). This relationship persists even when adjusted to factors such as age and income level of participants. Infected participants from age group ≥ 55 years and those with high income were those with a higher risk to develop diabetes. Infected patients with high BMI were more prone to develops diabetic mellitus compared with infected patients with normal BMI (p = 0.0034).

446,PMC6805520,"Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic disease closely related to personal life style. Therefore, achieving effective self-management is one of the most important ways to control it. There is evidence that social support can help to improve the self-management ability of patients with T2DM, but which social support is more effective has been rarely explored. The purpose of this study is to construct an integrated model to analyze which social support has more significant impact on self-management of T2DM, and provide reasonable suggestions to health care providers on how to effectively play the role of social support.
We established a social support indicator evaluation system and proposed an integrated model that combines ANP (Analytical Network Process) and CRITIC (CRiteria Importance through Intercriteria Correlation) methods to evaluate the impact of social support on T2DM self-management from both subjective and objective perspectives. The weights calculated by the model will serve as the basis for us to judge the importance of different social support indicators.
Informational support (weighting 49.26%) is the most important criteria, followed by tangible support (weighting 39.24%) and emotional support (weighting 11.51%). Among 11 sub-criteria, guidance (weighting 23.05%) and feedback (weighting 14.68%) are two most relevant with T2DM self-management. This result provides ideas and evidence for health care providers on how to offer more effective social support.
To our knowledge, this is the first study in which Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) tools, specifically ANP and CRITIC, are used to evaluate the impact of social support on improving self-management of type 2 diabetes. The study suggests that incorporating two sub-indicators of guidance and feedback into the diabetes care programs may have great potential to improve T2DM self-management and further control patient blood glucose and reduce complications.",2019 Oct 22,An integrated model to evaluate the impact of social support on improving self-management of type 2 diabetes mellitus,BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making
447,PMC6590966,"The purpose of this study was first, to examine perceived diabetes risk compared with actual diabetes risk in the general population and second, to investigate which factors determine whether persons at increased actual risk also perceive themselves at elevated risk.
The study comprised adults (aged 18–97 years) without known diabetes from a nationwide survey on diabetes-related knowledge and information needs in Germany in 2017. Actual diabetes risk was calculated by an established risk score estimating the 5-year probability of developing type 2 diabetes and was compared with perceived risk of getting diabetes over the next 5 years (response options: 'almost no risk', 'slight risk', 'moderate risk', 'high risk'; n = 2327). Among adults with an increased actual diabetes risk (n=639), determinants of perceived risk were investigated using multivariable logistic regression analysis.
Across groups with a 'low' (<2%), 'still low' (2% to<5%), 'elevated' (5% to <10%), and 'high' (≥10%) actual diabetes risk, a proportion of 89.0%, 84.5%, 79.3%, and 78.9%, respectively, perceived their diabetes risk as almost absent or slight. Among those with an increased (elevated/high) actual risk, independent determinants of an increased (moderate/high) perceived risk included younger age (OR 0.92 (95% CI 0.88 to 0.96) per year), family history of diabetes (2.10 (1.06–4.16)), and being informed about an increased diabetes risk by a physician (3.27 (1.51–7.07)), but none of further diabetes risk factors, healthcare behaviors or beliefs about diabetes.
Across categories of actual diabetes risk, perceived diabetes risk was low, even if actual diabetes risk was high. For effective strategies of primary diabetes prevention, attention should be directed to risk communication at the population level as well as in primary care practice.",2019 Jun 21,Perceived diabetes risk and related determinants in individuals with high actual diabetes risk: results from a nationwide population-based survey,BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care

449,PMC7325532,"To assess the real-world management practices of subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) in India.
This cross-sectional study was conducted between 7 March 2016 and 15 May 2016 in India as part of the seventh wave (2016) of the International Diabetes Management Practices Study (IDMPS). Adult subjects with T1DM or T2DM visiting physicians during a 2-week recruitment period were included.
A total of 55 physicians included 539 subjects who met eligibility criteria. Of 495 subjects with T2DM, 303 were treated with oral glucose lowering drugs (OGLDs) only, 158 were treated with OGLD + insulin, and 27 received insulin only. Among 44 subjects with T1DM receiving insulin, 13 (29.5%) were also treated with OGLD therapy. The most commonly used insulin regimens were basal alone (69/184; 37.5%) and premixed alone (63/184; 34.2%) in subjects with T2DM, and basal + prandial insulin (24/44; 54.5%) in subjects with T1DM. Proportions of subjects achieving glycemic targets were low [glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) <7%: T1DM = 7.3% (3/44), T2DM = 25.2% (106/495); as targeted by the treating physician: T1DM = 31.8% (14/44), T2DM = 32.1% (59/185); global target: T1DM = 4.8% (2/42) and T2DM = 1.7% (8/482)]. In subjects with T2DM, HbA1c <7% was noted in 11/22 subjects receiving insulin only and 76/260 receiving only OGLDs.

450,PMC6295048,"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a of the major public health issues in Asia. The present study aimed to determine the prevalence of, and risk factors for GDM in Asia via a systematic review and meta-analysis.
We systematically searched PubMed, Ovid, Scopus and ScienceDirect for observational studies in Asia from inception to August 2017. We selected cross sectional studies reporting the prevalence and risk factors for GDM. A random effects model was used to estimate the pooled prevalence of GDM and odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI).
Eighty-four studies with STROBE score ≥ 14 were included in our analysis. The pooled prevalence of GDM in Asia was 11.5% (95% CI 10.9–12.1). There was considerable heterogeneity (I2 > 95%) in the prevalence of GDM in Asia, which is likely due to differences in diagnostic criteria, screening methods and study setting. Meta-analysis demonstrated that the risk factors of GDM include history of previous GDM (OR 8.42, 95% CI 5.35–13.23); macrosomia (OR 4.41, 95% CI 3.09–6.31); and congenital anomalies (OR 4.25, 95% CI 1.52–11.88). Other risk factors include a BMI ≥25 kg/m2 (OR 3.27, 95% CI 2.81–3.80); pregnancy-induced hypertension (OR 3.20, 95% CI 2.19–4.68); family history of diabetes (OR 2.77, 2.22–3.47); history of stillbirth (OR 2.39, 95% CI 1.68–3.40); polycystic ovary syndrome (OR 2.33, 95% CI1.72–3.17); history of abortion (OR 2.25, 95% CI 1.54–3.29); age ≥ 25 (OR 2.17, 95% CI 1.96–2.41); multiparity ≥2 (OR 1.37, 95% CI 1.24–1.52); and history of preterm delivery (OR 1.93, 95% CI 1.21–3.07).
We found a high prevalence of GDM among the Asian population. Asian women with common risk factors especially among those with history of previous GDM, congenital anomalies or macrosomia should receive additional attention from physician as high-risk cases for GDM in pregnancy.

451,PMC5330113,"Hypophysitis is an umbrella term for a group of disorders involving inflammation of the pituitary gland. A rare occurrence in humans, hypophysitis can produce a range of clinical signs including (but not limited to) visual deficits and diabetes insipidus. Only five cases of canine hypophysitis exist in the literature, all presenting in mature dogs with no visual deficits and a grave outcome. This case report describes the clinical and advanced imaging features of blindness-inducing presumptive hypophysitis in a dog, which rapidly resolved with medical management.
A 1-year-and-seven-month-old neutered male Standard Poodle presented with subacute blindness, ataxia, and polyuria/polydipsia (PUPD). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) detected a contrast-enhancing pituitary mass with perilesional oedema compromising the optic chiasm. Suspecting neoplasia, anti-inflammatory corticosteroid was commenced prior to radiation therapy planning. Complete resolution of neurological and visual deficits occurred within 12 days of starting steroid treatment. Repeated advanced imaging indicated macroscopic resolution of the lesion. An extended thyroid panel with insulin-like growth factor-1 analysis supported a diagnosis of hypophysitis. Resolution of PUPD was achieved with tapering courses of prednisolone and desmopressin; the dog has since been clinically normal for 14 months and treatment-free for 11 months.
To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first instance in which a canine pituitary mass has demonstrated long-term resolution with palliative medical treatment alone, alongside reversal of associated blindness and presumptive diabetes insipidus. We suspect this lesion to be a form of hypophysitis, which should be included among differential diagnoses for pituitary masses, and for subacute blindness in dogs. Where possible, we advocate biopsy-confirmation of hypophysitis prior to timely intervention with anti-inflammatory treatment.",2017 Feb 28,Restored vision in a young dog following corticosteroid treatment of presumptive hypophysitis,BMC Veterinary Research

One of the most lethal and prevalent chronic diseases is diabetes mellitus, which is characterized by dysfunction of glucose homeostasis.
The objective of this paper is to review recent efforts to use artificial intelligence techniques to assist in the management of diabetes, along with the associated challenges.
A review of the literature was conducted using PubMed and related bibliographic resources. Analyses of the literature from 2010 to 2018 yielded 1849 pertinent articles, of which we selected 141 for detailed review.
We propose a functional taxonomy for diabetes management and artificial intelligence. Additionally, a detailed analysis of each subject category was performed using related key outcomes. This approach revealed that the experiments and studies reviewed yielded encouraging results.
We obtained evidence of an acceleration of research activity aimed at developing artificial intelligence-powered tools for prediction and prevention of complications associated with diabetes.

453,PMC4241302,"A 73-year-old woman admitted to our hospital because of headache, poor appetite, malaise, weight loss, and vomiting was found to have central adrenal insufficiency and thyrotoxicosis due to silent thyroiditis. Polyuria developed after replacement with glucocorticoid (masked diabetes insipidus), which was controlled with nasal administration of desmopressin. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed a large cystic pituitary mass (18 × 18 × 12 mm) extending suprasellarly to the optic chiasm. Transsphenoidal surgery revealed that the pituitary tumor was Rathke's cleft cyst. Following surgery, replacement with neither glucocorticoid nor desmopressin was needed any more. Therefore, it is suggested that Rathke's cleft cyst is responsible for the masked diabetes insipidus and the central insufficiency.

Analysis of the mutant receptor in Madin-Darby Canine Kidney cell culture revealed that AVPR2-L170P was retained in the endoplasmic reticulum, and the expression was dramatically downregulated compared to wild-type AVPR2. Inhibition of the lysosome resulted in increased intracellular accumulation of AVPR2-L170P, indicating that AVPR2-L170P is downregulated via the lysosome.

All patients (aged 0–18 years) with diabetes mellitus underwent biochemical, immunological and genetic testing. American Diabetes Association guidelines were used to classify types of diabetes mellitus. The incidence and prevalence of all the different types of diabetes mellitus were calculated.
Total number of children with diabetes mellitus was 1,325 (type 1 n = 1,096, ≥1 antibody; type 2 n = 104, type 1B n = 53; maturity onset diabetes of the young n = 20; monogenic autoimmune n = 4; neonatal diabetes mellitus n = 10;, syndromic diabetes mellitus n = 23; and double diabetes mellitus n = 15). The incidence and prevalence of type 1 diabetes were 38.05 and 249.73 per 100,000, respectively, and for type 2 were 2.51 and 23.7 per 100,000, respectively. The incidence of neonatal diabetes mellitus was 34.4 per 1,000,000 live births, and in indigenous Qataris the incidence was 43.6 per 1,000,000 live births. The prevalence of type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes in Qatari children was double compared with other nationalities. The prevalence of maturity onset diabetes of the young in Qatar was 4.56 per 100,000.
This is the first prospective and comprehensive study to document the epidemiology and genetic landscape of childhood diabetes mellitus in this region. Qatar has the fourth highest incidence of type 1 diabetes mellitus, with the incidence and prevalence being higher in Qatari compared with non‐Qatari. The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus is also higher in Qatar than in Western countries. The incidence of neonatal diabetes mellitus is the second highest in the world. GCK is the most common form of maturity onset diabetes of the young, and a large number of patients have type 1B diabetes mellitus.
This is the first comprehensive, prospective study from the Middle East North Africa region to systematically study the causes of diabetes in every child in the State of Qatar. The State of Qatar has the fourth highest incidence of type 1 diabetes in the world. The incidence of type 2 diabetes is much higher in Qatar than in Western countries. Both type 1 and type 2 diabetes are more common in the Qatari population than the non‐Qatari population.

The patient was not treated with steroids and is well controlled with antidiuretic hormones. It has been reported that pediatric IgG4-RH differs from that of adults in several respects. We believe that the pediatric IgG4-RH may not fit the diagnostic criteria of adults. There may be also other cases of increased serum IgG4 levels in pediatric patients with idiopathic CDI.

We populated it with 628 published disease‐associated variants (December 2016) for: WFS1 (n = 309), CISD2 (n = 3), ALMS1 (n = 268), and SLC19A2 (n = 48) for Wolfram type 1, Wolfram type 2, Alström, and Thiamine‐responsive megaloblastic anemia syndromes, respectively; and included 23 previously unpublished novel germline variants in WFS1 and 17 variants in ALMS1. We then investigated genotype–phenotype relations for the WFS1 gene. The presence of biallelic loss‐of‐function variants predicted Wolfram syndrome defined by insulin‐dependent diabetes and optic atrophy, with a sensitivity of 79% (95% CI 75%–83%) and specificity of 92% (83%–97%). The presence of minor loss‐of‐function variants in WFS1 predicted isolated diabetes, isolated deafness, or isolated congenital cataracts without development of the full syndrome (sensitivity 100% [93%–100%]; specificity 78% [73%–82%]). The ability to provide a prognostic prediction based on genotype will lead to improvements in patient care and counseling.

We also investigated correlation between levels of liver enzymes and some components of MS in both groups of patients.
This cross-sectional study included 96 patients (age 47–83 years) with T2DM. All patients were divided according to the criteria of the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) in two groups: 50 patients with T2 DM and MS (T2DM-MS) and 46 patients with T2DM without MS (T2DM-Non MS). The analysis included blood pressure monitoring and laboratory tests: fasting blood glucose (FBG), total lipoprotein cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), triglyceride (TG), fibrinogen and liver enzymes: GGT, ALT and AST. T2DM-MS group included patients which had FBG ≥ 6,1 mmol/L, TG ≥ 1,7 mmol/L and blood pressure ≥ 130/85 mm Hg.
T2DM-MS patients had significant higher values of systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure and medium arterial pressure compared to T2DM-Non MS patients. Serum levels of TC, TG, LDL-C, VLDL-C and FBG were significantly higher in the T2DM-MS group compared to the T2DM-Non MS group. Serum fibrinogen level and GGT level were significantly higher in patients with T2DM-MS compared to the serum fibrinogen level and GGT level in T2DM-Non MS patients. Mean serum AST and ALT level were higher, but not significantly, in patients with T2DM and MS compared to the patients with T2DM without MS. Significant negative correlations were observed between TC and AST (r= -0,28, p<0,05), as well as between TC and ALT level (r= -0,29, p<0,05) in T2DM-MS group of patients.
These results suggest that patients with T2DM and MS have markedly elevated liver enzymes. T2DM and MS probably play a role in increasing the risk of liver injury.",2015 Aug 4,Metabolic Syndrome and Serum Liver Enzymes Level at Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus,Medical Archives
460,PMC8784703,"We report a case of pituitary metastasis (PM) presenting with acute anterior and posterior pituitary dysfunction following a two-decade-long oncologic course marked by disease progression.
An elderly woman with a history of stage IIA invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast presented with confusion. Her laboratory evaluation was significant for panhypopituitarism and central diabetes insipidus, and magnetic resonance imaging findings were suggestive of PM. She was treated with hormone replacement, resulting in the reversal of her metabolic and cognitive derangements.
PM is a rare complication of advanced malignancy. Although several malignancies may spread to the pituitary, the most common are breast cancer in women and lung cancer in men. Unlike pituitary adenomas, which predominantly involve the anterior pituitary, PM has a predilection for the posterior lobe and infundibulum due to direct access via systemic circulation. The clinical presentation of PM depends on the size of the metastatic deposit and other structures involved in the vicinity of the sella. Magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium is the gold standard for the evaluation of sellar masses. The diagnosis of PM involves a thorough history, physical examination, biochemical evaluation of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, and imaging studies.
Metastatic involvement of the pituitary is a rare condition seen in <2% of resected pituitary masses. The clinical presentation is heterogeneous and can include headache, visual impairment, and panhypopituitarism. Unfortunately, the presence of PM portends a poor prognosis, and the median survival rate after diagnosis is 6 to 13.6 months.",2021 Jun 16,Pituitary Metastasis Presenting With Central Diabetes Insipidus and Panhypopituitarism,AACE Clinical Case Reports

To increase the awareness and monitoring for transient and symptomatic DI in children with partial hypopituitarism during periods in which increased GC needs are required. Methods/Case. A 2-month-old female infant with septo-optic dysplasia (SOD; on thyroid and maintenance GC replacement therapy at 8 mg/m2/day) developed transient DI during 2 separate episodes of stress (one hypothermia, one febrile) when stress dosing of GC (25 mg/m2/day) was instituted. Conclusion. Children not diagnosed with DI during initial evaluation for hypopituitarism may benefit from rescreening of serum sodium levels during acute periods of stress that demand ""stress"" GC dosing.

463,PMC3368392,"Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus results in osmotic diuresis. Diabetic patients have lowered nitric oxide (NO) which may exacerbate polyuria. We examined how lack of NO affects the transporters involved in urine concentration in diabetic animals. Diabetes was induced in rats by streptozotocin. Control and diabetic rats were given L-NAME for 3 weeks. Urine osmolality, urine output, and expression of urea and water transporters and the Na-K-2Cl cotransporter were examined. Predictably, diabetic rats presented with polyuria (increased urine volume and decreased urine osmolality). Although metabolic parameters of control rats were unaffected by L-NAME, treated diabetic rats produced 30% less urine and osmolality was restored. UT-A1 and UT-A3 were significantly increased in diabetic rat inner medulla. While L-NAME treatment alone did not alter UT-A1 or UT-A3 abundance, absence of NO prevented the upregulation of both transporters in diabetic rats. Similarly, AQP2 and NKCC2 abundance was increased in diabetic animals however, expression of these transporters were unchanged by L-NAME treatment of diabetes. Increased expression of the concentrating transporters observed in diabetic rats provides a compensatory mechanism to decrease solute loss despite persistent glycosuria. Our studies found that although diabetic-induced glycosylation remained increased, total protein expression was decreased to control levels in diabetic rats treated with L-NAME. While the role of NO in urine concentration remains unclear, lowered NO associated with diabetes may be deleterious to the transporters’ response to the subsequent osmotic diuresis.",2012 Jun 6,The Role of Nitric Oxide in the Dysregulation of the Urine Concentration Mechanism in Diabetes Mellitus,Frontiers in Physiology

A PubMed search of select medical subject heading (MeSH) terms was carried out to identify all studies reporting findings about VEGF expression in periodontal tissues of diabetic patients up to May 2018. The inclusion criteria were studies on VEGF expression in periodontally diseased tissues of diabetic patients compared with nondiabetic subjects, with any method of analysis, and published in the English language. Results: Eight articles met the inclusion criteria. Immunohistochemistry was used in six of the studies, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (real-time RT-PCR) aiming to quantify mRNA VEGF expression was used in one study, and ELISA analysis was used for one study. Compared with nondiabetic patients, a higher VEGF expression in gingival tissue and gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) samples in diabetic patients with periodontitis was reported. Conclusions: Overall, novel evidence for the VEGF expression within the periodontal tissue of diabetic patients paves the way for further studies on the role of this protein in neovascularization physiology and pathophysiology in microvasculature of the periodontium.",2020 Apr 16,Does Diabetes Induce the Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) Expression in Periodontal Tissues?

467,PMC3956997,"Ifosfamide-induced Fanconi syndrome is a rare complication that typically occurs in young patients due to a cumulative dose of ifosfamide > 40-60 g/m2, a reduction in kidney mass, or concurrent cisplatin treatment. It is usually characterized by severe and fatal progression accompanied by type II proximal renal tubular dysfunction, as evidenced by glycosuria, proteinuria, electrolyte loss, and metabolic acidosis. Diabetes insipidus is also a rare complication of ifosfamide-induced renal disease. We herein describe a case involving a 61-year-old man who developed ifosfamide-induced Fanconi syndrome accompanied by diabetes insipidus only a few days after the first round of chemotherapy. He had no known risk factors. In addition, we briefly review the mechanisms and possible therapeutic options for this condition based on other cases in the literature. Patients who receive ifosfamide must be closely monitored for renal impairment to avoid this rare but fatal complication.",2014 Feb 27,Ifosfamide-induced Fanconi syndrome with diabetes insipidus,The Korean Journal of Internal Medicine

Besides genetic, environmental and infectious causes, several endocrine and metabolic abnormalities are associated with varying degrees of hearing impairment. The pattern of hearing loss may be conductive, sensori-neural or mixed. The neurophysiology of hearing as well as the anatomical structure of the auditory system may be influenced by changes in the hormonal and metabolic milieu. Optimal management of these conditions requires the integrated efforts of the otolaryngologist and the endocrinologist.

469,PMC7098606,"Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder resulting from either loss of insulin producing cells, insufficient insulin action, or both. Knowledge can play an important role in preventing diabetes mellitus and its complications. There is limited information regarding knowledge and related factors regarding diabetes mellitus among non-diabetic adult community members in the study area. Therefore, the current study aimed to determine knowledge and associated factors towards diabetes mellitus among non-diabetes community members of Gondar city.
Community-based cross-sectional study was conducted on non-diabetic community members from July 1–29, 2019 in Gondar city. The participants were selected randomly from each households. A structured questionnaire was used to collect the data. EpiData version 3.1 was used for data entry and SPSS version 20 was used for data processing and analysis. Descriptive statistics were calculated for most variables. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify the associated factors. A variable was considered significantly associated at p-value<0.05.
A total of 633 study subjects participated in this study with a mean age of 36.12 (± 12.87) years. Of these study participants, 572 had awareness about diabetes mellitus and 51.4% (95% CI: 47.4%, 55.8%) had good knowledge. Being male [Adjusted odds ratio = 1.62 (95% CI: 1.05, 2.48)], monthly income of 3000–5000 birr [Adjusted odds ratio = 1.88 (95% CI: 1.03, 3.41)], monthly income of ≥5001 birr [Adjusted odds ratio = 2.37 (95% CI: 1.17, 4.78)], previous training on diabetes mellitus [Adjusted odds ratio = 4.37 (95% CI; 3.04, 7.37)], being grade 9–12 [Adjusted odds ratio = 3.1 (95% CI: 1.09, 8.66)], having college and above educational qualification [Adjusted odds ratio = 3.70 (95% CI: 1.26, 10.85)] were significantly associated with good knowledge towards diabetes mellitus.

470,PMC5472967,"Recently, basic and clinical studies have provided evidence supporting the relationship between circulating levels of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 23 and the development of atherosclerosis. Given that diabetes is an established risk factor for lower extremity atherosclerotic disease (LEAD), the goal of the present study was to explore the relationship between serum FGF23 levels and LEAD, as well as the related factors, in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
A total of 401 hospitalized T2DM patients (201 subjects with LEAD and 200 subjects without LEAD) were enrolled in this study. Serum FGF23 levels were determined by a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Femoral intima-media thickness (F-IMT) and lower limb atherosclerotic plaque were assessed through color Doppler ultrasound.
The median (interquartile range) serum FGF23 levels in the entire study population was 42.08 (35.59–49.17) pg/mL. Subjects with LEAD had significantly higher serum FGF23 levels compared with those without LEAD (44.00 [37.54–51.30] pg/mL versus 40.42 [32.61–48.23] pg/mL, P < 0.001). Logistic regression showed that serum FGF23 levels were independently and positively correlated with the presence of LEAD (odds ratio 1.039, 95% confidence interval 1.012–1.067, P = 0.004). In addition, multiple liner regression analysis revealed that serum FGF23 levels were positively associated with F-IMT (standardized β = 0.175, P < 0.001). Furthermore, this relationship remained significant after additional adjustment for gender and factors potentially affecting serum FGF23 levels (serum calcium, serum phosphorus, and glomerular filtration rate), respectively (both P < 0.01).

A 16‐year‐old female was diagnosed with diabetes by her family doctor and was referred to our institution for genetic examination. Genetic testing revealed a novel RFX6 heterozygous mutation (NM_173560: exon17: c.1954C>T: p.R652X) in the patient and in her mother and brother. She had no islet‐specific autoantibodies and showed a reduced meal‐induced response of insulin, glucose‐dependent insulinotropic polypeptide, and glucagon‐like peptide‐1, which is consistent with the phenotype of MODY due to heterozygous RFX6 mutation. In conclusion, we report a case of MODY due to a novel heterozygous mutation, p.R652X.

472,PMC7784174,"The study aims to determine the association of diabetes-related emotional distress with reported diabetes self-care, and glycemic control of adult Filipinos with type 2 diabetes mellitus at The Medical City using 2 psychometric tests.
This is a cross-sectional study conducted among 94 Filipinos diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus, who answered 2 validated English questionnaires: Problem areas in diabetes (PAID-20) and Diabetes self-management questionnaire (DSMQ) that screen for diabetes-related emotional distress and diabetes reported self-care, respectively. Data were encoded and analyzed using Stata SE v.13.
42.6% of Filipinos with type 2 diabetes mellitus had emotional distress showing moderate to severe distress in factor 1 (diabetes-related emotional distress) and factor 3 (food related problems). 51.1% had suboptimal self-care, poorly scoring in areas of health-care use and dietary control. Majority of those who had diabetes-related distress and poor self-care where young, pre-obese and had diabetes duration of ±5 years. There was no significant association between diabetes-related emotional distress with diabetes self-care and emotional distress with glycated hemoglobin, but majority of those who had diabetes distress had higher glycated hemoglobin. There was significant association between diabetes self-care and glycemic outcomes (p=0.006) with relative risk of 1.51 (95% CI 1.10-2.07). There was linear inverse weak correlation between all subdomains of DSMQ with glycated hemoglobin except Dietary Control.

473,PMC3893423,"Prevalence studies usually depend on self-report of disease status in survey data or administrative data collections and may over- or under-estimate disease prevalence. The establishment of a linked data collection provided an opportunity to explore the accuracy and completeness of capture of information about diabetes in survey and administrative data collections.
Baseline questionnaire data at recruitment to the 45 and Up Study was obtained for 266,848 adults aged 45 years and over sampled from New South Wales, Australia in 2006–2009, and linked to administrative data about hospitalisation from the Admitted Patient Data Collection (APDC) for 2000–2009, claims for medical services (MBS) and pharmaceuticals (PBS) from Medicare Australia data for 2004–2009. Diabetes status was determined from response to a question ‘Has a doctor EVER told you that you have diabetes’ (n = 23,981) and augmented by examination of free text fields about diagnosis (n = 119) or use of insulin (n = 58). These data were used to identify the sub-group with type 1 diabetes. We explored the agreement between self-report of diabetes, identification of diabetes diagnostic codes in APDC data, claims for glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) in MBS data, and claims for dispensed medication (oral hyperglycaemic agents and insulin) in PBS data.
Most participants with diabetes were identified in APDC data if admitted to hospital (79.3%), in MBS data with at least one claim for HbA1c testing (84.7%; 73.4% if 2 tests claimed) or in PBS data through claim for diabetes medication (71.4%). Using these alternate data collections as an imperfect ‘gold standard’ we calculated sensitivities of 83.7% for APDC, 63.9% (80.5% for two tests) for MBS, and 96.6% for PBS data and specificities of 97.7%, 98.4% and 97.1% respectively. The lower sensitivity for HbA1c may reflect the use of this test to screen for diabetes suggesting that it is less useful in identifying people with diabetes without additional information. Kappa values were 0.80, 0.70 and 0.80 for APDC, MBS and PBS respectively reflecting the large population sample under consideration. Compared to APDC, there was poor agreement about identifying type 1 diabetes status.

474,PMC6329046,"Serum haptoglobin (Hp) has been closely associated with cardio-cerebrovascular diseases. We investigated a metabolic profile associated with circulating Hp and carotid arterial functions via a targeted metabolomics approach to provide insight into potential mechanisms.
A total of 240 participants, including 120 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and 120 non-diabetes mellitus (non-DM) subjects were recruited in this study. Targeted metabolic profiles of serum metabolites were determined using an AbsoluteIDQ™ p180 Kit (BIOCRATES Life Sciences AG, Innsbruck, Austria). Ultrasound of the bilateral common carotid artery was used to measure intima-media thickness and inter-adventitial diameter. Serum Hp levels were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
Serum Hp levels in T2DM patients and non-DM subjects were 103.40 (72.46, 131.99) mg/dL and 100.20 (53.99, 140.66) mg/dL, respectively. Significant differences of 19 metabolites and 17 metabolites were found among serum Hp tertiles in T2DM patients and non-DM subjects, respectively (P < 0.05). Of these, phosphatidylcholine acyl-alkyl C32:2 (PC ae C32:2) was the common metabolite observed in two populations, which was associated with the serum Hp groups and lipid traits (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the metabolite ratios of two acidic amino acids, including aspartate to PC ae C32:2 (Asp/PC ae C32:2) and glutamate to PC ae C32:2 (Glu/PC ae C32:2) were correlated with serum Hp, carotid arterial functions and other biochemical index in both populations significantly (P < 0.05).
Targeted metabolomics analyses might provide a new insight into the potential mechanisms underlying the association between serum Hp and carotid arterial functions.

The role played by mitochondria remains elusive, with contradictory results on the occurrence of mitochondrial dysfunction. We evaluated 13 recessive WS patients by deep clinical phenotyping, including optical coherence tomography (OCT), serum lactic acid at rest and after standardized exercise, brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging, and brain and muscle Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS). Finally, we investigated mitochondrial bioenergetics, network morphology, and calcium handling in patient-derived fibroblasts. Our results do not support a primary mitochondrial dysfunction in WS patients, as suggested by MRS studies, OCT pattern of retinal nerve fiber layer loss, and, in fibroblasts, by mitochondrial bioenergetics and network morphology results. However, we clearly found calcium mishandling between endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria, which, under specific metabolic conditions of increased energy requirements and in selected tissue or cell types, may turn into a secondary mitochondrial dysfunction. Critically, we showed that Wolframin (WFS1) protein is enriched at mitochondrial-associated ER membranes and that in patient-derived fibroblasts WFS1 protein is completely absent. These findings support a loss-of-function pathogenic mechanism for missense mutations in WFS1, ultimately leading to defective calcium influx within mitochondria.",2020 Mar 16,Calcium mishandling in absence of primary mitochondrial dysfunction drives cellular pathology in Wolfram Syndrome,Scientific Reports

477,PMC6280332,"Congenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (CNDI) is a rare inherited disorder characterized by a renal insensitivity to arginine vasopressin (AVP). In the majority of the cases, CNDI is caused by mutations in the arginine vasopressin receptor 2 (AVPR2) gene. Our objective is to report a novel mutation in the AVPR2 gene causing CNDI in a 6-year-old boy, presenting with growth failure and dull normal cognitive functions.
The proband was the third off-spring of non-consanguineous parents and had polyuria (4.3 L/day), polydipsia (5 L/day). The diagnosis of CNDI was established by a water-deprivation test and a desmopressin challenge test. Genetic studies were also carried out in the mother, siblings and affected family members, since excessive fluid intake and diuresis were also reported in these individuals. All exons of the AVPR2 gene for all participants were amplified and sequenced. Bioinformatics analysis for wild-type and mutant AVPR2 were obtained with Swiss-Model and UCSF Chimera 1.10.2.
A novel, hemizygous, missense mutation was identified at the position 80th in exon 2 (p.H80Y) of AVPR2 in the proband. The proband’s mother, maternal aunt and grandmother were heterozygous and his maternal uncle was hemizygous for this mutation. Bioinformatic analysis indicates this mutation would cause significant conformational changes in protein structure.
p.H80Y mutation will cause inappropriate folding of the protein compromising water homeostasis via AVPR2 and AVP and leading to diabetes insipidus. We suggest that future functional investigations of the H80Y mutation may provide a basis for understanding the pathophysiology of the NDI in patients with this variant.",2018 Nov 29,A Novel Mutation in the AVPR2 Gene Causing Congenital Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus,Journal of Clinical Research in Pediatric Endocrinology

We also investigated the response to antidepressant treatment in both groups.
Forty-one patients with major depression were recruited at the University Hospital of Occupational and Environmental Health. All patients were diagnosed with major depression using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition. Type 2 diabetes mellitus was diagnosed according to the criteria of the Japan Diabetes Society. Six healthy controls with no history of psychiatric or physical diseases were also enrolled. Serum levels of several cytokines, growth factors, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) were measured. The clinical symptoms of patients with major depression were assessed using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale.
Significant differences in cytokines, growth factors, and hs-CRP were observed between the major depression and healthy control groups. Serum TNF-α levels were significantly higher in patients with major depression and type 2 diabetes mellitus than in those without type 2 diabetes mellitus. In the major depression group, serum IL-6 and hs-CRP levels tended to be higher in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus than in those without. Several correlations among cytokines, growth factors, and hs-CRP were observed in patients with major depression with and without type 2 diabetes mellitus. Responses to pharmacological interventions for major depression did not differ between patients with and without type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Serum levels of TNF-α, hs-CRP, and IL-6 were different between patients with major depression with and without type 2 diabetes mellitus.

479,PMC8398524,"Throughout the 20th and 21st centuries, the incidence of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), also known as chronic diseases, has been increasing worldwide. Changes in dietary and physical activity patterns, along with genetic conditions, are the main factors that modulate the metabolism of individuals, leading to the development of NCDs. Obesity, diabetes, metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are classified in this group of chronic diseases. Therefore, understanding the underlying molecular mechanisms of these diseases leads us to develop more accurate and effective treatments to reduce or mitigate their prevalence in the population.

480,PMC7797297,"Hypertension and diabetes mellitus are the most common comorbid non-communicable chronic diseases that threaten human beings worldwide. Hypertension is associated with an increased risk of diabetes mellitus and vis-a-vis. However, there is limited information on the magnitude of diabetes mellitus in hypertensive patients in sub-Saharan countries. Hence, this study assessed the magnitude of diabetes mellitus and its associated factors among adult hypertensive patients attending a hypertension clinic in Northeast Ethiopia.
Institution-based cross-sectional study conducted on 407 participants from April to June 2019. The participants were included in the study using systematic random sampling. Data were collected using the WHO STEPwise method. We run descriptive statistics to determine the magnitude of diabetes mellitus in hypertensive patients and logistic regression to identify factors associated with diabetes, and statistically significant associations were declared at a P-value of less than 0.05.
The magnitude of diabetes mellitus among hypertensive patients was 29.1%, of whom 24% were newly diagnosed. Respondents with a family history of diabetes mellitus (AOR: 4.6, CI: 2.2, 9.48), increased waist-to-height ratio (AOR: 21.5, CI: 5.62,43.67), increased waist circumference (AOR: 3.2, CI: 1.58, 6.53) and primary school educational status (AOR: 3.2, CI: 1.41, 7.25) were more likely to have diabetes. Similarly, respondents with longer hypertension duration (AOR: 4.09, CI: 1.22, 13.64), past daily smoking history (AOR: 10.46, CI: 1.59,6.8), increased diastolic blood pressure (AOR: 4.15, CI: 1.51, 11.37), and increased waist circumference (AOR: 7.5, CI: 4.47,14.95) were more likely to be diagnosed newly for diabetes.

481,PMC8162454,"Diabetes is the most frequent cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD), leading to nearly half of all cases of kidney failure requiring replacement therapy. The principal cause of death among patients with diabetes and CKD is cardiovascular disease (CVD). Sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors were developed to lower blood glucose levels by inhibiting glucose reabsorption in the proximal tubule. In clinical trials designed to demonstrate the CVD safety of SGLT2 inhibitors in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), consistent reductions in risks for secondary kidney disease end points (albuminuria and a composite of serum creatinine doubling or 40% estimated glomerular filtration rate decline, kidney failure, or death), along with reductions in CVD events, were observed. In patients with CKD, the kidney and CVD benefits of canagliflozin were established by the CREDENCE (Canagliflozin and Renal Events in Diabetes With Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation) trial in patients with T2DM, urinary albumin-creatinine ratio >300 mg/g, and estimated glomerular filtration rate of 30 to <90 mL/min/1.73 m2. To clarify and support the role of SGLT2 inhibitors for treatment of T2DM and CKD, the National Kidney Foundation convened a scientific workshop with an international panel of more than 80 experts. They discussed the current state of knowledge and unanswered questions in order to propose therapeutic approaches and delineate future research. SGLT2 inhibitors improve glomerular hemodynamic function and are thought to ameliorate other local and systemic mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of CKD and CVD. SGLT2 inhibitors should be used when possible by people with T2DM to reduce risks for CKD and CVD in alignment with the clinical trial entry criteria. Important risks of SGLT2 inhibitors include euglycemic ketoacidosis, genital mycotic infections, and volume depletion. Careful consideration should be given to the balance of benefits and harms of SGLT2 inhibitors and risk mitigation strategies.

482,PMC8061461,"Psychiatry and Family Medicine residents frequently see patients with comorbid mental and physical disorders. Little is known about the difference in knowledge of Psychiatry residents and Family Medicine residents regarding management of common conditions they encounter. This study aimed to assess the knowledge of Psychiatry and Family Medicine residents regarding medical management of schizophrenia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemia, as the findings could help to refine the training curriculum for residency training.
A cross-sectional survey design was used. Psychiatry and Family Medicine residents pursuing their residency in Singapore were recruited from November 2019 to June 2020. The survey questionnaire consisted of questions which assessed the knowledge regarding medical management of schizophrenia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemia. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the demographic data; T-tests or Mann-Whitney U tests to compare the differences between groups; and multiple regression analyses to assess the factors associated with Psychiatry residents’ knowledge of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemia.
Fifty-seven out of 70 (81.4%) Psychiatry residents and 58 out of 61 (95.1%) Family Medicine residents participated in the study. The majority of Psychiatry residents encountered patients with hypertension (93.0%), diabetes mellitus (87.7%) and dyslipidemia (91.2%) on a daily to weekly basis. Psychiatry residents had higher scores on questions about schizophrenia versus Family Medicine residents (mean 50.70 versus 43.28, p < 0.001). However, Psychiatry residents scored lower on questions about hypertension (mean 33.86 versus 40.98, p < 0.001), diabetes mellitus (mean 45.68 versus 49.79, p = 0.005) and dyslipidemia (mean 37.04 versus 44.31, p < 0.001). Receiving undergraduate medical education locally, compared to receiving it overseas, was associated with better knowledge of hypertension (beta = 0.515, p = 0.009) and dyslipidemia (beta = 0.559, p = 0.005); while younger age (26–30 versus > 35 and 31–35 versus > 35) was associated with better knowledge of hypertension (beta = 1.361, p = 0.002 and beta = 1.225, p = 0.003). A significant proportion of Psychiatry residents (61.4%) did not agree that the training provided to manage hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemia was adequate. Similarly, majority of Family Medicine residents (62.1%) did not agree that they had adequate training to manage schizophrenia.
This study raises the awareness of Psychiatry residents’ sense of discomfort in managing hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or dyslipidemia and conversely Family Medicine residents in management of schizophrenia, which can be further addressed during the training postings within the residency programs. Future studies are needed to look at local (such as training curriculum) and systemic factors (such as practice trends and culture) in order to better align residency selection criteria and training foci with real world practice factors over time.

483,PMC8104216,"Vitamin D deficiency has been reported to be associated with diabetic microvascular complications, but previous studies have only focused on the relationship between vitamin D and specific complications. Therefore, we aimed to explore the relationship between vitamin D level and diabetic microvascular complications in general, including diabetic retinopathy (DR), diabetic nephropathy (DN), and diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN).
This was a cross-sectional study of 815 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Clinical information and laboratory results were collected from the medical records. The relationship between vitamin D and the three diabetic microvascular complications was investigated.
The serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25 [OH] D) level of patients with DPN and/or DN was significantly lower than that of T2DM patients without any microvascular complications (P < 0.01). Univariate analysis showed that the 25 (OH) D level was related to DPN and DN, but not DR. After adjustment, the 25 (OH) D level was confirmed to be an independent protective factor for DPN (odds ratio [OR]: 0.968, P = 0.004]) and DN (OR: 0.962, P = 0.006). The prevalence of DPN and DN increased significantly as the serum 25 (OH) D levels decreased. Furthermore, patients with both DPN and DN had the lowest concentration of serum 25 (OH) D (P < 0.001), and the prevalence of macroalbuminuria increased more abruptly than that of microalbuminuria across the 25 (OH) D tertiles. Among the patients with vitamin D insufficiency, those with DPN presented more comorbid macroalbuminuria than those without DPN (15.32% vs. 4.91%; P = 0.001).
Vitamin D deficiency is independently associated with higher risk of DPN and DN, but not DR, in T2DM patients. Further, it may be a potential predictor for both the occurrence and severity of DPN and DN.",2021 Feb 3,Relationship of serum vitamin D levels with diabetic microvascular complications in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus,Chinese Medical Journal
484,PMC7774613,"A valid tool is of paramount importance in determining women's sexual and reproductive health status, meeting their health needs, and recognizing the effectiveness of some interventions. This review study aimed to assess sexual and reproductive health dimensions tools in women with type 1 diabetes mellitus with regard to Consensus-based Standards for the selection of health status Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) checklist. In this review study, in addition to Iranian databases (MagIran, Sid, Irandoc), non-Iranian databases (PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Web of Science) and Google Scholar search engine were considered. The mentioned databases were searched for articles in English and Persian published within 2000–2019, using the search strategy for each database and Boolean operators along with appropriate keywords according to the MESH term. Articles with nonresearcher-made tools measuring the sexual and reproductive health concepts and dimensions were included in the present study. Afterward, the psychometric properties of the tools were assessed according to the COSMIN checklist. In the selected articles, there were 14 psychometrically valid tools to be assessed from 151 articles containing the sexual and reproductive health dimensions; among which, seven tools were evaluated with regard to COSMIN. None of the tools also had all the features noted in COSMIN. Moreover, all the concerned scales were not interpretable and accountable; however, a majority of them had internal consistency and construct validity. In this study, there was no valid and specific tool for measuring sexual-reproductive health status in this population group. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a valid tool according to the dimensions and needs of specific reproductive health in type 1 diabetes.",2020 Nov 26,Assessing sexual and reproductive health dimensions tools in women with type 1 diabetes mellitus with regard to Consensus-based Standards for the selection of health status Measurement Instruments checklist,Journal of Education and Health Promotion
485,PMC8623088,"Wolfram syndrome (WS), also known as a DIDMOAD (diabetes insipidus, early-onset diabetes mellitus, optic nerve atrophy and deafness) is a rare autosomal disorder caused by mutations in the Wolframin1 (WFS1) gene. Previous studies have revealed that glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP1 RA) are effective in delaying and restoring blood glucose control in WS animal models and patients. The GLP1 RA liraglutide has also been shown to have neuroprotective properties in aged WS rats. WS is an early-onset, chronic condition. Therefore, early diagnosis and lifelong pharmacological treatment is the best solution to control disease progression. Hence, the aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the long-term liraglutide treatment on the progression of WS symptoms. For this purpose, 2-month-old WS rats were treated with liraglutide up to the age of 18 months and changes in diabetes markers, visual acuity, and hearing sensitivity were monitored over the course of the treatment period. We found that treatment with liraglutide delayed the onset of diabetes and protected against vision loss in a rat model of WS. Therefore, early diagnosis and prophylactic treatment with the liraglutide may also prove to be a promising treatment option for WS patients by increasing the quality of life.",2021 Nov 16,"Early Intervention and Lifelong Treatment with GLP1 Receptor Agonist Liraglutide in a Wolfram Syndrome Rat Model with an Emphasis on Visual Neurodegeneration, Sensorineural Hearing Loss and Diabetic Phenotype",Cells
486,PMC8654374,"Insulin-induced hypoglycemia is a major treatment barrier in type-1 diabetes (T1D). Accordingly, it is important that we understand the mechanisms regulating the circulating levels of glucagon. Varying glucose over the range of concentrations that occur physiologically between the fed and fuel-deprived states (8 to 4 mM) has no significant effect on glucagon secretion in the perfused mouse pancreas or in isolated mouse islets (in vitro), and yet associates with dramatic increases in plasma glucagon. The identity of the systemic factor(s) that elevates circulating glucagon remains unknown. Here, we show that arginine-vasopressin (AVP), secreted from the posterior pituitary, stimulates glucagon secretion. Alpha-cells express high levels of the vasopressin 1b receptor (V1bR) gene (Avpr1b). Activation of AVP neurons in vivo increased circulating copeptin (the C-terminal segment of the AVP precursor peptide) and increased blood glucose; effects blocked by pharmacological antagonism of either the glucagon receptor or V1bR. AVP also mediates the stimulatory effects of hypoglycemia produced by exogenous insulin and 2-deoxy-D-glucose on glucagon secretion. We show that the A1/C1 neurons of the medulla oblongata drive AVP neuron activation in response to insulin-induced hypoglycemia. AVP injection increased cytoplasmic Ca2+ in alpha-cells (implanted into the anterior chamber of the eye) and glucagon release. Hypoglycemia also increases circulating levels of AVP/copeptin in humans and this hormone stimulates glucagon secretion from human islets. In patients with T1D, hypoglycemia failed to increase both copeptin and glucagon. These findings suggest that AVP is a physiological systemic regulator of glucagon secretion and that this mechanism becomes impaired in T1D.",2021 Nov 17,Arginine-vasopressin mediates counter-regulatory glucagon release and is diminished in type 1 diabetes,eLife
487,PMC8779739,"Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) is a rare disorder characterized by renal unresponsiveness to the hormone vasopressin, leading to excretion of large volumes of diluted urine. Mutations in the arginine vasopressin receptor-2 (AVPR2) gene cause congenital NDI and have an X-linked recessive inheritance. The disorder affects almost exclusively male family members, but female carriers occasionally present partial phenotypes due to skewed inactivation of the X-chromosome. Here, we report a rare case of a woman affected with X-linked recessive NDI, presenting an average urinary output of 12 L/day. Clinical and biochemical studies showed incomplete responses to water deprivation and vasopressin stimulation tests. Genetic analyses revealed a novel heterozygous missense mutation (c.493G > C, p.Ala165Pro) in the AVPR2 gene. Using a combination of in-silico protein modeling with human cellular models and molecular phenotyping, we provide functional evidence for phenotypic effects. The mutation destabilizes the helical structure of the AVPR2 transmembrane domains and disrupts its plasma membrane localization and downstream intracellular signaling pathways upon activation with its agonist vasopressin. These defects lead to deficient aquaporin 2 (AQP2) membrane translocation, explaining the inability to concentrate urine in this patient.",2022 Jan 17,"Clinical, Genetic and Functional Characterization of a Novel AVPR2 Missense Mutation in a Woman with X-Linked Recessive Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus",Journal of Personalized Medicine
488,PMC4975896,"Diabetes is associated with chronic inflammation and activation of the vascular endothelium and the coagulation system, which in a more acute manner are also observed in sepsis. Insulin and metformin exert immune modulatory effects. In this study, we aimed to determine the association of diabetes and preadmission insulin and metformin use with sepsis outcome and host response.
We evaluated 1104 patients with sepsis, admitted to the intensive care unit and stratified according to the presence or absence of diabetes mellitus. The host response was examined by a targeted approach (by measuring 15 plasma biomarkers reflective of pathways implicated in sepsis pathogenesis) and an unbiased approach (by analyzing whole genome expression profiles in blood leukocytes).
Diabetes mellitus was not associated with differences in sepsis presentation or mortality up to 90 days after admission. Plasma biomarker measurements revealed signs of systemic inflammation, and strong endothelial and coagulation activation in patients with sepsis, none of which were altered in those with diabetes. Patients with and without diabetes mellitus, who had sepsis demonstrated similar transcriptional alterations, comprising 74 % of the expressed gene content and involving over-expression of genes associated with pro-inflammatory, anti-inflammatory, Toll-like receptor and metabolic signaling pathways and under-expression of genes associated with T cell signaling pathways. Amongst patients with diabetes mellitus and sepsis, preadmission treatment with insulin or metformin was not associated with an altered sepsis outcome or host response.
Neither diabetes mellitus nor preadmission insulin or metformin use are associated with altered disease presentation, outcome or host response in patients with sepsis requiring intensive care.

489,PMC7136162,"Diabetes mellitus is an important risk factor for a first cardiovascular event and for worse outcomes after a cardiovascular event has occurred. This situation might be caused, at least in part, by the prothrombotic status observed in patients with diabetes. Therefore, contemporary antithrombotic strategies, including more potent agents or drug combinations, might provide greater clinical benefit in patients with diabetes than in those without diabetes. In this Consensus Statement, our Working Group explores the mechanisms of platelet and coagulation activity, the current debate on antiplatelet therapy in primary cardiovascular disease prevention, and the benefit of various antithrombotic approaches in secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease in patients with diabetes. While acknowledging that current data are often derived from underpowered, observational studies or subgroup analyses of larger trials, we propose antithrombotic strategies for patients with diabetes in various cardiovascular settings (primary prevention, stable coronary artery disease, acute coronary syndromes, ischaemic stroke and transient ischaemic attack, peripheral artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and venous thromboembolism). Finally, we summarize the improvements in cardiovascular outcomes observed with the latest glucose-lowering drugs, and on the basis of the available evidence, we expand and integrate current guideline recommendations on antithrombotic strategies in patients with diabetes for both primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease.

490,PMC8668851,"Diabetes mellitus can be categorized into two major variants, type 1 and type 2. A number of traits such as clinical phenotype, age at disease onset, genetic background, and underlying pathogenesis distinguish the two forms.
Recent evidence indicates that type 1 diabetes can be accompanied by insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes exhibits self-reactivity. These two previously unknown conditions can influence the progression and outcome of the disease. Unlike most conventional considerations, diabetes appears to consist of a spectrum of intermediate phenotypes that includes monogenic and polygenic loci linked to inflammatory processes including autoimmunity, beta cell impairment, and insulin resistance.
Here we discuss why a shift of the classical bi-modal view of diabetes (autoimmune vs. non-autoimmune) is necessary in favor of a model of an immunological continuum of endotypes lying between the two extreme “insulin-resistant” and “autoimmune beta cell targeting,” shaped by environmental and genetic factors which contribute to determine specific immune-conditioned outcomes.",2021 Dec 13,Autoimmune Inflammation and Insulin Resistance: Hallmarks So Far and Yet So Close to Explain Diabetes Endotypes,Current Diabetes Reports
491,PMC6708663,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a complication of chronic pancreatitis (CP). Whether pancreatogenic diabetes associated with CP-DM represents a discrete pathophysiologic entity from type 2 DM (T2DM) remains uncertain. Addressing this question is needed for development of specific measures to manage CP-DM. We approached this question from a unique standpoint, hypothesizing that if CP-DM and T2DM are separate disorders, they should be genetically distinct. To test this hypothesis, we sought to determine whether a genetic risk score (GRS) based on validated single nucleotide polymorphisms for T2DM could distinguish between groups with CP-DM and T2DM.
We used 60 T2DM single nucleotide polymorphisms to construct a weighted GRS in 1,613 subjects from the North American Pancreatitis Study 2 and 2,685 subjects from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis, all of European origin.
The mean GRS was identical between 321 subjects with CP-DM and 423 subjects with T2DM (66.53 vs 66.42, P = 0.95), and the GRS of both diabetic groups was significantly higher than that of nondiabetic controls (n = 3,554, P < 0.0001). Exploratory analyses attempting to enrich the CP-DM group for pancreatogenic diabetes, such as eliminating diabetes diagnosed before CP, requiring pancreas-specific comorbidities, or removing those with a family history of diabetes, did not improve the ability of the GRS to distinguish between CP-DM and T2DM.
Recognizing that we lacked a gold standard to define CP-DM, our study suggests that CP-DM may be a subtype of T2DM, a notion that should be tested in future, large prospective studies.",2019 Jun 20,Genetic Risk Score in Diabetes Associated With Chronic Pancreatitis Versus Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus,Clinical and Translational Gastroenterology
492,PMC6259371,"The prevalence of juvenile-onset gout has been increasing. Hereditary factors and secondary diseases should be considered in these patients. Adipsic diabetes insipidus (ADI) is characterized by arginine vasopressin (AVP) deficiency, which results in hypotonic polyuria, and dysfunction of thirst osmoreceptors, which results in failure to generate a thirst sensation in response to hypernatremia. We herein report a case of a boy with gouty arthritis, refractory hyperuricemia, prominent hypernatremia, a high creatinine concentration, and a history of surgery for a hypothalamic hamartoma. The patient was diagnosed with central diabetes insipidus after endocrine evaluation. Because he never had symptoms of thirst, the final diagnosis was corrected to ADI. This is the first report of gout due to chronic ADI in an adolescent. Volume contraction due to ADI might be one cause of hyperuricemia and renal impairment in such patients. Moreover, AVP deficiency might directly lead to low urate clearance due to the lack of vasopressin receptor 1 stimulation. Lack of polydipsia and polyuria may delay the diagnosis of ADI and lead to severe complications of a chronic hyperosmolar status.

493,PMC6547328,"Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for 15% of lung cancers, and it commonly expresses peptide and protein factors that are active as hormones. These secreting factors manifest as paraneoplastic disorders, such as ectopic adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) syndrome (EAS). The clinical features are abnormalities in carbohydrate metabolism, hypokalemia, peripheral edema, proximal myopathy, hypertension, hyperpigmentation, and severe systemic infection. However, it is uncommon that EAS has an influence on hypothalamus-pituitary function.
A 62-year-old man presented with complaints of haemoptysis, polyuria, polydipsia, increased appetite, weight loss, and pigmentation. Following a series of laboratory and imaging examinations, he was diagnosed with SCLC, EAS, hypogonadism, hypothyroidism, and central diabetes insipidus. After three rounds of chemotherapy, levels of ACTH, cortisol, thyroid hormone, gonadal hormone, and urine volume had returned to normal levels. In addition, the pulmonary tumor was reduced in size.
We report a rare case of SCLC complicated with panhypopituitarism due to EAS. We hypothesize that EAS induced high levels of serum glucocorticoid and negative feedback for the synthesis and secretion of antidiuretic hormone from the paraventricular nucleus, and trophic hormones from the anterior pituitary. Therefore, patients who present with symptoms of hypopituitarism, or even panhypopituitarism, with SCLC should be evaluated for EAS.",2019 May 26,Small cell lung cancer with panhypopituitarism due to ectopic adrenocorticotropic hormone syndrome: A case report,World Journal of Clinical Cases
494,PMC4021356,"Wolfram syndrome (WFS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by diabetes insipidus, diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy, and deafness. WFS1 and WFS2 are caused by recessive mutations in the genes Wolfram Syndrome 1 (WFS1) and CDGSH iron sulfur domain 2 (CISD2), respectively. To explore the function of CISD2, we performed genetic studies in flies with altered expression of its Drosophila orthologue, cisd2. Surprisingly, flies with strong ubiquitous RNAi-mediated knockdown of cisd2 had no obvious signs of altered life span, stress resistance, locomotor behavior or several other phenotypes. We subsequently found in a targeted genetic screen, however, that altered function of cisd2 modified the effects of overexpressing the fly orthologues of two lysosomal storage disease genes, palmitoyl-protein thioesterase 1 (PPT1 in humans, Ppt1 in flies) and ceroid-lipofuscinosis, neuronal 3 (CLN3 in humans, cln3 in flies), on eye morphology in flies. We also found that cln3 modified the effects of overexpressing Ppt1 in the eye and that overexpression of cln3 interacted with a loss of function mutation in cisd2 to disrupt locomotor ability in flies. Follow-up multi-species bioinformatic analyses suggested that a gene network centered on CISD2, PPT1 and CLN3 might impact disease through altered carbohydrate metabolism, protein folding and endopeptidase activity. Human genetic studies indicated that copy number variants (duplications and deletions) including CLN3, and possibly another gene in the CISD2/PPT1/CLN3 network, are over-represented in individuals with developmental delay. Our studies indicate that cisd2, Ppt1 and cln3 function in concert in flies, suggesting that CISD2, PPT1 and CLN3 might also function coordinately in humans. Further, our studies raise the possibility that WFS2 and some lysosomal storage disorders might be influenced by common mechanisms and that the underlying genes might have previously unappreciated effects on developmental delay.",2014 Apr 4,"Genetic studies in Drosophila and humans support a model for the concerted function of CISD2, PPT1 and CLN3 in disease",Biology Open
495,PMC5013397,"Although diabetes mellitus is associated with an increased risk of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, the underlying mechanisms leading to left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (LVDD) remain poorly understood. The study was designed to assess the risk factors for LVDD in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
The study cohort included 101 asymptomatic patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus without overt heart disease. Left ventricular diastolic function was estimated as the ratio of early diastolic velocity (E) from transmitral inflow to early diastolic velocity (e’) of tissue Doppler at mitral annulus (E/e’). Parameters of glycemic control, plasma insulin concentration, treatment with antidiabetic drugs, lipid profile, and other clinical characteristics were evaluated, and their association with E/e’ determined. Patients with New York Heart Association class >1, ejection fraction <50%, history of coronary artery disease, severe valvulopathy, chronic atrial fibrillation, or creatinine clearance <30 mL/min, as well as those receiving insulin treatment, were excluded.
Univariate analysis showed that E/e’ was significantly correlated with age (p<0.001), sex (p<0.001), duration of diabetes (p=0.002), systolic blood pressure (p=0.017), pulse pressure (p=0.010), fasting insulin concentration (p=0.025), and sulfonylurea use (p<0.001).

GDM has a considerable impact on health outcomes of the mother and offspring during pregnancy, delivery, and beyond. Although the exact mechanism regarding GDM remains unclear, numerous studies have suggested that non-coding RNAs, including long non-coding (lnc)RNAs, microRNAs, and circular RNAs, were involved in the pathogenesis of GDM in which they played vital regulatory roles. Additionally, several studies have revealed that extracellular vehicles also participated in the pathogenesis of GDM, highlighting their important role in this disease. Considering the lack of effective biomarkers for the early identification of and specific treatment for GDM, non-coding RNAs and extracellular vehicles may be promising biomarkers and even targets for GDM therapies. This review provides an update on our understanding of the role of non-coding RNAs and extracellular vehicles in GDM. As our understanding of the function of lncRNAs and extracellular vehicles improves, the future appears promising for their use as potential biomarkers and treatment targets for GDM in clinical practice.",2021 May 20,Non-Coding RNAs and Extracellular Vehicles: Their Role in the Pathogenesis of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus,Frontiers in Endocrinology
498,PMC7736611,"Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), by unleashing the anticancer response of the immune system, can improve survival of patients affected by several malignancies, but may trigger a broad spectrum of adverse events, including autoimmune hypophysitis. ICI-related hypophysitis mainly manifests with anterior hypopituitarism, while the simultaneous involvement of both anterior and posterior pituitary (i.e., panhypophysitis) has rarely been described.
In June 2015, a 64-year-old man affected by liver metastases of a uveal melanoma was referred to us due to polyuria and polydipsia. Two months prior, he had started ipilimumab therapy (3 mg/kg iv every 21 days). The treatment was well-tolerated (only mild asthenia and diarrhea were reported). A few days before the fourth cycle, the patient complained of intense headaches, profound fatigue, nocturia, polyuria (up to 10 L urine/daily), and polydipsia. Laboratory tests were consistent with adrenal insufficiency, hypothyroidism, and transient central diabetes insipidus. The pituitary MRI showed an enlarged gland with microinfarcts, while the hypophyseal stalk was normal, and the neurohypophyseal ‘bright signal’ in T1 sequences was not detected. The treatment included dexamethasone (then cortisone acetate at replacement dose), desmopressin, and levothyroxine. Within the next five days, the symptoms resolved, and blood pressure, electrolytes, glucose, and urinalysis were stable within the normal ranges; desmopressin was discontinued while cortisone acetate and levothyroxine were maintained. The fourth ipilimumab dose was entirely administered in the absence of further side effects.
As ICIs are increasingly used as anticancer agents, the damage to anterior and/or posterior pituitary can be progressively encountered by oncologists and endocrinologists in their clinical practice. Patients on ICIs and their caregivers should be informed about that risk and be empowered to alert the referring specialists early, at the onset of panhypopituitarism symptoms, including polyuria/polydipsia.",2020 Dec 1,Case Report: Ipilimumab-Induced Panhypophysitis: An Infrequent Occurrence and Literature Review,Frontiers in Oncology

500,PMC5597214,"Many studies have explored the relationship between diabetes mellitus (DM) and tuberculosis (TB) demonstrating increased risk of TB among patients with DM and poor prognosis of patients suffering from the association of DM/TB. Owing to a paucity of studies addressing this question, it remains unclear whether patients with DM and TB are more likely than TB patients without DM to be grouped into molecular clusters defined according to the genotype of the infecting Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacillus. That is, whether there is convincing molecular epidemiological evidence for TB transmission among DM patients. Objective: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to quantitatively evaluate the propensity for patients with DM and pulmonary TB (PTB) to cluster according to the genotype of the infecting M. tuberculosis bacillus.
We conducted a systematic search in MEDLINE and LILACS from 1990 to June, 2016 with the following combinations of key words “tuberculosis AND transmission” OR “tuberculosis diabetes mellitus” OR “Mycobacterium tuberculosis molecular epidemiology” OR “RFLP-IS6110” OR “Spoligotyping” OR “MIRU-VNTR”. Studies were included if they met the following criteria: (i) studies based on populations from defined geographical areas; (ii) use of genotyping by IS6110- restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis and spoligotyping or mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit-variable number of tandem repeats (MIRU-VNTR) or other amplification methods to identify molecular clustering; (iii) genotyping and analysis of 50 or more cases of PTB; (iv) study duration of 11 months or more; (v) identification of quantitative risk factors for molecular clustering including DM; (vi) > 60% coverage of the study population; and (vii) patients with PTB confirmed bacteriologically. The exclusion criteria were: (i) Extrapulmonary TB; (ii) TB caused by nontuberculous mycobacteria; (iii) patients with PTB and HIV; (iv) pediatric PTB patients; (v) TB in closed environments (e.g. prisons, elderly homes, etc.); (vi) diabetes insipidus and (vii) outbreak reports. Hartung-Knapp-Sidik-Jonkman method was used to estimate the odds ratio (OR) of the association between DM with molecular clustering of cases with TB. In order to evaluate the degree of heterogeneity a statistical Q test was done. The publication bias was examined with Begg and Egger tests. Review Manager 5.3.5 CMA v.3 and Biostat and Software package R were used.
Selection criteria were met by six articles which included 4076 patients with PTB of which 13% had DM. Twenty seven percent of the cases were clustered. The majority of cases (48%) were reported in a study in China with 31% clustering. The highest incidence of TB occurred in two studies from China. The global OR for molecular clustering was 0.84 (IC 95% 0.40–1.72). The heterogeneity between studies was moderate (I2 = 55%, p = 0.05), although there was no publication bias (Beggs test p = 0.353 and Eggers p = 0.429).
There were very few studies meeting our selection criteria. The wide confidence interval indicates that there is not enough evidence to draw conclusions about the association.

In this prospective nested case–cohort study, participants were recalled for follow up with detailed evaluation including oral glucose tolerance test at 8, 15 and 22 years. Logistic regression was used to estimate the risk of developing impaired glucose tolerance/type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome at follow up. The association between maternal glycemia at pregnancy and follow up was evaluated by linear regression. We also charted trajectory of β‐cell function during follow up.
The analysis included 121 women with a mean follow‐up period of 22.5 years, and a mean age of 50.3 years. Gestational diabetes was associated with an adjusted odds ratio of 2.48 (95% confidence interval 1.03–5.99) for combined diabetes/impaired glucose tolerance at follow up (P = 0.04). Women with a pre‐pregnancy body mass index ≥23 had an odds ratio of 5.43 (95% confidence interval 1.87–15.72) for metabolic syndrome at follow up, compared with those with body mass index <23 (P = 0.002). Both fasting and 2‐h glucose during pregnancy were strongly associated with glycemic indices at follow up (P‐value <0.001–0.016). Gestational diabetes was associated with impaired β‐cell function that remained relatively stable after the index pregnancy.
Chinese women with a history of gestational diabetes have a high prevalence of impaired glucose tolerance/type 2 diabetes at 22‐year follow up. Glucose levels during mid‐pregnancy are strongly associated with those of middle age.

502,PMC8428073,"COVID-19 has changed the nature of medical consultations, emphasizing virtual patient counselling, with relevance for patients with diabetes insipidus (DI) or hyponatraemia. The main complication of desmopressin treatment in DI is dilutional hyponatraemia. Since plasma sodium monitoring is not always possible in times of COVID-19, we recommend to delay the desmopressin dose once a week until aquaresis occurs allowing excess retained water to be excreted. Patients should measure their body weight daily. Patients with DI admitted to the hospital with COVID-19 have a high risk for mortality due to volume depletion. Specialists must supervise fluid replacement and dosing of desmopressin. Patients after pituitary surgery should drink to thirst and measure their body weight daily to early recognize the development of postoperative SIAD. They should know hyponatraemia symptoms. Hyponatraemia in COVID-19 is common with a prevalence of 20–30% and is mostly due to SIAD or hypovolaemia. It mirrors disease severity and is an early predictor of mortality. Hypernatraemia may also develop in COVID-19 patients, with a prevalence of 3–5%, especially in ICU, and derives from different multifactorial reasons, for example, due to insensible water losses from pyrexia, increased respiration rate and use of diuretics.

The participants were people with diabetes mellitus who were the active members of a peer educator network, lived in poor urban areas of Phnom Penh, and attended weekly educational sessions during the survey period. Diabetes medication adherence was measured using four items of modified Morisky Medication Adherence Scale. Participants were classified into two groups based on their adherence score: 0 (high adherence) and from 1 to 4 (medium or low adherence). Sociodemographic characteristics; medical history; accessibility to health services; and knowledge, attitude, and practices related to diabetes mellitus were examined. A multiple logistic regression analysis was conducted adjusting for sex, age, marital status, and education levels.
Data from 773 people with diabetes were included in the analyses. Of the total, 49.3% had a high level of diabetes medication adherence. A high level of adherence was associated with higher family income (≥50 USD per month) (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 5.00, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.25–11.08), absence of diabetes mellitus-related complications (AOR = 1.66, 95% CI = 1.19–2.32), use of health services more than once per month (AOR = 2.87, 95% CI = 1.64–5.04), following special diet for diabetes mellitus (AOR = 1.81, 95% CI = 1.17–2.81), and absence of alcohol consumption (AOR = 13.67, 95% CI = 2.86–65.34).
High diabetes medication adherence was associated with better family economic conditions, absence of diabetes mellitus-related complications, and healthy behaviors. It would be crucial to improve affordable access to regular follow-ups including promotion of healthy behaviors through health education and control of diabetes mellitus-related complications.",2019 Nov 19,Factors associated with medication adherence among people with diabetes mellitus in poor urban areas of Cambodia: A cross-sectional study,PLoS ONE

Genetic testing in familial cases of FNDI should be carry out to ensure adequate treatments and avoid disease manifestations especially in infants.
In this study, we investigated three-generations of a large Italian family with clinical diagnosis of familial central diabetes insipidus for the presence of potential pathogenic mutations in the AVP gene.
We identified a heterozygous missense mutation (c.154 T > A; p.C52S) in AVP gene in all affected members studied of a large Italian family. In silico tools were used to investigate the pathogenic role of the mutation and three-dimensional protein structure predicted that the p.C52S impairs disulfide bridges formation resulting in misfolding of the protein.
This is the first study that identified a novel missense p.C52S mutation as causative of central diabetes insipidus in a large Italian pedigree.",2021 Jul 28,Autosomal dominant familial neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus caused by a novel missense mutation in AVP gene in a large Italian kindred,Endocrine

We aimed to estimate the burden of cancer associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus in Japan between 2010 and 2030. In this study, we estimated the population attributable fraction of cancer risk associated with type 2 diabetes in 2010 and 2030 using the prevalence estimates of type 2 diabetes in Japan from 1990 to 2030, summary hazard ratios of diabetes and cancer risk from a pooled analysis of eight large‐scale Japanese cohort studies, observed incidence/mortality of cancer in 2010 and predicted incidence/mortality for 2030 derived from the age–period–cohort model. Our results showed that between 2010 and 2030, the total numbers of cancer incidence and mortality were predicted to increase by 38.9% and 10.5% in adults aged above 20 years, respectively. In the number of excess incident cancer cases associated with type 2 diabetes, an increase of 26.5% in men and 53.2% in women is expected between 2010 and 2030. The age‐specific analysis showed that the population attributable fraction of cancer will increase in adults aged >60 years over time, but will not change in adults aged 20–59 years. In conclusion, this study suggests a modest but steady increase in cancers associated with type 2 diabetes.
This study provides the first comprehensive evidence on the current and future burden of cancer associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Between 2010 and 2030, the incident cancer cases associated with type 2 diabetes were found to increase constantly over time, particularly in liver, pancreas and colon in Japan. Given the prolonged life expectancy in Japan, increase in people living with type 2 diabetes and subsequent cancer will be a public health issue in the years to come.",2016 Mar 28,"Burden of cancer associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus in Japan, 2010–2030",Cancer Science

Although the connection between loss of function mutations of the WFS1 gene and DIDMOAD-syndrome including diabetes mellitus underpins the significance of wolframin in the pathogenesis, exact role of WFS1 polymorphic variants in the development of type 1 and type 2 diabetes has not been discovered yet. In this analysis, 787 patients with diabetes and 900 healthy people participated. Genotyping of the 7 WFS1 SNPs was carried out by TaqMan assays. Association study was performed by χ 2-test in combination with correction for multiple testing. For functional analysis, the entire 3’ UTR of the WFS1 gene was subcloned in a pMIR-Report plasmid and relative luciferase activities were determined. Linkage disequilibrium analysis showed a generally high LD within the investigated region, however the rs1046322 locus was not in LD with the other SNPs. The two miR-SNPs, rs1046322 and rs9457 showed significant association with T1DM and T2DM, respectively. Haplotype analysis also confirmed the association between the 3’ UTR loci and both disease types. In vitro experiments showed that miR-185 reduces the amount of the resulting protein, and rs9457 miRSNP significantly influences the rate of reduction in a luciferase reporter assay. Genetic variants of the WFS1 gene might contribute to the genetic risk of T1DM and T2DM. Furthermore demonstrating the effect of rs9457 in binding of miR-185, we suggest that the optimal level of wolframin protein, potentially influenced by miR-regulation, is crucial in normal beta cell function.",2015 Oct 1,Micro-RNA Binding Site Polymorphisms in the WFS1 Gene Are Risk Factors of Diabetes Mellitus,PLoS ONE
508,PMC8497126,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a major chronic metabolic disease in the world, and the prevalence has been increasing rapidly in recent years. The channel of KATP plays an important role in the regulation of insulin secretion. The variants in ABCC8 gene encoding the SUR1 subunit of KATP could cause a variety of phenotypes, including neonatal diabetes mellitus (ABCC8-NDM) and ABCC8-induced nonneonatal diabetes mellitus (ABCC8-NNDM). Since the features of ABCC8-NNDM have not been elucidated, this study is aimed at concluding the genetic features and clinical characteristics. 
 We comprehensively reviewed the literature associated with ABCC8-NNDM in the following databases: MEDLINE, PubMed, and Web of Science to investigate the features of ABCC8-NNDM. 
 Based on a comprehensive literature search, we found that 87 probands with ABCC8-NNDM carried 71 ABCC8 genetic variant alleles, 24% of whom carried inactivating variants, 24% carried activating variants, and the remaining 52% carried activating or inactivating variants. Nine of these variants were confirmed to be activating or inactivating through functional studies, while four variants (p.R370S, p.E1506K, p.R1418H, and p.R1420H) were confirmed to be inactivating. The phenotypes of ABCC8-NNDM were variable and could also present with early hyperinsulinemia followed by reduced insulin secretion, progressing to diabetes later. They had a relatively high risk of microvascular complications and low prevalence of nervous disease, which is different from ABCC8-NDM. 
 Genetic testing is essential for proper diagnosis and appropriate treatment for patients with ABCC8-NNDM.

509,PMC7938013,"COVID-19 has changed the nature of medical consultations, emphasizing virtual patient counseling, with relevance for patients with diabetes insipidus (DI) or hyponatraemia. The main complication of desmopressin treatment in DI is dilutional hyponatraemia. Since plasma sodium monitoring is not always possible in times of COVID-19, we recommend to delay the desmopressin dose once a week until aquaresis occurs allowing excess retained water to be excreted. Patients should measure their body weight daily. Patients with DI admitted to the hospital with COVID-19 have a high risk for mortality due to volume depletion. Specialists must supervise fluid replacement and dosing of desmopressin. Patients after pituitary surgery should drink to thirst and measure their body weight daily to early recognize the development of the postoperative syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD). They should know hyponatraemia symptoms. The prevalence of hyponatraemia in patients with pneumonia due to COVID-19 is not yet known, but seems to be low. In contrast, hypernatraemia may develop in COVID-19 patients in ICU, from different multifactorial reasons, for example, due to insensible water losses from pyrexia, increased respiration rate and use of diuretics. Hypernatraemic dehydration may contribute to the high risk of acute kidney injury in COVID-19.

510,PMC7480585,"The burden of diabetes mellitus in Sub-Saharan Africa is growing rapidly, and yet the prevalence and patient characteristics are still largely unknown.
We analyzed clinical and demographic characteristics of Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) patients attending a diabetes clinic in Guinea-Bissau from February 2008 to April 2014, and estimated the prevalence and risk factors of unknown-impaired fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and diabetes, as well as excess mortality associated with T2DM.
We characterized T2DM patients attending the national diabetes clinic in Bissau. Diabetes was diagnosed based on FPG. We matched T2DM patients 1:1 with non-diabetes community controls on age and sex to determine relevant risk factors for T2DM using logistic regression. Furthermore, we matched patients 1:6 with community controls to assess long-term survival (until February 2019) in a Cox regression using calendar time as the underlying timescale. Verbal autopsies determined the cause of death among T2DM patients and controls.
The mean age among T2DM was 50.6 (SD 11.1), and the mean FPG at first consultation was high (13.2 mmol/L (SD 5.1)). Ethnicity, family history of diabetes, hypertension, and anthropometrics differed among T2DM patients, community controls with impaired FPG, and healthy controls. Family history of diabetes (OR = 5.65, 95% CI: 3.10–10.3) and elevated waist circumference (2.33, 1.26–4.29) were significant risk factors for T2DM. 20.4% (59/289) of community controls had abnormal FPG. T2DM patients had an excess mortality hazard ratio of 3.53 (95%CI: 1.92–6.52). Deaths caused by bacterial infections, including foot ulcers, were more common among T2DM patients, compared with community controls (54% (7/13) vs. 19% (5/27) (P = 0.02)).

A retrospective study using real‐world data was carried out in electronic medical records from a tertiary care hospital and in the Japanese Medical Data Center Inc. claim database from 2008 to 2019. Each patient was propensity score‐matched between the BS and the MT group by age, sex, body mass index, glycated hemoglobin and type 2 diabetes mellitus duration, and compared from the index date to the 1 year post‐index.
The study included 78 patients in the BS group and 238 patients in the MT group. The mean body mass index in the BS and the MT group was 32.1 and 32.0 kg/m2, respectively. In the BS group, the patients underwent either laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy with or without duodenojejunal bypass. The diabetes remission rate (glycated hemoglobin <6.5% without diabetes medication) at 1 year was 59.0% in the BS group and 0.4% in the MT group (P < 0.0001). Optimal glycemic control of glycated hemoglobin <7.0% was achieved in 75.6% in the BS group and in 29.0% in the MT group (P < 0.0001). The median monthly drug costs for metabolic syndrome decreased from $US126.5 (at baseline) to $US0.0 (at 1 year) in the BS group, whereas it increased from $US52.4 to $US58.3 in the MT group.

514,PMC8397566,"Hyponatremia is a common complication of diabetes. However, the relationship between serum sodium level and diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is unknown. This study was aimed at investigating the relationship between low serum sodium level and DPN in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. 
 A retrospective study was performed on 1928 patients with type 2 diabetes between 2010 and 2018. The multivariate test was used to analyze the relationship between the serum sodium level and the nerve conduction function. A restricted cubic spline was used to flexibly model and visualize the relationship between the serum sodium level and DPN, followed by logistic regression with adjustment. 
 As the serum sodium level increased, the prevalence of DPN had a reverse J-curve distribution with the serum sodium levels (69.6%, 53.7%, 49.6%, 43.9%, and 49.7%; P = 0.001). Significant differences existed between the serum sodium level and the motor nerve conduction velocity, sensory nerve conduction velocity, part of compound muscle action potential, and sensory nerve action potential of the participants. Compared with hyponatremia, the higher serum sodium level was a relative lower risk factor for DPN after adjusting for several potential confounders (OR = 0.430, 95%CI = 0.220–0.841; OR = 0.386, 95%CI = 0.198–0.755; OR = 0.297, 95%CI = 0.152–0.580; OR = 0.376, 95%CI = 0.190–0.743; all P < 0.05).

515,PMC8169367,"Type 1 diabetes mellitus is a T cell‐mediated autoimmune disease. However, the determination of the autoimmune status of type 1 diabetes mellitus relies on islet autoantibodies (Abs), as T‐cell assay is not routinely carried out. This study aimed to investigate the diagnostic value of combined assay of islet antigen‐specific T cells and Abs in type 1 diabetes mellitus patients.
A total of 54 patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and 56 healthy controls were enrolled. Abs against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), islet antigen‐2 and zinc transporter 8 were detected by radioligand assay. Interferon‐γ‐secreting T cells responding to glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 and C‐peptide (CP) were measured by enzyme‐linked immunospot.
The positive rate for T‐cell responses was significantly higher in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus than that in controls (P < 0.001). The combined positive rate of Abs and T‐cell assay was significantly higher than that of Abs assay alone (85.2% vs 64.8%, P = 0.015). A significant difference in fasting CP level was found between the T+ and T– groups (0.07 ± 0.05 vs 0.11 ± 0.09 nmol/L, P = 0.033). Furthermore, levels of fasting CP and postprandial CP were both lower in the Ab−T+ group than the Ab−T− group (fasting CP 0.06 ± 0.05 vs 0.16 ± 0.12 nmol/L, P = 0.041; postprandial CP 0.12 ± 0.13 vs 0.27 ± 0.12 nmol/L, P = 0.024).
Enzyme‐linked immunospot assays in combination with Abs detection could improve the diagnostic sensitivity of autoimmune diabetes.

Sprague-Dawley rats treated with lithium for 4 weeks were used as the NDI model and expression of renal COX-2 was determined by immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry. In Li-NDI where urine output was markedly increased and urine osmolality was significantly decreased, COX-2 expression in the inner medulla was decreased (28% of control), while it increased 18-fold in the cortex and outer medulla. Consistent with this, labeling intensity of COX-2 in macula densa region was increased, whereas it was decreased in the interstitial cells in the inner medulla, indicating a differential regulation of COX-2 between the cortex and inner medulla in Li-NDI. Accordingly, urinary PGE2 excretion was significantly increased in Li-NDI. In conclusion, there is a differential regulation of COX-2 between cortex and inner medulla in Li-NDI and urinary PGE2 excretion is increased in Li-NDI, possibly due to an increased renal production. This may suggest that increased renal production of PGE2 could play a role in modulating water reabsorption in the renal collecting duct in Li-NDI.",2007 Dec 31,Dysregulation of Renal Cyclooxygenase-2 in Rats with Lithium-induced Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus,Electrolytes & Blood Pressure : E & BP

While gestational diabetes also shares mechanisms of action with diabetes mellitus, several studies have provided hypotheses that could explain the pathophysiology of the link between diabetes mellitus and risk of pancreatic cancer. Accordingly, the aim of our study was to determine the risk of developing pancreatic cancer in women with a history of gestational diabetes from a quasi-exhaustive national medico-administrative database for deliveries in France. We included 1,368,755 women in our study. We showed that gestational diabetes was significantly associated with a greater risk of pancreatic cancer, regardless of subsequent type 2 diabetes. Our results suggest a better follow-up of patients after a gestational diabetes in order to identify high-risk profiles of developing more serious conditions, such as pancreatic cancer.
The aim of this large retrospective cohort study was to use a quasi-exhaustive national medico-administrative database of deliveries in France to determine the risk of developing pancreatic cancer (PC) in women with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). This nationwide population-based study included women aged 14–55 who gave birth between 1st January 2008 and 31 December 2009. The women were followed-up epidemiologically for eight years. Survival analyses using Cox regression models, adjusted for age, subsequent type 2 diabetes, and tobacco consumption, were performed on the time to occurrence of hospitalization for PC. The onset of GDM, tobacco consumption and subsequent type 2 diabetes were considered as time-dependent variables. Among 1,352,560 women included, 95,314 had a history of GDM (7.05%) and 126 women were hospitalized for PC (0.01%). Over the eight years of follow-up, GDM was significantly associated with a higher risk of hospitalization with PC in the first Cox regression model adjusted for age and subsequent type 2 diabetes (HR = 1.81 95% CI [1.06–3.10]). The second Cox regression model adjusted for the same covariates, plus tobacco consumption, showed that GDM was still significantly associated with a higher risk of hospitalization for PC with nearly the same estimated risk (HR = 1.77 95% CI [1.03–3.03]).

Diabetes as a consequence of obesity (diabesity), continues to increase exponentially in the 21st century. Although there are a multitude of drugs for the effective management of diabesity with modest benefits, most patients will require insulin for control of diabetes at some stage that would worsen obesity, and thereby diabesity. Therefore, effective non-pharmacological therapy needs to be expedited in all patients with diabesity. These measures include medical nutrition interventions, change of lifestyles and bariatric surgery.

519,PMC6944815,"Osteoporosis is known to be intimately related to sympathetic nerve activity. We examined the relationship of plasma leptin with cortical and trabecular bone components in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
The present cross‐sectional study included 182 type 2 diabetes mellitus patients (93 men, 89 women). Cortical thickness (CoTh) and trabecular bone mineral density (BMD) were determined at the 5.5% distal radius using an LD‐100 ultrasonic bone densitometry device. Plasma leptin along with physical and laboratory measurements was simultaneously determined.
Plasma leptin, but not body mass index (BMI), was inversely correlated with CoTh (ρ = −0.487, P < 0.001), while BMI, but not plasma leptin, was positively correlated with trabecular BMD (ρ = 0.369, P < 0.001). In multivariable regression analysis, after adjustments for age, sex, duration of diabetes, glycated hemoglobin A1c, albumin, estimated glomerular filtration rate, parathyroid hormone and handgrip strength, plasma leptin was inversely associated with CoTh (β = −0.258, P < 0.001), but not trabecular BMD. Furthermore, plasma leptin level retained a significant association with CoTh after further adjustment for BMI (β = −0.237, P < 0.001) and BMI plus waist‐to‐hip ratio (β = −0.243, P < 0.001). In contrast, the “sex × leptin” interaction was not significant (P = 0.596).
Leptin level in plasma, independent of BMI and BMI plus waist‐to‐hip ratio, was shown to be inversely associated with CoTh, but not trabecular BMD, suggesting that hyperleptinemia resulting from obesity might contribute to cortical porosis in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Wearable sensor systems can be used for gait analysis by providing spatiotemporal parameters and postural control (evaluated from the perspective of body sway), useful for investigating the disease progression. Thanks to their small size and low cost of their components, inertial measurement units (IMUs) are easy to wear and are cheap tools for movement analysis. Materials and Methods: The aim of this study is to review articles published in the last 21 years (from 2000 to 2021) concerning the application of wearable sensors to assess spatiotemporal parameters of gait and body postural alterations in patients with diabetes mellitus. Relevant articles were searched in the Medline database using PubMed, Ovid and Cochrane libraries. Results: One hundred and four articles were initially identified while searching the scientific literature on this topic. Thirteen were selected and analysed in this review. Wearable motion sensors are useful, noninvasive, low-cost, and objective tools for performing gait and posture analysis in diabetic patients. The IMUs can be worn at the lumber levels, tibias or feet, and different spatiotemporal parameters of movement and static posture can be assessed. Conclusions: Future research should focus on standardizing the measurement setup and selecting the most informative spatiotemporal parameters for gait and posture analysis.",2021 Oct 22,Wearable Sensor for Assessing Gait and Postural Alterations in Patients with Diabetes: A Scoping Review,Medicina
523,PMC7084712,"Diabetes mellitus comprises a group of carbohydrate metabolism disorders that share a common main feature of chronic hyperglycemia that results from defects of insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. Insulin is an important anabolic hormone, and its deficiency leads to various metabolic abnormalities in proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates. Atherosclerosis develops as a result of a multistep process ultimately leading to cardiovascular disease associated with high morbidity and mortality. Alteration of lipid metabolism is a risk factor and characteristic feature of atherosclerosis. Possible links between the two chronic disorders depending on altered metabolic pathways have been investigated in numerous studies. It was shown that both types of diabetes mellitus can actually induce atherosclerosis development or further accelerate its progression. Elevated glucose level, dyslipidemia, and other metabolic alterations that accompany the disease development are tightly involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis at almost every step of the atherogenic process. Chronic inflammation is currently considered as one of the key factors in atherosclerosis development and is present starting from the earliest stages of the pathology initiation. It may also be regarded as one of the possible links between atherosclerosis and diabetes mellitus. However, the data available so far do not allow for developing effective anti-inflammatory therapeutic strategies that would stop atherosclerotic lesion progression or induce lesion reduction. In this review, we summarize the main aspects of diabetes mellitus that possibly affect the atherogenic process and its relationship with chronic inflammation. We also discuss the established pathophysiological features that link atherosclerosis and diabetes mellitus, such as oxidative stress, altered protein kinase signaling, and the role of certain miRNA and epigenetic modifications.",2020 Mar 6,The Diabetes Mellitus–Atherosclerosis Connection: The Role of Lipid and Glucose Metabolism and Chronic Inflammation,International Journal of Molecular Sciences
524,PMC3501852,"Women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) have a high risk of developing postpartum type 2 diabetes. Strategies to prevent postpartum type 2 diabetes are important to reduce the epidemic of diabetes and its societal impact. Breastfeeding was reported to improve early postpartum glucose tolerance and reduce the subsequent risk of type 2 diabetes. To investigate whether breastfeeding influences short- and long-term postpartum diabetes outcomes, women with GDM (n = 304) participating in the prospective German GDM study were followed from delivery for up to 19 years postpartum for diabetes development. All participants were recruited between 1989 and 1999. Postpartum diabetes developed in 147 women and was dependent on the treatment received during pregnancy (insulin vs. diet), BMI, and presence/absence of islet autoantibodies. Among islet autoantibody-negative women, breastfeeding was associated with median time to diabetes of 12.3 years compared with 2.3 years in women who did not breastfeed. The lowest postpartum diabetes risk was observed in women who breastfed for >3 months. On the basis of these results, we recommend that breastfeeding should be encouraged among these women because it offers a safe and feasible low-cost intervention to reduce the risk of subsequent diabetes in this high-risk population.",2012 Nov 15,Long-Term Protective Effect of Lactation on the Development of Type 2 Diabetes in Women With Recent Gestational Diabetes Mellitus,Diabetes
525,PMC6824451,"It is critical to integrate medical nutrition therapy (MNT) provided by a registered dietician (RD) into primary care of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This is necessary to achieve the goals of improving overall metabolic measures beyond calorie restriction and weight loss. Misconceptions about nutrition in T2DM add to the challenges of executing MNT in a culturally sensitive population. The current review provides insights into MNT for the prevention and management of T2DM in India, based on both evidence and experience. It revisits historical Indian studies and provides information on appropriate dietary intake of carbohydrates (60–70%), proteins (~ 20%) and fats (10%) that will be acceptable and beneficial in an Indian T2DM population. It discusses nuances of types of carbohydrates and fats and explains associations of increased dietary fiber intake, balanced intake of low and high glycemic index foods and substitution of saturated fats with plant-based polyunsaturated fats in improving outcomes of T2DM and attenuating risk factors. The article also deliberates upon special patient populations with comorbid conditions and diseases and the necessary adjustments needed in their nutritional care. It outlines a step-wise approach to MNT involving a careful interplay of nutrition assessment, diagnosis, individualization and patient counseling. Overall, the success of MNT relies on providing accurate, acceptable and appropriate dietary choices for continued patient adherence. Collaborative efforts from diabetologists, endocrinologists, internists and RDs are required to prioritize and implement MNT in diabetes practice in India.

526,PMC6024961,"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a common complication of pregnancy; its rising incidence is a result of increased maternal obesity and older maternal age together with altered diagnostic criteria identifying a greater proportion of pregnant women with GDM. Its consequences are far-reaching, associated with poorer maternal and neonatal outcomes compared to non-GDM pregnancies, and GDM has implications for metabolic health in both mother and offspring. Objective markers to identify women at high risk for the development of GDM are useful to target therapy and potentially prevent its development. Established clinical risk factors for GDM include overweight/obesity, age, ethnicity, and family history of diabetes, though they lack specificity for its development. The addition of biomarkers to predictive models of GDM may improve the ability to identify women at risk of GDM prior to its development. These biomarkers reflect the pathophysiologic mechanisms of GDM involving insulin resistance, chronic inflammation, and altered placental function. In addition, the role of epigenetic changes in GDM pathogenesis highlights the complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors, potentially offering further refinement of the prediction of GDM risk. In this review, we will discuss the clinical challenges associated with the diagnosis of GDM and its current pathophysiologic basis, giving rise to potential biomarkers that may aid in its identification. While not yet validated for clinical use, we explore the possible clinical role of biomarkers in the future. We also explore novel diagnostic tools, including high throughput methodologies, that may have potential future application in the identification of women with GDM.",2018 May 23,The Emerging Role of Biomarkers in the Diagnosis of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus,Journal of Clinical Medicine
527,PMC8509285,"Background: Stroke remains a leading cause of death and disability throughout the world. It is well established that Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is a risk factor for stroke, while other risk factors include dyslipidaemia and hypertension. Given that the global prevalence of diabetes steadily increases, the need for adequate glycaemic control and prevention of DM-related cardiovascular events remains a challenge for the medical community. Therefore, a re-examination of the latest data related to this issue is of particular importance. Objective: This review aims to summarise the latest data on the relationship between DM and stroke, including epidemiology, risk factors, pathogenesis, prevention and biomarkers. Methods: For this purpose, comprehensive research was performed on the platforms PubMed, Google Scholar and EMBASE with a combination of the following keywords: diabetes mellitus, stroke, macrovascular complications, diabetic stroke, cardiovascular disease. Conclusions: Much progress has been made in stroke in people with DM in terms of prevention and early diagnosis. In the field of prevention, the adaptation of the daily habits and the regulation of co-morbidity of individuals play a particularly important role. Simultaneously, the most significant revolution has been brought by the relatively new treatment options that offer protection to the cardiovascular system. Moreover, many prognostic and diagnostic biomarkers have been identified, paving the way for early and accurate diagnoses. However, to date, there are crucial points that remain controversial and need further clarification.",2021 Oct 8,"Diabetes, Vascular Aging and Stroke: Old Dogs, New Tricks?",Journal of Clinical Medicine

529,PMC8688740,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most prevalent liver disease worldwide, and more than half of individuals diagnosed with type 2 diabetes concurrently present with NAFLD. There is a bidirectional pathological relationship between the two conditions, whereby NAFLD increases the risk of type 2 diabetes, and type 2 diabetes contributes to and accelerates the progression of NAFLD. Furthermore, over 30% of patients with NAFLD progress to non-alcoholic liver steatohepatitis (NASH), which then increases the risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Despite its high prevalence and the potential clinical implications, the underlying pathogenesis of NAFLD has yet to be fully elucidated, and there is no consensus regarding standard diagnosis and treatment for either NALFD or NASH. As patients with both NASH and type 2 diabetes have impaired hepatic function owing to chronic inflammation and the resulting structural changes caused by hepatic fat accumulation, they face reduced options for antidiabetic treatment. SGLT-2 inhibitors inhibit glucose reabsorption in the proximal tubule, with increased excretion of glucose in urine and decreased glucose levels in plasma, and their glycemia-lowering effect is insulin-independent. Several other beneficial effects have been reported for SGLT-2 inhibitors, including reduced risks of cardiovascular and renal diseases, improved blood pressure control, body weight reduction, and reductions in liver fat content. Experimental studies in mouse models have suggested that SGLT-2 inhibitors may have beneficial modulatory effects on NAFLD/NASH. Several trials in patients with type 2 diabetes have also suggested that these drugs may be useful in treating both type 2 diabetes and NAFLD or NASH. However, further research is needed to identify the mechanisms by which SGLT-2 inhibitors affect fatty liver and steatohepatitis. In this state-of-the-art review, we explore the literature on the efficacy of SGLT-2 inhibitors in patients with type 2 diabetes and NASH, and present arguments for and against the use of SGLT-2 inhibitors in this patient population.",2021 Dec 7,Efficacy of Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter 2 Inhibitors in Patients With Concurrent Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis: A Review of the Evidence,Frontiers in Endocrinology
530,PMC7500018,"Diabetes mellitus is a common chronic disease and a severe public health issue. The incidence trends for type 1 diabetes (TIDM) and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) have rarely been studied on a global scale. We aimed to determine the temporal and geographical trends of diabetes globally.
Data on diabetes mellitus, including incidence, prevalence from 1990 to 2017 were obtained from the 2017 Global Burden of Disease study. We calculated the estimated annual percentage changes (EAPCs) in age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) of diabetes mellitus according to sex, region, and disease type.
The worldwide incident cases of diabetes mellitus has increased by 102.9% from 11,303,084 cases in 1990 to 22,935,630 cases in 2017 worldwide, while the ASIR increased from 234 /100,000 persons (95% UI, 219–249) to 285/100,000 persons (95% UI, 262–310) in this period [EAPC = 0.87, 95% confidence interval (CI):0.79–0.96]. The global ASIRs of T1DM and T2DM both demonstrated significant increase during 1990–2017, with EAPCs of 0.34 (95% CI,0.30–0.39) and 0.89 (95% CI,0.80–0.97), respectively. The ASIR trends also varied considerably by regions and countries. The increase in ASIR was greatest in high sociodemographic index regions (EAPC = 1.05, 95% CI:0.92–1.17) and lowest in low-SDI regions (EAPC = 0.79, 95% CI:0.71–0.88).

531,PMC8279635,"Longitudinal data on progression, complications, and management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) across India are scarce. LANDMARC (CTRI/2017/05/008452), the first pan‐India, longitudinal, prospective, observational study, aims to understand the management and real‐world outcomes of T2DM over 3 years.
Adults (≥25 to ≤60 years old at T2DM diagnosis; diabetes duration ≥2 years at enrollment; controlled/uncontrolled on ≥2 anti‐diabetic agents) were enrolled. Baseline characteristics were analyzed using descriptive statistics.
Of the 6279 recruited participants, 6236 were eligible for baseline assessment (56.6% [n/N = 3528/6236] men; mean ± SD age: 52.1 ± 9.2 years, diabetes duration: 8.6 ± 5.6 years). mean ± SD HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose, and postprandial glucose values were 64 ± 17 mmol/mol (8.1 ± 1.6%), 142.8 ± 50.4 mg/dl, and 205.7 ± 72.3 mg/dl, respectively. Only 25.1% (n/N = 1122/6236) participants had controlled glycemia (HbA1c < 53 mmol/mol, <7%). Macrovascular and microvascular complications were prevalent in 2.3% (n/N = 145/6236) and 14.5% (n/N = 902/6236) participants, respectively. Among those with complications, non‐fatal myocardial infarction (n/N = 74/145, 51.0%) and neuropathy (n/N = 737/902, 81.7%) were the most reported macrovascular and microvascular complication, respectively. Hypertension (n/N = 2566/3281, 78.2%) and dyslipidemia (n/N = 1635/3281, 49.8%) were the most reported cardiovascular risks. Majority (74.5%; n/N = 4643/6236) were taking oral anti‐diabetic drugs (OADs) only, while 24.4% (n/N = 1522/6236) participants were taking OADs+insulin. Biguanides (n/N = 5796/6236, 92.9%) and sulfonylureas (n/N = 4757/6236, 76.3%) were the most reported OADs. Basal (n/N = 837/6236, 13.4%) and premix (n/N = 684/6236, 11.0%) insulins were the most reported insulins.

532,PMC8825412,"Patients with diabetes mellitus have an increased risk of fractures; however, the underlying mechanism is largely unknown. We aimed to investigate whether the risk of major osteoporotic fractures in diabetes patients differs between subjects initiated with alendronate and denosumab, respectively.
We conducted a retrospective nationwide cohort study through access to all discharge diagnoses (ICD-10 system) from the National Danish Patient Registry along with all redeemed drug prescriptions (ATC classification system) from the Health Service Prescription Registry. We identified all subjects with a diabetes diagnosis between 2000 and 2018 and collected data on the first new prescription of anti-osteoporotic treatment between 2011 and 2018. Exposure was defined as either alendronate or denosumab treatment initiated after diabetes diagnosis. Outcome information was collected by identification of all major osteoporotic fracture (MOF) diagnoses, i.e., hip, spine, forearm, and humerus, from exposure until 2018 or censoring by emigration or death. The risk of fracture was calculated as hazard ratios (HR) using multiply adjusted Cox proportional models with death as a competing risk.
We included 8,745 subjects initiated with either alendronate (n = 8,255) or denosumab (n = 490). The cohort consisted of subjects with a mean age of 73.62 (SD ± 9.27) years, primarily females (69%) and suffering mainly from type 2 diabetes (98.22%) with a median diabetes duration at baseline of 5.45 years (IQR 2.41–9.19). Those in the denosumab group were older (mean 75.60 [SD ± 9.72] versus 73.51 [SD ± 9.23] years), had a higher proportion of women (81% versus 68%, RR 1.18 [95% CI 1.13–1.24], and were more comorbid (mean CCI 2.68 [95% CI 2.47–2.88] versus 1.98 [95% CI 1.93–2.02]) compared to alendronate initiators. In addition, denosumab users had a higher prevalence of previous fractures (64% versus 46%, RR 1.38 [95% CI 1.28–1.48]). The adjusted HR for any MOF after treatment initiation with denosumab was 0.89 (95% CI 0.78–1.02) compared to initiation with alendronate.
The risk of incident MOF among subjects with diabetes was similar between those initially treated with alendronate and denosumab. These findings indicate that the two treatment strategies are equally effective in preventing osteoporotic fractures in subjects with diabetes.",2022 Jan 26,The Efficacy of Alendronate Versus Denosumab on Major Osteoporotic Fracture Risk in Elderly Patients With Diabetes Mellitus: A Danish Retrospective Cohort Study,Frontiers in Endocrinology
533,PMC8416465,"The presence of hypertension (HTN) in type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) is a common phenomenon in more than half of the diabetic patients. Since HTN constitutes a predictor of vascular complications and cardiovascular disease in type 2 DM patients, it is of significance to understand the molecular and cellular mechanisms of type 2 DM binding to HTN. This review attempts to understand the mechanism via the perspective of the metabolites. It reviewed the metabolic perturbations, the biological function of perturbated metabolites in two diseases, and the mechanism underlying metabolic perturbation that contributed to the connection of type 2 DM and HTN. DM-associated metabolic perturbations may be involved in the pathogenesis of HTN potentially in insulin, angiotensin II, sympathetic nervous system, and the energy reprogramming to address how perturbated metabolites in type 2 DM affect the pathogenesis of HTN. The recent integration of the metabolism field with microbiology and immunology may provide a wider perspective. Metabolism affects immune function and supports immune cell differentiation by the switch of energy. The diverse metabolites produced by bacteria modified the biological process in the inflammatory response of chronic metabolic diseases either. The rapidly evolving metabolomics has enabled to have a better understanding of the process of diseases, which is an important tool for providing some insight into the investigation of diseases mechanism.

535,PMC6465731,"Congenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) is a rare condition characterized by severe polyuria, due to the inability of the kidneys to concentrate urine in response to arginine vasopressin (AVP). In the majority of the cases, the disease shows an X‐linked inherited pattern, although an autosomal recessive inheritance was also observed.
We report a patient with a severe NDI diagnosed during the neonatal period. Because the patient was female without a family history of congenital NDI, her disease was thought to exhibit an autosomal recessive form.
A full mutation analysis of AVP receptor 2 (AVPR2; MIM#300538) gene showed no mutations. However, direct Sanger sequencing of the aquaporin 2 (AQP2) revealed an apparently homozygous mutation at nucleotide position NM_000486.5:c.374C>T (p.Thr125Met) in exon 2.

537,PMC8257029,"This article aims to narrate the various oral complications in individuals suffering from diabetes mellitus. Google search for “diabetes mellitus and oral complications” was done. The search was also carried out for “diabetes mellitus” and its oral complications individually. Diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disorder that is a global epidemic and a common cause of morbidity and mortality in the world today. Currently, there are about 422 million cases of diabetes mellitus worldwide. Diabetic patients can develop different complications in the body such as retinopathy, neuropathy, nephropathy, cardiovascular disease. Complications in the oral cavity have been observed in individuals suffering from diabetes mellitus. A study noted that more than 90% of diabetic patients suffered from oral complications. Another research has shown a greater prevalence of oral mucosal disorders in patients with diabetes mellitus than non-diabetic population: 45–88% in patients with type 2 diabetes compared to 38.3–45% in non-diabetic subjects and 44.7% in type 1 diabetic individuals compared to 25% in the non-diabetic population. Oral complications in people with diabetes are periodontal disease, dental caries, oral infections, salivary dysfunction, taste dysfunction, delayed wound healing, tongue abnormalities, halitosis, and lichen planus. The high glucose level in saliva, poor neutrophil function, neuropathy, and small vessel damage contribute to oral complications in individuals with uncontrolled diabetes. Good oral health is imperative for healthy living. Oral complications cause deterioration to the quality of life in diabetic patients. Complications like periodontal disease having a bidirectional relationship with diabetes mellitus even contribute to increased blood glucose levels in people with diabetes.

538,PMC5717832,"Diagnosis of monogenic as well as atypical forms of diabetes mellitus has important clinical implications for their specific diagnosis, prognosis, and targeted treatment. Single gene mutations that affect beta-cell function represent 1–2% of all cases of diabetes. However, phenotypic heterogeneity and lack of family history of diabetes can limit the diagnosis of monogenic forms of diabetes. Next-generation sequencing technologies provide an excellent opportunity to screen large numbers of individuals with a diagnosis of diabetes for mutations in disease-associated genes.
We utilized a targeted sequencing approach using the Illumina HiSeq to perform a case-control sequencing study of 22 monogenic diabetes genes in 4016 individuals with type 2 diabetes (including 1346 individuals diagnosed before the age of 40 years) and 2872 controls. We analyzed protein-coding variants identified from the sequence data and compared the frequencies of pathogenic variants (protein-truncating variants and missense variants) between the cases and controls.
A total of 40 individuals with diabetes (1.8% of early onset sub-group and 0.6% of adult onset sub-group) were carriers of known pathogenic missense variants in the GCK, HNF1A, HNF4A, ABCC8, and INS genes. In addition, heterozygous protein truncating mutations were detected in the GCK, HNF1A, and HNF1B genes in seven individuals with diabetes. Rare missense mutations in the GCK gene were significantly over-represented in individuals with diabetes (0.5% carrier frequency) compared to controls (0.035%). One individual with early onset diabetes was homozygous for a rare pathogenic missense variant in the WFS1 gene but did not have the additional phenotypes associated with Wolfram syndrome.
Targeted sequencing of genes linked with monogenic diabetes can identify disease-relevant mutations in individuals diagnosed with type 2 diabetes not suspected of having monogenic forms of the disease. Our data suggests that GCK-MODY frequently masquerades as classical type 2 diabetes. The results confirm that MODY is under-diagnosed, particularly in individuals presenting with early onset diabetes and clinically labeled as type 2 diabetes; thus, sequencing of all monogenic diabetes genes should be routinely considered in such individuals. Genetic information can provide a specific diagnosis, inform disease prognosis and may help to better stratify treatment plans.

Both, the durable polymer zotarolimus-eluting stent (DP-ZES), the first DES to gain FDA-approval for specific use in patients with diabetes mellitus, and the polymer-free sirolimus- and probucol-eluting stent (PF-SES), with a unique design that enables effective drug release without the need of a polymer offer the potential to enhance clinical long-term outcomes especially in patients with diabetes mellitus.
We investigate 10-year clinical outcomes of the prespecified subgroups of patients with and without diabetes mellitus, randomly assigned to treatment with PF-SES versus DP-ZES in the ISAR-TEST 5 trial. The primary endpoint of interest was major adverse cardiac events (MACE), defined as the composite of all-cause death, any myocardial infarction or any revascularization. Further endpoints of interest were cardiac death, myocardial infarction related to the target vessel and target lesion revascularization as well as the individual components of the primary composite endpoint and the incidence of definite or probable stent thrombosis at 10 years.
This analysis includes a total of 3002 patients randomly assigned to PF-SES (n = 2002) or DP-ZES (n = 1000). Prevalence of diabetes mellitus was high and comparable, 575 Patients (28.7%) in PF-SES group and 295 patients (29.5%) in DP-ZES group (P = 0.66). At 10 years 53.5% of patients with diabetes mellitus and 68.5% of patients without diabetes mellitus were alive. Regarding major adverse cardiac events, PF-SES as compared to DP-ZES showed comparable event rates in patients with diabetes mellitus (74.8% vs. 79.6%; hazard ratio 0.86; 95% CI 0.73–1.02; P = 0.08) and in patients without diabetes (PF-SES 62.5% vs. DP-ZES 62.2%; hazard ratio 0.99; 95% CI 0.88–1.11; P = 0.88).
At 10 years, both new-generation DES show comparable clinical outcome irrespective of diabetic status or polymer strategy. Event rates after PCI in patients with diabetes mellitus are considerable higher than in patients without diabetes mellitus and continue to accrue over time.

540,PMC5829348,"Posttransplant diabetes mellitus (PTDM) is a well-recognized complication of heart transplantation and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Previous studies have yielded wide ranging estimates in the incidence of PTDM due in part to variable definitions applied. In addition, there is a limited published data on the management of PTDM after heart transplantation and a paucity of studies examining the effects of newer classes of hypoglycaemic drug therapies. In this review, we discuss the role of established glucose-lowering therapies and the rationale and emerging clinical evidence that supports the role of incretin-based therapies (glucagon like peptide- (GLP-) 1 agonists and dipeptidyl peptidase- (DPP-) 4 inhibitors) and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors in the management of PTDM after heart transplantation. Recently published Consensus Guidelines for the diagnosis of PTDM will hopefully lead to more consistent approaches to the diagnosis of PTDM and provide a platform for the larger-scale multicentre trials that will be needed to determine the role of these newer therapies in the management of PTDM.",2018 Jan 29,Management Strategies for Posttransplant Diabetes Mellitus after Heart Transplantation: A Review,Journal of Transplantation
541,PMC5838894,"For decades, sulfonylureas (SUs) have been important drugs in the antidiabetic therapeutic armamentarium. They have been used as monotherapy as well as combination therapy. Focus on newer drugs and concerns about the risk of severe hypoglycemia and weight gain with some SUs have led to discussion on their safety and utility. It has to be borne in mind that the adverse events associated with SUs should not be ascribed to the whole class, as many modern SUs, such as glimepiride and gliclazide modified release, are associated with better safety profiles. Furthermore, individualization of treatment, using SUs in combination with other drugs, backed with careful monitoring and patient education, ensures maximum benefits with minimal side effects. The current guidelines, developed by experts from Africa, Asia, and the Middle East, promote the safe and smart use of SUs in combination with other glucose-lowering drugs.",2018 Jan-Feb,Consensus Recommendations on Sulfonylurea and Sulfonylurea Combinations in the Management of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus – International Task Force,Indian Journal of Endocrinology and Metabolism

We report a patient with a thickened pituitary stalk (TPS) and papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) whose diagnosis remained obscure until a skin lesion appeared. The patient presented with PTC, status postthyroidectomy, and I131 therapy. PTC molecular testing revealed BRAF mutant (V600E, GTC>GAG). She had a 5-year history of polyuria/polydipsia. Overnight dehydration study confirmed diabetes insipidus (DI). MRI revealed TPS with loss of the posterior pituitary bright spot. Evaluation showed hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and low IGF-1. Chest X-ray and ACE levels were normal. Radiographs to evaluate for extrapituitary sites of Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis (LCH) were unremarkable. Germinoma studies were negative: normal serum and CSF beta-hCG, alpha-fetoprotein, and CEA. Three years later, the patient developed vulvar labial lesions followed by inguinal region skin lesions, biopsy of which revealed LCH. Reanalysis of thyroid pathology was consistent with concurrent LCH, PTC, and Hashimoto's thyroiditis within the thyroid. This case illustrates that one must be vigilant for extrapituitary manifestations of systemic diseases to diagnose the etiology of TPS.

543,PMC7094867,"Non-muscle invasive bladder cancer patients are at high risk for tumour recurrence and progression, hence an intensive follow-up procedure is recommended which is costly. Identification of factors that are associated with the risk of recurrence and progression may enable personalized follow-up schedules. Obesity and diabetes mellitus may be associated with a worse prognosis, but the evidence is limited and inconsistent. Our objective was to determine the associations of BMI and diabetes mellitus with risks of recurrence and progression among non-muscle invasive bladder cancer patients.
A population-based cohort of patients diagnosed with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer between 1995 and 2010 was retrospectively identified from the Netherlands Cancer Registry and invited to participate in the Nijmegen Bladder Cancer Study (n = 1,433). Average weight during adult life, height, and diabetes mellitus diagnosis were self-reported by use of a questionnaire. Clinical follow-up data were retrieved from medical files. Associations were quantified using proportional hazard analyses. For all analyses, minimal adjustment sets were selected using a Directed Acyclic Graph.
Fourteen percent of the patients indicated to be diagnosed with diabetes mellitus, and more than half was overweight (45%) or obese (9%). Compared to healthy weight, overweight and obesity were not associated with risk of recurrence (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) = 1.02; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.86–1.22, and HR = 1.02; 95% CI: 0.76–1.38, respectively) and overall progression (HR = 1.04; 95% CI: 0.74–1.44, and HR = 1.20; 95% CI: 0.69–2.09, respectively). Also, no clear associations of diabetes mellitus with risk of recurrence (HR = 1.22; 95% CI: 0.98–1.54) and overall progression (HR = 1.16; 95% CI: 0.76–1.76) were found.

544,PMC8465784,"This study assessed the performance of visceral adiposity index and body shape index in predicting diabetes mellitus (DM) risk and compared their predictive ability to that of body mass index and waist circumference.
Among 8249 consecutive subjects who attended the Nationwide Health Check Up System for Senior Citizens (≥ 65 years) between 2008 and 2018, we examined the associations of several adiposity indices with DM risk and explored gender differences.
Among all adiposity indicators, Chinese visceral adiposity index (CVAI) demonstrated the highest discriminatory ability for diabetes mellitus with area under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) of 0.65, 0.68, and 0.66 for men, women, and all participants, respectively, and optimal cut-offs set as 126.09 in men and 117.77 in women. Compared with body shape index (ABSI), both CVAI and VAI were strongly associated with baseline DM (adjusted OR: 4.85, 95% CI: 4.05–5.82 and 4.22, 95% CI: 3.53–5.05 for 4th vs 1st quartile groups by CVAI and VAI, P < 0.001), which was more pronounced in older adult women (Pinteraction < 0.05). Over a median of 5.25 years (IQR: 3.07–6.44 years) follow-up, Cox regression models showed higher predictive ability of CVAI and VAI compared to ABSI. Further, both CVAI and VAI independently predicted new-onset DM (adjusted HR: 1.29, 95% CI: 1.22–1.37 and 1.16, 95% CI: 1.11–1.21 by CVAI and VAI) and composite endpoint of new DM and death among those without baseline DM.

545,PMC7387426,"Metabolic abnormalities such as dyslipidemia, hyperinsulinemia, or insulin resistance and obesity play key roles in the induction and progression of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The field of immunometabolism implies a bidirectional link between the immune system and metabolism, in which inflammation plays an essential role in the promotion of metabolic abnormalities (e.g., obesity and T2DM), and metabolic factors, in turn, regulate immune cell functions. Obesity as the main inducer of a systemic low-level inflammation is a main susceptibility factor for T2DM. Obesity-related immune cell infiltration, inflammation, and increased oxidative stress promote metabolic impairments in the insulin-sensitive tissues and finally, insulin resistance, organ failure, and premature aging occur. Hyperglycemia and the subsequent inflammation are the main causes of micro- and macroangiopathies in the circulatory system. They also promote the gut microbiota dysbiosis, increased intestinal permeability, and fatty liver disease. The impaired immune system together with metabolic imbalance also increases the susceptibility of patients to several pathogenic agents such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Thus, the need for a proper immunization protocol among such patients is granted. The focus of the current review is to explore metabolic and immunological abnormalities affecting several organs of T2DM patients and explain the mechanisms, whereby diabetic patients become more susceptible to infectious diseases.",2020 Jul 22,The Effects of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus on Organ Metabolism and the Immune System,Frontiers in Immunology

It becomes rapidly increasing, non-communicable disease—a major threat to global public health particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa. Though previous studies among diabetic patients were focused in health institution, limited knowledge, attitude and practice were seen. There is no study conducted about diabetes related to knowledge, attitudes, practice and associated factors in the community level.
The study assessed knowledge, attitude, practices, and its associated factors towards diabetes mellitus among non diabetic community members of Bale Zone, Ethiopia.
Community based cross-sectional study was conducted from November 15 to December 15, 2015 among 605 non diabetic community members of Bale Zone administrative towns. Data was collected using pretested structured face-to-face interview after taking informed written consent. Respondents were selected by systematic random sampling. The data was entered into EPI data version 3.1 and analyzed using Statistical package for social sciences version 20. Odds ratio and 95% confidence interval were calculated and P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. Finally, multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to indicate the independent predictors of knowledge, attitude and practice.

547,PMC7517557,"Both diabetes mellitus and being female significantly increase the risk of being diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD). The diagnosis of MDD, combined with diabetes mellitus, can be detrimental in terms of mortality and morbidity. We aimed at investigating the impact of diabetes mellitus on the gender gap in MDD over the course of a human lifetime.
In a cross-sectional study over the course of 17 years, medical claims data of the general Austrian population (n=8 996 916) between 1997 and 2014 was analyzed. Of these, 123 232 patients with diabetes mellitus were extracted and compared with non-diabetic controls.
In a cohort of 123 232 patients with diabetes mellitus and 1 933 218 controls (52% females, 48% males), women with diabetes had 2.55 times increased ORs to be diagnosed with MDD compared with women without diabetes (95% CI 2.48 to 2.62, p<0.001) between the age of 30 and 69 years. The effect of diabetes mellitus on the prevalence of MDD was significantly smaller in men (OR=1.85, 95% CI 1.80 to 1.91, p<0.001). Between 0 and 30 years and after age 70 years, the gender gap of MDD was not different between patients with and without diabetes mellitus. The peak of the gender gap in MDD in patients with diabetes mellitus was around the age of 40–49 years. A sensitivity analysis identified overweight, obesity and alcohol dependence as the most potent influencing factors of the widening of the gender gap among patients with diabetes mellitus.
Diabetes mellitus is a stronger risk factor for MDD in women than in men, with the greatest width of the gender gap between 40 and 49 years. High-risk patients for MDD, such as overweight female patients with diabetes, should be more carefully assessed and monitored.",2020 Sep 24,Diabetes mellitus is associated with a higher risk for major depressive disorder in women than in men,BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care

However, the relationship between the FGF21-adiponectin pathway and type 2 diabetes in humans is unclear. Here, we investigated the association of FGF21/adiponectin ratio with deterioration in glycemia in a prospective cohort study.
We studied 6361 subjects recruited from the prospective Shanghai Nicheng Cohort Study in China. The association between baseline FGF21/adiponectin ratio and new-onset diabetes and incident prediabetes was evaluated using multiple logistic regression analysis.
At baseline, FGF21/adiponectin ratio levels increased progressively with the deterioration in glycemic control from normal glucose tolerance to prediabetes and diabetes (p for trend < 0.001). Over a median follow-up of 4.6 years, 195 subjects developed new-onset diabetes and 351 subjects developed incident prediabetes. Elevated baseline FGF21/adiponectin ratio was a significant predictor of new-onset diabetes independent of traditional risk factors, especially in subjects with prediabetes (odds ratio, 1.367; p = 0.001). Moreover, FGF21/adiponectin ratio predicted incident prediabetes (odds ratio, 1.185; p = 0.021) while neither FGF21 nor adiponectin were independent predictors of incident prediabetes (both p > 0.05). Furthermore, net reclassification improvement and integrated discrimination improvement analyses showed that FGF21/adiponectin ratio provided a better performance in diabetes risk prediction than the use of FGF21 or adiponectin alone.
FGF21/adiponectin ratio independently predicted the onset of prediabetes and diabetes, with the potential to be a useful biomarker of deterioration in glycemia.

Coronary artery disease (CAD) is accelerated in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D).
To test whether this reflects differential genetic influences on CAD risk in subjects with T2D, we performed a systematic assessment of genetic overlap between CAD and T2D in 66 643 subjects (27 708 with CAD and 24 259 with T2D). Variants showing apparent association with CAD in stratified analyses or evidence of interaction were evaluated in a further 117 787 subjects (16 694 with CAD and 11 537 with T2D).
None of the previously characterized CAD loci was found to have specific effects on CAD in T2D individuals, and a genome-wide interaction analysis found no new variants for CAD that could be considered T2D specific.

552,PMC5239834,"Introduction. Management of postoperative central diabetes insipidus (DI) can be challenging from changes in volume status and serum sodium levels. We report a case successfully using a dilute vasopressin bolus protocol in managing hypovolemic shock in acute, postoperative, central DI. Case Report. Patient presented after bifrontal decompressive craniotomy for severe traumatic brain injury. He developed increased urine output resulting in hypovolemia and hypernatremia. He was resuscitated with intravenous fluids including a dilute vasopressin bolus protocol. This protocol consisted of 1 unit of vasopressin in 1 liter of 0.45% normal saline. This protocol was given in boluses based on the formula: urine output minus one hundred. Initial serum sodium was 148 mmol/L, and one-hour urine output was 1 liter. After 48 hours, he transitioned to 1-desamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin (DDAVP). Pre-DDAVP serum sodium was 149 mmol/L and one-hour urine output 320 cc. Comparing the bolus protocol to the DDAVP protocol, the average sodium was 143.8 ± 3.2 and 149.6 ± 3.2 mmol/L (p = 0.0001), average urine output was 433.2 ± 354.4 and 422.3 ± 276.0 cc/hr (p = 0.90), and average specific gravity was 1.019 ± 0.009 and 1.016 ± 0.01 (p = 0.42), respectively.

553,PMC6158996,"This study is to investigate the predictive value of posterior pituitary bright spot (PPBS) on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for postoperative diabetes insipidus (DI) in patients with pituitary adenoma.
This was a retrospective study. In total, 65 patients with pituitary adenoma who underwent transsphenoidal surgery were enrolled. Before surgery, all patients had MRI examinations. The length of pituitary stalk and position of PPBS in T1WI sagittal and coronal sections were analyzed. The volume and height of the tumor was calculated in enhanced T1WI. Urine volume was monitored to analyze the clinical factors contributing to DI.
Among the 65 cases of pituitary adenoma, there were 54 cases of positive PPBS and 11 cases of negative PPBS. There were 32 cases of transient DI, and among these, 22 cases were positive PPBS and 10 cases were negative PPBS. However, there were 33 cases without DI, and among these, 32 cases were positive PPBS and one case was negative PPBS. The negative PPBS was significantly higher in cases with DI, compared with positive PPBS (P<0.05). Logistic regression showed that preoperative negative PPBS was an important predictor for postoperative DI (P<0.05).
Postoperative DI should be considered when there is negative preoperative PPBS on MRI.

554,PMC8259464,"Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (DI) refers to the reduction in the ability of the kidney to concentrate urine, which can be caused by partial or complete resistance at the site of action of anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) in the collecting tubules. Ifosfamide-induced nephrogenic DI typically occurs concomitantly in patients who have other signs of tubular toxicity consistent with Fanconi syndrome including glucosuria, aminoaciduria, and hypophosphatemia. We present a case of a 36-year-old female with recurrent synovial cell sarcoma of the pleural membranes, treated with ifosfamide-based chemotherapy, who was admitted to the hospital for the management of polyuria, hypotension, as well as electrolyte derangements including hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia and non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, 1 week after receiving a cumulative ifosfamide dose of 7.5 g/m2. Nephrogenic DI was indicated by polyuria as well as a urine osmolality to plasma osmolality ratio of less than 1.5 following a trial of intravenous desmopressin, but the patient’s acute kidney injury on presentation precluded the early employment of thiazides and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Instead, the patient’s polyuria and urine osmolality improved only after the administration of repetitive supraphysiologic doses of intravenous desmopressin. Our case reiterates that patients with non-hereditary nephrogenic DI may have partial rather than complete resistance to ADH and highlights that desmopressin may be considered in patients with ifosfamide-induced nephrogenic DI to prevent severe volume depletion, especially in patients who have persistent symptomatic polyuria despite maintaining a careful fluid balance and pharmacological therapy with NSAIDs and diuretics, or if the patient’s clinical condition precludes the use of these strategies.",2021 Jul 1,Ifosfamide-induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus responsive to supraphysiologic doses of intravenous desmopressin ,Clinical Nephrology.

We investigated the relationship between eating speed, as well as other eating habits such as snacking and skip breakfast, and new onset of diabetes in a nation-wide Japanese cohort. We obtained data from the nation-wide annual health check program in Japan. In 197,825 participants without diabetes in 2008, questionnaires recorded data on the diet habits (eating speed, snack after supper or before sleep, and skipping breakfast) and unadjusted and multivariable-adjusted logistic regression models were used to measure the odds ratio of new-onset diabetes mellitus in a 3-year follow up. The proportion of fast eaters, those who snack after supper, snack before sleep, and skip breakfast was higher in the new-onset diabetes group than in the group who did not develop diabetes mellitus. As compared with the non-fast eater group, fast eaters were generally younger, had higher BMI, had more weight gain from 20 years onwards, and experienced frequent weight fluctuations of ≥3 kg within 1 year. The risk of fast eaters developing diabetes mellitus remained even after correction for multiple factors including age, body weight, rate of weight change, blood pressure, smoking, and alcohol consumption. No other eating habits were independent predictors for onset of diabetes mellitus. Results show that fast eating is a sole predisposing factor among eating habits for new-onset diabetes.

This was a retrospective study including a group of 74 patients managed at a tertiary care center. Patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, steroid-induced diabetes, post-transplant diabetes, and other types of diabetes were excluded. Patients were screened using the Diabetes Distress Scale-2 (DDS-2). A Diabetes Medication Complexity Scoring (DMCS) system was developed to objectively assess the diabetes medication complexity. Based on DMCS, participants were categorized into three groups: low (n=26), moderate (n=22), and high (n=26) medication complexity.
Complexity groups were similar in sociodemographic characteristics, diabetes duration, body mass index, and blood pressure as well as the prevalence of hypertension, hyperlipidemia and hypoglycemic episodes. However, there were significant differences for HbA1c with higher HbA1c in the high and moderate complexity groups than in the low group (p=0.006). The microvascular complications were also more common in higher complexity groups (p=0.003). The prevalence of diabetes-related distress (DDS-2 ≥6) was 34.6% in the low, 36.4% in the moderate and 69.2% in the high complexity groups (p=0.021). There were significant differences in DDS-2 score among complexity groups (p=0.009), with higher DDS-2 score in the high complexity group compared with the moderate (p=0.008) and low complexity groups (p=0.009).

The burden of this disease includes a number of co-morbidities. However, estimates of prevalence, incidence and associated diseases as well as the current temporal development and regional differences are largely missing for South Western Germany.
Lifetime diagnosis-based prevalence, incidence and presence of concomitant co-morbidities were examined between the years 2007 and 2010 in the claims data set of all insured persons of the AOK Baden-Wuerttemberg, a large statutory health insurance. The analysis was based on the respective WHO-ICD-10 codes. Data were standardized for age and sex on the residential population of about 10 million inhabitants of South Western Germany.
The total study cohort involved approximately 3.5 million persons each year. The standardized diagnosis-based prevalence (SDP) of T2DM rose from 6.6 %, 7.4 %, 8.0 %, up to 8.6 % in the years 2007 to 2010. Yearly SDP was between 14.0 % and 18.9 % at an age range of 60 to 64 years and between 26.7 % and 31.8 % at an age of 75 years or older. In the year 2010 the regional distributions of standardized diagnosis-based prevalence were between 7.6 % and 11.6 %, respectively. Incidence rates were 8.3 in 2008, 7.8 in 2009, and 8.7 in 2010 (all rates per 1000). The excess disease risk (odds ratio) of T2DM was for adiposity 2.8 to 3.0, hypertension 2.4 to 3.7, coronary heart disease 1.8 to 1.9, stroke 1.7 to 1.8, renal insufficiency 2.8 to 3.4, and retinopathy 2.8 to 2.9 in the years 2007 to 2010. These co-morbidities appeared several years earlier compared to the non-diabetic population.
T2DM is common and increasing in South Western Germany. In particular a quarter of the population in higher ages was afflicted by T2DM. Interestingly a region-specific pattern was observed as well as an increase in numbers during earlier years in life.

558,PMC8831806,"The association of serum retinol-binding protein (RBP) levels with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) remains controversial. Furthermore, few studies have investigated their relationship in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to explore the association between serum RBP levels and NAFLD in Chinese inpatients with T2DM.
 This cross-sectional, real-world study included 2,263 Chinese T2DM inpatients. NAFLD was diagnosed by abdominal ultrasonography. The subjects were divided into four groups based on RBP quartiles, and clinical characteristics were compared among the four groups. The associations of both RBP levels and quartiles with the presence of NAFLD were also analyzed.
 After adjustment for sex, age, and diabetes duration, there was a significant increase in the prevalence of NAFLD from the lowest to the highest RBP quartiles (30.4%, 40.0%, 42.4%, and 44.7% for the first, second, third, and fourth quartiles, respectively, P<0.001 for trend). Fully adjusted multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that both increased RBP levels (odds ratio, 1.155; 95% confidence interval, 1.012 to 1.318; P=0.033) and quartiles (P=0.014 for trend) were independently associated with the presence of NAFLD in T2DM patients.
 Increased serum RBP levels were independently associated with the presence of NAFLD in Chinese T2DM inpatients. Serum RBP levels may be used as one of the indicators to assess the risk of NAFLD in T2DM patients.",2021 Aug 10,Serum Retinol-Binding Protein Levels Are Associated with Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease in Chinese Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: A Real-World Study,Diabetes & Metabolism Journal
559,PMC5343917,"The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the organelle where secretory and membrane proteins are synthesized and folded. Unfolded proteins that are retained within the ER can cause ER stress. Eukaryotic cells have a defense system called the “unfolded protein response” (UPR), which protects cells from ER stress. Cells undergo apoptosis when ER stress exceeds the capacity of the UPR, which has been revealed to cause human diseases. Although neurodegenerative diseases are well-known ER stress-related diseases, it has been discovered that endocrine diseases are also related to ER stress. In this review, we focus on ER stress-related human endocrine disorders. In addition to diabetes mellitus, which is well characterized, several relatively rare genetic disorders such as familial neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus (FNDI), Wolfram syndrome, and isolated growth hormone deficiency type II (IGHD2) are discussed in this article.",2017 Feb 11,Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) Stress and Endocrine Disorders,International Journal of Molecular Sciences
560,PMC5770032,"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is associated with developing type 2 diabetes, but very few studies have examined its effect on developing cardiovascular disease.
We conducted a retrospective cohort study utilizing a large primary care database in the United Kingdom. From 1 February 1990 to 15 May 2016, 9,118 women diagnosed with GDM were identified and randomly matched with 37,281 control women by age and timing of pregnancy (up to 3 months). Adjusted incidence rate ratios (IRRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for cardiovascular risk factors and cardiovascular disease. Women with GDM were more likely to develop type 2 diabetes (IRR = 21.96; 95% CI 18.31–26.34) and hypertension (IRR = 1.85; 95% CI 1.59–2.16) after adjusting for age, Townsend (deprivation) quintile, body mass index, and smoking. For ischemic heart disease (IHD), the IRR was 2.78 (95% CI 1.37–5.66), and for cerebrovascular disease 0.95 (95% CI 0.51–1.77; p-value = 0.87), after adjusting for the above covariates and lipid-lowering medication and hypertension at baseline. Follow-up screening for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular risk factors was poor. Limitations include potential selective documentation of severe GDM for women in primary care, higher surveillance for outcomes in women diagnosed with GDM than control women, and a short median follow-up postpartum period, with a small number of outcomes for IHD and cerebrovascular disease.
Women diagnosed with GDM were at very high risk of developing type 2 diabetes and had a significantly increased incidence of hypertension and IHD. Identifying this group of women in general practice and targeting cardiovascular risk factors could improve long-term outcomes.
Krishnarajah Nirantharakumar and colleagues present results from a cohort of women with gestational diabetes and identify these as a target group for preventative interventions for cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes.
The prevalence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is increasing rapidly in most developed countries.
Although it is well documented that women diagnosed with GDM have a greatly increased lifetime risk of developing type 2 diabetes, there is a paucity of reports on its association with cardiovascular disease.
Only 3 previous population-based cohort studies have reported on GDM and the long-term risk of cardiovascular events (including 1 utilizing a primary care database), and no studies have been reported from the United Kingdom (UK).
This population-based retrospective cohort study utilized a large UK primary care database that included more than 9,000 women diagnosed with GDM between 1 February 1990 and 15 May 2016.
The association between GDM and the development of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease postpartum was examined.
Women diagnosed with GDM were over 20 times more likely to develop type 2 diabetes, 2.8 times more likely to develop ischemic heart disease, and twice as likely to develop hypertension, although no association was found for cerebrovascular disease.
Less than 60% of women diagnosed with GDM were screened in primary care for type 2 diabetes in the first year postpartum, and the proportion screened rapidly declined after this period.
Screening rates were also low for cardiovascular risk factors such as smoking, high body mass index, hypertension, and dyslipidemia, and were similar to the screening rates in control women.
GDM in women increases the risk for hypertension and ischemic heart disease in addition to type 2 diabetes.
Although the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines recommend annual screening for type 2 diabetes in women diagnosed with GDM, this study found that follow-up screening was poor for type 2 diabetes and other cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension.
Women diagnosed with GDM are an identifiable group of at-risk women and ideal for targeting preventative metabolic and cardiovascular interventions.
Clinical guidelines should include postpartum screening and management for all cardiovascular risk factors in women diagnosed with GDM and not restrict it to diabetes.",2018 Jan 16,"Increased risk of ischemic heart disease, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes in women with previous gestational diabetes mellitus, a target group in general practice for preventive interventions: A population-based cohort study",PLoS Medicine
561,PMC6064622,"Lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) plays an important role in cholesterol esterification in serum. Serum LCAT activity is elevated in patients with serum high triglyceride and low high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) concentrations, both of which are related to metabolic syndrome and subsequent diabetes mellitus, referred to as lipotoxicity. We hypothesized that increased serum LCAT activity could predict future risk of diabetes mellitus in a general Japanese population.
We prospectively studied 1496 individuals aged 20–86 years without histories of diabetes mellitus at baseline. Serum lipid concentrations, glucose parameters, and LCAT activity measured as the serum cholesterol esterification rate, were evaluated.
During 11 years of follow-up, 46 newly diagnosed patients with diabetes mellitus were reported. After adjustment for plasma glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels, the relative risks (RRs) for the development of diabetes mellitus were 5.45 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 2.37–12.55; P <  0.001] for body-mass index, 0.22 (95% CI, 0.09–0.53; P = 0.001) for HDL-C, 4.81 (95% CI, 1.96–11.77; P = 0.001) for triglyceride, and 4.64 (95% CI, 1.89–11.41; P = 0.001) for LCAT activity. After adjustment for HbA1c, total cholesterol, triglyceride, HDL-C, phospholipid, and free fatty acid levels, the RR of LCAT activity for future risk of diabetes mellitus remained significant (RR, 4.93; 95% CI,1.32–18.41; P = 0.018). In this analysis, we found a significant association between LCAT activity and risk of diabetes mellitus in men but not in women.

562,PMC8616213,"Diabetes mellitus is a common disease in patients with cancer. It is a risk factor for certain cancers such as pancreatic, liver, colon, breast, and endometrial cancer. Furthermore, several new cancer treatments or the use of steroids may unmask underlying diabetes or aggravate preexisting diabetes. Evidence suggests that patients with cancer and diabetes have higher cancer-related mortality. Moreover, concurrent complications associated with diabetes in patients with cancer may influence the choice of cancer therapy. This review highlights the relationship between diabetes and cancer and various aspects of the management of diabetes in patients with cancer.
Background: Diabetes mellitus and cancer are commonly coexisting illnesses, and the global incidence and prevalence of both are rising. Cancer patients with diabetes face unique challenges. This review highlights the relationship between diabetes and cancer and various aspects of the management of diabetes in cancer patients. Methods: A literature search using keywords in PubMed was performed. Studies that were published in English prior to July 2021 were assessed and an overview of epidemiology, cancer risk, outcomes, treatment-related hyperglycemia and management of diabetes in cancer patients is provided. Results: Overall, 8–18% of cancer patients have diabetes as a comorbid medical condition. Diabetes is a risk factor for certain solid malignancies, such as pancreatic, liver, colon, breast, and endometrial cancer. Several novel targeted compounds and immunotherapies can cause hyperglycemia. Nevertheless, most patients undergoing cancer therapy can be managed with an appropriate glucose lowering agent without the need for discontinuation of cancer treatment. Evidence suggests that cancer patients with diabetes have higher cancer-related mortality; therefore, a multidisciplinary approach is important in the management of patients with diabetes and cancer for a better outcome. Conclusions: Future studies are required to better understand the underlying mechanism between the risk of cancer and diabetes. Furthermore, high-quality prospective studies evaluating management of diabetes in cancer patients using innovative tools are needed.

564,PMC8036743,"End-stage kidney disease (ESKD) is a main public health problem, the prevalence of which is continuously increasing worldwide. Due to adverse effects of renal replacement therapies, kidney transplantation seems to be the optimal form of therapy with significantly improved survival, quality of life and diminished overall costs compared with dialysis. However, post-transplant patients frequently suffer from post-transplant diabetes mellitus (PTDM) which an important risk factor for cardiovascular and cardiovascular-related deaths after transplantation. The management of post-transplant diabetes resembles that of diabetes in the general population as it is based on strict glycemic control as well as screening and treatment of common complications. Lifestyle interventions accompanied by the tailoring of immunosuppressive regimen may be of key importance to mitigate PTDM-associated complications in kidney transplant patients. More transplant-specific approach can include the exchange of tacrolimus with an alternative immunosuppressant (cyclosporine or mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor), the decrease or cessation of corticosteroid therapy and caution in the prescribing of diuretics since they are independently connected with post-transplant diabetes.

565,PMC6831311,"X-linked nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) is a rare inherited disease, and is characterized by renal resistance to arginine vasopressin (AVP). Its diagnosis can be clinically challenging. The application of molecular genetic analysis can provide a rapid and definitive diagnosis.
A 75-year-old woman presented with recurrent nausea and vomiting was admitted to the Department of Gastroenterology. The patient had a strong family history of polydipsia and polyuria. Sequencing analysis of the antidiuretic hormone arginine vasopressin receptor 2 (AVPR2) revealed the novel missense mutation p. Trp164Cys (c.492G>G/C) in exon 2. There was a heterozygous mutation in the patient's sister and niece, while there was a mutation in her sons, brother and nephews. The locus is located on the X chromosome Xq28, and its mutation can lead to X linked recessive NDI. The p. Trp164Cys mutation of AVPR2 gene has not been reported in literature before. The mutation was predicted to be probably damaging by several prediction methods, including SIFT and PolyPhen-2. There was no significant abnormal variation in other detection regions of the gene. And there was also no abnormal variation in AVP and AQP2 genes in this family.
X-linked NDI was diagnosed according to the patient's family history and DNA sequencing analysis.
After treated with desmopressin, antiemetic drugs and massive infusion glucose transfusion, the patient's urine volume decreased and electrolyte disturbance was corrected, and the symptoms of nausea and vomiting gradually disappeared.
The patients with suspected congenital NDI should undergo genetic sequencing analysis of AVPR2, AVP and AQP2 genes.

567,PMC6941051,"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), a metabolic disease that develops with the increase in insulin resistance during late pregnancy, is currently one of the most common complications affecting pregnancy. The polygenic nature of GDM, together with the interplay between different genetic variants with nutritional and environmental factors has hindered the full understanding of the etiology of this disease. However, an important genetic overlap has been found with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and, as in the case of T2DM, most of the identified loci are associated with β-cell function. Early detection of GDM and adequate interventions to control the maternal glycemia are necessary to avoid the adverse outcomes for both the mother and the offspring. The in utero exposure to the diabetic milieu predispose these children for future diseases, among them T2DM, originating a vicious circle implicated in the increased prevalence of both GDM and T2DM. The involvement of inflammatory processes in the development of GDM highlights the importance of pancreatic β-cell factors able to favor the adaptation processes required during gestation, concomitantly with the protection of the islets from an inflammatory milieu. In this regard, two members of the Pax family of transcription factors, PAX4 and PAX8, together with the chromatin remodeler factor HMG20A, have gained great relevance due to their involvement in β-cell mass adaptation together with their anti-inflammatory properties. Mutations in these factors have been associated with GDM, highlighting these as novel candidates for genetic screening analysis in the identification of women at risk of developing GDM.",2019 Dec 6,Molecular Modelling of Islet β-Cell Adaptation to Inflammation in Pregnancy and Gestational Diabetes Mellitus,International Journal of Molecular Sciences
568,PMC7036249,"Wolfram syndrome is a rare genetic disease characterized by insulin-dependent diabetes, optic nerve atrophy, sensorineural hearing loss and neurodegeneration. Although olfactory dysfunction, a classical clinical marker of neurodegenerative processes, has been reported in Wolfram syndrome, its use as a clinical marker in Wolfram is limited due to data scarcity. In addition, it is unknown whether Wolfram syndrome affects the sense of taste.
Smell and taste perception were assessed in participants with Wolfram syndrome (n = 40) who were 15.1 ± 6.0 years of age (range: 5.1–28.7 years) and two sex- and age-matched control groups: one group with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D; n = 25) and a healthy control group (HC; n = 29). Smell sensitivity was assessed by measuring n-butanol detection thresholds and smell identification by using the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT). Taste function was assessed using NIH Toolbox, which includes the assessment of sucrose (sweet) taste preference, and perceived intensity of sucrose, sodium chloride (salty), and quinine hydrochloride (bitter) both in the tip of the tongue (regional test) and the whole mouth.
Smell sensitivity was not significantly different among groups; however, smell identification was impaired in Wolfram syndrome, as reflected by significantly lower UPSIT scores in Wolfram syndrome compared to HC and T1D (P < 0.001). Compared to participants in the control groups, participants with Wolfram syndrome had a blunted perception of sweetness and saltiness when taste stimuli were applied regionally (P < 0.05), but differences in perceived intensity were no longer significant among groups when taste stimuli were tasted with the whole mouth. Groups preferred similar sucrose concentrations.
Wolfram syndrome was associated with olfactory dysfunction. However, the olfactory dysfunction was qualitative (related to smell identification) and not secondary to olfactory insensitivity or diabetes, suggesting is arising from dysfunction in central olfactory brain regions. In contrast to olfaction, and despite decreased perception of taste intensity in the anterior tongue, the sense of taste was overall well-conserved in individuals with Wolfram syndrome. Future longitudinal studies of taste and smell perception in Wolfram syndrome will be important to determine the use of the chemical senses as clinical markers of disease progression.",2020 Feb 22,Taste and smell function in Wolfram syndrome,Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases
569,PMC4084573,"The treatment of central diabetes insipidus (DI) with desmopressin in the neonatal period is challenging because of the significant risk of hyponatremia with this agent. The fixed anti-diuresis action of desmopressin and the obligate high fluid intake with milk feeds lead to considerable risk of water intoxication and hyponatremia. To reduce this risk, thiazide diuretics, part of the treatment of nephrogenic DI, were used in conjunction with low renal solute feed and were effective in a single case series of neonatal central DI.
 We evaluated the efficacy of early treatment of neonatal central DI with hydrochlorothiazide with low solute feed and investigated the clinical indicators for transition to desmopressin during infancy.
A retrospective chart review was conducted at Princess Margaret Hospital, Perth of neonates diagnosed with central DI and treated with hydrochlorothiazide, between 2007 and 2013. Four newborns were identified. Mean sNa and mean change in sNa with desmopressin and hydrochlorothiazide treatment were recorded along with episodes of hyponatremia and hypernatremia. Length and weight trajectories during the first 12 months were assessed.
The mean change in sNa per day with hydrochlorothiazide and low renal solute feed was 2.5 - 3 mmol/L; on desmopressin treatment, the mean change in sNa was 6.8-7.9 mmol/L. There was one episode of symptomatic hyponatremia with intranasal desmopressin with no episodes of hyponatremia or hypernatremia during treatment with hydrochlorothiazide or following transition to oral desmopressin. Transition to oral desmopressin between 3 to 12 months of age was associated with good control of DI. Following introduction of solids, sNa remained stable but weight gain was slow. This improved following transition to desmopressin in one infant.

However, transition to desmopressin should be considered early in infancy following initiation of solids to facilitate growth.",2014 Jun 20,Efficacy of Hydrochlorothiazide and low renal solute feed in Neonatal Central Diabetes Insipidus with transition to Oral Desmopressin in early infancy,International Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology
570,PMC8293805,"Whether categories of family history of diabetes can act as independent risk factors for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM-1, -2) has not yet been established, and neither has it been established how categories of body mass index (BMI) affect these relationships. A group of 912 women without chronic diseases, recruited in the first trimester, was investigated: 125 (13.7%) women developed GDM-1 (treated with diet); 21 (2.3%) women developed GDM-2 (treated with insulin); and a control group consisted of 766 non-diabetic women. A multiple logistic regression was used to evaluate adjusted odds ratios (AOR (95% confidence intervals)) of GDM-1 and GDM-2 for declared diabetes in the parents or grandparents (separately). These relationships were investigated in the whole cohort and subgroups of pre-pregnancy BMI. (1) Some categories of the family history were independent risk factors of GDM-1 or GDM-2. Compared to ‘absence of diabetes in the family’, women with diabetes in the father had a 3.68-fold increase in GDM-1 risk (AOR-b = 3.68 (2.23–6.07)), and women with diabetes in the mother had a 2.13-fold increase in GDM-1 risk (AOR-b = 2.13 (1.1–4.14)) and a 4.73-fold increase in GDM-2 risk (AOR-b = 4.73 (1.26–17.77)). Women with diabetes in the grandmother had a 2.34-fold increase in GDM-1 risk (AOR-b = 2.34 (1.29–4.24)). (2) The cumulative assessment of diabetes in the parents and/or grandparents was not related to the intensification of the risk of GDM, except for the increased risk of GDM-1 for diabetes in both mother and grandmothers simultaneously (AOR-b = 8.80 (1.16–66.57)), however, this group was very small. (3) The analyses in the subgroups of BMI categories showed that diabetes in the father was also an independent risk factor of GDM in the subgroup of pregnant women with normal BMI. In the subgroups of overweight and/or obesity, the risk of GDM for paternal and maternal diabetes was approximately twice as high as compared to the results of pregnant women with normal BMIs. Additionally, apart from the maternal influence of diabetes, the results suggest a significant influence of diabetes in the father on the risk of GDM, even (interestingly) in lean pregnant women.",2021 Jun 28,"Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) Risk for Declared Family History of Diabetes, in Combination with BMI Categories",International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health
571,PMC7607591,"Patients with the ultra-rare Wolfram syndrome (WFS) develop insulin-dependent diabetes and progressive neurodegeneration. The aim of the study was to quantify microRNAs (miRNAs) in sera from patients with WFS, correlate their expression with neurological imaging over time and compare miRNA levels with those observed in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM).
We quantified miRNA expression (Qiagen, Germany) in two groups of patients: with WFS at study entry (n=14) and after 2 years of follow-up and in 15 glycated hemoglobin-matched (p=0.72) patients with T1DM.
We observed dynamic changes in the expression of multiple miRNAs in patients with WFS parallel to disease progression and in comparison to the T1DM patients group. Among miRNAs that differed between baseline and follow-up WFS samples, the level of 5 increased over time (miR-375, miR-30d-5p, miR-30e-30, miR-145-5p and miR-193a-5p) and was inversely correlated with macular average thickness, while the expression of 2 (let-7g-5p and miR-22-3p) decreased and was directly correlated with neuroimaging indicators of neurodegeneration.

We included full-text English language articles that reported the prevalence of sarcopenia in patients with and without diabetes. Quality assessment was performed according to the Newcastle- Ottawa scale for observational studies.
Sixteen studies were included in the meta-analysis. Three studies showed that high HbA1c levels lead to loss of muscle mass, and one study involving prediabetes showed that people with prediabetes had lower muscle mass, strength, and performance than non-diabetic population. Seven studies showed that people with diabetes had a higher risk of sarcopenia than those without diabetes (combined OR: 2.09, 95% CI:1.62-2.70). The remaining five studies suggested that diabetic complications increased the risk of sarcopenia (combined OR: 2.09,95% CI:1.62-2.70).

573,PMC3281774,"Mitochondrial diseases comprise a diverse set of clinical disorders that affect multiple organ systems with varying severity and age of onset. Due to their clinical and genetic heterogeneity, these diseases are difficult to diagnose. We have developed a targeted exome sequencing approach to improve our ability to properly diagnose mitochondrial diseases and apply it here to an individual patient. Our method targets mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and the exons of 1,600 nuclear genes involved in mitochondrial biology or Mendelian disorders with multi-system phenotypes, thereby allowing for simultaneous evaluation of multiple disease loci.
Targeted exome sequencing was performed on a patient initially suspected to have a mitochondrial disorder. The patient presented with diabetes mellitus, diffuse brain atrophy, autonomic neuropathy, optic nerve atrophy, and a severe amnestic syndrome. Further work-up revealed multiple heteroplasmic mtDNA deletions as well as profound thiamine deficiency without a clear nutritional cause. Targeted exome sequencing revealed a homozygous c.1672C > T (p.R558C) missense mutation in exon 8 of WFS1 that has previously been reported in a patient with Wolfram syndrome.
This case demonstrates how clinical application of next-generation sequencing technology can enhance the diagnosis of patients suspected to have rare genetic disorders. Furthermore, the finding of unexplained thiamine deficiency in a patient with Wolfram syndrome suggests a potential link between WFS1 biology and thiamine metabolism that has implications for the clinical management of Wolfram syndrome patients.",2012 Jan 6,Atypical case of Wolfram syndrome revealed through targeted exome sequencing in a patient with suspected mitochondrial disease,BMC Medical Genetics

This narrative review highlights recent epidemiological studies regarding associations of maternal obesity and diabetes with neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders in offspring, and provides an overview of plausible underlying mechanisms and challenges for future human studies. A comprehensive search strategy selected terms that corresponded to the domains of interest (maternal obesity, different types of diabetes, offspring cognitive functions and neuropsychiatric disorders). The databases searched for articles published between January 2010 and April 2019 were PubMed, Web of Science and CINAHL. Evidence from epidemiological studies strongly suggests that maternal pre-pregnancy obesity is associated with increased risks for autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and cognitive dysfunction with modest effect sizes, and that maternal diabetes is associated with the risk of the former two disorders. The influence of maternal obesity on other psychiatric disorders is less well studied, but there are reports of associations with increased risks for offspring depression, anxiety, schizophrenia and eating disorders, at modest effect sizes. It remains unclear whether these associations are due to intrauterine mechanisms or explained by confounding family-based sociodemographic, lifestyle and genetic factors.

In rare cases, it can involve extrapulmonary organs and lead to endocrine abnormalities such as central diabetes insipidus. A 42-year-old man presented with polyphagia and polydipsia, as well as a dry cough and dyspnea on exertion. Magnetic resonance imaging of the hypothalamic-pituitary system failed to show the posterior pituitary, which is a typical finding in patients with central diabetes insipidus. This condition was confirmed by a water deprivation test, and the patient was also found to have type 2 diabetes mellitus.

579,PMC8775516,"Although it is well known that lifestyle changes can affect plasma glucose levels, there is little formal evidence for the sustained effectiveness of exercise and diet in diabetes mellitus (DM) management. Self-care in DM refers to the real-life application of the knowledge that the patient gained during the education programmes. The goals are to bring about changes in the patient’s behaviour, thus improving glycaemic control. We evaluated the influence of DM self-care activities (SCA) on glycaemic control in a total of 159 patients with DM. Plasma glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels were used to monitor glycaemic control, while SCA were assessed using the standardised Diabetes Self-Management Questionnaire (DSMQ). In our study, 53% of the patients had a HbA1c ≥ 7%. In univariate linear regression models, a statistically significant inverse association was observed between the HbA1c (the dependent variable) and both the DSMQ Dietary Control Score (R2 = 0.037, p = 0.0145) and the DSMQ Sum Score (R2 = 0.06, p = 0.0014). The mean absolute change in the HbA1c% associated with one standard deviation (SD) change in the DSMQ Sum Score, independent of the other significant variables retained in the compacted multivariate regression model, was −0.419% (confidence interval: 95%: from −0.18 to −0.65). Although the impact of the DSMQ Score was modest when compared to the other independent variables in the multivariate model, the findings emphasise the importance of maintaining optimal lifestyle changes to avoid hyperglycaemia and its complications. In conclusion, enhanced self-management of DM is associated with improved glucose control. In patients with chronic diseases such as DM, the role of streamlining SCA encompassing physical activity and proper dietary choices is imperative because of a significantly reduced access to healthcare globally as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.",2022 Jan 17,Correlations between Diabetes Mellitus Self-Care Activities and Glycaemic Control in the Adult Population: A Cross-Sectional Study,Healthcare
580,PMC8247904,"The relationship between COVID-19 and diabetes mellitus is complicated and bidirectional. On the one hand, diabetes mellitus is considered one of the most important risk factors for a severe course of COVID-19. Several factors that are often present in diabetes mellitus are likely to contribute to this risk, such as older age, a proinflammatory and hypercoagulable state, hyperglycemia and underlying comorbidities (hypertension, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease and obesity). On the other hand, a severe COVID-19 infection, and its treatment with steroids, can have a specific negative impact on diabetes itself, leading to worsening of hyperglycemia through increased insulin resistance and reduced β-cell secretory function. Worsening hyperglycemia can, in turn, adversely affect the course of COVID-19. Although more knowledge gradually surfaces as the pandemic progresses, challenges in understanding the interrelationship between COVID-19 and diabetes remain.",2021 Jun 17,COVID-19 and Diabetes: Understanding the Interrelationship and Risks for a Severe Course,Frontiers in Endocrinology
581,PMC5688772,"Earlier we reported that the recombinant soluble (pro) renin receptor sPRR‐His upregulates renal aquoporin‐2 (AQP2) expression, and attenuates polyuria associated with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) induced by vasopressin type 2 receptor (V2R) antagonism. Patients that receive lithium therapy develop polyuria associated NDI that might be secondary to downregulation of renal AQP2. We hypothesized that sPRR‐His attenuates indices of NDI associated with lithium treatment. Eight‐week‐old male C57/BL6 mice consumed chow supplemented with LiCl (40 mmol/kg diets) for 14 days. For the last 7 days mice received either sPRR‐His [30 μg/(kg day), i.v.; sPRR] or vehicle (Veh) via minipump. Control (Con) mice consumed standard chow for 14 days. Compared to Con mice, 14‐d LiCl treatment elevated water intake and urine volume, and decreased urine osmolality, regardless of sPRR‐His or Veh administration. These data indicate that sPRR‐His treatment does not attenuate indices of NDI evoked by lithium. Unexpectedly, epididymal fat mass was lower, adipocyte UCP1 mRNA and protein expression were higher, and multilocular lipid morphology was enhanced, in LiCl‐fed mice treated with sPRR‐His versus vehicle. The beiging of white adipose tissue is a novel metabolic benefit of manipulating the sPRR in the context of lithium‐induced NDI.",2017 Nov 15,The soluble (Pro) renin receptor does not influence lithium‐induced diabetes insipidus but does provoke beiging of white adipose tissue in mice,Physiological Reports
582,PMC7343578,"COVID-19 infection has tremendously impacted our daily clinical practice as well as our social living organization. Virtually all organs and biological systems suffer from this new coronavirus infection, either because the virus targets directly specific tissues or because of indirect effects. Endocrine diseases are not an exception and some of endocrine organs are at risk of direct or indirect lesion by COVID-19. Although there is still no evidence of higher predisposition to contract the infection in patients with diabetes and/or obesity, the coexistence of these conditions contributes to a worse prognosis because both conditions confer an impaired immunologic system. Cytokines storm can be amplified by these two latter conditions thereby leading to multisystemic failure and death. Glycaemic control has been demonstrated to be crucial to avoiding long hospital stays, ICU requirement and also prevention of excessive mortality. Endocrine treatment modifications as a consequence of COVID-19 infection are required in a proactive manner, in order to avoid decompensation and eventual hospital admission. This is the case of diabetes and adrenal insufficiency in which prompt increase of insulin dosage and substitutive adrenal steroids through adoption of the sick day’s rules should be warranted, as well as easy contact with the health care provider through telematic different modalities.

583,PMC3531026,"The integrity of the renal concentrating mechanism is maintained by the anatomical and functional arrangements of the renal transport mechanisms for solute (sodium, potassium, urea, etc) and water and by the function of the regulatory hormone for renal concentration, vasopressin. The discovery of aquaporins (water channels) in the cell membranes of the renal tubular epithelial cells has elucidated the mechanisms of renal actions of vasopressin. Loss of the concentrating mechanism results in uncontrolled polyuria with low urine osmolality and, if the patient is unable to consume (appropriately) large volumes of water, hypernatremia with dire neurological consequences. Loss of concentrating mechanism can be the consequence of defective secretion of vasopressin from the posterior pituitary gland (congenital or acquired central diabetes insipidus) or poor response of the target organ to vasopressin (congenital or nephrogenic diabetes insipidus). The differentiation between the three major states producing polyuria with low urine osmolality (central diabetes insipidus, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and primary polydipsia) is done by a standardized water deprivation test.

We measured the odds ratio (OR) of new-onset diabetes mellitus relative to fasting plasma glucose levels at various ranges in a nation-wide Japanese population with and without CVD history. Of 186,749 participants without diabetes in 2008, 171,408 had no history of CVD, while 15,341 did. Participants were classified into 8 categories according to their fasting plasma glucose levels. Unadjusted and multivariable-adjusted logistic regression models were used to measure the OR of new-onset diabetes mellitus in the 3-year follow up. In all participants, multivariable-adjusted OR increased when fasting plasma glucose levels were <70 mg/dL or 90–125 mg/dL. Participants without CVD showed increased OR when glucose levels were <70 mg/dL or 90–125 mg/dL. Participants with a history of CVD showed increased OR with glucose levels of 95–125 mg/dL.

585,PMC5897355,"Congenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) is characterized by the inability of the kidney to concentrate urine. Congenital NDI is mainly caused by loss-of-function mutations in the vasopressin type 2 receptor (V2R), leading to impaired aquaporin-2 (AQP2) water channel activity. So far, treatment options of congenital NDI either by rescuing mutant V2R with chemical chaperones or by elevating cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels have failed to yield effective therapies. Here we show that inhibition of A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs) binding to PKA increases PKA activity and activates AQP2 channels in cortical collecting duct cells. In vivo, the low molecular weight compound 3,3′-diamino-4,4′-dihydroxydiphenylmethane (FMP-API-1) and its derivatives increase AQP2 activity to the same extent as vasopressin, and increase urine osmolality in the context of V2R inhibition. We therefore suggest that FMP-API-1 may constitute a promising lead compound for the treatment of congenital NDI caused by V2R mutations.
Patients suffering from congenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) fail to concentrate urine due to mutations in vasopressin type 2 receptor (V2R).

586,PMC7359237,"There is limited evidence on whether screening for type 2 diabetes mellitus affects health outcomes. A recent systematic review of randomised clinical trials found only one trial that met their inclusion criteria; therefore, current guidelines for screening interventions for type 2 diabetes mellitus are based on expert opinions and best practice rather than synthesised evidence. This systematic review seeks to collate evidence from non-randomised studies to investigate the effect of screening for adults with type 2 diabetes on outcomes including diabetes-related morbidity, mortality (all-cause and diabetes-related) and harms.
This systematic review will follow Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) guidelines for the synthesis of non-randomised studies. We will search PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, CINAHL, Academic Search Premier and Health Source Nursing Academic (from inception onwards). We will include non-randomised trials, controlled before-after studies, interrupted time-series studies, repeated measures studies and concurrently controlled prospective cohort studies. The primary outcome will be diabetes-related morbidity (microvascular complications of diabetic retinopathy, nephropathy or neuropathy or macrovascular complications of non-fatal myocardial infarction, peripheral arterial disease or non-fatal stroke). The secondary outcomes will be mortality (all-cause and diabetes-related) and harms of screening strategies to patients (including psychological harms or adverse events following treatments) or to health care system (including resource allocation for false-positives or overdiagnosis). Two reviewers will independently screen all citations and full-text articles. Data will be abstracted by one reviewer and checked by a second. The risk of bias of individual studies will be appraised using the ROBINS-I tool. GRADE will be used to determine the quality of the scientific evidence. If feasible, we will conduct random effects meta-analysis where appropriate. If necessary, analyses will be conducted to explore the potential sources of heterogeneity (e.g. age, sex, socio-economic status, rural versus urban or low-middle income versus high-income country). We will disseminate the findings via publications and through relevant networks.
The protocol outlines the methods for systematically reviewing and synthesising evidence of screening strategies for type 2 diabetes mellitus and their effect on health outcomes associated with the disease. The potential impact of this systematic review is improved evidence-informed decision-making for policies and practice for screening of type-2 diabetes.

587,PMC7641838,"There is increasing evidence that the lung is a target organ of diabetes. This study aimed to examine in detail the association between diabetes mellitus and pulmonary function using a national cohort. We also aimed to explore the non-linear association between pulmonary function and blood glucose, insulin resistance, and C-reactive protein (CRP).
A total of 30,442 participants from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from the period between 2007 and 2012 were included. The cross-sectional association between diabetes mellitus and pulmonary function was assessed using multiple linear regression. Where there was evidence of non-linearity, we applied a restricted cubic spline with three knots to explore the non-linear association. Partial mediation analysis was performed to evaluate the underlying mechanism. All analyses were weighted to represent the US population and to account for the intricate survey design.
A total of 8584 people were included in the final study population. We found that diabetes was significantly associated with reduced forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity. We further found L-shaped associations between hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and pulmonary function. There was a negative association between HbA1c and FEV1 in diabetes participants with good glucose control (HbA1c < 7.0%), but not in patients with poor glucose control. A non-linear association was also found with fasting plasma glucose, 2 h-plasma glucose after oral glucose tolerance test, insulin resistance, and CRP. Finally, we found that diabetes duration did not affect pulmonary function, and the deleterious effect of diabetes on pulmonary function was mediated by hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, low-grade chronic inflammation (CRP), and obesity.
Diabetes mellitus is non-linearly associated with pulmonary function. Our finding of a negative association between HbA1c and FEV1 in diabetes patients with good glucose control but not in patients with poor glucose control indicates that a stricter glycemic target should be applied to diabetic patients to improve pulmonary function.

Delayed diagnosis and inadequate management of such cases may lead to worsened neurological outcomes with a high mortality rate.
Here we report the case of a 7-year-old girl who underwent surgical resection of a craniopharyngioma, following which she initially developed central diabetes insipidus. However, later on in the course of her illness she developed symptomatic hyponatremia with natriuresis which was diagnosed to be due to cerebral salt wasting disease. This combination of central diabetes insipidus and cerebral salt wasting syndrome is a rare occurrence and poses a diagnostic challenge. Diagnosis and management can be even more difficult when these conditions precede or coexist with each other.
In such cases development of hyponatremia should always prompt consideration of unusual causes like cerebral salt wasting disease in addition to the classically described syndrome of inappropriate secretion of anti-diuretic hormone.

591,PMC6437257,"The current diabetes management strategies not only aim at controlling glycaemic parameters but also necessitate continuous medical care along with multifactorial risk reduction through a comprehensive management concept. The sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) are a group of evolving antidiabetic agents that have the potential to play a pivotal role in the comprehensive management of patients with diabetes due to their diverse beneficial effects. SGLT2i provide moderate glycaemic control, considerable body weight and blood pressure reduction, and thus have the ability to lower the risk of macrovascular and microvascular complications. Some of the unique characteristics associated with SGLT2i, such as reduction in body weight (more visceral fat mass loss than subcutaneous fat loss), reduction in insulin resistance and improvement in β-cell function, as measured by homeostatic model assessment-β (HOMA-β) could be potentially beneficial and help in overcoming some of the challenges faced by Indian patients with diabetes. In addition, a patient-centric approach with individualised treatment during SGLT2i therapy is inevitable in order to reduce diabetic complications and improve quality of life. Despite their broad benefits profile, the risk of genital tract infections, volume depletion, amputations and diabetic ketoacidosis associated with SGLT2i should be carefully monitored.

593,PMC8504031,"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is glucose intolerance first recognised during pregnancy. Both modalities and thresholds of the GDM diagnostic test, the Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT), have varied widely over time and among countries. Additionally, OGTT limitations include inconsistency, poor patient tolerability, and questionable diagnostic reliability. Many biological parameters have been reported to be modified by GDM and could potentially be used as diagnostic indicators. This study aimed to 1) systematically explore biomarkers reported in the literature as differentiating GDM from healthy pregnancies 2) screen those indicators assessed against OGTT to propose OGTT alternatives.
A systematic review of GDM diagnostic indicators was performed according to PRISMA guidelines (PROSPERO registration CRD42020145499). Inclusion criteria were full-text, comprehensible English-language articles published January 2009-January 2021, where a biomarker (from blood, ultrasound, amniotic fluid, placenta) was compared between GDM and normal glucose tolerance (NGT) women from the second trimester onward to immediately postpartum. GDM diagnostic method had to be clearly specified, and the number of patients per study higher than 30 in total or 15 per group. Results were synthesised by biomarkers.
Of 13,133 studies identified in initial screening, 174 studies (135,801 participants) were included. One hundred and twenty-nine studies described blood analytes, one amniotic fluid analytes, 27 ultrasound features, 17 post-natal features. Among the biomarkers evaluated in exploratory studies, Adiponectin, AFABP, Betatrophin, CRP, Cystatin-C, Delta-Neutrophil Index, GGT, TNF-A were those demonstrating statistically and clinically significant differences in substantial cohorts of patients (> 500). Regarding biomarkers assessed versus OGTT (i.e. potential OGTT alternatives) most promising were Leptin > 48.5 ng/ml, Ficolin3/adiponectin ratio ≥ 1.06, Chemerin/FABP > 0.71, and Ultrasound Gestational Diabetes Score > 4. These all demonstrated sensitivity and specificity > 80% in adequate sample sizes (> / = 100).
Numerous biomarkers may differentiate GDM from normoglycaemic pregnancy. Given the limitations of the OGTT and the lack of a gold standard for GDM diagnosis, advanced phase studies are needed to triangulate the most promising biomarkers. Further studies are also recommended to assess the sensitivity and specificity of promising biomarkers not yet assessed against OGTT.

Our literature search identified 90 patient cases (our case excluded). Most patients were treated with anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 as monotherapy (79%) or in combination with CTLA-4 blockade (15%). On average, diabetes mellitus was diagnosed after 4.5 cycles; earlier for combination ICI at 2.7 cycles.

596,PMC5744627,"Diabetes insipidus is a rare disorder characterized by an impairment in water balance because of the inability to concentrate urine. While central diabetes insipidus is caused by mutations in the AVP, the reason for genetically determined nephrogenic diabetes insipidus can be mutations in AQP2 or AVPR2. After release of AVP from posterior pituitary into blood stream, it binds to AVPR2, which is one of the receptors for AVP and is mainly expressed in principal cells of collecting ducts of kidney. Receptor activation increases cAMP levels in principal cells, resulting in the incorporation of AQP2 into the membrane, finally increasing water reabsorption. This pathway can be altered by mutations in AVPR2 causing nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. In this study, we functionally characterize four mutations (R68W, ΔR67-G69/G107W, V162A and T273M) in AVPR2, which were found in Turkish patients. Upon AVP stimulation, R68W, ΔR67-G69/G107W and T273M showed a significantly reduced maximum in cAMP response compared to wild-type receptor. All mutant receptor proteins were expressed at the protein level; however, R68W, ΔR67-G69/G107W and T273M were partially retained in the cellular interior. Immunofluorescence studies showed that these mutant receptors were trapped in ER and Golgi apparatus. The function of V162A was indistinguishable from the indicating other defects causing disease. The results are important for understanding the influence of mutations on receptor function and cellular trafficking. Therefore, characterization of these mutations provides useful information for further studies addressing treatment of intracellularly trapped receptors with cell-permeable antagonists to restore receptor function in patients with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.",2017 Nov 8,Functional characterization of AVPR2 mutants found in Turkish patients with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus,Endocrine Connections

A total of 998728 people (115655 diabetes and 883073 non-diabetes) without kidney cancer at recruitment were followed from 2003 to 2005. The cumulative incidence of kidney cancer from 2003 to 2005 in diabetic patients and non-diabetic people in all ages and in age <40, 40–64, 65–74 and ≥75 years were calculated in the diabetic patients and the non-diabetic people, respectively. Logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratios comparing diabetic patients to non-diabetic people in the respective age groups. Multivariable-adjusted odds ratios for kidney cancer with regards to diabetes status and diabetes duration (as a continuous variable or categorized into subgroups of non-diabetes, diabetes duration <1 year, 1–2.9 years, 3–4.9 years and ≥5 years) were estimated after multivariable adjustment. The multivariable-adjusted odds ratios for all baseline variables were also estimated for diabetic patients and non-diabetic people, respectively.
The 3-year cumulative incidence of kidney cancer in the diabetic patients and the non-diabetic people was 166.9 and 33.1 per 100,000 person-years, respectively. The incidence increased with regards to increasing age in both the diabetic patients and the non-diabetic people, but a higher risk of kidney cancer for the diabetic patients compared to the non-diabetic people was consistently observed in different age groups. After multivariable adjustment, the odds ratio for diabetic patients versus non-diabetic people was 1.7 (95% confidence interval: 1.3–2.1, P<0.01). While compared to the non-diabetic people, the odds ratio (95% confidence interval) for diabetes duration <1, 1–2.9 years, 3–4.9 years and ≥5 years was 1.5 (0.8–2.7), 1.6 (1.0–2.4), 1.6 (1.1–2.4) and 1.7 (1.3–2.3), respectively (P-trend <0.01). Analyses conducted in the diabetic patients and the non-diabetic people, respectively, consistently showed age, nephropathy and end-stage renal disease as significant risk factors of kidney cancer.

Normal glucose homeostasis is a complex process involving several interacting mechanisms, such as insulin secretion, insulin sensitivity, glucose production, and glucose uptake. The dysregulation of one or more of these mechanisms due to environmental and/or genetic factors, can lead to a defective glucose homeostasis. Hyperglycemia is managed by augmenting insulin secretion and/or interaction with hepatic glucose production, as well as by decreasing dietary caloric intake and raising glucose metabolism through exercise. Although these interventions can delay disease progression and correct blood glucose levels, they are not able to cure the disease or stop its progression entirely. Better management of type 2 diabetes is sorely needed. Advances in genotyping techniques and the availability of large patient cohorts have made it possible to identify common genetic variants associated with type 2 diabetes through genome-wide association studies (GWAS). So far, genetic variants on 19 loci have been identified. Most of these loci contain or lie close to genes that were not previously linked to diabetes and they may thus harbor targets for new drugs. It is also hoped that further genetic studies will pave the way for predictive genetic screening. The newly discovered type 2 diabetes genes can be classified based on their presumed molecular function, and we discuss the relation between these gene classes and current treatments. We go on to consider whether the new genes provide opportunities for developing alternative drug therapies.",2009 Apr,Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: New Genetic Insights will Lead to New Therapeutics,Current Genomics
599,PMC7934035,"A 9-month-old intact female domestic mediumhair cat presented with a 5-month history of obtundation, lethargy, hypernatremia (181 mmol/l; reference interval [RI] 151–158 mmol/l), hyperchloremia (142 mmol/l; RI 117–126 mmol/l), azotemia (blood urea nitrogen 51 mg/dl; RI 18–33 mg/dl), creatinine 3.0 mg/dl (RI 1.1–2.2 mg/dl), hyperphosphatemia (8.3 mg/dl; RI 3.2–6.3 mg/dl) and total hypercalcemia (11.4 mg/dl; RI 9–10.9 mg/dl), with concurrent polyuria with adipsia. Neurologic evaluation revealed proprioceptive deficits, and this finding paired with a history of focal seizure-like activity despite improving sodium concentrations suggested a cerebrothalamic lesion. For this reason, and historical and biochemical findings consistent with adipsic diabetes insipidus (DI), MRI of the brain was performed, which revealed a lesion of the hypophyseal fossa consistent with a pituitary cyst. Given the patient’s age and the timeline of clinical signs, a congenital pituitary cyst was strongly suspected. The patient was managed initially with intravenous fluids to correct the hypernatremia, then managed for more than 4 years with topical ocular desmopressin acetate administration and free water administered through a feeding tube. This cat’s clinical diagnosis included a congenital pituitary cyst with subsequent central DI and primary adipsia.
The clinical presentations of primary adipsia or central DI are both rare in cats. This is the first report to describe these conditions occurring in a cat owing to a congenital pituitary cyst and describes successful long-term management of this condition.",2021 Feb 27,Congenital pituitary cyst resulting in adipsic central diabetes insipidus and secondary hypernatremia in a cat,JFMS Open Reports
600,PMC6679489,"Wolfram syndrome is a rare disorder associated with diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, optic nerve atrophy, hearing and vision loss, and neurodegeneration. Sleep complaints are common but have not been studied with objective measures. Our goal was to assess rates of sleep apnea and objective and self-reported measures of sleep quality, and to determine the relationship of sleep pathology to other clinical variables in Wolfram syndrome patients.
Genetically confirmed Wolfram syndrome patients were evaluated at the 2015 and 2016 Washington University Wolfram Syndrome Research Clinics. Patients wore an actigraphy device and a type III ambulatory sleep study device and completed the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and/or the Pediatric Sleep Questionnaire (PSQ). PSQI and PSQ questionnaire data were compared to a previously collected group of controls. Patients were characterized clinically with the Wolfram Unified Rating Scale (WURS) and a subset underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for brain volume measurements.
Twenty-one patients were evaluated ranging from age 8.9–29.7 years. Five of 17 (29%) adult patients fit the criteria for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA; apnea-hypopnea index [AHI] ≥ 5) and all 4 of 4 (100%) children aged 12 years or younger fit the criteria for obstructive sleep apnea (AHI’s ≥ 1). Higher AHI was related to greater disease severity (higher WURS Physical scores). Higher mixed apnea scores were related to lower brainstem and cerebellar volumes. Patients’ scores on the PSQ were higher than those of controls, indicating greater severity of childhood obstructive sleep-related breathing disorders.
Wolfram syndrome patients had a high rate of OSA. Further study would be needed to assess how these symptoms change over time. Addressing sleep disorders in Wolfram syndrome patients would likely improve their overall health and quality of life.",2019 Aug 2,Sleep disturbances in Wolfram syndrome,Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases

Dermatomyositis (DM), a rare autoimmune condition characterized by inflammatory myopathy and skin rashes, is also known to affect the gastrointestinal, pulmonary, and rarely the cardiac systems and the joints. The association of CDI and DM is extremely rare. After an extensive literature search and to the best of our knowledge this is the first reported case in literature, we report the case of a 36-year-old male with a history of CDI, who presented to the hospital’s endocrine outpatient clinic for evaluation of a 3-week history of progressive facial rash accompanied by weakness and aching of the muscles.

604,PMC7708000,"Data on microvascular complications in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) in Sudan are scarce. This study was aimed at determining the prevalence of diabetic nephropathy (DN) and retinopathy (DR) and their relationship to certain risk factors in children with T1DM attending the Sudan Childhood Diabetes Centre. Design and Methods. A clinic-based cross-sectional study of 100 patients with T1DM aged 10-18 years. Patients with disease duration exceeding 5 years if the onset of diabetes was prepubertal and 2 years if it was postpubertal were included. Relevant sociodemographic, clinical, and biochemical information was obtained. Blood pressure was measured. The patients were screened for DN and DR using urinary microalbumin estimation and fundus photography, respectively. 
 The frequency of microalbuminuria and diabetic retinopathy was 36% and 33%, respectively. Eleven percent had both retinopathy and microalbuminuria. Seven percent of the patients were found to be hypertensive. Patients with diabetic retinopathy had significantly higher HbA1c levels (p = 0.009) and longer diabetes duration (p = 0.02) than patients without retinopathy. Logistic regression showed that high HbA1c (odds ratio (OR) 0.83, confidence interval (CI) 0.68-1.00, p = 0.04), but not age, duration, ethnic group, BMI, blood pressure, and presence of nephropathy, was an independent risk factor for retinopathy. Likewise, high blood pressure (OR 6.89, CI 1.17-40.52, p = 0.03), but not age, duration, ethnic group, BMI, HbA1c, and presence of retinopathy, was a predictor for nephropathy. 
 High prevalence of incipient DN and early stages of DR were observed in this study. Longer diabetes duration and higher HbA1c were associated with the presence of diabetic retinopathy. High blood pressure was a risk factor for DN. So regular screening for these complications and optimization of glycemic control are needed.",2020 Nov 24,Early Diabetic Nephropathy and Retinopathy in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus Attending Sudan Childhood Diabetes Centre,Journal of Diabetes Research
605,PMC8724717,"To optimize type 1 diabetes mellitus self-management, experts recommend a person-centered approach, in which care is tailored to meet people’s needs and preferences. Existing tools for tailoring type 1 diabetes mellitus education and support are limited by narrow focus, lack of strong association with meaningful outcomes like A1c, or having been developed before widespread use of modern diabetes technology. To facilitate comprehensive, effective tailoring for today’s working-aged adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus, we developed and validated the Barriers and Supports Evaluation (BASES).
Participants 25–64 years of age with type 1 diabetes mellitus were recruited from clinics and a population-based registry. Content analysis of semistructured interviews (n=33) yielded a pool of 136 items, further refined to 70 candidate items on a 5-point Likert scale through cognitive interviewing and piloting. To develop and validate the tool, factor analyses were applied to responses to candidate items (n=392). Additional survey data included demographics and the Diabetes-Specific Quality of Life (QOL) Scale-Revised. To evaluate concurrent validity, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) values and QOL scores were regressed on domain scores.
Factor analyses yielded 5 domains encompassing 30 items: Learning Opportunities, Costs and Insurance, Family and Friends, Coping and Behavioral Skills, and Diabetes Provider Interactions. Models exhibited good to adequate fit (Comparative Fit Index >0.88 and Root Mean Squared Error of Approximation <0.06). All domains demonstrated significant associations with HbA1c and QOL in the expected direction, except Family and Friends. Coping and Behavioral Skills had the strongest associations with both HbA1c and QOL.
The BASES is a valid, comprehensive, person-centered tool that can tailor diabetes support and education to individuals’ needs in a modern practice environment, improving effectiveness and uptake of services. Clinicians could use the tool to uncover patient-specific barriers that limit success in achieving HbA1c goals and optimal QOL.",2022 Jan 3,Development and validation of the self-management Barriers and Supports Evaluation for working-aged adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus,BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care
606,PMC5409007,"Despite the established benefits of diabetes camps for the continuing education of children with type 1 diabetes mellitus, little is known about the long-term metabolic benefits of diabetes camps for middle-aged and elderly people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), especially in terms of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) variability.
The 1-year mean and variability of HbA1c before and after the diabetes camp was compared between the participants of the diabetes camp (n=57; median age 65 years [range, 50 to 86 years]; median diabetes duration 14 years [range, 1 to 48 years]). Additional case-control analysis compared the metabolic outcomes of the participants of the diabetes camp and their propensity score-matched controls who underwent conventional diabetes education (n=93).
The levels of HbA1c during the first year after the diabetes camp were comparable to those of the matched controls (P=0.341). In an analysis of all participants of the diabetes camp, the 1-year mean±standard deviation (SD) of HbA1c decreased (P=0.010 and P=0.041) after the diabetes camp, whereas the adjusted SD and coefficient of variance (CV) of HbA1c did not decrease. The adjusted SD and CV significantly decreased after the diabetes camp in participants whose 1-year mean HbA1c was ≥6.5% before the diabetes camp (n=40) and those with a duration of diabetes less than 15 years (n=32).

608,PMC4512224,"The risk of cardiovascular events in humans increases in the presence of type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus, in large part due to exacerbated atherosclerosis. Genetically engineered mouse models have begun to elucidate cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for diabetes-exacerbated atherosclerosis. Research on these mouse models has revealed that diabetes independently accelerates initiation and progression of lesions of atherosclerosis and also impairs the regression of lesions following aggressive lipid lowering. Myeloid cell activation in combination with proatherogenic changes allowing for increased monocyte recruitment into arteries of diabetic mice has emerged as an important mediator of the effects of diabetes on the three stages of atherosclerosis. The effects of diabetes on atherosclerosis appear to be dependent on an interplay between glucose and lipids, as well as other factors, and result in increased recruitment of monocytes into both progressing and regressing lesions of atherosclerosis. Importantly, some of the mechanisms revealed by mouse models are now being studied in human subjects.

609,PMC4004929,"We have identified a novel mutation of the arginine vasopressin receptor 2 (AVPR2) gene in a case of congenital X-linked nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI). The patient was a 2-mo-old Japanese boy with persistent fever and failure to thrive. He was diagnosed as having congenital NDI by clinical and laboratory findings. Molecular analysis demonstrated that he was hemizygous for a G to C transversion in exon 2 of the AVPR2 gene which resulted in a glycine to arginine substitution (G107R) at the 107th codon of the first extracellular loop. His mother was heterozygous for the same mutation. We speculated that the G107R mutation would interfere with the binding capacity of the AVPR2, since G107R is located near F105 and R106, both of which are crucial for ligand binding. In cases of X-linked NDI, mutations in the AVPR2 gene are distributed widely. Thus, DNA analysis throughout the gene is of clinical value for the identification of female carriers, and it also gives precise information for genetic counseling.",2005 Feb 14,A Novel Mutation of the Arginine Vasopressin Receptor 2 Gene in a Patient with Congenital Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus,Clinical Pediatric Endocrinology

612,PMC7973501,"The number of people affected by Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is close to half a billion and is on a sharp rise, representing a major and growing public health burden. Given its mild initial symptoms, T2DM is often diagnosed several years after its onset, leaving half of diabetic individuals undiagnosed. While several classical clinical and genetic biomarkers have been identified, improving early diagnosis by exploring other kinds of omics data remains crucial. In this study, we have combined longitudinal data from two population-based cohorts CoLaus and DESIR (comprising in total 493 incident cases vs. 1360 controls) to identify new or confirm previously implicated metabolomic biomarkers predicting T2DM incidence more than 5 years ahead of clinical diagnosis. Our longitudinal data have shown robust evidence for valine, leucine, carnitine and glutamic acid being predictive of future conversion to T2DM. We confirmed the causality of such association for leucine by 2-sample Mendelian randomisation (MR) based on independent data. Our MR approach further identified new metabolites potentially playing a causal role on T2D, including betaine, lysine and mannose. Interestingly, for valine and leucine a strong reverse causal effect was detected, indicating that the genetic predisposition to T2DM may trigger early changes of these metabolites, which appear well-before any clinical symptoms. In addition, our study revealed a reverse causal effect of metabolites such as glutamic acid and alanine. Collectively, these findings indicate that molecular traits linked to the genetic basis of T2DM may be particularly promising early biomarkers.",2021 Mar 18,Triangulating evidence from longitudinal and Mendelian randomization studies of metabolomic biomarkers for type 2 diabetes,Scientific Reports

Systematic reviews with meta-analyses reporting summary risk estimates for the associations between incidence of type 2 diabetes and dietary behaviours or diet quality indices, food groups, foods, beverages, alcoholic beverages, macronutrients, and micronutrients.
53 publications were included, with 153 adjusted summary hazard ratios on dietary behaviours or diet quality indices (n=12), food groups and foods (n=56), beverages (n=10), alcoholic beverages (n=12), macronutrients (n=32), and micronutrients (n=31), regarding incidence of type 2 diabetes. Methodological quality was high for 75% (n=115) of meta-analyses, moderate for 23% (n=35), and low for 2% (n=3). Quality of evidence was rated high for an inverse association for type 2 diabetes incidence with increased intake of whole grains (for an increment of 30 g/day, adjusted summary hazard ratio 0.87 (95% confidence interval 0.82 to 0.93)) and cereal fibre (for an increment of 10 g/day, 0.75 (0.65 to 0.86)), as well as for moderate intake of total alcohol (for an intake of 12-24 g/day v no consumption, 0.75 (0.67 to 0.83)). Quality of evidence was also high for the association for increased incidence of type 2 diabetes with higher intake of red meat (for an increment of 100 g/day, 1.17 (1.08 to 1.26)), processed meat (for an increment of 50 g/day, 1.37 (1.22 to 1.54)), bacon (per two slices/day, 2.07 (1.40 to 3.05)), and sugar sweetened beverages (for an increase of one serving/day, 1.26 (1.11 to 1.43)).
Overall, the association between dietary factors and type 2 diabetes has been extensively studied, but few of the associations were graded as high quality of evidence. Further factors are likely to be important in type 2 diabetes prevention; thus, more well conducted research, with more detailed assessment of diet, is needed.

Mitochondria are one of the main targets of diabetes at the intracellular level. This review is dedicated to the analysis of recent data regarding the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in the development of diabetes mellitus.

615,PMC7554616,"Neonatal Diabetes (ND) mellitus is a rare genetic disease (1 in 90,000 live births). It is defined by the presence of severe hyperglycaemia associated with insufficient or no circulating insulin, occurring mainly before 6 months of age and rarely between 6 months and 1 year. Such hyperglycaemia requires either transient treatment with insulin in about half of cases, or permanent insulin treatment. The disease is explained by two major groups of mechanism: malformation of the pancreas with altered insulin-secreting cells development/survival or abnormal function of the existing pancreatic β cell. The most frequent genetic causes of neonatal diabetes mellitus with abnormal β cell function are abnormalities of the 6q24 locus and mutations of the ABCC8 or KCNJ11 genes coding for the potassium channel in the pancreatic β cell. Other genes are associated with pancreas malformation or insufficient β cells development or destruction of β cells. Clinically, compared to patients with an ABCC8 or KCNJ11 mutation, patients with a 6q24 abnormality have lower birth weight and height, are younger at diagnosis and remission, and have a higher malformation frequency. Patients with an ABCC8 or KCNJ11 mutation have neurological and neuropsychological disorders in all those tested carefully. Up to 86% of patients who go into remission have recurrent diabetes when they reach puberty, with no difference due to the genetic origin. All these results reinforce the importance of prolonged follow-up by a multidisciplinary pediatric team, and later doctors specializing in adult medicine. 90% of the patients with an ABCC8 or KCNJ11 mutation as well as those with 6q24 anomalies are amenable to a successful switch from insulin injection to oral sulfonylureas.",2020 Sep 30,Neonatal Diabetes Mellitus,Frontiers in Pediatrics

617,PMC8074744,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major cause of mortality in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) patients, and cardiovascular risk (CVR) remains high even in T1DM patients with good metabolic control. The underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood and known risk factors seem to operate differently in T1DM and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients. However, evidence of cardiovascular risk assessment and management in T1DM patients often is extrapolated from studies on T2DM patients or the general population. In this review, we examine the existing literature about the prevalence of clinical and subclinical CVD, as well as current knowledge about potential risk factors involved in the development and progression of atherosclerosis in T1DM patients. We also discuss current approaches to the stratification and therapeutic management of CVR in T1DM patients. Chronic hyperglycemia plays an important role, but it is likely that other potential factors are involved in increased atherosclerosis and CVD in T1DM patients.

618,PMC8421276,"Congenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) is primarily caused by loss-of-function mutations in the vasopressin type 2 receptor (V2R). Renal unresponsiveness to the antidiuretic hormone vasopressin impairs aquaporin-2 (AQP2) water channel activity and water reabsorption from urine, resulting in polyuria. Currently available symptomatic treatments inadequately reduce patients’ excessive amounts of urine excretion, threatening their quality of life. In the past 25 years, vasopressin/cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)/protein kinase A (PKA) has been believed to be the most important signaling pathway for AQP2 activation. Although cAMP production without vasopressin is the reasonable therapeutic strategy for congenital NDI caused by V2R mutations, the efficacy of candidate drugs on AQP2 activation is far less than that of vasopressin.
Intracellular distribution and activity of PKA are largely controlled by its scaffold proteins, A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs). Dissociating the binding of AKAPs and PKA significantly increased PKA activity in the renal collecting ducts and activated AQP2 phosphorylation and trafficking. Remarkably, the AKAPs–PKA disruptor FMP-API-1 increased transcellular water permeability in isolated renal collecting ducts to the same extent as vasopressin. Moreover, derivatives of FMP-API-1 possessed much more high potency. FMP-API-1/27 is the first low-molecular-weight compound to be discovered that can phosphorylate AQP2 more effectively than preexisting drug candidates.
AKAP-PKA disruptors are a promising therapeutic target for congenital NDI.

620,PMC8192255,"The risk of fracture is increased in both type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, in contrast to the former, patients with T2DM usually possess higher bone mineral density. Thus, there is a considerable difference in the pathophysiological basis of poor bone health between the two types of diabetes. Impaired bone strength due to poor bone microarchitecture and low bone turnover along with increased risk of fall are among the major factors behind elevated fracture risk. Moreover, some antidiabetic medications further enhance the fragility of the bone. On the other hand, antiosteoporosis medications can affect the glucose homeostasis in these patients. It is also difficult to predict the fracture risk in these patients because conventional tools such as bone mineral density and Fracture Risk Assessment Tool score assessment can underestimate the risk. Evidence-based recommendations for risk evaluation and management of poor bone health in diabetes are sparse in the literature.

621,PMC8114606,"Prohormone convertase 1/3, encoded by the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 1 gene, is essential for processing prohormones; therefore, its deficiency is characterized by a deficiency of variable levels in all hormone systems. Although a case of postprandial hypoglycemia has been previously reported in the literature, prohormone convertase insufficiency with type 2 diabetes mellitus has not yet been reported. Our case, a 14-year-old girl, was referred due to excess weight gain. She was diagnosed as having type 2 diabetes mellitus based on laboratory test results. Prohormone convertase deficiency was considered due to the history of resistant diarrhea during the infancy period and her rapid weight gain. Proinsulin level was measured as >700 pmol/L(3.60–22) during diagnosis. In genetic analysis, a c.685G> T(p.V229F) homozygous mutation in the PCSK1 gene was detected and this has not been reported in relation to this disorder. In conclusion, patients with recurrent resistant diarrhea during infancy followed by rapid weight gain need to be evaluated with the diagnosis of prohormone convertase deficiency.",2021 Jan 1,A case of prohormone convertase deficiency diagnosed with type 2 diabetes,Turkish Archives of Pediatrics
622,PMC7882189,"To provide an estimate of the effect of interventions on comorbid depressive disorder (MDD) or subthreshold depression in type 1 and type 2 diabetes.
Systematic review and meta‐analysis. We searched PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase, and the Cochrane Library for randomized controlled trials evaluating the outcome of depression treatments in diabetes and comorbid MDD or subthreshold symptoms published before August 2019 compared to care as usual (CAU), placebo, waiting list (WL), or active comparator treatment as in a comparative effectiveness trial (CET). Primary outcomes were depressive symptom severity and glycemic control. Cohen's d is reported.
Forty‐three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were selected, and 32 RCTs comprising 3,543 patients were included in the meta‐analysis. Our meta‐analysis showed that, compared to CAU, placebo or WL, all interventions showed a significant effect on combined outcome 0,485 (95% CI 0.360; 0.609). All interventions showed a significant effect on depression. Pharmacological treatment, group therapy, psychotherapy, and collaborative care had a significant effect on glycemic control. High baseline depression score was associated with a greater reduction in HbA1c and depressive outcome. High baseline HbA1c was associated with a greater reduction in HbA1c.
All treatments are effective for comorbid depression in type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. Over the last decade, new interventions with large effect sizes have been introduced, such as group‐based therapy, online treatment, and exercise. Although all interventions were effective for depression, not all treatments were effective for glycemic control. Effective interventions in comorbid depressive disorder may not be as effective in comorbid subthreshold depression. Baseline depression and HbA1c scores modify the treatment effect. Based on the findings, we provide guidance for treatment depending on patient profile and desired outcome, and discuss possible avenues for further research.
This systematic review and meta‐analysis exploring psychotherapeutic, pharmacologic, and other interventions shows beneficial treatment effects for comorbid depression in type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus with moderate‐to‐large effect sizes for most intervention types. Although all interventions were effective for depression, not all treatments were effective for glycemic control.

624,PMC8409872,"Discontinuation of diabetes care has been studied mostly in patients with prevalent diabetes and not in patients with newly diagnosed diabetes, whose dropout risk is highest. Because enrolling patients in a prospective study will influence adherence, we retrospectively examined whether guideline‐recommended practices, defined as nutritional guidance or ophthalmological examination, can prevent patient discontinuation of diabetes care after its initiation.
We retrospectively identified adults with newly screened diabetes during checkups using a large Japanese administrative claims database (JMDC, Tokyo, Japan) that contains laboratory data and lifestyle questionnaires. We defined discontinuation of physician visits as a follow‐up interval exceeding 6 months. We divided the patients into those who received guideline‐recommended practices (nutritional guidance or ophthalmology consultation) within the same month as the first visit and those who did not. We calculated propensity scores and carried out inverse probability of treatment weighting analyses to compare discontinuation between the two groups.
We identified 6,508 patients with at least one physician consultation for diabetes care within 3 months after their checkup, including 4,574 patients without and 1,934 with guideline‐recommended practices. After inverse probability of treatment weighting, patients with guideline‐recommended practices had a significantly lower proportion of discontinuation than those without (17.2% vs 21.8%; relative risk 0.79, 95% confidence interval 0.69–0.91).
This study is the first to show that after adjustment for both patient and healthcare provider factors, guideline‐recommended practices within the first month of physician consultation for diabetes care can decrease subsequent discontinuation of physician visits in patients with newly diagnosed diabetes.
Nutritional or ophthalmological care is recommended in diabetes guidelines. Newly‐screened diabetes patients receiving such care are less likely to discontinue care.

625,PMC8214347,"This study looked into the prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) and risks for cardiovascular and metabolic diseases among young adults with diabetes (age 20-44 years old, YOD) and late-onset DM (≥45 years old, LOD) in Filipinos.
Weighted data from 546,580 adults with DM from the 8th Philippine National Nutrition and Health Survey (NNHeS) were utilized. Differences in sociodemographic, anthropometric, clinical profiles and metabolic risks were compared between YOD and LOD.
The aggregated prevalence of DM is 5.43% (95%CI, 5.10–5.79), YOD were 2.64% (95% CI, 2.32–3.00) and LOD 9.85% (95%CI, 9.18–10.56). Mean age of YOD was 37,6 years, LOD 59,9 years. The YOD were mostly males (56%), with higher BMI (26.24 kg/m2 vs 25 kg/m2, p=0.002), lower mean SBP (122.41±19.17 mmHg vs 135.45±22.47 mmHg, p<0.001), more daily smokers (23% vs 14%), and alcoholic beverage drinkers (39% vs 31%). Physical activity was similar between groups (44% vs 51%, p=0.078). However, average total caloric intake (1776.78±758.38 kcal vs 1596.88±639.16 kcal, p=0.023) and carbohydrate intake (306.13±142.16 grams vs 270.53±104.74 g, p=0.014) were higher in YOD. Dietary carbohydrate proportions were higher than recommended (69% vs 68%) for both groups. Young Filipinos had higher risk to develop diabetes when they are obese II (22% vs 12%), current drinker (56% vs 37%), and current smoker (28% vs 18%). Eighty percent of YOD and LOD had metabolic syndrome (MetS). With every unit increase in age and fat intake, the odds of having MetS were raised by 5.4% (95%CI 1%–10%, p=0.029) and 1.6% (95%CI 0.04%-3%, p=0.044), respectively.

626,PMC8150415,"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is the most common complication during pregnancy and is associated with an increased risk for the development of cardiometabolic diseases. Behavioral interventions can reduce this risk, but current solutions insufficiently address the requirements for such a program. The systematic development of a scalable mobile health (mHealth) promotion program for mothers during the first years post-GDM may contribute to solving this problem.
The aim of this project was to systematically plan and develop a theory- and evidence-based mHealth intervention to change cardiometabolic risk behaviors in women during the first 5 years post-GDM that meets women’s expected standards of commercial health apps.
The intervention mapping steps 1 to 4 structured the systematic planning and development of the mHealth program described in this paper. Steps 1 and 2 led to a theory- and evidence-based logic model of change for cardiometabolic health. Based on this model, the prevention program was designed (step 3) and produced (step 4) in cooperation with industrial partners to ensure a high technological standard of the resulting smartphone app for the iPhone (Apple Inc). Step 4 included a user study with women during the first 5 years post-GDM once a beta version of the app (“TRIANGLE”) was available. The user study comprised 2 test rounds of 1 week (n=5) and 4 weeks (n=6), respectively. The tests included validated questionnaires on user acceptance, user logs, and think-alouds with semistructured interviews.
The novel TRIANGLE app is among the first self-paced smartphone apps for individual habit change in the 3 lifestyle areas of physical activity, nutrition, and psychosocial well-being. The 3 core features—a challenge system, human coaching, and a library—address 11 behavioral determinants with 39 behavior change methods to support lifestyle changes. Participants in the user study showed a high acceptance, high perceived quality, and high perceived impact of the TRIANGLE app on their health behaviors. Participants tested the app regularly, used it intuitively, and suggested improvements. We then adapted the TRIANGLE app according to the insights from the user study before the full TRIANGLE program production.
The intervention mapping approach was feasible to plan and develop an innovative and scalable smartphone solution for women during the first 5 years post-GDM. The resulting TRIANGLE intervention has the potential to support behavior change for cardiometabolic disease prevention. However, the app needs further refinement and testing in clinical trials. Intervention mapping steps 5 (implementation plan) and 6 (evaluation plan) may support the integration of the TRIANGLE intervention into routine care.

Recent clinical trials of new glucose-lowering treatments have drawn attention to the importance of hospitalization for heart failure as a complication of diabetes mellitus. However, the epidemiology is not well described, particularly for type 1 diabetes mellitus. We examined the incidence and case-fatality of heart failure hospitalizations in the entire population aged ≥30 years resident in Scotland during 2004 to 2013.
Date and type of diabetes mellitus diagnosis were linked to heart failure hospitalizations and deaths using the national Scottish registers. Incidence rates and case-fatality were estimated in regression models (quasi-Poisson and logistic regression respectively). All estimates are adjusted for age, sex, socioeconomic status, and calendar-year.
Over the 10-year period of the study, among 3.25 million people there were 91, 429, 22 959, and 1313 incident heart failure events among those without diabetes mellitus, with type 2, and type 1 diabetes mellitus, respectively. The crude incidence rates of heart failure hospitalization were therefore 2.4, 12.4, and 5.6 per 1000 person-years for these 3 groups. Heart failure hospitalization incidence was higher in people with diabetes mellitus, regardless of type, than in people without. Relative differences were smallest for older men, in whom the difference was nonetheless large (men aged 80, rate ratio 1.78; 95% CI, 1.45–2.19). Rates declined similarly, by 0.2% per calendar-year, in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus and without diabetes mellitus. Rates fell faster, however, in those with type 1 diabetes mellitus (2.2% per calendar-year, rate ratio for type 1/calendar-year interaction 0.978; 95% CI, 0.959–0.998).
Thirty-day case-fatality was similar among people with type 2 diabetes mellitus and without diabetes mellitus, but was higher in type 1 diabetes mellitus for men (odds ratio, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.95–0.96) and women (odds ratio, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.97–0.98). Case-fatality declined over time for all groups (3.3% per calendar-year, odds ratio per calendar-year 0.967; 95% CI, 0.961–0.973).
Despite falling incidence, particularly in type 1 diabetes mellitus, heart failure remains ≈2-fold higher than in people without diabetes mellitus, with higher case-fatality in those with type 1 diabetes mellitus. These findings support the view that heart failure is an under-recognized and important complication in diabetes mellitus, particularly for type 1 disease.",2018 Dec 10,Incidence of Hospitalization for Heart Failure and Case-Fatality Among 3.25 Million People With and Without Diabetes Mellitus,Circulation

630,PMC8371619,"Judicious balance of fluids is needed for optimal management of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Achieving optimal fluid balance is difficult in patients with disorders of fluid homeostasis such as diabetes insipidus (DI). There is little data on the use of Furosemide to aid in balancing fluid and electrolytes in patients with DI. Here, we present a critically ill 11-year-old female with developmental delay, septo-optic dysplasia, central DI, and respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19 ARDS. She required careful titration of a Vasopressin infusion in addition to IV Furosemide for successful management of fluid and electrolyte derangements. On admission, she demonstrated high-volume urine output with mild hypernatremia (serum sodium 156 mmol/L). Despite her maximum Vasopressin infusion rate of 8 mU/kg/hr, by day two of admission, she voided a total of 4 L resulting in severe hypernatremia (serum sodium 171 mmol/L). With continually high Vasopressin infusion rates, her overall fluid balance became increasingly net positive, although her hypernatremia persisted. Her ARDS continued to worsen. After 48 hours of the addition of intermittent Furosemide, successful diuresis along with resolution of hypernatremia was achieved. The combination of IV Furosemide with Vasopressin infusion resulted in tailored diuresis and more controlled titration of serum sodium levels than adjustment in Vasopressin and fluids alone. These results are in contradistinction to the published literature, which focuses on the use of thiazide diuretics in managing DI. This experience highlights the potential for loop diuretics to aid in establishing a desired fluid and electrolyte status in managing patients with both DI and ARDS.",2021 Aug 4,Diabetes Insipidus Complicating Management in a Child with COVID-19 and Multiorgan System Failure: A Novel Use for Furosemide,Case Reports in Critical Care
631,PMC6968576,"Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a rare malignancy most commonly characterized by histiocytic infiltration of bone. LCH lesions in the skull place the adjacent central nervous system (CNS) at risk for involvement, which can manifest as central diabetes insipidus (CDI) when there is infiltration of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. We present a case of a 39-year-old female who presented with polyuria and polydipsia for 1 year and left-sided hearing loss, gait instability, and nystagmus for 5 days. She was found on laboratory evaluation to have CDI and underwent left cortical mastoidectomy for a destructive peripherally enhancing mastoid lesion seen on MRI brain. Pathology revealed CD1a and S100+ LCH and the patient was subsequently discharged to begin outpatient chemotherapy with vinblastine and prednisone. The patient’s CDI was diagnostic of CNS involvement, making her LCH multisystem through the infiltration of both the skull and hypothalamic-pituitary structures. As CDI can be seen in up to 25% of single-system LDH, and up to 50% of multisystem cases, radiologic studies to evaluate for osteolytic skull lesions must be considered as part of the evaluation for LCH when CDI has been diagnosed.",2019 Dec 14,A case of multisystem Langerhans cell histiocytosis presenting as central diabetes insipidus,Journal of Community Hospital Internal Medicine Perspectives
632,PMC8759158,"Symptomatic pituitary metastasis is rare; furthermore, it can result in diabetes insipidus and panhypopituitarism. Since diabetes insipidus is masked by concurrent panhypopituitarism, it can impede the diagnosis of pituitary dysfunction.
A 68-year-old Japanese female suffering from pituitary and thalamic metastases caused by untreated breast cancer, underwent a biopsy targeting the thalamus, not the pituitary. She lacked prebiopsy pituitary dysfunction symptoms; however, these symptoms unexpectedly occurred after biopsy. Diabetes insipidus was masked by corticosteroid insufficiency, and she showed normal urinary output and plasma sodium levels. Upon commencement of glucocorticoid replacement therapy, the symptoms of diabetes insipidus appeared.
In this case, thalamic biopsy, as opposed to pituitary biopsy, was performed to preserve pituitary function. However, pituitary dysfunction could not be avoided. Caution is necessary for asymptomatic patients with pituitary metastases as invasive interventions, such as surgery, may induce pituitary dysfunction. Moreover, with respect to masked diabetes insipidus, there is a need to carefully consider pituitary dysfunction to avoid misdiagnosis and delayed treatment.",2022 Jan 14,Masked diabetes insipidus in pituitary metastasis from breast cancer after thalamic biopsy: a case report,Journal of Medical Case Reports

634,PMC6927016,Central diabetes insipidus (CDI) is an uncommon condition resulting from lack of vasopressin secretion from the posterior pituitary gland typically caused by some form of destruction of the gland. Here we present a case of transient CDI after discontinuation of vasopressin used for septic shock without evidence of overt pituitary damage. Serum sodium concentration peaked at 160 mmol/L in the setting of polyuria within days of vasopressin discontinuation without identified alternative etiologies. Sodium levels and urine output normalized with administration of desmopressin with continued stability after desmopressin was discontinued. This is one of few reported cases of diabetes insipidus occurring after discontinuation of vasopressin and the rapid and profound response to desmopressin in this case proves a central etiology. This case allows for speculation into predisposing risk factors for this phenomenon including preexisting neurological disease.,2019 Dec 11,Transient Central Diabetes Insipidus after Discontinuation of Vasopressin,Case Reports in Endocrinology
635,PMC7966184,"Although transient diabetes insipidus (DI) is the most common complication of pituitary surgery, there is no consensus on its definition. Polyuria is the most overt symptoms of DI, but can also reflect several physiological adaptive mechanisms in the postoperative phase. These may be difficult to distinguish from and might coincide with DI. The difficulty to distinguish DI from other causes of postoperative polyuria might explain the high variation in incidence rates. This limits interpretation of outcomes, in particular complication rates between centers, and may lead to unnecessary treatment. Aim of this review is to determine a pathophysiologically sound and practical definition of DI for uniform outcome evaluations and treatment recommendations.
This study incorporates actual data and the experience of our center and combines this with a review of literature on pathophysiological mechanisms and definitions used in clinical studies reporting of postoperative DI.
The occurrence of excessive thirst and/or hyperosmolality or hypernatremia are the best indicators to discriminate between pathophysiological symptoms and signs of DI and other causes. Urine osmolality distinguishes DI from osmotic diuresis.
To improve reliability and comparability we propose the following definition for postoperative DI: polyuria (urine production > 300 ml/hour for 3 h) accompanied by a urine specific gravity (USG) < 1.005, and at least one of the following symptoms: excessive thirst, serum osmolality > 300 mosmol/kg, or serum sodium > 145 mmol/L.

636,PMC8261591,"The treatment of asymptomatic hydronephrosis due to ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO), as well as the timing and indications for surgical intervention, remain controversial. Diabetes insipidus (DI) is a rare disease in infants that is known to cause non-obstructive hydronephrosis, while its association with obstructive hydronephrosis has not been reported. Some studies have found that increased water intake is a predisposing risk factor of developing hydronephrosis. However, there are no studies or guidelines that indicate the specific follow-up intervals and surgical indications for mild hydronephrosis if predisposing risk factors persist. A 46-month-old boy was admitted to our Urology Department with a history of Society of Fetal Urology (SFU) Grade 2 prenatal left hydronephrosis, which was stable at SFU Grade 1–2 at regular postnatal follow-ups. The patient developed polydipsia and polyuria three months prior to admission, then he was considered as primary polydipsia by endocrinology and was treated with fluid restriction while the examination was negative. Renal ultrasound at follow-up demonstrated severe left hydronephrosis with an anterior-posterior diameter (APD) of 6.25 cm three months after symptom onset. Diuretic renography (DR) revealed a renal function of 13.7% with a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 11.25 mL/min. The patient was otherwise asymptomatic without any abdominal pain or vomiting. He underwent left pyelostomy immediately as well as laparoscopic left dismembered ureteropelvioplasty after three months, and a diagnosis of UPJO was confirmed. The patient had an uncomplicated postoperative recovery and the result of follow-up renal ultrasound was stable. However, the symptoms of polydipsia and polyuria did not improve significantly. He underwent pituitary magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and pathological examination, the results of which were consistent with central DI caused by Langerhans cell hyperplasia four months postoperatively. This case indicates the need to pay attention to children with mild hydronephrosis undergoing regular observation and conservative treatment, as a sudden aggravation of the hydronephrosis and a rapid decline of renal function may occur if DI persists.",2021 Jun,Asymptomatic obstructive hydronephrosis associated with diabetes insipidus: a case report and review,Translational Pediatrics

This study was conducted to validate the factor structure of the Greek version of DEPS-R using Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA), to investigate its reliability and convergent validity in Greek T1DM adults and to compare a single factor DEPS-R model with multiple factor models. Participants were 103 T1DM adults receiving insulin, who responded to DEPS-R. Their anthropometric, biochemical and clinical history data were evaluated. The sample presented good glycemic control and 30.1% scored above the established DEPS-R cut-off score for disturbed eating behavior. CFA results revealed that the data fit well to the factor models. The DEPS-R scale had good reliability and was positively linked to BMI, HbA1c, total daily dose and time in range. Model comparison supported the superiority of the 1-factor model, implying that Greek clinicians and practitioners might not have to consider individualized treatment based on various scores across different subscales but they can adopt a single DEPS-R score for an easy and efficient screening for disordered eating.",2021 Jul 12,The Diabetes Eating Problem Survey-Revised (DEPS-R) in a Greek Adult Population with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus: Model Comparison Supporting a Single Factor Structure,Nutrients

We used real-world data from the System of Xiamen Citizens Health Information from 2014 to 2019 to estimate the changing trends in the prevalence and incidence of diagnosed T2DM. The System included the diagnosis of diabetes and the prescription of hypoglycemic drugs. Prevalent cases of T2DM were individuals who were diagnosed with T2DM and/or using hypoglycemic drugs. Incident cases were individuals with diagnosed T2DM and/or using hypoglycemic drugs in 2014 or 2019 who had not been diagnosed and/or did not use hypoglycemic drugs in the past.

640,PMC8515475,"Improving detection of depression in people with diabetes is recommended. However, little is known about how different health systems compare in depression detection. We estimated and compared the (1) prevalence of depression detection in people with and without diabetes, and (2) association between diabetes and undiagnosed depression across three health systems.
Cross-sectional analysis of three nationally representative studies: The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing, the English Longitudinal Study on Ageing and the Health and Retirement Study.
Community-dwelling adults in Ireland, England and the USA.
Adults aged ≥50 years.
The primary outcome was depression diagnosis. The secondary outcome was any depression. Any depression was defined by the presence of self-reported doctor-diagnosed depression or current depression symptoms on the Centre for Epidemiological Studies-Depression scale. Depression diagnosis was categorised as: undiagnosed, symptomatic and diagnosed, and asymptomatic and diagnosed. We estimated age-standardised prevalence of depression diagnosis by country and diabetes status. Anyone who self-reported having ever received a doctor diagnosis of diabetes was classified as having diabetes. Among respondents with depression, we estimated the association between diabetes and undiagnosed depression by country using multivariable logistic regression.
The prevalence of depression (diagnosed and undiagnosed) was higher in people with diabetes in each country with absolute rates varying by country; undiagnosed prevalence (Ireland: diabetes 10.1% (95% CI 7.5% to 12.8%) vs no diabetes 7.5% (95% CI 6.8% to 8.2%), England: diabetes 19.3% (95% CI 16.5% to 22.2%) vs no diabetes 11.8% (95% CI 11.0% to 12.6%), USA: diabetes 7.4% (95% CI 6.4% to 8.4%) vs no diabetes 6.1% (95% CI 5.7% to 6.6%)). In the fully adjusted model, there was no clear pattern of association between diabetes status and undiagnosed depression; Ireland: OR=0.82 (95% CI 0.5 to 1.3), England: OR=1.47 (95% CI 1.0 to 2.1), USA: OR=0.80 (95% CI 0.7 to 1.0).

641,PMC8375146,"Compared to individuals without type 2 diabetes mellitus, the relative increase in cardiovascular mortality is much higher in women than in men in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
We evaluated data from 7443 individuals (3792 women, 50.9%), aged 20 to 81 years, from two independent population-based investigations, SHIP-0 and MONICA/KORA S3. We analyzed the longitudinal sex-specific associations of lipoprotein(a) with cardiovascular mortality in individuals with and without type 2 diabetes mellitus using Cox regression.
During a median follow-up of 20.5 years (136,802 person-years), 657 participants (404 men and 253 women) died of cardiovascular causes. Among individuals without type 2 diabetes mellitus, men had a significantly higher risk for cardiovascular mortality compared to women in unadjusted model and after adjustment. On the other hand, in participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the risk for cardiovascular mortality was not different between men and women in the unadjusted model and after adjustment for age, body mass index, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, fasting status and study sample (SHIP-0, MONICA/KORA S3). Further adjustment for lipoprotein(a) concentrations had no impact on the hazard ratio (HR) for cardiovascular mortality comparing men versus women in individuals without type 2 diabetes mellitus [HR: 1.94; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.63 to 2.32; p < 0.001]. In individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus, however, further adjustment for lipoprotein(a) led to an increased risk for cardiovascular mortality in men and a decreased risk in women resulting in a statistically significant difference between men and women (HR: 1.53; 95% CI 1.04 to 2.24; p = 0.029).
Women are described to have a stronger relative increase in cardiovascular mortality than men when comparing individuals with and without type 2 diabetes mellitus. Higher lipoprotein(a) concentrations in women with type 2 diabetes mellitus than in men with type 2 diabetes mellitus might partially explain this finding.",2021 Aug 18,Association of sex-specific differences in lipoprotein(a) concentrations with cardiovascular mortality in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus,Cardiovascular Diabetology
642,PMC4696136,"Autosomal dominant inheritance of congenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (CNDI) is rare and usually caused by variations in the AQP2 gene. We have investigated the genetic and molecular background underlying symptoms of diabetes insipidus (DI) in a Swedish family with autosomal dominant inheritance of the condition.
The proband and her father were subjected to water deprivation testing and direct DNA sequencing of the coding regions of the AQP2 and AVP genes. Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells stably expressing AQP2 variant proteins were generated by lentiviral gene delivery. Localization of AQP2 variant proteins in the cells under stimulated and unstimulated conditions was analyzed by means of immunostaining and confocal laser scanning microscopy. Intracellular trafficking of AQP2 variant proteins was studied using transient expression of mutant dynamin2-K44A-GFP protein and AQP2 variant protein phosphorylation levels were assessed by Western blotting analysis.
Clinical and genetic data suggest that the proband and her father suffer from partial nephrogenic DI due to a variation (g.4807C > T) in the AQP2 gene. The variation results in substitution of arginine-254 to tryptophan (p.R254W) in AQP2. Analysis of MDCK cells stably expressing AQP2 variant proteins revealed disabled phosphorylation, impaired trafficking and intracellular accumulation of AQP2-R254W protein. Notably, blocking of the endocytic pathway demonstrated impairment of AQP2-R254W to reach the cell surface.
Partial CNDI in the Swedish family is caused by an AQP2 variation that seems to disable the encoded AQP2-R254W protein to reach the subapical vesicle population as well as impairing its phosphorylation at S256. The AQP2-R254W protein is thus unable to reach the plasma membrane to facilitate AVP mediated urine concentration.

643,PMC8815864,"Increasing global diabetes incidence has profound implications for health systems and for people living with diabetes. Guidelines have established clinical targets but there may be variation in clinical outcomes including HbA1c, based on location and practice size. Investigating this variation may help identify factors amenable to systemic improvement interventions. The aims of this study were to identify centre-specific and patient-specific factors associated with variation in HbA1c levels and to determine how these associations contribute to variation in performance across diabetes centres.
This cross-sectional study analysed data for 5,872 people with type 1 (n = 1,729) or type 2 (n = 4,143) diabetes mellitus collected through the Australian National Diabetes Audit (ANDA). A linear mixed-effects model examined centre-level and patient-level factors associated with variation in HbA1c levels.
Mean age was: 43±17 years (type 1), 64±13 (type 2); median disease duration: 18 years (10,29) (type 1), 12 years (6,20) (type 2); female: 52% (type 1), 45% (type 2). For people with type 1 diabetes, volume of patients was associated with increases in HbA1c (p = 0.019). For people with type 2 diabetes, type of centre was associated with reduction in HbA1c (p <0.001), but location and patient volume were not. Associated patient-level factors associated with increases in HbA1c included past hyperglycaemic emergencies (type 1 and type 2, p<0.001) and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander status (type 2, p<0.001). Being a non-smoker was associated with reductions in HbA1c (type 1 and type 2, p<0.001).
Centre-level and patient-level factors were associated with variation in HbA1c, but patient-level factors had greater impact. Interventions targeting patient-level factors conducted at a centre level including sick-day management, smoking cessation programs and culturally appropriate diabetes education for and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples may be more important for improving glycaemic control than targeting factors related to the Centre itself.",2022 Feb 4,Exploring HbA1c variation between Australian diabetes centres: The impact of centre-level and patient-level factors,PLoS ONE

While neuroendocrine abnormalities associated with congenital toxoplasmosis are uncommon, isolated central diabetes insipidus is extremely rare.
Here, we report on a female infant who presented with fever, convulsions, and polyuria. Examination revealed weight and length below the 3rd centile along with signs of severe dehydration. Fundal examination showed bilateral chorioretinitis. This infant developed hypernatremia together with increased serum osmolality and decreased both urine osmolality and specific gravity consistent with central diabetes insipidus. Serology for toxoplasma specific immunoglobulin M was high for both the mother and the baby and polymerase chain reaction for toxoplasma deoxyribonucleic acid was positive in the infant confirming congenital toxoplasmosis.

646,PMC8410026,"Wolfram syndrome is a rare ER disorder characterized by insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, optic nerve atrophy, and progressive neurodegeneration. Although there is no treatment for Wolfram syndrome, preclinical studies in cell and rodent models suggest that therapeutic strategies targeting ER calcium homeostasis, including dantrolene sodium, may be beneficial.
Based on results from preclinical studies on dantrolene sodium and ongoing longitudinal studies, we assembled what we believe is the first-ever clinical trial in pediatric and adult Wolfram syndrome patients with an open-label phase Ib/IIa trial design. The primary objective was to assess the safety and tolerability of dantrolene sodium in adult and pediatric Wolfram syndrome patients. Secondary objectives were to evaluate the efficacy of dantrolene sodium on residual pancreatic β cell functions, visual acuity, quality-of-life measures related to vision, and neurological functions.
Dantrolene sodium was well tolerated by Wolfram syndrome patients. Overall, β cell functions were not significantly improved, but there was a significant correlation between baseline β cell functions and change in β cell responsiveness (R2, P = 0.004) after 6-month dantrolene therapy. Visual acuity and neurological functions were not improved by 6-month dantrolene sodium. Markers of inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress, such as IFN-γ, IL-1β, TNF-α, and isoprostane, were elevated in subjects.
This study justifies further investigation into using dantrolene sodium and other small molecules targeting the ER for treatment of Wolfram syndrome.

The records of children and adolescents aged 0-18 years who were diagnosed as “diabetes/persistent hyperglycemia” between January 1999 and December 2016, were reviewed. Clinical and laboratory characteristics of the patients at diagnosis and type of diabetes were recorded.
Children and adolescents aged 0-18 years who were diagnosed ""diabetes/persistent hyperglycemia"" between January 1999 and December 2016, were reviewed. Clinical and laboratory characteristics of the patients at the diagnosis and type of diabetes were recorded.The mean ± standard deviation age of 835 patients (48.7% females) at diagnosis was 8.8±4.4 years. Eighty-four percent of the patients were diagnosed as T1D, 5.7% as T2D, 5.3% as clinical MODY and 5% as being cases of other types of diabetes. The frequency of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and severe DKA in T1D were 48.4% and 11.6%, respectively. Fourteen patients (29.2%) with T2D presented with ketosis and two of them (4.2%) had DKA at diagnosis. Antibody positivity was 83.1% in T1D and 14.8% in T2D. A statistically significant increase in the frequency of T2D has clearly been demonstrated in recent years with a frequency of 1.9%, 2.4% and 7.9% in 1999-2004, 2005-2010 and 2011-2016, respectively (p<0.001).

The aim of this study is to present the distribution of plasma copeptin in a large pediatric cohort and to observe the influence of fluid consumption and obesity on its values. A cohort of 128 children and adolescents was divided into two groups on the basis of nocturnal deprivation (group A) or free access to oral fluids in the 6–8 h before blood collection (group B). At all distribution percentiles, copeptin levels were higher (p < 0.0001) in group A, as were plasma sodium levels and osmolality (p = 0.02 and p = 0.008, respectively). The influence of BMI on copeptin levels was investigated by dividing the cohort into nonobese (group C) and obese children and adolescents (group D). Copeptin levels were higher in group D (p = 0.04).
Conclusion: The measurement of copeptin could represent a useful tool for the diagnostic pathway of dysnatremic conditions, but its interpretation should take into consideration the state of hydration.

650,PMC8455689,"Neonatal diabetes mellitus (NDM) is noted as a genetic, heterogeneous, and rare disease in infants. NDM occurs due to a single-gene mutation in neonates. A common source for developing NDM in an infant is the existence of mutations/variants in the KCNJ11 and ABCC8 genes, encoding the subunits of the voltage-dependent potassium channel. Both KCNJ11 and ABCC8 genes are useful in diagnosing monogenic diabetes during infancy. Genetic analysis was previously performed using first-generation sequencing techniques, such as DNA-Sanger sequencing, which uses chain-terminating inhibitors. Sanger sequencing has certain limitations; it can screen a limited region of exons in one gene, but it cannot screen large regions of the human genome. In the last decade, first generation sequencing techniques have been replaced with second-generation sequencing techniques, such as next-generation sequencing (NGS), which sequences nucleic-acids more rapidly and economically than Sanger sequencing. NGS applications are involved in whole exome sequencing (WES), whole genome sequencing (WGS), and targeted gene panels. WES characterizes a substantial breakthrough in human genetics. Genetic testing for custom genes allows the screening of the complete gene, including introns and exons. The aim of this review was to confirm if the 22 genetic variations previously documented to cause NDM by Sanger sequencing could be detected using second generation sequencing techniques. The author has cross-checked global studies performed in NDM using NGS, ES/WES, WGS, and targeted gene panels as second-generation sequencing techniques; WES confirmed the similar variants, which have been previously documented with Sanger sequencing. WES is documented as a powerful tool and WGS as the most comprehensive test for verified the documented variants, as well as novel enhancers. This review recommends for the future studies should be performed with second generation sequencing techniques to identify the verified 22 genetic and novel variants by screening in NDM (PNDM or TNMD) children.

651,PMC8588678,"Elderly patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus are highly vulnerable due to severe complications. However, there is a contradiction in the relationship between social support and quality of life, which warrants further exploration of the internal mechanism. This study assessed the quality of life and its interfering factors in this patient population.
In total, 571 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus over 60 years old were recruited from two community clinics in Heilongjiang Province, China. We collected data on health status, quality of life, self-management behavior, fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level, and social support. Structural equation modeling and the bootstrap method were used to analyze the data.
The average quality of life score was − 29.25 ± 24.41. Poorly scored domains of quality of life were “Psychological feeling” (− 8.67), “Activity” (− 6.36), and “Emotion” (− 6.12). Of the 571 patients, 65.32% had normal FPG, 9.8% had high-risk FPG, 15.94% had good self-management behavior, and 22.07% had poor social support. Significant correlations among social support, self-management behavior, FPG level, and quality of life were noted. A multiple mediator model revealed that social support influenced quality of life in three ways: (1) directly (c′ = 0.6831); (2) indirectly through self-management behavior (a1*b1 = 0.1773); and (3) indirectly through FPG control (a2*b2 = 0.1929). Self-management behavior influenced the quality of life directly and indirectly through FPG control.
Improving self-management behavior and monitoring hypoglycemia should become priority targets for future intervention. Scheduled social support to self-management projects should be put into the standardized management procedure. Physicians should provide substantial and individualized support to the elderly patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus regarding medication, blood glucose monitoring, and physical exercise.

The aim of this study was to investigate the relationships between CGM metrics, such as time in range (TIR), and glycemic control indicators.
We carried out retrospective CGM and blood tests on 189 outpatients with impaired glucose tolerance (n = 22), type 1 diabetes mellitus (n = 67) or type 2 diabetes mellitus (n = 100).
In type 1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus patients, HbA1c and GA were negatively correlated with TIR, whereas 1,5‐AG was positively correlated with TIR. In type 1 diabetes mellitus patients, a TIR of 70% corresponded to HbA1c, GA and 1,5‐AG of 6.9% (95% confidence interval [CI] 6.5–7.2%), 20.3% (95% CI 19.0–21.7%) and 6.0 µg/mL (95% CI 5.1–6.9 µg/mL), respectively. In type 2 diabetes mellitus patients, a TIR of 70% corresponded to HbA1c, GA and 1,5‐AG of 7.1% (95% CI 7.0–7.3%), 19.3% (95% CI 18.7–19.9%) and 10.0 µg/mL (95% CI 9.0–11.0 µg/mL), respectively. TIR values corresponding to HbA1c levels of 7.0% were 56.1% (95% CI 52.3–59.8%) and 74.2% (95% CI 71.3–77.2%) in type 1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus patients, respectively.
The results of this study showed that the estimated HbA1c corresponding to a TIR of 70% was approximately 7.0% for both type 1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus patients, and that the estimated 1,5‐AG calculated from the TIR of 70% might be different between type 1 diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus patients.

The majority of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are overweight/obese, which increases the risk of cardiorenal outcomes in these patients; hence, sustained reductions in body weight and visceral adiposity are important management goals. However, most of the glucose-lowering therapies such as insulin, sulfonylureas, glinides, and thiazolidinediones induce weight gain, which makes the management of overweight/obese T2DM patients challenging. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors are the only oral glucose-lowering agents that have been shown to reduce body weight and visceral adiposity. In addition, SGLT-2 inhibitors therapy reduces ectopic fat deposition and improves adipose tissue function and weight-related quality of life.

A 24 year old previously healthy lady was admitted on third day of fever with thrombocytopenia. Critical phase started on fifth day with evidence of pleural effusion and moderate ascites. Thirty one hours into critical phase she developed headache, altered level of consciousness, limb rigidity and respiratory depression without definite seizures. Non-contrast CT brain done at tertiary care level revealed diffuse intracranial haemorrhages and sub arachnoid haemorrhages in right frontal, parietal, occipital lobes and brainstem, cerebral oedema with an acute subdural hematoma in right temporo- parietal region. Her platelet count was 40,000 at this time with signs of vascular leakage. She was intubated and ventilated with supportive care. Later on she developed features of cranial diabetes insipidus and it responded to intranasal desmopressin therapy. In spite of above measures signs of brainstem herniation developed and she succumbed to the illness on day 8. Dengue was confirmed serologically.

656,PMC7034430,"Diabetes used to be a rare condition among Inuit in Greenland. However, research in recent decades has shown a high prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes. Addressing diabetes in the geographically dispersed population of Greenland presents a challenge to the health care system. In 2008, a new model of diabetes care was introduced in Greenland that included continual monitoring, analysis, and adjustment of initiatives taken. The overall aim of this review was to review the feasibility of the monitoring of an ongoing national diabetes care programme. After ten years of observation it was clear that monitoring of such a programme based on information in electronic medical records in Greenland was feasible. It was found that the majority of the population in Greenland was in contact with the health care system. Increased diagnostic activity resulted in an increased prevalence of diagnosed diabetes. The quality of diabetes care in Greenland and the testing effectiveness of gestational diabetes were improved. Microvascular complications were frequently observed among Greenlandic diabetic patients, except for retinopathy that was as an exception. In summary, this model may improve diabetes care and potentially care for other chronic conditions in Greenland, and may also be helpful in other remote settings where chronic disease care is difficult.

657,PMC8825854,"To evaluate differences in macular and optic disc circulation in patients affected by Wolfram Syndrome (WS) employing optical coherence tomography-angiography (OCTA) imaging. In this retrospective study, 18 eyes from 10 WS patients, 16 eyes of 8 patients affected by type I diabetes and 17 eyes from 17 healthy controls were enrolled. All patients were imaged through OCT and OCTA and vascular parameters, as perfusion density (PD) and vessel length density (VLD) were measured. OCTA showed reduced PD in WS patients at the macular superficial capillary plexus (SCP, 27.8 ± 5.3%), deep vascular complex (DVC, 33.2 ± 1.9%) and optic nerve head (ONH, 21.2 ± 9.1%) compared to both diabetic patients (SCP 33.9 ± 1.9%, P < 0.0001; DVC 33.2 ± 0.7%, P = 1.0; ONH 33.9 ± 1.3, P < 0.0001) and healthy controls (SCP 31.6 ± 2.5, P = 0.002; DVC 34.0 ± 0.7%, P = 0.089; ONH 34.6 ± 0.8%, P < 0.0001). Similarly, VLD was lower in WS patients at the SCP (10.9 ± 2.7%) and ONH levels (7.5 ± 4.1%) compared to diabetic patients (SCP 13.8 ± 1.2%, P = 0.001; DVC 13.8 ± 0.2%, P < 0.0001; ONH 13.0 ± 0.7%, P =  < 0.0001), but higher in DVC (15.7 ± 1.2%, P < 0.0001). Furthermore, VLD was lower in WS patients in all the vascular parameters compared to controls (SCP 13.8 ± 1.5%, P < 0.0001; DVC 17.3 ± 0.6%, P < 0.0001; ONH 15.7 ± 0.5%, P < 0.0001). A significant microvasculature impairment in the macular SCP and ONH microvasculature was demonstrated in eyes affected by WS.

A total of 14 978 adults with hypertension without diabetes mellitus at baseline were included from the CSPPT (China Stroke Primary Prevention Trial). Participants were randomized double‐masked to daily enalapril 10 mg and folic acid 0.8 mg or enalapril 10 mg alone. BP measurements were taken every 3 months after randomization. The primary outcome was incident diabetes mellitus, defined as physician‐diagnosed diabetes mellitus, or use of glucose‐lowering drugs during follow‐up, or fasting glucose ≥126 mg/dL at the exit visit. Over a median of 4.5 years, a significantly higher risk of incident diabetes mellitus was found in participants with time‐averaged on‐treatment SBP 130 to <140 mm Hg (10.3% versus 7.4%; odds ratio [OR], 1.37; 95% CI, 1.15‒1.64), compared with those with SBP 120 to <130 mm Hg. Moreover, the risk of incident diabetes mellitus increased by 24% (OR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.00‒1.53) and the incidence of regression to normal fasting glucose (<100 mg/dL) decreased by 29% (OR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.57‒0.89) in participants with intermediate BP control (SBP/diastolic blood pressure, 130 to <140 and/or 80 to <90 mm Hg), compared with those with a tight BP control of <130/<80 mm Hg. Similar results were found when the time‐averaged BP were calculated using the BP measurements during the first 6‐ or 24‐month treatment period, or in the analysis using propensity scores.

660,PMC5363171,"Wolfram syndrome (WS) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in WFS1 gene. The clinical features include diabetes insipidus, diabetes mellitus (DM), optic atrophy, deafness, and other variable clinical manifestations. In this paper, we present the clinical and genetic characteristics of 3 WS patients from 3 unrelated Turkish families. Clinical characteristics of the patients and the age of onset of symptoms were quite different in each pedigree. The first two cases developed all symptoms of the disease in their first decade of life. The heterozygous father of case 2 was symptomatic with bilateral deafness. The first ocular finding of one patient (patient 3) was bilateral cataract which was accompanying DM as a first feature of the syndrome. In this patient’s family, there were two members with features suggestive of WS. Previously known homozygous mutations, c.460+1G>A in intron 4 and c.1885C>T in exon 8, were identified in these cases. A novel homozygous c.2534T>A mutation was also detected in the exon 8 of WFS1 gene. Because of the rarity and heterogeneity of WS, detection of specific and nonspecific clinical signs including ocular findings and family history in non-autoimmune, insulinopenic diabetes cases should lead to a tentative diagnosis of WS.

Group based DSME is widespread due to being a cheaper method and the added advantages of having patient meet and discuss with each other. assess effects of group-based DSME compared to routine treatment on clinical, lifestyle and psychosocial outcomes in type-2 diabetes patients.
A systematic review with meta-analysis. Computerised bibliographic database were searched up to January 2008 for randomised controlled trials evaluating group-based DSME for adult type-2 diabetics versus routine treatment where the intervention had at least one session and =/>6 months follow-up. At least two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed study quality.
In total 21 studies (26 publications, 2833 participants) were included. Of all the participants 4 out of 10 were male, baseline age was 60 years, BMI 31.6, HbA1c 8.23%, diabetes duration 8 years and 82% used medication. For the main clinical outcomes, HbA1c was significantly reduced at 6 months (0.44% points; P = 0.0006, 13 studies, 1883 participants), 12 months (0.46% points; P = 0.001, 11 studies, 1503 participants) and 2 years (0.87% points; P < 0.00001, 3 studies, 397 participants) and fasting blood glucose levels were also significantly reduced at 12 months (1.26 mmol/l; P < 0.00001, 5 studies, 690 participants) but not at 6 months. For the main lifestyle outcomes, diabetes knowledge was improved significantly at 6 months (SMD 0.83; P = 0.00001, 6 studies, 768 participants), 12 months (SMD 0.85; P < 0.00001, 5 studies, 955 participants) and 2 years (SMD 1.59; P = 0.03, 2 studies, 355 participants) and self-management skills also improved significantly at 6 months (SMD 0.55; P = 0.01, 4 studies, 534 participants). For the main psychosocial outcomes, there were significant improvement for empowerment/self-efficacy (SMD 0.28, P = 0.01, 2 studies, 326 participants) after 6 months. For quality of life no conclusion could be drawn due to high heterogeneity. For the secondary outcomes there were significant improvements in patient satisfaction and body weight at 12 months for the intervention group. There were no differences between the groups in mortality rate, body mass index, blood pressure and lipid profile.

662,PMC7290579,"Sorting nexin 27 (SNX27), a PDZ (Postsynaptic density-95/Discs large/Zonula occludens 1) domain-containing protein, cooperates with a retromer complex, which regulates intracellular trafficking and the abundance of membrane proteins. Since the carboxyl terminus of aquaporin-2 (AQP2c) has a class I PDZ-interacting motif (X-T/S-X-Φ), the role of SNX27 in the regulation of AQP2 was studied. Co-immunoprecipitation assay of the rat kidney demonstrated an interaction of SNX27 with AQP2. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down assays revealed an interaction of the PDZ domain of SNX27 with AQP2c. Immunocytochemistry of HeLa cells co-transfected with FLAG-SNX27 and hemagglutinin (HA)-AQP2 also revealed co-localization throughout the cytoplasm. When the PDZ domain was deleted, punctate HA-AQP2 labeling was localized in the perinuclear region. The labeling was intensively overlaid by Lysotracker staining but not by GM130 labeling, a cis-Golgi marker. In rat kidneys and primary cultured inner medullary collecting duct cells, the subcellular redistribution of SNX27 was similar to AQP2 under 1-deamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin (dDAVP) stimulation/withdrawal. Cell surface biotinylation assay showed that dDAVP-induced AQP2 translocation to the apical plasma membrane was unaffected after SNX27 knockdown in mpkCCD cells. In contrast, the dDAVP-induced AQP2 protein abundance was significantly attenuated without changes in AQP2 mRNA expression. Moreover, the AQP2 protein abundance was markedly declined during the dDAVP withdrawal period after stimulation under SNX27 knockdown, which was inhibited by lysosome inhibitors. Autophagy was induced after SNX27 knockdown in mpkCCD cells. Lithium-induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus in rats revealed a significant downregulation of SNX27 in the kidney inner medulla. Taken together, the PDZ domain-containing SNX27 interacts with AQP2 and depletion of SNX27 contributes to the autophagy-lysosomal degradation of AQP2.",2020 May 13,Sorting Nexin 27 Regulates the Lysosomal Degradation of Aquaporin-2 Protein in the Kidney Collecting Duct,Cells
663,PMC4733793,"To evaluate the utility of zinc transporter-8 (ZnT8) in the improvement of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) diagnosis and prediction, and to explore whether ZnT8 is a potential therapeutic target in T1DM.
A search was conducted within the medical database PubMed for relevant articles published from 2001 to 2015. The search terms are as follows: “ZnT8,” “type 1 diabetes,” “latent autoimmune diabetes in adults,” “type 2 diabetes,” “islet autoantibodies,” “zinc supplement,” “T cells,” “β cell,” “immune therapy.” We also searched the reference lists of selected articles.
English-language original articles and critical reviews concerning ZnT8 and the clinical applications of islet autoantibodies in diabetes were reviewed.
The basic function of ZnT8 is maintaining intracellular zinc homeostasis, which modulates the process of insulin biosynthesis, storage, and secretion. Autoantibodies against ZnT8 (ZnT8A) and ZnT8-specific T cells are the reliable biomarkers for the identification, stratification, and characterization of T1DM. Additionally, the results from the animal models and clinical trials have shown that ZnT8 is a diabetogenic antigen, suggesting the possibility of ZnT8-specific immunotherapy as an alternative for T1DM therapy.
ZnT8 is a novel islet autoantigen with a widely potential for clinical applications in T1DM. However, before the large-scale clinical applications, there are still many problems to be solved.",2015 Sep 5,Current and Future Clinical Applications of Zinc Transporter-8 in Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus,Chinese Medical Journal
664,PMC6929418,"The use of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy is becoming a standard of care for several cancers. Monoclonal antibodies targeting cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) and programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) or its ligand (PD-L1) cause a broad spectrum of autoimmune adverse events. ICI-induced type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is extremely rare (< 1%) but potentially life-threatening. It appears to be more common with PD-1 blockade (or combination immunotherapy) than with anti-CTLA-4 therapy, often during the first three to six months of therapy.
We report an acute onset T1DM with severe inaugural diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and remarkably elevated Glutamic Acid Decarboxylase antibody (GADA) titres following a single administration of combined ICI therapy with nivolumab (anti-PD-1) and ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4) in two adult patients with advanced metastatic melanoma. In these cases, the time to diabetes onset was remarkably short (two and five weeks), and one presented with fulminous T1DM in a previous long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Oncological patients treated with combination therapy of anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 can develop a particular pattern of T1DM, with very rapid onset within a few weeks after starting ICI therapy, even in the presence of an existing type 2 diabetes.

665,PMC8601459,"Diabetes mellitus affects almost 10% of U.S. adults, leading to human and financial burden. Underserved populations experience a higher risk of diabetes and related complications resulting from a combination of limited disposable income, inadequate diet, and lack of insurance coverage. Without the requisite resources, underserved populations lack the ability to access healthcare and afford prescription drugs to manage their condition. The aim of this systematic review is to synthesize the findings from cost-effectiveness studies of diabetes management in underserved populations.
Original, English, peer-reviewed cost-effectiveness studies of diabetes management in U.S. underserved populations were obtained from 8 databases, and PRISMA 2009 reporting guidelines were followed. Evidence was categorized as strong or weak based on a combination of GRADE and American Diabetes Association guidelines. Internal validity was assessed by the Cochrane methodology. Studies were classified by incremental cost-effectiveness ratio as very cost-effective (ICER≤US$25,000), cost-effective (US$25,000<ICER≤US$50,000), marginally cost-effective (US$50,000<ICER≤US$100,000) or cost-ineffective (ICER>US$100,000). Reporting and quality of economic evaluations was assessed using the CHEERS guidelines and Recommendations of Second Panel for Cost-Effectiveness in Health and Medicine, respectively.
Fourteen studies were included. All interventions were found to be cost-effective or very cost-effective. None of the studies reported all 24 points of the CHEERS guidelines. Given the considered cost categories vary significantly between studies, assessing cost-effectiveness across studies has many limitations. Program costs were consistently analyzed, and a third of the included studies (n = 5) only examined these costs, without considering other costs of diabetes care.
Cost-effectiveness studies are not based on a standardized methodology and present incomplete or limited analyses. More accurate assessment of all direct and indirect costs could widen the gap between intervention and usual care. This demonstrates the urgent need for a more standardized and comprehensive cost-effectiveness framework for future studies.",2021 Nov 18,Comprehensive cost-effectiveness of diabetes management for the underserved in the United States: A systematic review,PLoS ONE
666,PMC8040084,"During the last two decades, there have been several reports of an increasing incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in children and adolescents, especially among those belonging to minority ethnic groups. This trend, which parallels the increases in prevalence and degree of pediatric obesity, has caused great concern, even though T2DM remains a relatively rare disease in children. Youth T2DM differs not only from type 1 diabetes in children, from which it is sometimes difficult to differentiate, but also from T2DM in adults, since it appears to be an aggressive disease with rapidly progressive β-cell decline, high treatment failure rate, and accelerated development of complications. Despite the recent research, many aspects of youth T2DM still remain unknown, regarding both its pathophysiology and risk factor contribution, and its optimal management and prevention. Current management approaches include lifestyle changes, such as improved diet and increased physical activity, together with pharmacological interventions, including metformin, insulin, and the recently approved glucagon-like peptide-1 analog liraglutide. What is more important for everyone to realize though, from patients, families and physicians to schools, health services and policy-makers alike, is that T2DM is a largely preventable disease that will be addressed effectively only if its major contributor (i.e., pediatric obesity) is confronted and prevented at every possible stage of life, from conception until adulthood. Therefore, relevant comprehensive, coordinated, and innovative strategies are urgently needed.",2021 Apr 15,"Diagnosis, treatment and prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus in children and adolescents",World Journal of Diabetes
667,PMC2734842,"Wolfram Syndrome (WS) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterised by non-autoimmune diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy, cranial diabetes insipidus and sensorineural deafness. Some reports have described hypogonadism in male WS patients. The aim of our study was to find out whether Wfs1 deficient (Wfs1KO) male mice have reduced fertility and, if so, to examine possible causes.
Wfs1KO mice were generated by homologous recombination. Both Wfs1KO and wild type (wt) male mice were mated with wt female mice. The number of litters and the number of pups were counted and pregnancy rates calculated. The motility and morphology of the sperm and the histology of testes were analysed. Serum testosterone and FSH concentrations were also measured.
The pregnancy rate in wt females mated with Wfs1KO males was significantly lower than in the control group (15% vs. 32%; p < 0.05), but there was no significant difference in litter size. Analysis of male fertility showed that, in the Wfs1KO group, eight males out of 13 had pups whereas in the control group all 13 males had at least one litter. Sperm motility was not affected in Wfs1KO mice, but Wfs1KO males had less proximal bent tails (14.4 +/- 1.2% vs. 21.5 +/- 1.3 p < 0.05) and less abnormal sperm heads (22.8 +/- 1.8 vs. 31.5 +/- 3.5, p < 0.05) than wt males. Testes histology revealed significantly reduced number of spermatogonia (23.9 +/- 4.9 vs. 38.1 +/- 2.8; p < 0.05) and Sertoli cells (6.4 +/- 0.5 vs. 9.2 +/- 1.0; p < 0.05) in Wfs1KO mice. Serum testosterone and FSH concentrations did not differ between the two groups.
The impaired fertility of Wfs1KO male mice is most likely due to changes in sperm morphology and reduced number of spermatogenic cells. The exact mechanism through which the Wfs1 gene influences sperm morphology needs to be clarified in further studies.",2009 Aug 10,Male mice with deleted Wolframin (Wfs1) gene have reduced fertility,Reproductive Biology and Endocrinology : RB&E

Improper management of water and electrolyte imbalance is common cause of morbidity and mortality. Data is sparse and controversial regarding the choice of fluid therapy in this population during perioperative period.
In this retrospective-prospective study involving 73 patients (58 retrospective), the type of fluid therapy was correlated with occurrence of hypernatremia, hyponatremia, DI, morbidity, and mortality. In the retrospective study, 48 patients received normal saline and 10 received mixed fluids as per the prevailing practice. In the prospective group, five patients each received normal saline, half normal saline, and 5% dextrose randomly.
The sodium values were significantly higher in first 48 h in the group that received normal saline compared with other groups (P < 0.001). The use of normal saline was associated with higher incidence of hypernatremia, DI, and mortality (P = 0.05), while the group that received 5% dextrose was associated with hyponatremia, hypoglycemia, and seizures.

670,PMC6042323,"Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21OHD) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the CYP21A2. Congenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) is a rare X-linked recessive or autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in either AVPR2 or AQP2. Genotype-phenotype discordance caused by genetic mosaicism in CAH patients has not been reported, nor the concomitant CAH and NDI.
We investigated a patient with concomitant CAH and NDI from a consanguineous family. She (S-1) presented with clitoromegaly at 3 month of age, and polydipsia and polyuria at 13 month of age. Her parents and two elder sisters (S-2 and S-3) were clinically normal, but elevated levels of serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) were observed in the mother and S-2. The coding region of CYP21A2 and AQP2 were analyzed by PCR-sequencing analysis to identify genetic defects. Two homozygous CYP21A2 mutations (p.R357W and p.P454S) were identified in the proband and her mother and S-2. The apparent genotype-phenotype discordance was due to presence of small amount of wild-type CYP21A2 alleles in S-1, S-2, and their mother’s genome, thus protecting them from development of classic form of 21OHD (C21OHD). A homozygous AQP2 mutation (p.A147T) was also found in the patient. The patient was treated with hydrocortisone and hydrochlorothiazide. Her symptoms were improved with normal laboratory findings. The clitoromegaly is persisted.
Genetic mosaicism is a novel mechanism contributing to the genotype-phenotype discordance in 21OHD and small percentage of wild-type CYP21A2 alleles may be sufficient to prevent phenotype development. This is a first report of concurrent 21OHD and NDI caused by simultaneous homozygous CYP21A2 and AQP2 mutations.",2018 Jul 11,Phenotype heterogeneity of congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to genetic mosaicism and concomitant nephrogenic diabetes insipidus in a sibling,BMC Medical Genetics
671,PMC7349356,"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), one of the major pregnancy-related complications, characterized as a transitory form of diabetes induced by insulin resistance accompanied by a low/absent pancreatic beta-cell compensatory adaptation to the increased insulin demand, causes the acute, long-term, and transgenerational health complications. The aim of the study was to assess if alterations in gene expression of microRNAs associated with diabetes/cardiovascular/cerebrovascular diseases are present in whole peripheral blood of children aged 3–11 years descending from GDM complicated pregnancies. A substantially altered microRNA expression profile was found in children descending from GDM complicated pregnancies. Almost all microRNAs with the exception of miR-92a-3p, miR-155-5p, and miR-210-3p were upregulated. The microRNA expression profile also differed between children after normal and GDM complicated pregnancies in relation to the presence of overweight/obesity, prehypertension/hypertension, and/or valve problems and heart defects. Always, screening based on the combination of microRNAs was superior over using individual microRNAs, since at 10.0% false positive rate it was able to identify a large proportion of children with an aberrant microRNA expression profile (88.14% regardless of clinical findings, 75.41% with normal clinical findings, and 96.49% with abnormal clinical findings). In addition, the higher incidence of valve problems and heart defects was found in children with a prior exposure to GDM. The extensive file of predicted targets of all microRNAs aberrantly expressed in children descending from GDM complicated pregnancies indicates that a large group of these genes is involved in ontologies of diabetes/cardiovascular/cerebrovascular diseases. In general, children with a prior exposure to GDM are at higher risk of later development of diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular/cerebrovascular diseases, and would benefit from dispensarisation as well as implementation of primary prevention strategies.",2020 Jun 26,Substantially Altered Expression Profile of Diabetes/Cardiovascular/Cerebrovascular Disease Associated microRNAs in Children Descending from Pregnancy Complicated by Gestational Diabetes Mellitus—One of Several Possible Reasons for an Increased Cardiovascular Risk,Cells

673,PMC8059287,"Wolfram syndrome (WS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by diabetes insipidus, diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy and deafness. Mutations in Wolfram syndrome 1 (WFS1) gene may cause dysregulated endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-stress and cell apoptosis, contributing to WS symptoms. The aim of this study was to identify the molecular etiology of a case of WS and to explore the functional consequence of the mutant WFS1 gene in vitro.
A 27 years-old Chinese man was diagnosed as wolfram syndrome type 1 based on clinical data and laboratory data. DNA sequencing of WFS1 gene and mitochondrial m.3337G > A, m.3243A > G mutations were performed in the patient and his 4 family members. Functional analysis was performed to assessed the in vitro effect of the newly identified mutant. ER stress were evaluated by ER stress response element (ERSE)-luciferase assay. Cell apoptosis were performed by CCK-8, TUNEL staining and flow cytometric analysis.
A novel heterozygous 10-base deletion (c. 2067_2076 del10, p.W690fsX706) was identified in the patient. In vitro studies showed that mutant p.W690fsX706 increased ERSE reporter activity in the presence or absence of thapsigargin instead of wild type WFS1. Knockdown of WFS1 activated the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway and increased the cell apoptosis, which could not be restored by transfection with WFS1 mutant (p.W690fsX706) comparable to the wild type WFS1.
A novel heterozygous mutation of WFS1 detected in the patient resulted in loss-of-function of wolframin, thereby inducing dysregulated ER stress signaling and cell apoptosis. These findings increase the spectrum of WFS1 gene mutations and broaden our insights into the roles of mutant WFS1 in the pathogenesis of WS.

This cross-sectional analysis examined the 16 097 evacuees (1820 (11.3%) with and 14 277 (88.7%) without diabetes mellitus) included in the Fukushima Health Management Survey. Non-specific mental health distress was assessed using the Kessler-6 Scale, and traumatic symptoms were evaluated using the PTSD Checklist.

In the age-adjusted and sex-adjusted logistic models, suboptimal diabetic control (hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) ≥7%) was associated with both psychological distress and possible PTSD. In the same models, current smoking, evacuation, and sleep dissatisfaction were associated with psychological distress and possible PTSD. In the multivariate-adjusted logistic models, HbA1c ≥7% was associated with psychological distress, independent of job change, evacuation, or sleep dissatisfaction.

675,PMC5497032,"The present meta‐analysis aimed to clarify the association of unstable bodyweight with the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus, an association that has been controversial among longitudinal studies.
An electronic literature search using EMBASE and MEDLINE was followed up to 31 August 2016. The relative risks (RRs) of type 2 diabetes mellitus in individuals with unstable bodyweight were pooled using the inverse variance method.
Eight studies were eligible for the meta‐analysis. The median duration of measurements of weight change and follow‐up years for ascertaining type 2 diabetes mellitus were 13.5 and 9.4 years, respectively. The pooled RR for the least vs most stable category was 1.33 (95% confidence interval 1.12–1.57). Between‐study heterogeneity was statistically significant (P = 0.048). Whether type 2 diabetes mellitus was ascertained by blood testing explained 66.0% of the variance in the logarithm of RR (P = 0.02). In three studies in which blood testing was carried out, type 2 diabetes mellitus risk was not significant (RR 1.06, 95% confidence interval 0.91–1.25). Furthermore, publication bias that inflated type 2 diabetes mellitus risk was statistically detected by Egger's test (P = 0.09).
Unstable bodyweight might be modestly associated with the elevated risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus; although serious biases, such as diagnostic suspicion bias and publication bias, made it difficult to assess this association.",2017 Apr 26,Unstable bodyweight and incident type 2 diabetes mellitus: A meta‐analysis,Journal of Diabetes Investigation
676,PMC3987262,"Diabetes Mellitus is a common metabolic disorder presenting increased amounts of serum glucose and will cover 5.4% of population by year 2025. Accordingly, this review was performed to gather and discuss the stand points on diagnosis, pathophysiology, non-pharmacological therapy and drug management of diabetes this disorder as described in medieval Persian medicine. To this, reports on diabetes were collected and analyzed from selected medical and pharmaceutical textbooks of Traditional Persian Medicine. A search on databases as Pubmed, Sciencedirect, Scopus and Google scholar was also performed to reconfirm the Anti diabetic activities of reported herbs. The term, Ziabites, was used to describe what is now spoken as diabetes. It was reported that Ziabites, is highly associated with kidney function. Etiologically, Ziabites was characterized as kidney hot or cold dystemperament as well as diffusion of fluid from other organs such as liver and intestines into the kidneys. This disorder was categorized into main types as hot (Ziabites-e-har) and cold (Ziabites-e-barid) as well as sweet urine (Bole-e-shirin). Most medieval cite signs of Ziabites were remarked as unusual and excessive thirst, frequent urination and polydipsia. On the management, life style modification and observing the essential rules of prevention in Persian medicine as well as herbal therapy and special simple manipulations were recommended. Current investigation was done to clarify the knowledge of medieval scientists on diabetes and related interventions.

677,PMC4887828,"Metastases to the pituitary gland are rare; cancers that most commonly metastasize to the pituitary are breast and lung cancers. No specific computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging features reliably distinguish primary pituitary masses from metastases. A combination of a detailed clinical assessment together with specialist endocrine and neuroradiology support is essential to make the rare diagnosis of a pituitary metastasis. We present the case of a man with metastatic lung cancer, initially presenting as hypopituitarism. Subtle features in the history, together with neuroimaging findings atypical for pituitary adenomas, provided clues that the diagnosis was one of the pituitary metastases. Treatment of diabetes insipidus (DI) with replacement antidiuretic hormone (ADH) was complicated by extreme difficulties in achieving a satisfactory sodium and water balance. This was the result of coexistent DI and syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion perpetuated by the patient's primary lung cancer, a phenomenon not previously described in the literature.",2016 Jun 1,Competing interests in a lung cancer with metastasis to the pituitary gland: syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion versus diabetes insipidus,Oxford Medical Case Reports
678,PMC3354836,"The human eye, as an organ, can offer critical clues to the diagnosis of various systemic illnesses. Ocular changes are common in various endocrine disorders such as diabetes mellitus and Graves’ disease. However there exist a large number of lesser known endocrine disorders where ocular involvement is significant. Awareness of these associations is the first step in the diagnosis and management of these complex patients. The rare syndromes involving the pituitary hypothalamic axis with significant ocular involvement include Septo-optic dysplasia, Kallman's syndrome, and Empty Sella syndrome all affecting the optic nerve at the optic chiasa. The syndromes involving the thyroid and parathyroid glands that have ocular manifestations and are rare include Mc Cune Albright syndrome wherein optic nerve decompression may occur due to fibrous dysplasia, primary hyperparathyroidism that may present as red eye due to scleritis and Ascher syndrome wherein ptosis occurs. Allgrove's syndrome, Cushing's disease, and Addison's disease are the rare endocrine syndromes discussed involving the adrenals and eye. Ocular involvement is also seen in gonadal syndromes such as Bardet Biedl, Turner's, Rothmund's, and Klinefelter's syndrome. This review also highlights the ocular manifestation of miscellaneous syndromes such as Werner's, Cockayne's, Wolfram's, Kearns Sayre's, and Autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome.

679,PMC8197243,"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is the fastest growing type of diabetes, affecting between 2 to 38% of pregnancies worldwide, varying considerably depending on diagnostic criteria used and sample population studied. Adverse obstetric outcomes include an increased risk of macrosomia, and higher rates of stillbirth, instrumental delivery, and birth trauma. Metabolomics, which is a platform used to analyse and characterise a large number of metabolites, is increasingly used to explore the pathophysiology of cardiometabolic conditions such as GDM. This review aims to summarise metabolomics studies in GDM (from inception to January 2021) in order to highlight prospective biomarkers for diagnosis, and to better understand the dysfunctional metabolic pathways underlying the condition. We found that the most commonly deranged pathways in GDM include amino acids (glutathione, alanine, valine, and serine), carbohydrates (2-hydroxybutyrate and 1,5-anhydroglucitol), and lipids (phosphatidylcholines and lysophosphatidylcholines). We also highlight the possibility of using certain metabolites as predictive markers for developing GDM, with the use of highly stratified modelling techniques.

680,PMC6384538,"The diabetes disease burden in China is heavy, and mobile apps have a great potential for diabetes management. However, there is a lack of investigation of diabetes app use among Chinese diabetes patients and diabetologists. The perspectives and attitudes of diabetes patients and diabetologists regarding diabetes apps are also unclear.
Our objectives were to investigate diabetes patients’ and diabetologists’ use, attitudes, and perspectives, as well as patients’ needs, with respect to diabetes apps to provide information regarding the optimal design of diabetes apps and the best strategies to promote their use.
Diabetes patients and diabetologists across China were surveyed on the WeChat (Tencent Corp) network using Sojump (Changsha ran Xing InfoTech Ltd) from January 23, 2018, to July 30, 2018. In total, 2 survey links were initially sent to doctors from 46 Latent Autoimmune Diabetes of Adults Study collaborative hospitals in China in 25 major cities and were spread on their WeChat contacts network. We also published the patient survey link on 3 WeChat public accounts and requested diabetes patients to fill out questionnaires. A multivariate regression analysis was used to identify associations of demographic and basic disease information with app usage among adult patients.
Overall, 1276 individuals from 30 provincial regions responded to the patient survey; among them, the overall app awareness rate was 29.94% (382/1276) and usage was 15.44% (197/1276). The usage was higher among patients with type 1 diabetes (T1DM) than among patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM; 108/473, 22.8% vs 79/733, 10.8%; P<.001). The multivariate regression analysis showed that diabetes type, age, education, family income, and location were associated with app use in adult patients (P<.05). The need for and selection of diabetes apps differed slightly between patients with T1DM and patients with T2DM. The reasons why patients discontinued the use of an app included limited time (59/197, 29.9%), complicated operations (50/197, 25.4%), ineffectiveness for glycemic control (48/197, 24.4%), and cost (38/197, 19.3%).
Of the 608 responders to the diabetologist survey, 40.5% (246/608) recommended diabetes apps to patients and 25.2% (153/608) used diabetes apps to manage patients. The greatest obstacles to the diabetologists’ use of apps to manage diabetes patients include limited time (280/608, 46.1%), legal issues (129/608, 21.2%), patients’ distrust (108/608, 17.8%), and billing issues (66/608, 10.9%).
The awareness and use of diabetes apps in Chinese people with diabetes and the proportion of diabetologists using diabetes apps to manage patients are low. Designing apps targeting different patient needs and conducting high-quality randomized controlled trials will improve the effectiveness of the apps, provide evidence for patients to choose suitable apps, and be conducive to the promotion of app use.",2019 Feb 8,"Use, Perspectives, and Attitudes Regarding Diabetes Management Mobile Apps Among Diabetes Patients and Diabetologists in China: National Web-Based Survey",JMIR mHealth and uHealth
681,PMC4407600,"Statins competitively inhibit hepatic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, resulting in reduced plasma total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Recently, it has been shown that statins exert additional ‘pleiotropic’ effects by increasing expression levels of the membrane water channels aquaporin 2 (AQP2). AQP2 is localized mainly in the kidney and plays a critical role in determining cellular water content. This additional effect is independent of cholesterol homoeostasis, and depends on depletion of mevalonate-derived intermediates of sterol synthetic pathways, i.e. farnesylpyrophosphate and geranylgeranylpyrophosphate. By up-regulating the expression levels of AQP2, statins increase water reabsorption by the kidney, thus opening up a new avenue in treating patients with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI), a hereditary disease that yet lacks high-powered and limited side effects therapy. Aspects related to water balance determined by AQP2 in the kidney, as well as standard and novel therapeutic strategies of NDI are discussed.",2015 Jan 16,A novel therapeutic effect of statins on nephrogenic diabetes insipidus,Journal of Cellular and Molecular Medicine
682,PMC8154955,"X-linked nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (X-linked NDI) is a rare inherited disease mainly caused by lost-of-function mutations in human AVPR2 gene encoding arginine vasopressin receptor 2 (V2R). Our focus of the current study is on exploration of the functional and biochemical properties of Ile324Met (I324M) mutation identified in a pedigree showing as typical recessive X-linked NDI. We demonstrated that I324M mutation interfered with the conformation of complex glycosylation of V2R. Moreover, almost all of the I324M-V2R failed to express on the cell surface due to being captured by the endoplasmic reticulum control system. We further examined the signaling activity of DDAVP-medicated cAMP and ERK1/2 pathways and the results revealed that the mutant receptor lost the ability in response to DDAVP stimulation contributed to the failure of accumulation of cAMP and phosphorylated ERK1/2. Based on the characteristics of molecular defects of I324M mutant, we selected two reagents (SR49059 and alvespimycin) to determine whether the functions of I324M-V2R can be restored and we found that both compounds can significantly “rescue” I324M mutation. Our findings may provide further insights for understanding the pathogenic mechanism of AVPR2 gene mutations and may offer some implications on development of promising treatments for patients with X-linked NDI.",2021 May 26,Functional characterization of a loss-of-function mutant I324M of arginine vasopressin receptor 2 in X-linked nephrogenic diabetes insipidus,Scientific Reports
683,PMC6783171,"The clinical and genetic characteristics of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) were described via assessing 2 cases of NDI patients from a Chinese family.
Two patients who manifest polyuria and polydipsia were admitted to hospital for definite diagnosis.
Water deprivation-vasopressin tests showed that the patients may possess renal-origin diabetes insipidus. All the levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, follicle stimulation hormone, adrenocorticotropic hormone, prolactin, and growth hormone in both patients were normal. These results were certified that both patients possess a nephropathy-type diabetes insipidus. B-mode ultrasonography and urinalysis test demonstrated that the patient's diabetes insipidus is unlikely to originate from renal organic disease. Remarkably, by nucleotide sequencing, we found a novel mutation c.414_418del in arginine-vasopressin receptor 2 (AVPR2) was related to the disease of NDI.
Two patients were treated with oral hydrochlorothiazide and indomethacin. In addition, low salt diet and potassium supplementation throughout the patients’ treatment.

684,PMC6944850,"Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus have an increased hip fracture risk. We investigated the relationship between hip fracture and all‐cause death in patients with type 2 diabetes in comparison with cardiovascular disease (CVD) or end‐stage renal disease (ERSD).
In total, 4,923 Japanese participants with type 2 diabetes (mean age 65 years, 2,790 men, 2,133 women) were followed for a median of 5.3 years (follow‐up rate 99.5%). We evaluated the associations between the presence of hip fracture (n = 110), upper limb fracture (n = 801), CVD (n = 1,344), ESRD (n = 104) and all‐cause death by logistic regression analysis.
A total of 309 participants died during follow up. Multivariate‐adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for all‐cause mortality were significantly higher in participants with hip fractures than those without hip fractures (OR 2.67, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.54–4.41), whereas the ORs for upper limb fracture were not significant. The ORs for all‐cause mortality were significantly higher in participants with CVD than those without CVD (OR 1.78, 95% CI, 1.39–2.70) and ESRD (OR 2.36, 95% CI 1.32–4.05). The ORs for all‐cause mortality of hip fracture were not affected by further adjustment for CVD and ESRD (OR 2.74, 95% CI 1.58–4.54). The cause of death was infection (40.0%), malignant neoplasm (25.0%) and CVD (15.0%) among participants with hip fracture.
Hip fractures were associated with an increased risk of death among Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes, independently of CVD and ESRD.
Hip fracture is associated with increased mortality in the general population, although few studies have investigated the impact of hip fractures on the risk of death in patients with type 2 diabetes who also have a higher prevalence of fatal diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, renal disease or malignant neoplasia. In this study, the presence of hip fracture was associated with an increased risk of death among Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes, independently of cardiovascular disease and end‐stage renal disease. It should be emphasized that hip fracture is a critical event in the aging population of patients with type 2 diabetes.",2019 Jun 12,Impact of hip fracture on all‐cause mortality in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: The Fukuoka Diabetes Registry,Journal of Diabetes Investigation
685,PMC7858127,"Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) metrics, such as times in range (TIR) and time below range, have been shown to be useful as clinical targets that complement glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. We investigated the relationships between TIR, glycemic variability and patient characteristics in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
We carried out continuous glucose monitoring in 281 outpatients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who participated in a multicenter cohort (Hyogo Diabetes Hypoglycemia Cognition Complications) study.
The results are shown as the median (interquartile range). The age, disease duration and HbA1c were 68 years (62–71 years), 13 years (7–23 years) and 6.9% (6.5–7.5%), respectively. TIR and standard deviation obtained by continuous glucose monitoring worsened significantly with increasing disease duration. Multiple regression analyses showed that disease duration (standard partial regression coefficient, β = −0.160, P = 0.003), diabetic peripheral neuropathy (β = −0.106, P = 0.033) and urinary albumin excretion (β = −0.100, P = 0.043) were useful explanatory factors for TIR. In contrast, HbA1c (β = −0.398, P < 0.001) and the use of antidiabetic drugs potentially associated with severe hypoglycemia (β = 0.180, P = 0.028), such as sulfonylureas, glinides and insulin, were useful explanatory factors for time below range in the elderly patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
The results of this study suggest that disease duration and diabetic complications are associated with TIR deterioration. In addition, low HbA1c levels and the use of antidiabetic drugs potentially associated with severe hypoglycemia might worsen the time below range in the elderly.
In type 2 diabetes mellitus, the longer the duration of the disease, the number of patients treated with multiple medications or insulin increases and the glycemic fluctuation index measured by CGM worsens. CGM evaluations demonstrated that in elderly patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, there is a high risk of hypoglycemia for insulin users and those with low HbA1c levels.",2020 Aug 2,"Relationships between time in range, glycemic variability including hypoglycemia and types of diabetes therapy in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: Hyogo Diabetes Hypoglycemia Cognition Complications study",Journal of Diabetes Investigation

Hyponatremia is an electrolyte disorder frequently encountered by clinicians. Secondary adrenal insufficiency due to pituitary metastatic tumors should be considered as an alternative diagnosis when clinicians encounter patients with lung cancer who demonstrate hyponatremia. However, masked central diabetes insipidus should also be considered to prevent critical dehydration when glucocorticoid replacement therapy will be initiated.
A 70-year-old man with advanced lung adenocarcinoma demonstrated high-grade hyponatremia of 122 mmol/L. Magnetic resonance imaging disclosed a metastatic pituitary tumor and endocrinological examinations confirmed panhypopituitarism, including secondary adrenal insufficiency. Hydrocortisone replacement revealed masked diabetes insipidus with elevation of serum sodium levels that reached 151 mmol/L. Desmopressin administration was required to prevent water depletion and to immediately ameliorate the hypernatremia.
This is the first case report of masked diabetes insipidus that demonstrated high-grade hyponatremia. Secondary adrenal insufficiency can mask the hypernatremia that is a typical manifestation of diabetes insipidus. Physicians should consider adrenal insufficiency and diabetes insipidus due to pituitary metastasis of advanced malignancies, even when they encounter patients with hyponatremia.",2020 Dec 18,Masked Diabetes Insipidus Hidden by Severe Hyponatremia: A Case of Pituitary Metastasis of Lung Adenocarcinoma,The American Journal of Case Reports

Currently, diabetes is increasingly becoming a major threat to global public health, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa. Although previous studies emphasized knowledge and health beliefs about diabetes among patients living with diabetes, there is minimal evidence about knowledge and perception of risk for developing diabetes at the community level.
This study aimed to assess the knowledge and perception of diabetes mellitus and its associated factors among people in Debre Berhan town, northeast Ethiopia.
A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 423 participants. The study was carried out from 25 February to 10 March 2019. Data were collected using a structured pretested questionnaire through face-to-face interviews. Data were entered into Epi data V 3.1 and exported to SPSS V 24 for analysis. A variable with p< 0.2 in bivariable analysis was entered into multivariable logistic regression. During multivariate analysis, variables with a p value of ≤ 0.05 were considered significantly associated.
A total of 237 (56.02%) participants had good general knowledge about diabetes mellitus. In the multivariable analysis, participants who were single (AOR = 9.08, CI: 1.72–48), had a family history of diabetes (AOR = 2.83; CI: 1.10–7.24), and had exposure to health education (AOR = 3.27; CI: 2.02–5.31) were associated with good knowledge. In this study, few respondents (20.1%) felt that they had a higher risk of developing diabetes. Two-thirds of respondents (62.4%) saw diabetes is a serious disease. On the other hand, approximately 67% agreed to the perceived benefits of screening.
Almost half of the Debre Berhan community was found to have inadequate knowledge of diabetes mellitus. Married, higher educational status, exposure to health education, and family history of diabetes mellitus were significantly associated with good knowledge.

The patient underwent a surgical exploration and tumor resection through a transsphenoidal approach. Pathologic results revealed a cholesteatoma. The patient's symptoms improved a lot after surgery, and the postoperative period was uneventful. Taken together, the lesion's imaging appearance, pathological characteristics, and clinical features were all unique features that lead to a diagnosis of cholesteatoma.

691,PMC6995794,"Here, we review insulin management options and strategies in nonpregnant adult patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Most patients with T1DM should follow a regimen of multiple daily injections of basal/bolus insulin, but those not meeting individual glycemic targets or those with frequent or severe hypoglycemia or pronounced dawn phenomenon should consider continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion. The latter treatment modality could also be an alternative based on patient preferences and availability of reimbursement. Continuous glucose monitoring may improve glycemic control irrespective of treatment regimen. A glycemic target of glycated hemoglobin < 7% (53 mmol/mol) is appropriate for most nonpregnant adults. Basal insulin analogues with a reduced peak profile and an extended duration of action with lower intraindividual variability relative to neutral protamine Hagedorn insulin are preferred. The clinical advantages of basal analogues compared with older basal insulins include reduced injection burden, better efficacy, lower risk of hypoglycemic episodes (especially nocturnal), and reduced weight gain. For prandial glycemic control, any rapid-acting prandial analogue (aspart, glulisine, lispro) is preferred over regular human insulin. Faster-acting insulin aspart is a relatively new option with the advantage of better postprandial glucose coverage. Frequent blood glucose measurements along with patient education on insulin dosing based on carbohydrate counting, premeal blood glucose, and anticipated physical activity is paramount, as is education on the management of blood glucose under different circumstances.

692,PMC6020307,"Previous studies have documented that visceral adipose tissue is positively associated with the risk of diabetes. However, the association of subcutaneous adipose tissue with diabetes risk is still in dispute. We aimed to assess the associations between different adipose distributions and the risk of newly diagnosed diabetes in Chinese adults.
The Shanghai Nicheng Cohort Study was conducted among Chinese adults aged 45–70 years. The baseline data of 12,137 participants were analyzed. Subcutaneous and visceral fat area (SFA and VFA) were measured by magnetic resonance imaging. Diabetes was newly diagnosed using a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test.
The multivariable-adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of newly diagnosed diabetes per 1—standard deviation increase in SFA and VFA were 1.29 (1.19–1.39) and 1.61 (1.49–1.74) in men, and 1.10 (1.03–1.18) and 1.56 (1.45–1.67) in women, respectively. However, the association between SFA and newly diagnosed diabetes disappeared in men and was reversed in women (OR 0.86 [95% CI, 0.78–0.94]) after additional adjustment for body mass index (BMI) and VFA. The positive association between VFA and newly diagnosed diabetes remained significant in both sexes after further adjustment for BMI and SFA. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of newly diagnosed diabetes predicted by VFA (0.679 [95% CI, 0.659–0.699] for men and 0.707 [95% CI, 0.690–0.723] for women) were significantly larger than by the other adiposity indicators.
SFA was beneficial for lower risk of newly diagnosed diabetes in women but was not associated with newly diagnosed diabetes in men after taking general obesity and visceral obesity into account. VFA, however, was associated with likelihood of newly diagnosed diabetes in both Chinese men and women.

Evidence points to a key role of microbes in diabetes mellitus, both as infectious agents associated with the diabetic status and as possible causative factors of diabetes mellitus. This review takes into account the different forms of diabetes mellitus, the genetic determinants that predispose to type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus (especially those with possible immunologic impact), the immune dysfunctions that have been documented in diabetes mellitus. Common infections occurring more frequently in diabetic vs. nondiabetic individuals are reviewed. Infectious agents that are suspected of playing an etiologic/triggering role in diabetes mellitus are presented, with emphasis on enteroviruses, the hygiene hypothesis, and the environment. Among biological agents possibly linked to diabetes mellitus, the gut microbiome, hepatitis C virus, and prion-like protein aggregates are discussed. Finally, preventive vaccines recommended in the management of diabetic patients are considered, including the bacillus calmette-Guerin vaccine that is being tested for type 1 diabetes mellitus. Evidence supports the notion that attenuation of immune defenses (both congenital and secondary to metabolic disturbances as well as to microangiopathy and neuropathy) makes diabetic people more prone to certain infections. Attentive microbiologic monitoring of diabetic patients is thus recommendable. As genetic predisposition cannot be changed, research needs to identify the biological agents that may have an etiologic role in diabetes mellitus, and to envisage curative and preventive ways to limit the diabetes pandemic.",2018 Nov 1,The diabetes pandemic and associated infections: suggestions for clinical microbiology,Reviews in Medical Microbiology
695,PMC5835454,"Frequent emergency department (ED) visitors are medically vulnerable individuals. We identified the characteristics of “frequent ED users” among Korean patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
We used the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service National Patient Sample, which is a nationally representative sample. Patients (n = 109,412) with type 2 diabetes mellitus as a primary or secondary diagnosis at one of their visits were included. Individuals were classified into three groups according to the number of ED visits: frequent (≥4 visits), occasional (<4 visits) and non‐users of the ED. The characteristics of the patients that distinguished frequent users from the other groups were investigated.
Frequent ED users were mainly men (P < 0.001), with longer treatment duration (P < 0.001), more frequent comorbidities (cardiovascular and chronic kidney disease) and primary diagnosis made by surgery (P = 0.0028). They had higher mortality (P = 0.0085), longer hospitalization duration (P < 0.001), higher costs per visit (P < 0.001) and more often required medical protection (P < 0.001). These patients were treated more frequently with sulfonylurea, insulin, meglitinide and alpha‐glucosidase inhibitors (P < 0.05).
The present findings suggest that frequent users of the ED with type 2 diabetes mellitus have serious health conditions, a poor socioeconomic situation and tend to take some medicines (sulfonylurea, etc.), which often are associated with hypoglycemia. Attention should be given to therapy, and to patients with renal and cardiovascular diseases to decrease the dependency of these patients on the ED.",2017 Aug 17,Characteristics of frequent emergency department users with type 2 diabetes mellitus in Korea,Journal of Diabetes Investigation
696,PMC6882272,"Background: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a common chronic disorder in children and is caused by absolute or relative insulin deficiency, with or without insulin resistance. There are several different forms of childhood DM. Children can suffer from neonatal diabetes mellitus (NDM), type 1 diabetes (T1DM), type 2 diabetes (T2DM), Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY), autoimmune monogenic, mitochondrial, syndromic and as yet unclassified forms of DM. The Middle East has one of the highest incidences of several types of DM in children; however, it is unclear whether pediatric diabetes is an active area of research in the Middle East and if ongoing, which research areas are of priority for DM in children.
Objectives: To review the literature on childhood DM related to research in the Middle East, summarize results, identify opportunities for research and make observations and recommendations for collaborative studies in pediatric DM.
Methods: We conducted a thorough and systematic literature review by adhering to a list recommended by PRISMA. We retrieved original papers written in English that focus on childhood DM research, using electronic bibliographic databases containing publications from the year 2000 until October 2018. For our final assessment, we retrieved 429 full-text articles and selected 95 articles, based on our inclusion and exclusion criteria.
Results: Our literature review suggests that childhood DM research undertaken in the Middle East has focused mainly on reporting retrospective review of case notes, a few prospective case studies, systemic reviews, questionnaire-based studies, and case reports. These reported studies have focused mostly on the incidence/prevalence of different types of DM in childhood. No studies report on the establishment of National Childhood Diabetes Registries. There is a lack of consolidated studies focusing on national epidemiology data of different types of childhood DM (such as NDM, T1DM, T2DM, MODY, and syndromic forms) and no studies reporting on clinical trials in children with DM.
Conclusions: Investing in and funding basic and translational childhood diabetes research and encouraging collaborative studies, will bring enormous benefits financially, economically, and socially for the whole of the Middle East region.",2019 Nov 19,A Systematic Review of Childhood Diabetes Research in the Middle East Region,Frontiers in Endocrinology

These changes predispose the bone to an increased fracture risk and impaired osseus healing. In a clinical practice, adequate control of diabetes mellitus is essential for preventing detrimental effects on bone health. Alternative fracture risk assessment tools may be needed to accurately determine fracture risk in patients living with diabetes mellitus. Currently, there is no conclusive model explaining the mechanism of action of diabetes mellitus on bone health, particularly in view of progenitor cells. In this review, the best available literature on the impact of diabetes mellitus on bone health in vitro and in vivo is summarised with an emphasis on future translational research opportunities in this field.",2019 Sep 30,Impact of Diabetes Mellitus on Bone Health,International Journal of Molecular Sciences
698,PMC8136679,"Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder characterized by hyperglycemia resulting from defects in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. Diabetes and its complications can be reduced by enhancing the attitude of the community. However, there is limited information regarding attitude towards diabetes in northwest Ethiopia. Therefore, this study determined the attitude and associated factors of diabetes mellitus among adult non-diabetic participants in Gondar city.
A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted in Gondar city. Systematic random sampling was employed to select 626 non-diabetic participants. The data were collected using a pre-tested structured questionnaire. Descriptive statistics, processing, and analysis were done using STATA version 14. Both bivariable and multivariable binary logistic regressions were used to identify the associated factors. An adjusted odds ratio with a 95% confidence interval was used to calculate a level of significance.
Of 626 participants, 572 (91.37%) study subjects heard about diabetes mellitus. Three hundred and fifteen participants (55.07%) (95% CI: 50.9% - 59.1%) had a favorable attitude towards diabetes mellitus. Having good knowledge about diabetes (adjusted odds ratio = 2.69, 95% CI: 1.88, 3.87), and higher educational status (adjusted odds ratio = 1.69, 95% CI: 1.04, 2.78) were positively associated with a favorable attitude towards diabetes mellitus. Female gender (adjusted odds ratio = 0.68, 95% CI: 0.47, 0.98), on the other hand, had poor attitude towards diabetes mellitus.
In this study, a favorable attitude towards diabetes was low among adult non-diabetic participants.

699,PMC8628725,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic progressive disorder and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The concept of T2DM remission and the reversal of diabetic parameters to normal levels has been gaining momentum over the past years. T2DM remission is increasingly being recognized by various global guidelines. Multiple models have been developed and validated for quantifying the extent of remission achieved. Based on favorable clinical evidence, T2DM remission can be considered as the therapeutic goal in diabetes management and, in select cases, as an alternative to expensive treatment options, which can be burdensome as T2DM progresses. This narrative review discusses the available strategies, such as lifestyle interventions, physical activity, bariatric surgery, medical nutrition therapy, and non-insulin glucose-lowering medications, for achieving T2DM remission. Although the concept of T2DM remission has emerged as a real-world option, effective implementation in routine clinical practice may not be feasible until long-term studies prove the efficacy of different approaches in this regard.",2021 Nov 9,Quantifying Remission Probability in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus,Clinics and Practice

In this register-based study, all singletons born alive from January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2015 in the North Denmark and Central Denmark regions of Denmark and their mothers were included. We used data from Danish health registers and the LABKA database. Logistic regression models were used to compute crude and adjusted prevalence odds ratios (cORs and aORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for major congenital malformations overall and for subtypes, by type of maternal pre-existing diabetes and HbA1c levels.
Among 314,245 infants included, 2020 (0.64%) had mothers with type 1 diabetes and 498 (0.16%) had mothers with type 2 diabetes. We found an aOR of 2.9 (95% CI: 2.5, 3.5) and 1.9 (95% CI: 1.3; 2.8) for major malformations for type 1 and type 2 diabetes, respectively. The highest occurrence was seen for major congenital heart diseases, but we also observed higher occurrence of several other non-cardiac malformations. For both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, the prevalence of major congenital malformations increased with higher levels of maternal HbA1c with no safe threshold level. Mothers with type 1 diabetes had higher risks than those without diabetes irrespective of HbA1c, and women with HbA1c levels ≥9.5% had 8 times the odds of major congenital malformations [aOR 8.7 (95% CI: 5.4; 14.5)].

702,PMC4023572,"Monogenic diabetes represents a heterogeneous group of disorders resulting from defects in single genes. Defects are categorized primarily into two groups: disruption of β‐cell function or a reduction in the number of β‐cells. A complex network of transcription factors control pancreas formation, and a dysfunction of regulators high in the hierarchy leads to pancreatic agenesis. Dysfunction among factors further downstream might cause organ hypoplasia, absence of islets of Langerhans or a reduction in the number of β‐cells. Many transcription factors have pleiotropic effects, explaining the association of diabetes with other congenital malformations, including cerebellar agenesis and pituitary agenesis. Monogenic diabetes variants are classified conventionally according to age of onset, with neonatal diabetes occurring before the age of 6 months and maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) manifesting before the age of 25 years. Recently, certain familial genetic defects were shown to manifest as neonatal diabetes, MODY or even adult onset diabetes. Patients with neonatal diabetes require a thorough genetic work‐up in any case, and because extensive phenotypic overlap exists between monogenic, type 2, and type 1 diabetes, genetic analysis will also help improve diagnosis in these cases. Next generation sequencing will facilitate rapid screening, leading to the discovery of digenic and oligogenic diabetes variants, and helping to improve our understanding of the genetics underlying other types of diabetes. An accurate diagnosis remains important, because it might lead to a change in the treatment of affected subjects and influence long‐term complications.

An NDI pedigree was included in this study, including the proband and his mother. All NDI patients had polyuria, polydipsia, and growth retardation. PCR mapping, long range PCR and sanger sequencing were used to identify genetic causes of NDI.
A novel 22,110 bp deletion comprising AVPR2 and ARH4GAP4 genes was identified by PCR mapping, long range PCR and sanger sequencing. The deletion happened perhaps due to the 4-bp homologous sequence (TTTT) at the junctions of both 5′ and 3′ breakpoints. The gross deletion co-segregates with NDI. After analyzing available data of putative clinical signs of AVPR2 and ARH4GAP4 deletion, we reconsider the potential role of AVPR2 deletion in short stature.

704,PMC8543822,"Permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus (PNDM) presents with dehydration and hyperglycemia, which usually occurs during the first 12 months of life. Activating mutations of beta-cell adenosine triphosphate-sensitive potassium [KATP] channel subunits that cause opening of the channel are associated with PNDM. Some patients with PNDM respond to administration of a sulfonylurea derivative, which has long action on blood glucose even during hypoglycemia and has an apoptotic effect on beta cells. However, there have been no reports regarding treatment with meglitinide (repaglinide), which has rapid and short duration of action during the rise in blood glucose after meals that is more similar to beta cell function. It has no effects during hypoglycemia, so it does not cause neurological damage, and has no apoptotic effect on beta cells. We report herein the effects of repaglinide administration in the management and clinical outcome of two patients with PNDM during 9 and 10 years of follow-up.
Two Iranian infants were brought to our institution with poor general condition, dehydration, lethargy, and poor feeding. They had diabetic ketoacidosis at 52 days and 3.5 months of age, respectively. Their genetic analysis revealed mutations in the KCNJ11 gene encoding KIR6.2, so they both had PNDM. After treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis with insulin, they responded to sulfonylurea (glibenclamide) treatment, but were switched to repaglinide because of blood sugar fluctuations in terms of hyper- and hypoglycemia. Repaglinide was administered with the dosage of 0.04 mg/kg/day divided before every meal. 
The patients were 10 and 9 years old at the last visit, with normal growth parameters. The values of self-monitored blood glucose were well-controlled, and the hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) levels ranged from 3.6 to 6.4% during the follow-up period. There was no complication of diabetes, neurological disorder, or adverse effects related to repaglinide. 
In every neonate or infant < 6 months of age with diabetes mellitus, PNDM should be considered.

706,PMC6359174,"Aquaporins (AQPs) are a family of highly selective transmembrane channels that mainly transport water across the cell and some facilitate low-molecular-weight solutes. Eight AQPs, including AQP1, AQP2, AQP3, AQP4, AQP5, AQP6, AQP7, and AQP11, are expressed in different segments and various cells in the kidney to maintain normal urine concentration function. AQP2 is critical in regulating urine concentrating ability. The expression and function of AQP2 are regulated by a series of transcriptional factors and post-transcriptional phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and glycosylation. Mutation or functional deficiency of AQP2 leads to severe nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Studies with animal models show AQPs are related to acute kidney injury and various chronic kidney diseases, such as diabetic nephropathy, polycystic kidney disease, and renal cell carcinoma. Experimental data suggest ideal prospects for AQPs as biomarkers and therapeutic targets in clinic.

708,PMC4628085,"Wolfram syndrome (WFS) is diagnosed as coexistence of diabetes mellitus and optic atrophy, where pancreatic beta cell destruction is associated with neurodegeneration. Typically, WFS necessitates insulin treatment similar to type 1 diabetes (T1D), but the mechanism of beta cell mass reduction leading to hyperglycemia is different.
The aim of the study was to assess glycemic variability using the continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system in seven pediatric patients with genetically confirmed WFS and compare the results with data obtained from 21 propensity score-matched patients with T1D. The “GlyCulator” application was used for the calculation of glycemic variability indices.
CGM recordings showed similarities in glycemic variability among WFS patients, but differing from those of the T1D group. Coefficient of variation (%CV), CONGA4h, and GONGA6h were significantly (p < 0.05) lower in WFS patients (28.08 ± 7.37, 54.96 ± 11.92, and 55.99 ± 10.58) than in T1D patients (37.87 ± 14.24, 74.12 ± 28.74, p = 0.02, and 80.26 ± 35.05, respectively). In WFS patients, the percentage of values above 126 mg/dL was 69.79 (52.08–77.43), whereas in patients with T1D, the percentage was significantly lower—47.22 (35.07–62.85, p = 0.018).

709,PMC7610122,"Low birthweight is reportedly associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus; however, this association has not been confirmed in the Japanese population, and whether high birthweight is associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus is controversial. We aimed to investigate the association between birthweight and type 2 diabetes mellitus among a general Japanese population.
Overall 1,135 middle‐ to old‐aged Japanese men and women were enrolled in the Toon Health Study. A 75‐g oral glucose tolerance test was used to diagnose type 2 diabetes mellitus, and a questionnaire survey about birthweight was administered. The association between birthweight and the prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus in later life of the participants was examined using multivariable logistic regression analysis. Stratified analysis by current body mass index was also carried out.
The mean age was 56.5 ± 12.2 years. Type 2 diabetes mellitus was observed in 9.3% of the participants in this study. Compared with the reference group (2,500–3,999 g), the adjusted odds ratio of the low‐birthweight group (<2,500 g) for type 2 diabetes mellitus was 2.46 (95% confidence interval 1.48–4.10). The association between the high‐birthweight group (≥4000 g) and type 2 diabetes mellitus was not significant after including family history of diabetes in the multivariable model. The odds ratio of the low‐birthweight group for type 2 diabetes mellitus was higher in the overweight/obese group than in the non‐overweight group.

710,PMC8460767,"Aims: Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) were reported to be correlated with the development of diabetes, as well as diabetic vascular complications. Therefore, this study aimed at investigating the association between AGEs and lower-extremity atherosclerotic disease (LEAD).
Methods: A total of 1,013 type 2 diabetes patients were enrolled. LEAD was measured through color Doppler ultrasonography. The non-invasive skin autofluorescence method was performed for AGEs measurement. Considering that age plays an important role in both AGEs and LEAD, age-combined AGEs, i.e., AGEage index (define as AGEs × age/100) was used for related analysis.
Results: The overall prevalence of LEAD was 48.9% (495/1,013). Patients with LEAD showed a significantly higher AGEage (p < 0.001), and the prevalence of LEAD increased with ascending AGEage levels (p for trend < 0.001). Logistic regression analysis revealed that AGEage was significantly positively associated with risk of LEAD, and the odds ratios of presence of LEAD across quartiles of AGEage were 1.00, 1.72 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.14–2.61], 2.72 (95% CI = 1.76–4.22), 4.29 (95% CI = 2.69–6.85) for multivariable-adjusted model (both p for trend < 0.001), respectively. The results were similar among patients of different sexes, body mass index, and with or without diabetes family history. Further, AGEage presented a better predictive value for LEAD than glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), with its sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve of 75.5% (95% CI = 71.6–79.2%), 59.3% (95% CI = 54.9–63.6%), and 0.731 (0.703–0.758), respectively.
Conclusion: AGEage, the non-invasive measured skin AGEs combined with age, seems to be a more promising approach than HbA1c in identifying patient at high risk of LEAD.",2021 Sep 10,Association of Advanced Glycation End Products With Lower-Extremity Atherosclerotic Disease in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus,Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine
711,PMC4880583,"Nitric oxide (NO) is synthesized by a family of NO synthases (NOS), including neuronal, inducible, and endothelial NOS (n/i/eNOS). NO-mediated effects can be beneficial or harmful depending on the specific risk factors affecting the disease. In hypertension, the vascular relaxation response to acetylcholine is blunted, and that to direct NO donors is maintained. A reduction in the activity of eNOS is mainly responsible for the elevation of blood pressure, and an abnormal expression of iNOS is likely to be related to the progression of vascular dysfunction. While eNOS/nNOS-derived NO is protective against the development of atherosclerosis, iNOS-derived NO may be proatherogenic. eNOS-derived NO may prevent the progression of myocardial infarction. Myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury is significantly enhanced in eNOS-deficient animals. An important component of heart failure is the loss of coronary vascular eNOS activity. A pressure-overload may cause severer left ventricular hypertrophy and dysfunction in eNOS null mice than in wild-type mice. iNOS-derived NO has detrimental effects on the myocardium. NO plays an important role in regulating the angiogenesis and slowing the interstitial fibrosis of the obstructed kidney. In unilateral ureteral obstruction, the expression of eNOS was decreased in the affected kidney. In triply n/i/eNOS null mice, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus developed along with reduced aquaporin-2 abundance. In chronic kidney disease model of subtotal-nephrectomized rats, treatment with NOS inhibitors decreased systemic NO production and induced left ventricular systolic dysfunction (renocardiac syndrome).",2016 May 20,Altered Nitric Oxide System in Cardiovascular and Renal Diseases,Chonnam Medical Journal
712,PMC6676834,"In contrast to Caucasians of European origin, the aetiology of diabetes mellitus (DM) in young adults in other ethnic groups, including Indians is likely to be heterogeneous and difficult to determine. This study was undertaken to determine the aetiology of diabetes in young Indian adults using a protocol-based set of simple clinical and investigation tools.
In this prospective study, 105 Indian young adults with diabetes (age at onset 18-35 yr; duration <2 yr) were studied for a period of 1-3 years. Pancreatic imaging, fasting C-peptide, islet antibodies (against glutamic acid decarboxylase, tyrosine phosphatase and zinc transporter-8) and mitochondrial A3243G mutational analysis were performed in all patients. Four patients were screened for maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) using next-generation sequencing.
Type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T1DM and T2DM) were equally frequent (40% each), followed by fibrocalculous pancreatic diabetes (FCPD, 15%). Less common aetiologies included MODY (2%), mitochondrial diabetes (1%) and Flatbush diabetes (2%). There was considerable phenotypic overlap between the main aetiological subtypes. Elevated islet antibodies were noted in 62 per cent of T1DM patients [positive predictive value (PPV) 84%; negative predictive value (NPV) 78%] while low plasma C-peptide (<250 pmol/l) was present in 56 per cent of T1DM patients [PPV 96% (after excluding FCPD), NPV 72%]. Using these tests and observing the clinical course over one year, a final diagnosis was made in 103 (99%) patients, while the diagnosis at recruitment changed in 23 per cent of patients.

713,PMC7735527,"Sarcoidosis is defined by granuloma formation in a multitude of organs. Despite its rare involvement in the nervous system, there are a number of cases that identify neurological symptoms to be the initial clinical manifestation of sarcoidosis. The involvement of the hypothalamic-pituitary (HP) axis presented most frequently with hormone deficiencies. Studies have reported that damage to the pituitary gland may be irreversible, and hormone abnormalities were generally permanent. Neurosarcoidosis has been described as the underlying cause of central diabetes insipidus (DI) and syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) secretion. The pathological mechanism that can lead both to deficiency and excess of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) secretion is still not fully understood. It has been shown that diagnosis of neurosarcoidosis remains challenging, as symptoms can be inconclusive and diagnostic tools are not sufficiently sensitive and specific. Early treatment may potentially reverse pituitary deficiencies, although studies to confirm this hypothesis are minimal. This review article aims to increase knowledge about central DI and SIADH caused by neurosarcoidosis, identify possible difficulties in diagnosis, and discuss the importance of early management.

We aim to describe the implementation of DPARD and to provide an overview of the characteristics of patients included during the first 2 years.
For the DPARD cohort with long-term follow-up of observational nature, hospital data are gathered directly from electronic health records and securely transferred and stored. DPARD provides weekly updated clinical information on the diabetes population care on a hospital-level benchmarked against the national average.
Between November 2017 and January 2020, 20,857 patients were included from 8 (11%) Dutch hospitals with a level of care distribution representative of all diabetic outpatients in the Netherlands. Among patients with known diabetes type, 41% had type 1 diabetes, 51% type 2 diabetes, and 8% had diabetes due to other causes. Characteristics of the total patient population were similar to patients with unknown diabetes classification. HbA1c levels decreased over the years, while BMI levels showed an increase over time.
The national DPARD registry aims to facilitate investigation of prevalence and long-term outcomes of Dutch outpatients with diabetes mellitus and their treatment, thus allowing for quality improvement of diabetes care as well as allowing for comparison of diabetes care on an international level.",2021 Jun 16,"DPARD: rationale, design and initial results from the Dutch national diabetes registry",BMC Endocrine Disorders
715,PMC8589453,"Chronological age (CA) is determined by time of birth, whereas biological age (BA) is based on changes on a cellular level and strongly correlates with morbidity, mortality, and longevity. Type 2 diabetes (T2D) associates with increased morbidity and mortality; thus, we hypothesized that BA would be increased and calculated it from biomarkers collected at routine clinical visits. Deidentified data was obtained from three cohorts of patients (20–80 years old)—T2D, type 1 diabetes (T1D), and prediabetes—and compared to gender- and age-matched non-diabetics. Eight clinical biomarkers that correlated with CA in people without diabetes were used to calculate BA using the Klemera and Doubal method 1 (KDM1) and multiple linear regression (MLR). The phenotypic age (PhAge) formula was used with its predetermined biomarkers. BA of people with T2D was, on average, 12.02 years higher than people without diabetes (p < 0.0001), while BA in T1D was 16.32 years higher (p < 0.0001). Results were corroborated using MLR and PhAge. The biomarkers with the strongest correlation to increased BA in T2D using KDM were A1c (R2 = 0.23, p < 0.0001) and systolic blood pressure (R2 = 0.21, p < 0.0001). BMI had a positive correlation to BA in non-diabetes subjects but disappeared in those with diabetes. Mortality data using the ACCORD trial was used to validate our results and showed a significant correlation between higher BA and decreased survival. In conclusion, BA is increased in people with diabetes, irrespective of pathophysiology, and to a lesser extent in prediabetes.

716,PMC8105151,"COVID-19 has completely changed our daily clinical practice as well as our social relations. Many organs and biological systems are involved in SARS-Cov-2 infection, either due to direct virus-induced damage or to indirect effects that can have systemic consequences. Endocrine system is not only an exception but its involvement in COVID-19 is so relevant that an “endocrine phenotype” of COVID-19 has progressively acquired clinical relevance.
We have been appointed by the European Society of Endocrinology (ESE) to update with the current statement ESE members and the whole endocrine community on the emerging endocrine phenotype of COVID-19 and its implication for the prevention and management of the disease.
Diabetes has a major role in this phenotype since it is one of the most frequent comorbidities associated with severity and mortality of COVID-19. Careful management including treatment modifications may be required for protecting our patients rather with known diabetes from the most dangerous consequences of COVID-19 or hospitalized with COVID-19, but also in patients with SARS-CoV-2 induced newly onset diabetes. Obesity increases susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 and the risk for COVID-19 adverse outcome. Adequate nutritional management needs to be granted to patients with obesity or undernourishment in order to limit their increased susceptibility and severity of COVID-19 infection. Lack of vitamin D, hypocalcemia and vertebral fractures have also emerged as frequent findings in the hospitalized COVID-19 population and may negatively impact on the outcome of such patients. Also, in patients with adrenal insufficiency prompt adaptation of glucocorticoid doses may be needed. Moreover, in this updated statement role of sex hormones as well as peculiar pituitary and thyroid aspects of COVID-19 have been included. Finally, in view of the mass vaccination, potential implications for endocrine patients should be considered.",2021 May 8,COVID-19 and endocrine and metabolic diseases.

717,PMC8573287,"The hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS), an acute complication of diabetes mellitus with plasma hyperosmolarity, promotes the secretion of anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) and reduces the storage of ADH. Magnetic resonance T1-weighted imaging reflects ADH storage in the posterior pituitary lobe, which disappears when the storage is depleted. Whether the HHS induces ADH depletion leading to clinical manifestations has been unclear.
A 55-year-old Japanese woman was admitted to our center because of mental disturbance and hypotension. She had received lithium carbonate for bipolar disorder and presented with polydipsia and polyuria from 15 years of age. On admission, she had mental disturbance (Glasgow Coma Scale, E4V1M1), hypotension (systolic blood pressure, 50 mmHg), and tachycardia (pulse rate, 123/min). Plasma glucose was 697 mg/dL osmolality was 476 mOsm/kg•H2O, and bicarbonate was 23.7 mmol/L. The diagnoses of HHS and hypovolemic shock were made. During treatment with fluid replacement and insulin therapy, the urine volume continued to be approximately 3 to 4 L/day, and an endocrine examination revealed ADH insufficiency and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Desmopressin 10 μg/day and trichlormethiazide 2 mg/day were necessary and administered, and the endogenous ADH secretion improved gradually. The signal intensity of the pituitary posterior lobe, initially decreased on magnetic resonance T1 images, was also improved.

719,PMC7599609,"As a rare hereditary disease, congenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) is clinically characterized by polyuria with hyposthenuria and polydipsia. NDI results from collecting duct principal cell hyporesponsiveness or insensitivity to the antidiuretic action of arginine vasopressin (AVP). The principal cell-specific water channel aquaporin-2 (AQP2) plays an essential role in water reabsorption along osmotic gradients. The capacity to accumulate AQP2 in the apical plasma membrane in response to decreased fluid volume or increased plasma osmolality is critically regulated by the antidiuretic hormone AVP and its receptor 2 (AVPR2). Mutations in AVPR2 result in X-linked recessive NDI, the most common form of inherited NDI. Genetic defects in AQP2 cause autosomal recessive or dominant NDI. In this review, we provide an updated overview of the genetic and molecular mechanisms of congenital NDI, with a focus on the potential disease-causing mutations in AVPR2 and AQP2, the molecular defects in the AVPR2 and AQP2 mutants, post-translational modifications (i.e., phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and glycosylation) and various protein-protein interactions that regulate phosphorylation, ubiquitination, tetramerization, trafficking, stability, and degradation of AQP2.",2020 Sep 26,AQP2: Mutations Associated with Congenital Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus and Regulation by Post-Translational Modifications and Protein-Protein Interactions,Cells
720,PMC8606068,"This study investigated whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) reported by previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to be associated with impaired insulin secretion, insulin resistance, and/or type 2 diabetes are associated with disposition index, the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and/or development of diabetes following a pregnancy complicated by gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).
Seventy-two SNPs were genotyped in 374 women with previous GDM from Southern Sweden. An oral glucose tolerance test was performed 1–2 years postpartum, although data on the diagnosis of diabetes were accessible up to 5 years postpartum. HOMA-IR and disposition index were used to measure insulin resistance and secretion, respectively.
The risk A-allele in the rs11708067 polymorphism of the adenylate cyclase 5 gene (ADCY5) was associated with decreased disposition index (beta = − 0.90, SE 0.38, p = 0.019). This polymorphism was an expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) in islets for both ADCY5 and its antisense transcript. The risk C-allele in the rs2943641 polymorphism, near the insulin receptor substrate 1 gene (IRS1), showed a trend towards association with increased HOMA-IR (beta = 0.36, SE 0.18, p = 0.050), and the T-allele of the rs4607103 polymorphism, near the ADAM metallopeptidase with thrombospondin type 1 motif 9 gene (ADAMTS9), was associated with postpartum diabetes (OR = 2.12, SE 0.22, p = 0.00055). The genetic risk score (GRS) of the top four SNPs tested for association with the disposition index using equal weights was associated with the disposition index (beta = − 0.31, SE = 0.29, p = 0.00096). In addition, the GRS of the four SNPs studied for association with HOMA-IR using equal weights showed an association with HOMA-IR (beta = 1.13, SE = 0.48, p = 9.72874e−11).

To evaluate the clinical significance of 1,5-AG in diabetes detection, especially when used in combination with fasting plasma glucose (FPG), a total of 3098 participants at high risk for diabetes (1467 men, 1631 women) were enrolled. A total of 1471 (47.5%) participants were diagnosed with diabetes, and the mean 1,5-AG level in the diabetic group was significantly lower than that in non-diabetic group [12.5 (7.8–17.5) μg/mL vs. 20.5 (15.3–26.4) μg/mL, P < 0.001]. The optimal cut-off point was 15.9 μg/mL, for which the sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC) were 69.2%, 72.3%, and 0.781, respectively. For the combination of FPG and 1,5-AG, the sensitivity, specificity, and AUC improved to 82.5%, 83.5%, and 0.912, respectively. This method helped 75.8% of the participants avoid an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), reducing the need to carry out the OGTT by 43.9% compared to the use of the FPG criterion only.

722,PMC7480213,"Fasting in the Islamic month of Ramadan is obligatory for all sane, healthy adult Muslims. The length of the day varies significantly in temperate regions—typically lasting ≥ 18 h during peak summer in the UK. The synodic nature of the Islamic calendar means that Ramadan migrates across all four seasons over an approximately 33-year cycle. Despite valid exemptions, there is an intense desire to fast during this month, even among those who are considered to be at high risk, including many individuals with diabetes mellitus. In this review we explore the current scientific and clinical evidence on fasting in patients with diabetes mellitus, focussing on type 2 diabetes mellitus and type 1 diabetes mellitus, with brief reviews on pregnancy, pancreatic diabetes, bariatric surgery, the elderly population and current practice guidelines. We also make recommendations on the management of diabetes patients during the month of Ramadan. Many patients admit to a do-it-yourself approach to diabetes mellitus management during Ramadan, largely due to an under-appreciation of the risks and implications of the rigors of fasting on their health. Part of the issue may also lie with a healthcare professional’s perceived inability to grasp the religious sensitivities of Muslims in relation to disease management. Thus, the pre-Ramadan assessment is crucial to ensure a safe Ramadan experience. Diabetes patients can be risk-stratified from low, medium to high or very high risk during the pre-Ramadan assessment and counselled accordingly. Those who are assessed to be at high to very high risk are advised not to fast. The current COVID-19 pandemic upgrades those in the high-risk category to very high risk; hence a significant number of diabetes patients may fall under the penumbra of the ‘not to fast’ advisory. We recognize that fasting is a personal choice and if a person chooses to fast despite advice to the contrary, he/she should be adequately supported and monitored closely during Ramadan and for a brief period thereafter. Current advancements in insulin delivery and glucose monitoring technologies are useful adjuncts to strategies for supporting type 1 diabetes patients considered to be high risk as well as ‘high-risk’ type 2 patients manage their diabetes during Ramadan. Although there is a lack of formal trial data, there is sufficient evidence across the different classes of therapeutic hypoglycaemic agents in terms of safety and efficacy to enable informed decision-making and provide a breadth of therapeutic options for the patient and the healthcare professional, even if the professional advice is to abstain. Thus, Ramadan provides an excellent opportunity for patient engagement to discuss important aspects of management, to improve control in the short term during Ramadan and to help the observants understand that the metabolic gains achieved during Ramadan are also sustainable in the other months of the year by maintaining a dietary and behavioural discipline. The application of this understanding can potentially prevent long-term complications.

WS is characterized by insulin-requiring diabetes mellitus and optic atrophy. A constellation of other features contributes to the acronym DIDMOAD (Diabetes Insipidus, Diabetes Mellitus, Optic Atrophy, and Deafness). This review seeks to raise awareness of this rare form of diabetes so that individuals with WS are identified and provided with appropriate care.
 We describe a woman without risk factors for gestational or type 2 diabetes who presented with gestational diabetes (GDM) at the age of 39 years during her first and only pregnancy. Although she had optic atrophy since the age of 10 years, WS was not considered as her diagnosis until she presented with GDM. Biallelic mutations in WFS1 were identified, supporting a diagnosis of classical WS.
 The distinct natural history, complications, and differences in management reinforce the importance of distinguishing WS from other forms of diabetes.

Maintenance of eunatremia can be quite difficult in patients with DI and adipsia because of the absence of this homeostatic mechanism.

She underwent transsphenoidal resection in 2013 and additionally developed postoperative cognitive impairment and hypothalamic dysfunction, including adipsia. She subsequently experienced widely dysregulated sodium levels, necessitating inpatient care ∼30% of days in 2014 and 2015. We created a protocol for this patient that uses a fixed daily dose of subcutaneous DDAVP combined with daily modulation of fluid intake based on daily serum sodium measurement. The protocol provides guidance for the day’s fluid intake based on both the current sodium result and the rate of change from the previous day. Since the adoption of the protocol in June 2016, the patient has had a dramatic reduction in hospitalizations.

A total of 2,775 Japanese male workers who had no history of type 2 diabetes mellitus were followed. High GGT and ALT were defined as the top tertiles (GGT cutpoint: 49 IU/L, ALT cutpoint: 28 IU/L). Three groups were created using these dichotomized GGT and ALT cutpoints: both low, either high or both high. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were carried out adjusted for potential confounding factors.
A total of 276 type 2 diabetes mellitus cases were identified during 12 years (27,040 person‐years) of follow up. Participants with simultaneously elevated GGT and ALT had a significantly higher incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus, even after adjustment for fasting insulin and fasting blood glucose compared with the group without GGT or ALT elevation. Similar associations were observed in non‐ or light‐to‐moderate alcohol drinkers, as well as in participants with normal weight. However, the association was weaker in participants with triglycerides <150 mg/dL. We then evaluated whether the addition of GGT and ALT would improve the prediction of type 2 diabetes mellitus incidence, and found that their inclusion significantly increased the C‐statistic, net reclassification improvement and integrated discrimination improvement.

In this work, we focus on such mutations and discuss what the structural defects are that they appear to cause. To achieve this aim, we built a 3D molecular model for each mutant and explored the effect of the mutation on all of their structural features. Based on these analyses, we could collect the structural defects of all the pathogenic mutations (here or previously analysed) under few main categories, that we found to nicely correlate with the experimental phenotypes reported for several of the analysed mutants.

728,PMC8038821,"Introduction: Gestational diabetes (GDM), defined as hyperglycemia with onset or initial recognition during pregnancy, has a rising prevalence paralleling the rise in type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and obesity. GDM is associated with short-term and long-term consequences for both mother and child. Therefore, it is crucial we efficiently identify all cases and initiate early treatment, reducing fetal exposure to hyperglycemia and reducing GDM-related adverse pregnancy outcomes. For this reason, GDM screening is recommended as part of routine pregnancy care. The current screening method, the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), is a lengthy, cumbersome and inconvenient test with poor reproducibility. Newer biomarkers that do not necessitate a fasting sample are needed for the prompt diagnosis of GDM. The aim of this scoping review is to highlight and describe emerging protein biomarkers that fulfill these requirements for the diagnosis of GDM. Materials and Methods: This scoping review was conducted according to preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines for scoping reviews using Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), the Cumulative Index to Nursing & Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), PubMed, Embase and Web of Science with a double screening and extraction process. The search included all articles published in the literature to July 2020. Results: Of the 3519 original database citations identified, 385 were eligible for full-text review. Of these, 332 (86.2%) were included in the scoping review providing a total of 589 biomarkers studied in relation to GDM diagnosis. Given the high number of biomarkers identified, three post hoc criteria were introduced to reduce the items set for discussion: we chose only protein biomarkers with at least five citations in the articles identified by our search and published in the years 2017–2020. When applied, these criteria identified a total of 15 biomarkers, which went forward for review and discussion. Conclusions: This review details protein biomarkers that have been studied to find a suitable test for GDM diagnosis with the potential to replace the OGTT used in current GDM screening protocols. Ongoing research efforts will continue to identify more accurate and practical biomarkers to take GDM screening and diagnosis into the 21st century.",2021 Apr 6,Emerging Protein Biomarkers for the Diagnosis or Prediction of Gestational Diabetes—A Scoping Review,Journal of Clinical Medicine

Using healthcare data from the national health insurance examinees, our study comprised a cohort of adults aged ≥40 years with hypercholesterolemia who would be eligible for statin therapy for primary prevention from 2005 to 2012. The primary outcome was the occurrence of clinically relevant new‐onset diabetes mellitus requiring medical therapy. Among 2 162 119 adults with hypercholesterolemia who might be eligible for statin therapy, 638 625 (29.5%) ever used statins and 1 523 494 (70.5%) never used statins. In the propensity‐matched cohort of 518 491 pairs, during mean follow‐up of 3.9 years, being an ever‐user of statin was significantly associated with diabetes mellitus risk compared with being a never‐user of statin (13.4 versus 6.9 per 1000 person‐years; adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.88; 95% CI, 1.85–1.93). With increasing duration of statin use, the risk of diabetes mellitus was proportionally increased (HR 1.25 <1 year, HR 2.22 for 1–2 years, and HR 2.62 >2 years). An excess risk of diabetes mellitus was also associated with a higher intensity (HR 1.75 for low‐to‐moderate potency and HR 2.31 for high potency) and a cumulative dosing of statin (HR 1.06 for low‐tertile, HR 1.74 for middle‐tertile, and HR 2.52 for high‐tertile of defined‐daily‐disease).

731,PMC7522371,"Despite recent advancements in clinical drugs, diabetes treatment still needs further progress. As such, ongoing research has attempted to determine the precise molecular mechanisms of the disorder. Specifically, evidence supports that several signaling pathways play pivotal roles in the development of diabetes. However, the exact molecular mechanisms of diabetes still need to be explored. This study examines exciting new hallmarks for the strict involvement of autophagy and TGF-β signaling pathways in the pathogenesis of diabetes and the design of novel therapeutic strategies. Dysregulated autophagy in pancreatic β cells due to hyperglycemia, oxidative stress, and inflammation is associated with diabetes and accompanied by dysregulated autophagy in insulin target tissues and the progression of diabetic complications. Consequently, several therapeutic agents such as adiponectin, ezetimibe, GABA tea, geniposide, liraglutide, guava extract, and vitamin D were shown to inhibit diabetes and its complications through modulation of the autophagy pathway. Another pathway, TGF-β signaling pathway, appears to play a part in the progression of diabetes, insulin resistance, and autoimmunity in both type 1 and 2 diabetes and complications in diabetes. Subsequently, drugs that target TGF-β signaling, especially naturally derived ones such as resveratrol, puerarin, curcumin, hesperidin, and silymarin, as well as Propolis, Lycopus lucidus, and Momordica charantia extracts, may become promising alternatives to current drugs in diabetes treatment.

We interviewed 378 university students using pretested self-administered semi-structured questionnaires. Only students who consented to participate in the study were included. Data were entered into EpiData version 3.1 and analysed using SPSS version 18.
Almost all (99%) of the students had knowledge about diabetes mellitus. The majority (83.1%) reported that diabetes mellitus is not completely a genetic/hereditary disease. Only a minority of respondents reported that they should worry about diabetes before 45 years of age. Common symptoms of diabetes reported by the respondents included constant hunger, blurred vision, fatigue, and frequent urination.
Our study revealed that the majority of university students in Uganda had good knowledge about the risk factors and symptoms of diabetes mellitus. The majority also perceived themselves to be at risk of diabetes.",2017 Jul 1,"Knowledge, Attitudes, and Perceived Risks Related to Diabetes Mellitus Among University Students in Uganda: A Cross-Sectional Study",The East African Health Research Journal
734,PMC7305007,"The convergence of advances in medical science, human biology, data science, and technology has enabled the generation of new insights into the phenotype known as “diabetes.” Increased knowledge of this condition has emerged from populations around the world, illuminating the differences in how diabetes presents, its variable prevalence, and how best practice in treatment varies between populations. In parallel, focus has been placed on the development of tools for the application of precision medicine to numerous conditions. This Consensus Report presents the American Diabetes Association (ADA) Precision Medicine in Diabetes Initiative in partnership with the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD), including its mission, the current state of the field, and prospects for the future. Expert opinions are presented on areas of precision diagnostics and precision therapeutics (including prevention and treatment), and key barriers to and opportunities for implementation of precision diabetes medicine, with better care and outcomes around the globe, are highlighted. Cases where precision diagnosis is already feasible and effective (i.e., monogenic forms of diabetes) are presented, while the major hurdles to the global implementation of precision diagnosis of complex forms of diabetes are discussed. The situation is similar for precision therapeutics, in which the appropriate therapy will often change over time owing to the manner in which diabetes evolves within individual patients. This Consensus Report describes a foundation for precision diabetes medicine, while highlighting what remains to be done to realize its potential. This, combined with a subsequent, detailed evidence-based review (due 2022), will provide a roadmap for precision medicine in diabetes that helps improve the quality of life for all those with diabetes.",2020 Jun 11,Precision Medicine in Diabetes: A Consensus Report From the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD),Diabetes Care
735,PMC8292635,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are public health issues worldwide, and their comorbidities trigger the progress to severe disease and even death in such patients. Globally, DM has affected an estimated 9.3% adults, and as of April 18, 2021, the World Health Organization (WHO) has confirmed 141,727,940 COVID-19 confirmed cases. The virus is spread via droplets, aerosols, and direct touch with others. Numerous predictive factors have been linked to COVID-19 severity, including impaired immune response and increased inflammatory response, among others. Angiotensin receptor blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme 2 have also been identified as playing a boosting role in both susceptibility and severity to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Specifically, in DM patients, both their control and management during this pandemic is herculean as the restriction periods have markedly hampered the maintenance of means to control glycemia, hypertension, and neuroendocrine and kidney diseases. In addition, as a result of the underlyin cardio-metabolic and immunological disorders, DM patients are at a higher risk of developing the severe form of COVID-19 despite other comorbidities, such as hypertension, also potentially boosting the development of higher COVID-19 severity. However, even in non-DM patients, SARS-CoV-2 may also cause transient hyperglycemia through induction of insulin resistance and/or pancreatic β-cell injury. Therefore, a strict glucose monitoring of DM patients with COVID-19 is mandatory to prevent life-threatening complications.",2021 Jul 7,Factors Behind the Higher COVID-19 Risk in Diabetes: A Critical Review,Frontiers in Public Health
736,PMC5713291,"This review summarized different studies reporting the presence of autoantibodies reacting against cells of the pituitary (APAs) and/or hypothalamus (AHAs). Both APAs and AHAs have been revealed through immunofluorescence using different kinds of substrates. Autoantibodies against gonadotropic cells were mainly found in patients affected by cryptorchidism and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism while those against prolactin cells were found in different kinds of patients, the majority without pituitary abnormalities. APAs to growth hormone (GH) cells have been associated with GH deficiency while those against the adrenocorticotropic cells have distinguished central Cushing’s disease patients at risk of incomplete cure after surgical adenoma removal. AHAs to vasopressin cells have identified patients at risk of developing diabetes insipidus. APAs have been also found together with AHAs in patients affected by idiopathic hypopituitarism, but both were also present in different kinds of patients without abnormalities of the hypothalamic–pituitary axis. Despite some data being promising, the clinical use of pituitary and hypothalamus autoantibodies is still limited by the low diagnostic sensitivity, irreproducibility of the results, and the absence of autoantigen/s able to discriminate the autoimmune reaction involving the pituitary or the hypothalamus from the other autoimmune states.",2017 Nov 3,The Hypothalamic–Pituitary Axis and Autoantibody Related Disorders,International Journal of Molecular Sciences
737,PMC7645943,"The emergence of continuous glucose monitoring has driven improvements in glycaemic control and quality of life for people with diabetes. Recent changes in access to continuous glucose monitoring systems within UK health services have increased the number of people able to benefit from these technologies. The COVID‐19 pandemic has created an opportunity for diabetes healthcare professionals to use continuous glucose monitoring technology to remotely deliver diabetes services to support people with diabetes. This opportunity can be maximized with improved application and interpretation of continuous glucose monitoring‐generated data. Amongst the diverse measures of glycaemic control, time in range is considered to be of high value in routine clinical care because it is actionable and is visibly responsive to changes in diabetes management. Importantly, it is also been linked to the risk of developing complications associated with diabetes and can be understood by people with diabetes and healthcare professionals alike. The 2019 International Consensus on Time in Range has established a series of target glucose ranges and recommendations for time spent within these ranges that is consistent with optimal glycaemic control. The recommendations cover people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, with separate targets indicated for elderly people or those at higher risk from hypoglycaemia, as well as for women with type 1 diabetes during pregnancy.

738,PMC7610619,"Mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor (MANF) is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)–resident protein that plays a crucial role in attenuating ER stress responses. Although MANF is indispensable for the survival and function of mouse β-cells, its precise role in human β-cell development and function is unknown. In this study, we show that lack of MANF in humans results in diabetes due to increased ER stress, leading to impaired β-cell function. We identified two patients from different families with childhood diabetes and a neurodevelopmental disorder associated with homozygous loss-of-function mutations in the MANF gene. To study the role of MANF in human β-cell development and function, we knocked out the MANF gene in human embryonic stem cells and differentiated them into pancreatic endocrine cells. Loss of MANF induced mild ER stress and impaired insulin-processing capacity of β-cells in vitro. Upon implantation to immunocompromised mice, the MANF knockout grafts presented elevated ER stress and functional failure, particularly in recipients with diabetes. By describing a new form of monogenic neurodevelopmental diabetes syndrome caused by disturbed ER function, we highlight the importance of adequate ER stress regulation for proper human β-cell function and demonstrate the crucial role of MANF in this process.",2021 Jan 26,Loss of MANF Causes Childhood-Onset Syndromic Diabetes Due to Increased Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress,Diabetes
739,PMC6505274,"Diabetes during pregnancy is an increasingly common metabolic disorder, associated with significantly increased risks for both mother and child. Aim of this study was to compare maternal and perinatal outcomes in women with pregestational (PDM) type 1 (T1DM), type 2 diabetes (T2DM), gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and compare these to pregnancies not complicated with diabetes. This study also evaluated a specifically organized care-model mostly involving specialist diabetes nurses.
Retrospective population-based records review 2009–2012. Rates of maternal (preeclampsia, pre-term delivery, cesarean section (CS)) and fetal outcomes (large for gestational age (LGA), macrosomia, congenital malformations/intrauterine death) were assessed and potential predisposing or contributing factors as maternal age, ethnicity, obesity, weight gain, parity, HbA1c levels, insulin types and doses.
Among 280 pregnancies 48 were PDM, 97 GDM and 135 without diabetes. Within the group with diabetes, early-pregnancy BMI was higher (p = 0.0001), pregnancy weight gain lower (11.1 ± 6.7 kg vs 13.1 ± 7.1 kg, p = 0.005), more delivered preterm (p = 0.0001), by CS (p = 0.05), and had more LGA neonates (p = 0.06) than the group without diabetes. Among pregnancies with diabetes, GDM mothers gained less weight (9.9 kg vs 13.5 kg) (p = 0.006), and rates of CS (p = 0.03), preterm deliveries (p = 0.001) and LGA (p = 0.0001) were not increased compared to PDM; More T1DM infants were LGA, 60% vs. 27% in T2DM. In pregnancies with diabetes obesity, excessive weight gain and multiparity were associated with increased risk of LGA neonates, and mother’s type of diabetes and gestational week were associated with higher rates of CS.
Weight gain during pregnancy was lower in pregnancies with diabetes and prevalence of LGA, CS and preterm deliveries in GDM was not elevated, also for T2DM, except increased prevalence of LGA in T1DM that warrants increased clinical attention, indicating that this model of antenatal diabetes care may have contributed to improved maternal and fetal outcomes.",2019 May 7,"Obstetric and perinatal outcomes in pregnancies complicated by diabetes, and control pregnancies, in Kronoberg, Sweden",BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth

Patients with malignancies often have electrolyte abnormalities. We present a case of a patient with central diabetes insipidus secondary to metastatic pituitary invasion complicated by hypercalcemic nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.
We present a case of 40-year-old female with a history of stage IV breast cancer with skeletal and leptomeningeal metastasis, who was admitted with polyuria, polydipsia, and recent onset of confusion. The patient was found to have profound hypernatremia and severe hypercalcemia with normal parathyroid and vitamin D serum levels. Urine studies showed low urine osmolality and high urine output, despite the higher serum osmolality. The patient received 5% dextrose for rehydration, 1 dose of intravenous (IV) pamidronate, 1 dose of IV desmopressin, and 4 days of subcutaneous calcitonin 200 international units Q12H. Initially, her urine output in the hospital was in the range of 350–400 milliliters/hour, which responded well to 1 dose of 1-desamino-8d-arginine vasopressin (DDAVP). In the subsequent days, her confusion resolved with normalization of serum sodium and calcium, but she died because of the extensive malignancy.
Our case emphasizes the importance of identification of causes and complications of electrolyte abnormalities associated with metastatic cancers.

742,PMC8119225,"Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) patients produce large amounts of dilute urine. NDI can be congenital, resulting from mutations in the type-2 vasopressin receptor (V2R), or acquired, resulting from medications such as lithium. There are no effective treatment options for NDI. Activation of PKA is disrupted in both congenital and acquired NDI, resulting in decreased aquaporin-2 phosphorylation and water reabsorption. We show that adenosine monophosphate–activated protein kinase (AMPK) also phosphorylates aquaporin-2. We identified an activator of AMPK, NDI-5033, and we tested its ability to increase urine concentration in animal models of NDI. NDI-5033 increased AMPK phosphorylation by 2.5-fold, confirming activation. It increased urine osmolality in tolvaptan-treated NDI rats by 30%–50% and in V2R-KO mice by 50%. Metformin, another AMPK activator, can cause hypoglycemia, which makes it a risky option for treating NDI patients, especially children. Rats with NDI receiving NDI-5033 showed no hypoglycemia in a calorie-restricted, exercise protocol. Congenital NDI therapy needs to be effective long-term. We administered NDI-5033 for 3 weeks and saw no reduction in efficacy. We conclude that NDI-5033 can improve urine concentration in animals with NDI and holds promise as a potential therapy for patients with congenital NDI due to V2R mutations.",2021 Apr 22,An AMPK activator as a therapeutic option for congenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus,JCI Insight
743,PMC8369723,"Diabetes mellitus is a serious metabolic disorder which becomes common in middle and low incomes countries since few decades. Microvascular complications include retinopathy, neuropathy and nephropathy all of which can lead to disability, dependency, accelerate their morbidity, and mortality. In Ethiopia, there is paucity data regarding this topic. Hence, this study aimed to assess prevalence of microvascular complications and its predictors among type 2 diabetes mellitus patients.
Cross-sectional study was conducted from February to March 2020 at Dessie town hospitals. We used simple random sampling to recruit study participants and pre-tested interviewer administered questionnaire to collect the data. Data was entered into Epi-Data 3.1 and exported to SPSS-23 for analysis. Binary logistic regression was done to select potential variables to be adjusted at p ≤ 0.25. After running multivariable regression, variables with a p-value ≤ 0.05 were declared as statistically significant.
Three hundred and thirty-five type 2 DM patients participated in the study, of which 54.6% were males. One hundred and twenty-seven [37.9% (95% CI 32.5%–43.3%)] of diabetes mellitus had at least one microvascular complications. These were retinopathy 24.8%, nephropathy 16.1%, and neuropathy 8.1%.

744,PMC4915559,"The International Diabetes Federation estimates that 415 million adults worldwide now have diabetes and 318 million have impaired glucose tolerance. These numbers are expected to increase to 642 million and 482 million, respectively, by 2040. This burgeoning pandemic places an enormous burden on countries worldwide, particularly resource-poor regions. Numerous landmark trials evaluating both intensive lifestyle modification and pharmacological interventions have persuasively demonstrated that type 2 diabetes can be prevented or its onset can be delayed in high-risk individuals with impaired glucose tolerance. However, key challenges remain, including how to scale up such approaches for widespread translation and implementation, how to select appropriately from various interventions and tailor them for different populations and settings, and how to ensure that preventive interventions yield clinically meaningful, cost-effective outcomes. In June 2015, a Diabetes Care Editors’ Expert Forum convened to discuss these issues. This article, an outgrowth of the forum, begins with a summary of seminal prevention trials, followed by a discussion of considerations for selecting appropriate populations for intervention and the clinical implications of the various diagnostic criteria for prediabetes. The authors outline knowledge gaps in need of elucidation and explore a possible new avenue for securing regulatory approval of a prevention-related indication for metformin, as well as specific considerations for future pharmacological interventions to delay the onset of type 2 diabetes.

745,PMC8701487,"Worldwide, gestational diabetes affects 2–25% of pregnancies. Due to related disturbances of the maternal metabolism during the periconceptional period and pregnancy, children bear an increased risk for future diseases. It is well known that an aberrant intrauterine environment caused by elevated maternal glucose levels is related to elevated risks for increased birth weights and metabolic disorders in later life, such as obesity or type 2 diabetes. The complexity of disturbances induced by maternal diabetes, with multiple underlying mechanisms, makes early diagnosis or prevention a challenging task. Omics technologies allowing holistic quantification of several classes of molecules from biological fluids, cells, or tissues are powerful tools to systematically investigate the effects of maternal diabetes on the offspring in an unbiased manner. Differentially abundant molecules or distinct molecular profiles may serve as diagnostic biomarkers, which may also support the development of preventive and therapeutic strategies. In this review, we summarize key findings from state-of-the-art Omics studies addressing the impact of maternal diabetes on offspring health.",2021 Dec 15,Developmental Effects of (Pre-)Gestational Diabetes on Offspring: Systematic Screening Using Omics Approaches,Genes
746,PMC8684465,"Hypophysitis is defined as inflammation of the pituitary gland that is primary or secondary to a local or systemic process. Differential diagnosis is broad (including primary tumors, metastases, and lympho-proliferative diseases) and multifaceted. Patients with hypophysitis typically present with headaches, some degree of anterior and/or posterior pituitary dysfunction, and enlargement of pituitary gland and/or stalk, as determined by imaging. Most hypophysitis causes are autoimmune, but other etiologies include inflammation secondary to sellar tumors or cysts, systemic diseases, and infection or drug-induced causes. Novel pathologies such as immunoglobulin G4-related hypophysitis, immunotherapy-induced hypophysitis, and paraneoplastic pituitary-directed autoimmunity are also included in a growing spectrum of this rare pituitary disease. Typical magnetic resonance imaging reveals stalk thickening and homogenous enlargement of the pituitary gland; however, imaging is not always specific. Diagnosis can be challenging, and ultimately, only a pituitary biopsy can confirm hypophysitis type and rule out other etiologies. A presumptive diagnosis can be made often without biopsy. Detailed history and clinical examination are essential, notably for signs of underlying etiology with systemic manifestations. Hormone replacement and, in selected cases, careful observation is advised with imaging follow-up. High-dose glucocorticoids are initiated mainly to help reduce mass effect. A response may be observed in all auto-immune etiologies, as well as in lymphoproliferative diseases, and, as such, should not be used for differential diagnosis. Surgery may be necessary in some cases to relieve mass effect and allow a definite diagnosis. Immunosuppressive therapy and radiation are sometimes also necessary in resistant cases.",2021 Sep 16,"Hypophysitis, the Growing Spectrum of a Rare Pituitary Disease",The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism

An emerging cause of transient diabetes insipidus is through the use and withdrawal of vasopressin. Here, we present a case of transient CDI that developed during an intensive care unit admission.
A Caucasian woman presented to the emergency room after a fall. On presentation, the patient was found to be in shock and was admitted to the surgical intensive care unit. Treatment with norepinephrine, vasopressin, and intravenous antibiotics was started. On day 5 of hospitalization, the patient’s blood pressure improved, and treatment with vasopressin was discontinued. On day 6 of hospitalization, the patient’s urine output increased and serum sodium level was elevated. Despite increasing free water, serum sodium level continued to rise. Endocrinology division was consulted, and urine osmolality was consistent with diabetes insipidus (DI). Urine osmolality at 30 and 60 minutes after desmopressin (1-desamino-8-d-arginine vasopressin [DDAVP]) was consistent with CDI. Magnetic resonance imaging scan of the brain showed no intracranial pathology. Over the next day with scheduled DDAVP, serum sodium level decreased below the goal level. Thus, DDAVP was held. Prior to discharge, the patient did not require additional DDAVP. She was discharged without DDAVP.
Our patient’s workup was initially consistent with CDI. However, the DI resolved spontaneously, supporting transient CDI secondary to vasopressin infusion. Different theories have emerged about why this occurs with vasopressin. However, further investigation is needed.
Although rare, it is important to monitor for DI after vasopressin infusion and have a suspicion that DI may be transient in the absence of a clear cause.",2021 Jun 16,Transient Central Diabetes Insipidus Occurring After Vasopressin Infusion,AACE Clinical Case Reports
748,PMC5801254,"Previous studies have shown that serum bilirubin concentration is inversely associated with the risk of cardiovascular disease. The relationship between serum bilirubin concentration and left ventricular geometry, however, has not been investigated in patients with diabetes mellitus.
In this cohort study, 158 asymptomatic patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus without overt heart disease were enrolled. Left ventricular structure and function were assessed using echocardiography. Serum bilirubin concentration, glycemic control, lipid profile, and other clinical characteristics were evaluated, and their association with left ventricular geometry was determined. Patients with New York Heart Association Functional Classification greater than I, left ventricular ejection fraction less than 50%, history of coronary artery disease, severe valvulopathy, chronic atrial fibrillation, or creatinine clearance less than 30 ml/min, and those receiving insulin treatment, were excluded.
Univariate analyses showed that relative wall thickness (RWT) was significantly correlated with diastolic blood pressure (P = 0.003), HbA1c (P = 0.024), total cholesterol (P = 0.043), urinary albumin (P = 0.023), and serum bilirubin concentration (P = 0.009). There was no association between left ventricular mass index and serum bilirubin concentration. Multivariate linear regression analysis showed that log RWT was positively correlated with diastolic blood pressure (P = 0.010) and that log RWT was inversely correlated with log bilirubin (P = 0.003). In addition, the patients with bilirubin less than 0.8 mg/dl had a higher prevalence of concentric left ventricular remodeling compared with those with bilirubin 0.8 mg/dl or more.

749,PMC7432193,"Objective: The peer interaction–based online model has been influential in the recent development of diabetes management. This model “extends and innovates” the traditional mode of doctor–patient guidance, transforming it into a mode in which both doctor–patient guidance and patient–patient interaction coexist; this new mode has the added advantage of offering “extended continual intervention.” This study contributes to research on extending diabetes management models by investigating how patients with diabetes or prediabetes interact in online health communities, focusing on the interrelationship between self-efficacy characteristics and online participation during patient–patient interactions. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, participants with diabetes of various severities completed an electronic questionnaire, which was formulated with a revised classical scale. The questionnaire was disseminated through diabetes online health communities. Its content covered the respondent’s general condition, self-evaluation of their self-efficacy, and participation in online health communities, specifically with respect to factors such as the time spent in online information each day, the number of groups joined, and the extent of interaction in diabetes online health communities, etc. The main observation indicators were the participants’ self-efficacy, their extent of online participation, and the characteristics of online health communities. Descriptive statistics, chi-square test, linear trend estimation, and ordinal logistic regression were used to explore the relationship between the three indicators. Results: The self-efficacy scores (  ± s) were 51.9 ± 9.12, and 59.1% of interviewed participants had self-efficacy scores greater than the mean. Overall, most participants (96%) considered online diabetes social platforms to be helpful. Groups differed with respect to interaction mode, which indicated that people with high self-efficacy tend to employ various modes of interaction. Participants with high self-efficacy were also more likely to live in cities (p < 0.05) and be married (p < 0.05) and tended to spend more time paying attention to group information (p < 0.05), spend more time viewing group information (p < 0.05), and have a greater degree of interaction with group members (p < 0.05). Information sources for the different grades of participants was primarily obtained from social media. Conclusion: Among people with diabetes, the frequency and intensity of online interaction might positively affect self-efficacy and, by implication, diabetes self-management. Diabetics with high self-efficacy also tend to have positive online interaction and adopt different ways of interaction. In addition, the diabetes information sources of the respondents mainly come from social networks, most of the respondents think that online social networking sites have a positive impact on diabetes self-management, which shows that social network plays an important role in diabetes information source of diabetics. However, the design of online health communities has room for improvement, specifically with respect to the provision of information that patients require. As an interesting side note, among people with diabetes or prediabetes, those who lived in urban area and were married, those who paid more attention to group information, and those who actively participated in interactions tended to have relatively high self-efficacy. The results suggest that people with diabetes have higher-quality self-care when they engage in online health community interactions; such benefits cannot be obtained from treatment in a hospital. In general, enhanced self-efficacy in people with diabetes enables them to more readily acquire diabetes-related knowledge. Online interaction with diabetics, who has the same experience, can not only get more information, but also have a sense of identity and belonging, which enhances self-efficacy and further urges them to actively participate in online interaction. Therefore, online health communities are an important supplement to the clinical treatment of diabetes mellitus and clinicians can take advantage of the educational function of online diabetes groups in their provision of tailored diabetes interventions and take into account the factors that affect the self-efficacy of diabetics (including the frequency and intensity of online interaction, age, marital status, residential area, etc.), to provide tailored diabetes interventions for diabetics. Such a use of online diabetes groups can strengthen diabetes self-management.",2020 Jul 26,Interrelationship between Interpersonal Interaction Intensity and Health Self-Efficacy in People with Diabetes or Prediabetes on Online Diabetes Social Platforms: An In-Depth Survey in China,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health
750,PMC7408848,"Diabetes mellitus is a risk factor for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. However, how the clinical characteristics of MCI patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus are linked to sarcopenia and/or its criteria remain to be elucidated. Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were categorized into the MCI group for MoCA-J (the Japanese version of the Montreal cognitive assessment) score <26, and into the non-MCI group for MoCA-J ≥26. Sarcopenia was defined by a low skeletal mass index along with low muscle strength (handgrip strength) or low physical performance (walking speed <1.0 m/s). Univariate and multivariate-adjusted odds ratio models were used to determine the independent contributors for MoCA-J <26. Among 438 participants, 221 (50.5%) and 217 (49.5%) comprised the non-MCI and MCI groups, respectively. In the MCI group, age (61 ± 12 vs. 71 ± 10 years, p < 0.01) and duration of diabetes mellitus (14 ± 9 vs. 17 ± 9 years, p < 0.01) were higher than those in the non-MCI group. Patients in the MCI group exhibited lower hand grip strength, walking speed, and skeletal mass index, but higher prevalence of sarcopenia. Only walking speed (rather than muscle loss or muscle weakness) was found to be an independent determinant of MCI after adjusting for multiple factors, such as age, gender, body mass index (BMI), duration of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, smoking, drinking, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), HbA1c, and history of coronary heart diseases and stroke. In subgroup analysis, a group consisting of male patients aged ≥65 years, with BMI <25, showed a significant OR for walking speed. This study showed that slow walking speed is a sole determinant criterion of sarcopenia of MCI in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

752,PMC8620339,"Diabetes mellitus (DM), one of the metabolic diseases which is characterized by sustained hyperglycemia, is a life-threatening disease. The global prevalence of DM is on the rise, mainly in low- and middle-income countries. Diabetes is a major cause of blindness, heart attacks, kidney failure, stroke, and lower limb amputation. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a form of diabetes that is characterized by high blood sugar and insulin resistance. T2DM can be prevented or delayed by a healthy diet, regular physical activity, maintaining normal body weight, and avoiding alcohol and tobacco use. Ethanol and its metabolites can cause differentiation defects in stem cells and promote inflammatory injury and carcinogenesis in several tissues. Recent studies have suggested that diabetes can be treated, and its consequences can be avoided or delayed with proper management. DM has a greater risk for several cancers, such as breast, colorectal, endometrial, pancreatic, gallbladder, renal, and liver cancer. The incidence of cancer is significantly higher in patients with DM than in those without DM. In addition to DM, alcohol abuse is also a risk factor for many cancers. We present a review of the recent studies investigating the association of both DM and alcohol abuse with cancer incidence.",2021 Nov 8,Association of Diabetes Mellitus and Alcohol Abuse with Cancer: Molecular Mechanisms and Clinical Significance,Cells

Patients with established coronary artery disease or peripheral artery disease often have diabetes mellitus. These patients are at high risk of future vascular events.
In a prespecified analysis of the COMPASS trial (Cardiovascular Outcomes for People Using Anticoagulation Strategies), we compared the effects of rivaroxaban (2.5 mg twice daily) plus aspirin (100 mg daily) versus placebo plus aspirin in patients with diabetes mellitus versus without diabetes mellitus in preventing major vascular events. The primary efficacy end point was the composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke. Secondary end points included all-cause mortality and all major vascular events (cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or major adverse limb events, including amputation). The primary safety end point was a modification of the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis criteria for major bleeding.
There were 10 341 patients with diabetes mellitus and 17 054 without diabetes mellitus in the overall trial. A consistent and similar relative risk reduction was seen for benefit of rivaroxaban plus aspirin (n=9152) versus placebo plus aspirin (n=9126) in patients both with (n=6922) and without (n=11 356) diabetes mellitus for the primary efficacy end point (hazard ratio, 0.74, P=0.002; and hazard ratio, 0.77, P=0.005, respectively, Pinteraction=0.77) and all-cause mortality (hazard ratio, 0.81, P=0.05; and hazard ratio, 0.84, P=0.09, respectively; Pinteraction=0.82). However, although the absolute risk reductions appeared numerically larger in patients with versus without diabetes mellitus, both subgroups derived similar benefit (2.3% versus 1.4% for the primary efficacy end point at 3 years, Gail-Simon qualitative Pinteraction<0.0001; 1.9% versus 0.6% for all-cause mortality, Pinteraction=0.02; 2.7% versus 1.7% for major vascular events, Pinteraction<0.0001). Because the bleeding hazards were similar among patients with and without diabetes mellitus, the prespecified net benefit for rivaroxaban appeared particularly favorable in the patients with diabetes mellitus (2.7% versus 1.0%; Gail-Simon qualitative Pinteraction=0.001).
In stable atherosclerosis, the combination of aspirin plus rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily provided a similar relative degree of benefit on coronary, cerebrovascular, and peripheral end points in patients with and without diabetes mellitus. Given their higher baseline risk, the absolute benefits appeared larger in those with diabetes mellitus, including a 3-fold greater reduction in all-cause mortality.

754,PMC2518337,"OBJECTIVE—Wolfram syndrome is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by diabetes insipidus, diabetes (nonautoimmune), optic atrophy, and deafness (a set of conditions referred to as DIDMOAD). The WFS1 gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 4. Wolfram syndrome prevalence is 1 in 770,000 live births, with a 1 in 354 carrier frequency.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS—We evaluated six Italian children from five unrelated families. Genetic analysis for Wolfram syndrome was performed by PCR amplification and direct sequencing.
RESULTS—Mutation screening revealed five distinct variants, one novel mutation (c.1346C>T; p.T449I) and four previously described, all located in exon 8.
CONCLUSIONS—Phenotype-genotype correlation is difficult, and the same mutation gives very different phenotypes. Severely inactivating mutations result in a more severe phenotype than mildly inactivating ones.

755,PMC3436703,"Most cases of neonatal central diabetes insipidus are caused by an injury, which often results in other handicaps in the patient. The infant’s prognosis will be determined by his or her own early age and disability as well as by the physician’s skill. However, the rarity of this condition prevents the acquisition of personal experience dealing with it.
 A neonatal hemorrhagic stroke, caused by an aortic coarctation, caused right lower limb paresis, swallowing disability, and central diabetes insipidus in a term infant. The scant oral intake, as a consequence of his disability, caused progressive undernutrition which closed a vicious circle, delaying his development and his ability to overcome the swallowing handicap. On the other hand, nasal desmopressin absorption was blocked by several common colds, resulting in brain bleeding because of severe dehydration. This even greater brain damage hampered the improvement of swallowing, closing a second harmful circle. Moreover, a devastating central myelinolysis with quadriplegia, caused by an uncontrolled intravenous infusion, consummated a pernicious sequence, possibly unreported.
The child’s overall development advanced rapidly when his nutrition was improved by gastrostomy: This was a key effect of nutrition on his highly sensitive neurodevelopment. Besides, this case shows potential risks related to intranasal desmopressin treatment in young children.",2012 May 28,Rare neonatal diabetes insipidus and associated late risks: Case report,BMC Pediatrics
756,PMC6903756,"Previous studies found inconsistent results on the relationship between diabetes mellitus and concentrations of omentin-1. This study performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize previous findings on this relationship.
Studies related to this outcome were obtained using a systematic search in the electronic databases of Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase, SCOPUS, Google Scholar, gray literature and Web of Science in September 2019. The random effects model was used to measure the strength of the association between diabetes mellitus and concentrations of omentin-1, using standardized mean difference.
Forty-two eligible studies were included in the final meta-analysis. There was no significant difference in omentin-1 concentration between patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and the controls. On the other hand, lower concentration levels of omentin-1 were observed in patients with gestational diabetes mellitus (standardized mean difference:-0.44, 95% confidence interval:-0.76; -0.12, p = 0.007), or type 2 diabetes mellitus (standardized mean difference: -1.74, 95% confidence interval: -2.31; -1.16, p< 0.001) than in the controls.

757,PMC6848627,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) and thyroid dysfunction (TD) often tend to coexist in patients. Both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism are more common in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients than in their nondiabetic counterparts. Current guidelines are neither clear nor specific about the frequency of thyroid function monitoring in T2DM patients. Circulating thyroid hormones affect several different organs and cells, have a major impact on glucose, lipid, and protein metabolism, and can worsen glycaemic control in T2DM. Hyperthyroidism and thyrotoxicosis can worsen subclinical DM and cause hyperglycaemia in T2DM patients, increasing the risk of diabetic complications. T2DM reduces thyroid-stimulating hormone levels and impairs the conversion of thyroxine (T4) to triiodothyronine (T3) in the peripheral tissues. Poorly managed T2DM can lead to insulin resistance and hyperinsulinaemia, which causes thyroid tissue proliferation and increases nodule formation and goitre size. In addition, while metformin can be beneficial in both T2DM and TD patients, other antidiabetics such as sulfonylureas, pioglitazone, and thiazolidinediones can negatively impact TD. Antithyroid drugs such as methimazole can impair glycaemic control in T2DM patients. Thyrovigilance in T2DM patients and diabetovigilance in TD patients may therefore be necessary to facilitate individualized care and management.

759,PMC8582289,"Acquired forms of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) include lithium (Li)‐induced and hypokalemia‐induced NDI. Both forms are associated with AQP2 downregulation and collecting duct (CD) cellular remodeling. Statins are cholesterol‐lowering drugs appearing to increase AQP2 membrane‐translocation and improve urine concentration in other NDI models. We have investigated if statins are able to prevent or rescue the Li‐induced changes in mice and in a mouse cortical CD cell line (mCCDc1l). Biotinylation assays showed that acute (1hr) atorvastatin, simvastatin, or fluvastatin increased AQP2 membrane accumulation in mCCDc1l cells showing that the cell line responds to acute statin treatment. To see whether chronic statin treatment abolish the Li effects, mCCDc1l cells were treated with 48 h Li, combined Li/atorvastatin or combined Li/simvastatin. Li reduced AQP2, but combined Li/atorvastatin or Li/simvastatin did not prevent AQP2 downregulation. In mice, chronic (21 days) Li increased urine output and reduced urine osmolality, but combined Li/atorvastatin did not prevent these effects. In inner medulla (IM), Li reduced total AQP2 and increased pS261‐AQP2. Combined Li/atorvastatin did not abolish these changes. Atorvastatin did not prevent a Li‐induced increase in intercalated cells and proliferation in IM. In mice with already established NDI, atorvastatin had no effect on the Li‐induced changes either. Mice subjected to 14 days of potassium‐deficient diet developed polyuria and AQP2 downregulation in IM. Co‐treatment with atorvastatin did not prevent this. In conclusion, atorvastatin does not appear to be able to prevent or rescue Li‐NDI or to prevent hypokalemic‐induced NDI.

760,PMC8206553,"A mechanistic understanding of the genetic basis of complex diseases such as diabetes mellitus remain elusive due in large part to the activity of genetic disease modifiers that impact the penetrance and/or presentation of disease phenotypes. In the face of such complexity, rare forms of diabetes that result from single-gene mutations (monogenic diabetes) can be used to model the contribution of individual genetic factors to pancreatic β-cell dysfunction and the breakdown of glucose homeostasis. Here we review the contribution of protein coding and non-protein coding genetic disease modifiers to the pathogenesis of diabetes subtypes, as well as how recent technological advances in the generation, differentiation, and genome editing of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC) enable the development of cell-based disease models.

761,PMC6308908,"The deficit of Glyoxalase I (Glo1) and the subsequent increase in methylglyoxal (MG) has been reported to be one the five mechanisms by which hyperglycemia causes diabetic late complications. Aldo-keto reductases (AKR) have been shown to metabolize MG; however, the relative contribution of this superfamily to the detoxification of MG in vivo, particularly within the diabetic state, remains unknown.
CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing was used to generate a Glo1 knock-out (Glo1−/−) mouse line. Streptozotocin was then applied to investigate metabolic changes under hyperglycemic conditions.
Glo1−/− mice were viable and showed no elevated MG or MG-H1 levels under hyperglycemic conditions. It was subsequently found that the enzymatic efficiency of various oxidoreductases in the liver and kidney towards MG were increased in the Glo1−/− mice. The functional relevance of this was supported by the altered distribution of alternative detoxification products. Furthermore, it was shown that MG-dependent AKR activity is a potentially clinical relevant pathway in human patients suffering from diabetes.
These data suggest that in the absence of GLO1, AKR can effectively compensate to prevent the accumulation of MG. The combination of metabolic, enzymatic, and genetic factors, therefore, may provide a better means of identifying patients who are at risk for the development of late complications caused by elevated levels of MG.",2018 Sep 19,Compensatory mechanisms for methylglyoxal detoxification in experimental & clinical diabetes,Molecular Metabolism

769,PMC6598864,"Diabetes insipidus (DI), be it from central or nephrogenic origin, must be differentiated from secondary forms of hypotonic polyuria such as primary polydipsia. Differentiation is crucial since wrong treatment can have deleterious consequences. Since decades, the gold standard for differentiation has been the water deprivation test, which has limitations leading to an overall unsatisfying diagnostic accuracy. Furthermore, it is cumbersome for patients with a long test duration. Clinical signs and symptoms and MRI characteristics overlap between patients with DI and primary polydipsia. The direct test including vasopressin (AVP) measurement upon osmotic stimulation was meant to overcome these limitations, but failed to enter clinical practice mainly due to technical constraints of the AVP assay. Copeptin is secreted in equimolar amount to AVP but can easily be measured with a sandwich immunoassay. A high correlation between copeptin and AVP has been shown. Accordingly, copeptin mirrors the amount of AVP in the circulation and has led to a ‘revival’ of the direct test in the differential diagnosis of DI. We have shown that a baseline copeptin, without prior thirsting, unequivocally identifies patients with nephrogenic DI. In contrast, for the differentiation between central DI and primary polydipsia, a stimulated copeptin level of 4.9 pmol/L upon hypertonic saline infusion differentiates these two entities with a high diagnostic accuracy and is superior to the water deprivation test. Close sodium monitoring during the test is a prerequisite.

770,PMC6020390,"Wolfram syndrome (WFS) is a rare autosomal recessive disease with clinical manifestations of diabetes mellitus (DM), diabetes insipidus (DI), optic nerve atrophy (OA) and sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). Although SNHL is a key symptom of WFS, there is limited information on its natural history using standardized measures. Such information is important for clinical care and determining its use as an outcome measure in clinical trials.
Standardized audiologic measures, including pure-tone testing, tympanometry, speech perception, and the unaided Speech Intelligibility Index (SII) were assessed in patients with confirmed WFS annually. Mixed model analyses were used to examine main effects of age, time or interactions for pure tone average (PTA), high frequency average (HFA) and SII.
Forty WFS patients were evaluated between 1 and 6 times. Mean age at initial enrollment was 13.5 years (SD = 5.6). Patients were classified as having normal hearing (n = 10), mild-to-severe (n = 24) or profound SNHL (n = 6). Mean age of diagnosis for SNHL was 8.3 years (SD = 5.1) with 75% prevalence. HFA worsened over time for both ears, and SII worsened over time in the worse ear, with greater decline in both measures in younger patients. Average estimated change over 1 year for all measures was in the subclinical range and power analyses suggest that 100 patients would be needed per group (treatment vs. placebo) to detect a 60% reduction in annual change of HFA over 3 years. If trials focused on just those patients with SNHL, power estimates suggest 55 patients per group would be sufficient.
Most patients had a slow progressive SNHL emerging in late childhood. Change over time with standard audiologic tests (HFA, SII) was small and would not be detectable for at least 2 years in an individual. Relatively large sample sizes would be necessary to detect significant impact on hearing progression in a clinical trial. Hearing function should be monitored clinically in WFS to provide appropriate intervention. Because SNHL can occur very early in WFS, audiologists and otolaryngologists should be aware of and refer for later emerging symptoms.

This definition includes cases of undiagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) identified early in pregnancy and true GDM which develops later. GDM constitutes a greater impact on diabetes epidemic as it carries a major risk of developing T2DM to the mother and foetus later in life.

These might result in later development of cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome. The understanding of the different risk factors, the pathophysiological mechanisms and the genetic factors of GDM, will help us to identify the women at risk, to develop effective preventive measures and to provide adequate management of the disease. Clinical trials have shown that T2DM can be prevented in women with prior GDM, by intensive lifestyle modification and by using pioglitazone and metformin.

774,PMC8124476,"Wolfram syndrome is a rare neurodegenerative disorder that is typically characterized by diabetes mellitus and optic atrophy. Other common features are diabetes insipidus and hearing loss, but additional less-frequent findings may also be present. The phenotype spectrum is quite wide, and penetrance may be incomplete. The syndrome is progressive, and thus, the clinical picture may change during follow-up. Currently, two different subtypes of this syndrome have been described, and they are associated with two different disease-genes, wolframin (WFS1) and CISD2. These genes encode a transmembrane protein and an endoplasmic reticulum intermembrane protein, respectively. These genes are detected in different organs and account for the pleiotropic features of this syndrome. In this review, we describe the phenotypes of both syndromes and discuss the most pertinent literature about the genotype–phenotype correlation. The clinical presentation of Wolfram syndrome type 1 suggests that the pathogenic variant does not predict the phenotype. There are few papers on Wolfram syndrome type 2 and, thus, predicting the phenotype on the basis of genotype is not yet supported. We also discuss the most pertinent approach to gene analysis.",2021 Apr 30,Clinical Spectrum Associated with Wolfram Syndrome Type 1 and Type 2: A Review on Genotype–Phenotype Correlations,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health
775,PMC4493400,"Congenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) is a conformation disease resulting from protein misfolding. Ninety percent of mutations result from the inactivating mutations of the arginine vasopressin receptor 2 (AVPR2) gene transmitted in an X-linked fashion, blocking the response to vasopressin, resulting in the inability to concentrate urine. Clinical features include polyuria, polydispsia, dehydration, and hypernatremia. They are generally more severely in affected males but present variably in females due to skewed inactivation of the X chromosome. We describe a case of a 40-year-old woman with a history of Type 2 diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and obesity, who presents with debilitating polyuria since the age of 5 with no clear diagnosis. Interestingly, her son was diagnosed with NDI. Genetic testing revealed that she was heterozygous for the Val88Met mutation in the AVPR2 gene while her son was hemizygous for the same. The patient has since been successfully treated with diuretics and a low solute diet. We highlight that although X-linked NDI patients are mostly males, it should be considered in symptomatic females to prevent delays in the diagnosis. Conformational diseases such as NDI are presently the subject of research using pharmacological chaperones to restore proper receptor membrane localization and function.",2015 Jul 7,A Rare Case of Congenital Diabetes Insipidus,Frontiers in Medicine
776,PMC7682679,"We present a case of central diabetes insipidus (DI) secondary to neurosarcoidosis. The path to final diagnosis was challenging. Along with reporting the case, we review the available medical literature relating to neurosarcoidosis and central diabetes insipidus in this case report. Patient is a 56-year-old female with notable history of rheumatoid arthritis, anxiety, asthma, hypertension, spinal stenosis, and seizures of unknown etiology who presented to the emergency department for worsening headache for one week. She also endorsed decreased vision, photophobia, nausea, vomiting, gait abnormality, polyuria, and polydipsia over the past three months. Physical exam and neurological exam were unremarkable. Labs on presentation were notable for hypernatremia, increased serum osmolality and urine output of 5 L/day. Given her persistent headache and history of seizure, she underwent a CT head without contrast which showed a posterior suprasellar soft tissue fullness measuring 6 mm in the hypothalamic region. She then had additional imaging studies of the brain including MRI brain w/wo contrast and MRI pituitary w/wo contrast. MRI of the brain showed enlarged optic chiasm with increased T2 signal involving the proximal optic nerves and bilateral optic tracts, no brain parenchymal lesions to suggest multiple sclerosis. MRI of the pituitary w/wo contrast showed suprasellar mass arising from either the hypothalamus or less likely the chiasm which was concerning for high-grade glioma initially. Lumbar puncture was done that showed lymphocytic pleocytosis. Patient underwent right supraorbital craniotomy for biopsy of the suprasellar lesion. Surgical pathology showed noncaseating granulomatous inflammation most consistent with neuro-sarcoidosis. The diagnosis of neurosarcoidosis was made and patient was started on high dose steroids. Although central DI can be seen as a post-op complication, in our case, based on the clinical presentation, labs and imaging, there was concern of central DI on initial presentation. Patient was started on desmopressin 50 mg twice a day which resulted in marked improvement in urine output, serum sodium, and osmolality. Although it is rare to have nervous system involvement of sarcoidosis, symptoms of central diabetes insipidus could represent the first clinical manifestations of neurosarcoidosis. Proper treatment should be initiated in a timely fashion to avoid complications such as hydrocephalus.",2020 Oct 23,A Case of Central Diabetes Insipidus Secondary to Neurosarcoidosis,Cureus
777,PMC5372084,"We evaluated the effectiveness of European chronic care programmes for type 2 diabetes mellitus (characterised by integrative care and a multicomponent framework for enhancing healthcare delivery), compared with usual diabetes care.
Systematic review and meta-analysis.
MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL and CINAHL from January 2000 to July 2015.
Randomised controlled trials focussing on (1) adults with type 2 diabetes, (2) multifaceted diabetes care interventions specifically designed for type 2 diabetes and delivered in primary or secondary care, targeting patient, physician and healthcare organisation and (3) usual diabetes care as the control intervention.
Study characteristics, characteristics of the intervention, data on baseline demographics and changes in patient outcomes.
Weighted mean differences in change in HbA1c and total cholesterol levels between intervention and control patients (95% CI) were estimated using a random-effects model.
Eight cluster randomised controlled trials were identified for inclusion (9529 patients). One year of multifaceted care improved HbA1c levels in patients with screen-detected and newly diagnosed diabetes, but not in patients with prevalent diabetes, compared to usual diabetes care. Across all seven included trials, the weighted mean difference in HbA1c change was −0.07% (95% CI −0.10 to −0.04) (−0.8 mmol/mol (95% CI −1.1 to −0.4)); I2=21%. The findings for total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and blood pressure were similar to HbA1c, albeit statistical heterogeneity between studies was considerably larger. Compared to usual care, multifaceted care did not significantly change quality of life of the diabetes patient. Finally, measured for screen-detected diabetes only, the risk of macrovascular and mircovascular complications at follow-up was not significantly different between intervention and control patients.
Effects of European multifaceted diabetes care patient outcomes are only small.

778,PMC8409838,"The convergence of tuberculosis (TB) and diabetes mellitus (DM) is a new challenge in Asia as a result of the rising prevalence of diabetes mellitus with higher TB infection rates, and also because diabetes mellitus itself enhances TB disease activity and consequently the spread of TB. We aimed to address the risk presented by diabetes mellitus for TB infection.
Patients with diabetes mellitus were retrospectively recruited. The baseline assessments included age, sex, body mass index, fasting blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin, urine albumin‐to‐creatinine ratio and estimated glomerular filtration rate. TB was determined by meeting the international classification of disease, for TB diagnosis and receiving anti‐TB treatment for at least 2 months.
In total, 9,750 individuals with diabetes mellitus were recruited. The event rate of TB was 47 (0.48%). Younger age, lower proportion of men, higher fasting blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin values, and better renal function (estimated glomerular filtration rate and urine albumin‐to‐creatinine ratio) were observed in the metformin‐exposed groups. Old age and male sex were associated with higher TB infection risk on multivariate analysis. Metformin users had a significantly lower risk for TB infection, whereas insulin users had a higher risk for TB infection. However, glycemic status had no effect on TB infection risk.
This study provides clinical evidence from a survey of TB in individuals with diabetes mellitus. Old age, male sex and insulin use were risk factors for TB infection. Metformin remains the first choice of treatment for diabetes mellitus and has a potential protective effect against TB infection.",2021 Mar 3,Metformin as a potential protective therapy against tuberculosis in patients with diabetes mellitus: A retrospective cohort study in a single teaching hospital,Journal of Diabetes Investigation
779,PMC7784162,"This study assessed whether short message service (SMS) reminders would improve follow-up rate among gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) patients by 12 weeks postpartum.
In this single-center, single-blind randomized controlled trial, we assigned 308 patients with GDM to either of 2 arms, usual care alone versus usual care with SMS reminders. In the usual care group, 154 patients received a 10-minute short lecture on GDM and a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) request prior to discharge. In the SMS group, 154 patients received twice a week SMS reminders at 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 10 weeks after delivery in addition to usual care. The primary outcome was clinic visit within 6 to 12 weeks postpartum with a 75 g OGTT result.
In our population, the overall follow-up rate was 19.8% (61/308). Follow up rates were 20.1% (31/154) for the usual care group and 19.5% (30/154) for the SMS. The addition of SMS reminders was not associated with an increase in follow-up rate at 12 weeks postpartum (adjusted RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.63-1.52; p=0.932). The use of insulin or metformin for GDM control was associated with increased follow-up (adjusted RR 1.92, 95% CI 1.20-3.07; p=0.006).

780,PMC3551701,"Classically characterized by early onset insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy, deafness, diabetes insipidus, and neurological abnormalities, Wolfram syndrome (WFS) is also associated with atypical brainstem and cerebellar findings in the first decade of life. As such, we hypothesized that gait differences between individuals with WFS and typically developing (TD) individuals may be detectable across the course of the disease.
Gait was assessed for 13 individuals with WFS (min 6.4 yrs, max 25.8 yrs) and 29 age-matched, typically developing individuals (min 5.6 yrs, max 28.5 yrs) using a GAITRite ® walkway system. Velocity, cadence, step length, base of support and double support time were compared between groups.
Across all tasks, individuals with WFS walked slower (p = 0.03), took shorter (p ≤ 0.001) and wider (p ≤ 0.001) steps and spent a greater proportion of the gait cycle in double support (p = 0.03) compared to TD individuals. Cadence did not differ between groups (p = 0.62). Across all tasks, age was significantly correlated with cadence and double support time in the TD group but only double support time was correlated with age in the WFS group and only during preferred pace forward (rs= 0.564, p = 0.045) and dual task forward walking (rs= 0.720, p = 0.006) tasks. Individuals with WFS also had a greater number of missteps during tandem walking (p ≤ 0.001). Within the WFS group, spatiotemporal measures of gait did not correlate with measures of visual acuity. Balance measures negatively correlated with normalized gait velocity during fast forward walking (rs = −0.59, p = 0.03) and percent of gait cycle in double support during backward walking (rs = −0.64, p = 0.03).
Quantifiable gait impairments can be detected in individuals with WFS earlier than previous clinical observations suggested. These impairments are not fully accounted for by the visual or balance deficits associated with WFS, and may be a reflection of early cerebellar and/or brainstem abnormalities. Effective patient-centered treatment paradigms could benefit from a more complete understanding of the progression of motor and other neurological symptom presentation in individuals with WFS.",2012 Dec 8,Early presentation of gait impairment in Wolfram Syndrome,Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases
781,PMC2442085,"It has been reported that various types of axonal injury of hypothalamo-neurohypophyseal tract can result in degeneration of the magnocellular neurons (MCNs) in hypothalamus and development of central diabetes insipidus (CDI). However, the mechanism of the degeneration and death of MCNs after hypophysectomy in vivo is still unclear. This present study was aimed to disclose it and to figure out the dynamic change of central diabetes insipidus after hypophysectomy.
The analysis on the dynamic change of daily water consumption (DWC), daily urine volume(DUV), specific gravity of urine(USG) and plasma vasopressin concentration showed that the change pattern of them was triphasic and neuron counting showed that the degeneration of vasopressin neurons began at 10 d, aggravated at 20 d and then stabilized at 30 d after hypophysectomy. There was marked upregulation of cleaved Caspase-3 expression of vasopressin neurons in hypophysectomy rats. A ""ladder"" pattern of migration of DNA internucleosomal fragments was detected and apoptotic ultrastructure was found in these neurons. There was time correlation among the occurrence of diabetes insipidus, the changes of plasma vasopressin concentration and the degeneration of vasopressin neurons after hypophysectomy.
This study firstly demonstrated that apoptosis was involved in degeneration of supraoptic vasopressin neurons after hypophysectomy in vivo and development of CDI. Our study on time course and correlations among water metabolism, degeneration and apoptosis of vasopressin neurons suggested that there should be an efficient therapeutic window in which irreversible CDI might be prevented by anti-apoptosis.",2008 Jun 25,Apoptosis of supraoptic AVP neurons is involved in the development of central diabetes insipidus after hypophysectomy in rats,BMC Neuroscience

783,PMC4875973,"Central diabetes insipidus is an uncommon feature of malaria. A previously healthy 72-year-old man presented with fever, rigors, and altered mental status after a recent trip to Liberia, a country known for endemic falciparum malaria. Investigations confirmed plasmodium falciparum parasitemia. Within one week after admission, the serum sodium rose to 166 mEq/L and the urine output increased to 7 liters/day. Other labs were notable for a high serum osmolality, low urine osmolality, and low urine specific gravity. The hypernatremia did not respond to hypotonic fluids. Diabetes insipidus was suspected and parenteral desmopressin was started with a prompt decrease in urinary output and improvement in mental status. Additional testing showed normal anterior pituitary hormones. The desmopressin was eventually tapered off with complete resolution of symptoms. Central diabetes insipidus occurred likely as a result of obstruction of the neurohypophyseal microvasculature. Other endocrinopathies that have been reported with malaria include hyponatremia, adrenal insufficiency, hypothyroidism, hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, hyper-, and hypoglycemia, but none manifested in our patient. Though diabetes insipidus is a rare complication of malaria, clinicians need to be aware of this manifestation, as failure to do so may lead to fatality particularly if the patient is dehydrated.",2016 May 8,Cerebral Malaria: An Unusual Cause of Central Diabetes Insipidus,Case Reports in Endocrinology
784,PMC4936996,"Bipolar disorder refers to a group of chronic psychiatric disorders of mood and energy levels. While dramatic psychiatric symptoms dominate the acute phase of the diseases, the chronic course is often determined by an increasing burden of co-occurring medical conditions. High rates of diabetes mellitus in patients with bipolar disorder are particularly striking, yet unexplained. Treatment and lifestyle factors could play a significant role, and some studies also suggest shared pathophysiology and risk factors.
In this systematic literature review, we explored data around the relationship between bipolar disorder and diabetes mellitus in recently published population-based cohort studies with special focus on the elderly.
A systematic search in the PubMed database for the combined terms “bipolar disorder” AND “elderly” AND “diabetes” in papers published between January 2009 and December 2015 revealed 117 publications; 7 studies were large cohort studies, and therefore, were included in our review.
We found that age- and gender- adjusted risk for diabetes mellitus was increased in patients with bipolar disorder and vice versa (odds ratio range between 1.7 and 3.2).
Our results in large population-based cohort studies are consistent with the results of smaller studies and chart reviews. Even though it is likely that heterogeneous risk factors may play a role in diabetes mellitus and in bipolar disorder, growing evidence from cell culture experiments and animal studies suggests shared disease mechanisms. Furthermore, disease-modifying effects of bipolar disorder and diabetes mellitus on each other appear to be substantial, impacting both treatment response and outcomes.
The risk of diabetes mellitus in patients with bipolar disorder is increased. Our findings add to the growing literature on this topic. Increasing evidence for shared disease mechanisms suggests new disease models that could explain the results of our study. A better understanding of the complex relationship between bipolar disorder and diabetes mellitus could lead to novel therapeutic approaches and improved outcomes.",2016 Jul 7,Bipolar disorder and diabetes mellitus: evidence for disease-modifying effects and treatment implications,International Journal of Bipolar Disorders
785,PMC4743391,"Diabetes insipidus (DI) is a hereditary or acquired condition which disrupts normal life of persons with the condition; disruption is due to increased thirst and passing of large volumes of urine, even at night. A systematic search of literature for DI was carried out using the PubMed database for the purpose of this review. Central DI due to impaired secretion of arginine vasopressin (AVP) could result from traumatic brain injury, surgery, or tumors whereas nephrogenic DI due to failure of the kidney to respond to AVP is usually inherited. The earliest treatment was posterior pituitary extracts containing vasopressin and oxytocin. The synthetic analog of vasopressin, desmopressin has several benefits over vasopressin. Desmopressin was initially available as intranasal preparation, but now the oral tablet and melt formulations have gained significance, with benefits such as ease of administration and stability at room temperature. Other molecules used for treatment include chlorpropamide, carbamazepine, thiazide diuretics, indapamide, clofibrate, indomethacin, and amiloride.

787,PMC7378450,"Mean platelet volume (MPV) is a widely used biological marker of platelet function and activity. Increased MPV is associated with accelerated thrombopoiesis and an elevated risk of cardiovascular disease. However, it is not known whether higher MPV is related to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes and diabetic macrovascular complications in Japanese patients. Therefore, we analyzed MPV and its correlation with atherosclerosis in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes and those who had prediabetes.
We divided the patients into three groups: normoglycemic patients (n = 56), prediabetes patients (n = 44) and type 2 diabetes patients group, (n = 115). We measured platelet parameters and evaluated arterial stiffness in the three groups.
Significantly higher MPV was found in the type 2 diabetes mellitus and prediabetes patients compared with normoglycemic patients. MPV was significantly correlated with fasting blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin levels. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that MPV was positively correlated with HbA1c, even after adjustment for confounding factors. In the evaluation of arterial stiffness by measuring the cardio‐ankle vascular index and maximum intima‐media thickness, MPV showed a positive correlation with these parameters.
These findings suggest that MPV was significantly increased in the early stage of type 2 diabetes. We showed positive correlations between MPV and HbA1c levels, and between MPV and arterial stiffness in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes.
In Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes, mean platelet volume was significantly increased. Increased mean platelet volume led to progression of atherosclerosis.

There is, however, significant heterogeneity among the previous reports. We performed a systematic review and meta‐analysis to compare 3D strain values between adults with asymptomatic, subclinical diabetes mellitus (ie, patients with diabetes mellitus without known clinical manifestations of cardiac disease) and healthy controls.
After systematic review of 5 databases, 12 valid studies (544 patients with diabetes mellitus and 489 controls) were eligible for meta‐analysis. Pooled means and mean difference (MD) using a random‐effects model for 3D global longitudinal, circumferential, radial, and area strain were calculated. Patients with diabetes mellitus had an overall 2.31 percentage points lower 3D global longitudinal strain than healthy subjects (16.6%, 95% CI, 15.7–17.6 versus 19.0; 95% CI, 18.2–19.7; MD, −2.31, 95% CI, −2.72 to −2.03). Similarly, 3D global circumferential strain (18.9%; 95% CI, 17.5–20.3 versus 20.5; 95% CI, 18.9–22.1; MD, −1.50; 95% CI, −2.09 to −0.91); 3D global radial strain (44.6%; 95% CI, 40.2–49.1 versus 48.2; 95% CI, 44.7–51.8; MD, −3.47; 95% CI, −4.98 to −1.97), and 3D global area strain (30.5%; 95% CI, 29.2–31.8 versus 32.4; 95% CI, 30.5–34.3; MD, −1.76; 95% CI, −2.74 to −0.78) were also lower in patients with diabetes mellitus. Significant heterogeneity was noted between studies for all strain directions (inconsistency factor [I2], 37%–78%). Meta‐regression in subgroup analysis of studies using the most popular vendor found higher prevalence of hypertension as a significant contributor to worse 3D global longitudinal strain. Higher hemoglobulin A1c was the most significant contributor to worse 3D global circumferential strain in patients with diabetes mellitus.
Three‐dimensional myocardial strain was reduced in all directions in asymptomatic diabetic patients. Hypertension and hemoglobin A1c were associated with worse 3D global longitudinal strain and 3D global circumferential strain, respectively.

We analyzed data from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database on 3,750 type 2 diabetes mellitus patients with acute coronary syndrome or acute ischemic stroke within 3 months between 1 August 2011 and 31 December 2013. Clinical outcomes were evaluated by comparing 1,250 participants receiving vildagliptin with 2,500 propensity score‐matched participants. The primary composite outcome included CV death, non‐fatal myocardial infarction and non‐fatal stroke.
The primary composite outcome occurred in 122 patients (9.8%) in the vildagliptin group and 263 patients (10.5%) in the control group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.90, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.72–1.11) with a mean follow‐up period of 9.9 months. No significant between‐group differences were observed for CV death (HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.56–1.52), non‐fatal myocardial infarction (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.46–1.36) and non‐fatal stroke (HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.74–1.24). The vildagliptin group was at similar risks of hospitalization for heart failure (HF) or coronary intervention to the control group (P = 0.312 and 0.430, respectively). For patients with HF at baseline, the risk of hospitalization for HF was similar between the vildagliptin and control groups (HR 1.04, 95% CI 0.57–1.88).
Among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus after a recent acute coronary syndrome or acute ischemic stroke, treatment with vildagliptin was not associated with increased risks of CV death, non‐fatal myocardial infarction, non‐fatal stroke and hospitalization for HF.

Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of conditions that occur concomitantly and together they increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and double the risk of type 2 diabetes. In this review, we focus on the association between metabolic syndrome and periodontitis; however, we also include information on diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease, since these two conditions are significantly intertwined with metabolic syndrome. With regard to periodontitis and metabolic syndrome, to date, the vast majority of studies point to an association between these two conditions and also demonstrate that periodontitis can contribute to the development of, or can worsen, metabolic syndrome. Evaluating the effect of metabolic syndrome on the salivary microbiome, data presented herein support the hypothesis that the salivary bacterial profile is altered in metabolic syndrome patients compared with healthy patients. Considering periodontitis and these three conditions, the vast majority of human and animal studies point to an association between periodontitis and metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.

Conditional on having an event, there was a small decrease in the number of hospitalisations or ED presentations for the low (−6%) and moderate regularity quintiles (−8%), a reduction in bed days (ranging from −30 to −44%) and a reduction in average cost of between −23% and −41%, all relative to the lowest quintile. When probability of diabetes-related hospitalisation or ED presentation was included, only the inverse association with cost remained significant (mean of $A3798 to $A6350 less per individual, compared with the lowest regularity quintile). Importantly, continuity of provider did not significantly modify the effect of GP regularity for any outcome.
Higher regularity of GP contact—that is more evenly dispersed, not necessarily more frequent care—has the potential to reduce secondary healthcare costs and, conditional on having an event, the time spent in hospital, irrespective of continuity of provider. These findings argue for the advocacy of regular care, as distinct from solely continuity of provider, when designing policy and financial incentives for GP-led primary care.",2019 Jun 5,"Association between continuity of provider-adjusted regularity of general practitioner contact and unplanned diabetes-related hospitalisation: a data linkage study in New South Wales, Australia, using the 45 and Up Study cohort",BMJ Open
795,PMC3193784,"Fanconi's syndrome is a complex of multiple tubular dysfunctions of proximal tubular cells occurring alone or in association with a variety of inherited (primary) or acquired (secondary) disorders. It is characterized by aminoaciduria, normoglycaemic glycosuria, tubular proteinuria without hematuria, metabolic acidosis without anion gap and excessive urinary excretion of phosphorous, calcium, uric acid, bicarbonate, sodium, potassium, and magnesium. Whereas diabetes insipidus is a disease of collecting tubules and child mainly presents with dehydration and hypernatremia. Though all the cases published till date were secondary to drugs, myeloma, hematological disorders, etc., we are reporting the first case of idiopathic Fanconi's syndrome along with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus in a child who presented to us as resistant rickets.

796,PMC6214001,"Blood contains powerful pH-buffering molecules such as hemoglobin (Hb) and albumin, while interstitial fluids have little pH-buffering molecules. Thus, even under metabolic disorder conditions except severe cases, arterial blood pH is kept constant within the normal range (7.35~7.45), but the interstitial fluid pH under metabolic disorder conditions becomes lower than the normal level. Insulin resistance is one of the most important key factors in pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus, nevertheless the molecular mechanism of insulin resistance occurrence is still unclear. Our studies indicate that lowered interstitial fluid pH occurs in diabetes mellitus, causing insulin resistance via reduction of the binding affinity of insulin to its receptor. Therefore, the key point for improvement of insulin resistance occurring in diabetes mellitus is development of methods or techniques elevating the lowered interstitial fluid pH. Intake of weak organic acids is found to improve the insulin resistance by elevating the lowered interstitial fluid pH in diabetes mellitus. One of the molecular mechanisms of the pH elevation is that: (1) the carboxyl group (R-COO−) but not H+ composing weak organic acids in foods is absorbed into the body, and (2) the absorbed the carboxyl group (R-COO−) behaves as a pH buffer material, elevating the interstitial fluid pH. On the other hand, high salt intake has been suggested to cause diabetes mellitus; however, the molecular mechanism is unclear. A possible mechanism of high salt intake-caused diabetes mellitus is proposed from a viewpoint of regulation of the interstitial fluid pH: high salt intake lowers the interstitial fluid pH via high production of H+ associated with ATP synthesis required for the Na+,K+-ATPase to extrude the high leveled intracellular Na+ caused by high salt intake. This review article introduces the molecular mechanism causing the lowered interstitial fluid pH and insulin resistance in diabetes mellitus, the improvement of insulin resistance via intake of weak organic acid-containing foods, and a proposal mechanism of high salt intake-caused diabetes mellitus.",2018 Oct 19,The Proposal of Molecular Mechanisms of Weak Organic Acids Intake-Induced Improvement of Insulin Resistance in Diabetes Mellitus via Elevation of Interstitial Fluid pH,International Journal of Molecular Sciences
797,PMC6301727,"Background and aim: Diabetes self-management behaviors are necessary to ensure optimum glycemic control. However, limited data were available regarding the practice of self-management by the Iraqi diabetic patients. This study aims to understand the knowledge, behaviors, and barriers of diabetes self-management among Iraqi type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients in addition to their opinions and views toward the diabetes self-management educational program.
A qualitative method approach was used to obtain the data from T2DM patients recruited from the National Diabetes Center, Baghdad, Iraq. Data were collected using a semi-structured interview guide, and a thematic analysis approach was used to process the data.
Most participants agreed to the importance of self-management practices especially healthy eating, exercise, taking medications, and healthy coping with stress to control DM and prevent its complications. Healthy eating and physical activity recommendations were inadequately practiced by most of the participants. Most participants reported irregular self-monitoring of blood glucose. Most of the participants properly adhered to the anti-diabetic medications. They generally lack proper information/knowledge about the importance of self-management practices of foot care and managing diabetes during sick days and how such practices should be implemented. Most participants have positive attitudes toward diabetes self-management practices. Face-to-face educational sessions are preferred by most patients.
The Iraqi diabetic patients have inadequate self-management behaviors. The main barrier to self-management practices was the lack of knowledge due to the absence of diabetes self-management educational programs in Iraq.",2018 Dec 17,"Self-management knowledge and practice of type 2 diabetes mellitus patients in Baghdad, Iraq: a qualitative study","Diabetes, Metabolic Syndrome and Obesity: Targets and Therapy"

Systematic review and meta-analysis.
Medline and Embase between January 2000 and December 2019, studies published in English and conducted on humans.
Observational studies investigating progression to T2DM. Inclusion criteria were postpartum follow-up for at least 12 months, incident physician based diagnosis of diabetes, T2DM reported as a separate outcome rather than combined with impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance, and studies with both a group of patients with GDM and a control group.
This meta-analysis of 20 studies assessed a total of 1 332 373 individuals (67 956 women with GDM and 1 264 417 controls). Data were pooled by random effects meta-analysis models, and heterogeneity was assessed by use of the I2 statistic. The pooled relative risk for the incidence of T2DM between participants with GDM and controls was estimated. Reasons for heterogeneity between studies were investigated by prespecified subgroup and meta-regression analyses. Publication bias was assessed by funnel plots and, overall, studies were deemed to have a low risk of bias (P=0.58 and P=0.90). The overall relative risk for T2DM was almost 10 times higher in women with previous GDM than in healthy controls (9.51, 95% confidence interval 7.14 to 12.67, P<0.001). In populations of women with previous GDM, the cumulative incidence of T2DM was 16.46% (95% confidence interval 16.16% to 16.77%) in women of mixed ethnicity, 15.58% (13.30% to 17.86%) in a predominantly non-white population, and 9.91% (9.39% to 10.42%) in a white population. These differences were not statistically significant between subgroups (white v mixed populations, P=0.26; white v non-white populations, P=0.54). Meta-regression analyses showed that the study effect size was not significantly associated with mean study age, body mass index, publication year, and length of follow-up.
Women with a history of GDM appear to have a nearly 10-fold higher risk of developing T2DM than those with a normoglycaemic pregnancy. The magnitude of this risk highlights the importance of intervening to prevent the onset of T2DM, particularly in the early years after pregnancy.

This has been paralleled by increasing interest in the establishment of a universal definition for T2DM remission which, under given circumstances, could be considered equivalent to a “cure”. The efficacy of bariatric surgery in particular for achieving glycemic control has highlighted surgery as a candidate curative intervention for T2DM. Herein, available evidence regarding available surgical modalities and the mechanisms that drive metabolic amelioration after bariatric surgery are reviewed.

801,PMC8724342,"Dental implant surgery was developed to be the most suitable and comfortable instrument for dental and oral rehabilitation in the past decades, but with increasing numbers of inserted implants, complications are becoming more common. Diabetes mellitus as well as prediabetic conditions represent a common and increasing health problem (International Diabetes Federation in IDF Diabetes Atlas, International Diabetes Federation, Brussels, 2019) with extensive harmful effects on the entire organism [(Abiko and Selimovic in Bosnian J Basic Med Sci 10:186–191, 2010), (Khader et al., in J Diabetes Complicat 20:59–68, 2006, 10.1016/j.jdiacomp.2005.05.006)]. Hence, this study aimed to give an update on current literature on effects of prediabetes and diabetes mellitus on dental implant success.
A systematic literature research based on the PRISMA statement was conducted to answer the PICO question “Do diabetic patients with dental implants have a higher complication rate in comparison to healthy controls?”. We included 40 clinical studies and 16 publications of aggregated literature in this systematic review.
We conclude that patients with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus suffer more often from peri-implantitis, especially in the post-implantation time. Moreover, these patients show higher implant loss rates than healthy individuals in long term. Whereas, under controlled conditions success rates are similar. Perioperative anti-infective therapy, such as the supportive administration of antibiotics and chlorhexidine, is the standard nowadays as it seems to improve implant success. Only few studies regarding dental implants in patients with prediabetic conditions are available, indicating a possible negative effect on developing peri-implant diseases but no influence on implant survival.
Dental implant procedures represent a safe way of oral rehabilitation in patients with prediabetes or diabetes mellitus, as long as appropriate precautions can be adhered to. Accordingly, under controlled conditions there is still no contraindication for dental implant surgery in patients with diabetes mellitus or prediabetic conditions.",2022 Jan 3,Systematic review on diabetes mellitus and dental implants: an update,International Journal of Implant Dentistry

803,PMC3183526,"Diabetes Insipidus (DI) is a heterogeneous clinical syndrome of disturbance in water balance, characterized by polyuria (urine output > 4 ml/kg/hr), polydypsia (water intake > 2 L/m2/d) and failure to thrive. In children, Nephrogenic DI (NDI) is more common than Central DI (CDI), and is often acquired. The signs and symptoms vary with etiology, age at presentation and mode of onset. Neonates and infants with NDI are severely affected and difficult to treat. Diagnosis is based on the presence of high plasma osmolality and low urinary osmolality with significant water diuresis. Water deprivation test with vasopressin challenge, though has limitations, is done to differentiate NDI and CDI and diagnose their partial forms. Measurement of urinary aquaporin 2 and serum copeptin levels are being studied and show promising diagnostic potential. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) pituitary helps in the etiological diagnosis of CDI, absence of posterior pituitary bright signal being the pathognomic sign. If pituitary stalk thickening of < 2 mm is present, these children need to be monitored for evolving lesion. Neonates and young infants are better managed with fluids alone. Older children with CDI are treated with desmopressin. The oral form is safe, highly effective, with more flexibility of dosing and has largely replaced the intranasal form. In NDI besides treatment of the underlying cause, use of high calorie low solute diet and drugs to ameliorate water excretion (thiazide, amelioride, indomethacin) are useful.

805,PMC4450481,"Wolfram Syndrome (WFS) is known to involve diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, optic nerve atrophy, vision loss, hearing impairment, motor abnormalities, and neurodegeneration, but has been less clearly linked to cognitive, sleep, and psychiatric abnormalities. We sought to determine whether these abnormalities are present in children, adolescents, and young adults with WFS compared to age- and gender-matched individuals with and without type 1 diabetes using standardized measures.
Individuals with genetically-confirmed WFS (n = 19, ages 7–27) were compared to age- and gender- equivalent groups of individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1DM; n = 25), and non-diabetic healthy controls (HC: n = 25). Cognitive performance across multiple domains (verbal intelligence, spatial reasoning, memory, attention, smell identification) was assessed using standardized tests. Standardized self- and parent-report questionnaires on psychiatric symptoms and sleep disturbances were acquired from all groups and an unstructured psychiatric interview was performed within only the WFS group.
The three groups were similar demographically (age, gender, ethnicity, parental IQ). WFS and T1DM had similar duration of diabetes but T1DM had higher HbA1C levels than WFS and as expected both groups had higher levels than HC. The WFS group was impaired on smell identification and reported sleep quality, but was not impaired in any other cognitive or self-reported psychiatric domain. In fact, the WFS group performed better than the other two groups on selected memory and attention tasks. However, based upon a clinical evaluation of only WFS patients, we found that psychiatric and behavioral problems were present and consisted primarily of anxiety and hypersomnolence.
This study found that cognitive performance and psychological health were relatively preserved WFS patients, while smell and sleep abnormalities manifested in many of the WFS patients. These findings contradict past case and retrospective reports indicating significant cognitive and psychiatric impairment in WFS. While many of these patients were diagnosed with anxiety and hypersomnolence, self-reported measures of psychiatric symptoms indicated that the symptoms were not of grave concern to the patients. It may be that cognitive and psychiatric issues become more prominent later in life and/or in later stages of the disease, but this requires standardized assessment and larger samples to determine. In the relatively early stages of WFS, smell and sleep-related symptoms may be useful biomarkers of disease and should be monitored longitudinally to determine if they are good markers of progression as well.

An institution-based cross-sectional study was carried out from June to July 2016. A total of 758 participants were selected using a multistage sampling technique. Data were collected with a structured interviewer-administered questionnaire; a WHO STEPwise approach of NCDs risk factors identification, and the collected data were checked for completeness immediately following data collection and the filled questionnaires were entered into Epi–Info 3.5.1, and then exported to SPSS 23 for further analysis. Descriptive statistics such as mean, percentages, standard deviation, and ranges were determined. To identify factors associated with diabetes mellitus, binary logistics regression was used.
The overall prevalence of diabetes mellitus was 14.8%, with a sex-specific prevalence of 18.35% and 16.62% for males and females, respectively. Older age participants had higher risks of developing diabetes mellitus than younger age individuals. Alcohol drinkers had more risks of developing diabetes mellitus than non-alcohol drinkers. Participants with plasma HDL-C ≥40mg/dl were more likely to develop diabetes mellitus than those with <40mg/dl.

They can be associated with endocrine manifestations, which may be complications from a previously diagnosed IEM of childhood onset. More rarely, endocrinopathies can signal an IEM in adulthood, which should be suspected when an endocrine disorder is associated with multisystemic involvement (neurological, muscular, hepatic features, etc.). IEM can affect all glands, but diabetes mellitus, thyroid dysfunction and hypogonadism are the most frequent disorders. A single IEM can present with multiple endocrine dysfunctions, especially those involving energy deficiency (respiratory chain defects), and metal (hemochromatosis) and storage disorders (cystinosis). Non-autoimmune diabetes mellitus, thyroid dysfunction and/or goiter and sometimes hypoparathyroidism should steer the diagnosis towards a respiratory chain defect. Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism is frequent in haemochromatosis (often associated with diabetes), whereas primary hypogonadism is reported in Alström disease and cystinosis (both associated with diabetes, the latter also with thyroid dysfunction) and galactosemia. Hypogonadism is also frequent in X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (with adrenal failure), congenital disorders of glycosylation, and Fabry and glycogen storage diseases (along with thyroid dysfunction in the first 3 and diabetes in the last).

Patients with a mean HbA1c during childhood and adolescence of ≤7.5 and >7.5% were compared with respect to the occurrence of additional Wolfram syndrome symptoms. The wolframin (WFS1) gene was screened for mutations in 39 patients. WFS1 genotypes were examined for correlation with age at onset of diabetes.
WSD was diagnosed earlier than type 1 diabetes (5.4 ± 3.8 vs. 7.9 ± 4.2 years; P < 0.001) with a lower prevalence of ketoacidosis (7 vs. 20%; P = 0.049).

The Diabetes Mellitus and Vascular health initiative (DMVhi) was initiated as a prospective longitudinal cohort study on the prevalence of undiagnosed Type 2 diabetes and prediabetes, diabetes risk and cardiovascular risk in a cohort of Irish adults aged 45-75 years.
Members of the largest Irish private health insurance provider aged 45 to 75 years were invited to participate in the study. Exclusion criteria: already diagnosed with diabetes or taking oral hypoglycaemic agents. Participants completed a detailed medical questionnaire, had weight, height, waist and hip circumference and blood pressure measured. Fasting blood samples were taken for fasting plasma glucose (FPG). Those with FPG in the impaired fasting glucose (IFG) range had a 75gm oral glucose tolerance test performed.
122,531 subjects were invited to participate. 29,144 (24%) completed the study. The prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes was 1.8%, of impaired fasting glucose (IFG) was 7.1% and of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) was 2.9%. Dysglycaemia increased among those aged 45-54, 55-64 and 65-75 years in both males (10.6%, 18.5%, 21.7% respectively) and females (4.3%, 8.6%, 10.9% respectively). Undiagnosed T2D, IFG and IGT were all associated with gender, age, blood pressure, BMI, abdominal obesity, family history of diabetes and triglyceride levels.

813,PMC7285586,"Inflammation-related atherosclerotic peripheral vascular disease is a major end organ complication of diabetes mellitus that results in devastating morbidity and mortality. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are nano-sized particles that contain molecular cargo and circulate in the blood. Here, we examined EV protein cargo from diabetic individuals and whether these EVs cause functional changes in endothelial cells.
We quantified inflammatory protein levels in plasma-derived EVs from a longitudinal cohort of euglycemic and diabetic individuals and used in vitro endothelial cell biological assays to assess the functional effects of these EVs with samples from a cross-sectional cohort.
We found several significant associations between EV inflammatory protein levels and diabetes status. The angiogenic factor, vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A), was associated with diabetes status in our longitudinal cohort. Those with diabetes mellitus had higher EV VEGF-A levels compared to euglycemic individuals. Additionally, EV levels of VEGF-A were significantly associated with homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and β-cell function (HOMA-B). To test whether EVs with different inflammatory cargo can demonstrate different effects on endothelial cells, we performed cell migration and immunofluorescence assays. We observed that EVs from diabetic individuals increased cell lamellipodia formation and migration when compared to EVs from euglycemic individuals.
Higher levels of inflammatory proteins were found in EVs from diabetic individuals. Our data implicate EVs as playing important roles in peripheral vascular disease that occur in individuals with diabetes mellitus and suggest that EVs may serve as an informative diagnostic tool for the disease.",2020 Jun 9,Extracellular vesicles in diabetes mellitus induce alterations in endothelial cell morphology and migration,Journal of Translational Medicine
814,PMC7760441,"Congenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (CNDI) is a rare hereditary renal disorder that is caused by mutations in AVPR2 or aquaporin 2 (AQP2). Up to now, there are few reports about CNDI in neonates. Early clinical manifestations of CNDI in neonates are atypical. A lack of understanding of the disease by clinicians causes frequent misdiagnoses or missed diagnoses, which may result in failure to administer treatments in time and ultimately leads to severe complications. In this study, clinical data of a case of AVPR2 gene mutation-induced CNDI, which was confirmed by genetic testing, were retrospectively analyzed to improve our understanding of this disease.
On February 1, 2020, a male neonate was hospitalized 17 d after birth due to a 7 d period of pyrexia. The patient’s symptoms included recurrent pyrexia, hypernatremia and hyperchloremia, which were difficult to treat. The patient was fed on demand, and water was additionally provided between milk intakes. A combination treatment of hydrochlorothiazide and amiloride was administered. After the treatment, body temperature and electrolyte levels returned to normal, the volume of urine was significantly reduced and the patient was subsequently discharged. Genetic tests confirmed that the patient carried the AVPR2 gene missense mutation c.541C>T (P.R181C), and the patient’s mother carried a heterozygous mutation at the same locus. After clinical treatment with a combination of hydrochlorothiazide and amiloride, the body temperature and electrolyte levels returned to normal. Up until the most recent follow-up examination, normal body temperature, electrolyte levels and growth and development were observed.

During 4 years, several total-body positron emission tomography and MRI scans showed no extracardiac lymphoma. On year 5 after the cardiac surgery, patient presented with sleepiness, hyperphagia, memory loss, confabulation, dementia and diabetes insipidus. Brain MRI showed a single hypothalamic recurrence of the original lymphoma that responded to high-dose methotrexate treatment. Correction of diabetes insipidus improved alertness but amnesia and cognitive deficits persisted, including incapacity to read and write. This case illustrates two unusual locations of DLBCL: primary cardiac lymphoma and hypothalamus.

817,PMC4890267,"The steep rise of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and associated complications go along with mounting evidence of clinically important sex and gender differences. T2DM is more frequently diagnosed at lower age and body mass index in men; however, the most prominent risk factor, which is obesity, is more common in women. Generally, large sex-ratio differences across countries are observed. Diversities in biology, culture, lifestyle, environment, and socioeconomic status impact differences between males and females in predisposition, development, and clinical presentation. Genetic effects and epigenetic mechanisms, nutritional factors and sedentary lifestyle affect risk and complications differently in both sexes. Furthermore, sex hormones have a great impact on energy metabolism, body composition, vascular function, and inflammatory responses. Thus, endocrine imbalances relate to unfavorable cardiometabolic traits, observable in women with androgen excess or men with hypogonadism. Both biological and psychosocial factors are responsible for sex and gender differences in diabetes risk and outcome. Overall, psychosocial stress appears to have greater impact on women rather than on men. In addition, women have greater increases of cardiovascular risk, myocardial infarction, and stroke mortality than men, compared with nondiabetic subjects. However, when dialysis therapy is initiated, mortality is comparable in both males and females. Diabetes appears to attenuate the protective effect of the female sex in the development of cardiac diseases and nephropathy. Endocrine and behavioral factors are involved in gender inequalities and affect the outcome. More research regarding sex-dimorphic pathophysiological mechanisms of T2DM and its complications could contribute to more personalized diabetes care in the future and would thus promote more awareness in terms of sex- and gender-specific risk factors.",2016 May 9,"Sex and Gender Differences in Risk, Pathophysiology and Complications of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus",Endocrine Reviews
818,PMC8429928,"The aquaporin 2 (AQP2) plays a critical role in water reabsorption to maintain water homeostasis. AQP2 mutation leads to nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI), characterized by polyuria, polydipsia, and hypernatremia. We previously reported that a novel AQP2 mutation (G215S) caused NDI in a boy. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the cell biological consequences of this mutation on AQP2 function and clarify the molecular pathogenic mechanism for NDI in this patient. First, we analyzed AQP2 expression in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells by AQP2-G215S or AQP2-WT plasmid transfection and found significantly decreased AQP2-G215S expression in cytoplasmic membrane compared with AQP2-WT, independent of forskolin treatment. Further, we found co-localization of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) marker (Calnexin) with AQP2-G215S rather than AQP2-WT in MDCK cells by immunocytochemistry. The functional analysis showed that MDCK cells transfected with AQP2-G215S displayed reduced water permeability compared with AQP2-WT. Visualization of AQP2 structure implied that AQP2-G215S mutation might interrupt the folding of the sixth transmembrane α-helix and/or the packing of α-helices, resulting in the misfolding of monomer and further impaired formation of tetramer. Taken together, these findings suggested that AQP2-G215S was misfolded and retained in the ER and could not be translocated to the apical membrane to function as a water channel, which revealed the molecular pathogenic mechanism of AQP2-G215S mutation and explained for the phenotype of NDI in this patient.",2021 Aug 27,Molecular Characterization of an Aquaporin−2 Mutation Causing Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus,Frontiers in Endocrinology
819,PMC6944834,"The worldwide prevalence of diabetes mellitus has been increasing over the past decades, particularly in developing countries. Because of the lack of information regarding changes in diabetes mellitus prevalence, awareness, treatment and control in rural China, we assessed these trends – overall and in the context of related health conditions – to explore the impact of these primary health issues on these rates in a poorly educated, rural population.
Diabetes mellitus prevalence, awareness, treatment and control rates were compared between two surveys carried out in 1992 and 2011. The residents of three villages, aged 35–64 years, were recruited for this study.
In 1992, 1,091 individuals were interviewed and, in 2011, 2,338 individuals were interviewed. Between the two surveys, the overall diabetes mellitus prevalence in the study population was lower in 1992 than that in 2011 (P < 0.001); among men, the prevalence was 5.2‐fold higher in 2011 than in 1992 (10.5 vs 1.7%) and nearly 4.3‐fold higher (11.2 vs 2.1%) among women. Men aged 35–44 years, with >6 years of education, stage I hypertension and being overweight, had a higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus in 2011 than in 1992. Similarly, for the same time periods, there was also a higher diabetes mellitus prevalence among women aged 55–64 years, with 1–6 years of education, stage III hypertension and who were overweight. However, there were no significant changes in diabetes mellitus awareness, treatment or control in this population.
These results suggest that particular efforts must be made to enhance diabetes mellitus prevention, control and public awareness in rural communities in China.
The overall prevalence of diabetes mellitus increased significantly both in men and in women over the past two decades. In men, the prevalence of diabetes mellitus increased most significantly for those aged 35–44 years, with >6 years of education, having stage I hypertension and being overweight; but for those aged 55–64 years, with 1–6 years of education, having stage III hypertension and being overweight in women.

820,PMC5704222,"Monogenic forms of diabetes may account for 1–5% of all cases of diabetes, and may occur in the context of syndromic presentations. We investigated the case of a girl affected by insulin-dependent diabetes, diagnosed at 6 years old, associated with congenital cataract. Her consanguineous parents and her four other siblings did not have diabetes or cataract, suggesting a recessive syndrome. Using whole exome sequencing of the affected proband, we identified a heterozygous p.R825Q ABCC8 mutation, located at the exact same amino-acid position as the p.R825W recurring diabetes mutation, hence likely responsible for the diabetes condition, and a homozygous p.G71S mutation in CRYBB1, a gene known to be responsible for congenital cataract. Both mutations were predicted to be damaging and were absent or extremely rare in public databases. Unexpectedly, we found that the mother was also homozygous for the CRYBB1 mutation, and both the mother and one unaffected sibling were heterozygous for the ABCC8 mutation, suggesting incomplete penetrance of both mutations. Incomplete penetrance of ABCC8 mutations is well documented, but this is the first report of an incomplete penetrance of a CRYBB1 mutation, manifesting between susceptible subjects (unaffected mother vs. affected child) and to some extent within the patient herself, who had distinct cataract severities in both eyes. Our finding illustrates the importance of family studies to unmask the role of confounding factors such as double-gene mutations and incomplete penetrance that may mimic monogenic syndromes including in the case of strongly evocative family structure with consanguinity.",2017 Nov 7,Juvenile-Onset Diabetes and Congenital Cataract: “Double-Gene” Mutations Mimicking a Syndromic Diabetes Presentation,Genes

DM leads to many complications that are associated with higher morbidity and mortality worldwide. Therefore, the current study was planned to assess the prevalence and risk factors of type-2 DM in Ethiopian population. Six electronic databases such as: PubMed, Scopus, Hinari, Web of science, Google Scholar, and African Journals Online were searched for studies published in English up December 30, 2020. Newcastle–Ottawa Scale was used for quality assessment of the included studies. The data was extracted by Microsoft excel and analyzed through Stata version 16 software. The random effect meta-regression analysis was computed at 95% CI to assess the pooled prevalence and risk factors of type-2 DM. Forty observational studies were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of DM in Ethiopia was 6.5% (95% CI (5.8, 7.3)). The sub-group analysis revealed that the highest prevalence of DM was found in Dire Dawa city administration (14%), and the lowest prevalence was observed in Tigray region (2%). The pooled prevalence of DM was higher (8%) in studies conducted in health facility.

823,PMC5956045,"Congenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) is characterized by defective urine concentrating ability. Symptomatic polyuria is present from birth, even with normal release of the antidiuretic hormone vasopressin by the pituitary. Over the last two decades, the aquaporin-2 (AQP2) gene has been cloned and the molecular mechanisms of urine concentration have been gradually elucidated. Vasopressin binds to the vasopressin type II receptor (V2R) in the renal collecting ducts and then activates AQP2 phosphorylation and trafficking to increase water reabsorption from urine. Most cases of congenital NDI are caused by loss-of-function mutations to V2R, resulting in unresponsiveness to vasopressin. In this article, we provide an overview of novel therapeutic molecules of congenital NDI that can activate AQP2 by bypassing defective V2R signaling with a particular focus on the activators of the calcium and cAMP signaling pathways.",2018 Feb 24,Activation of AQP2 water channels without vasopressin: therapeutic strategies for congenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus,Clinical and Experimental Nephrology
824,PMC5557946,"Salusin-β is an endogenous parasympathomimetic proatherosclerotic peptide. Salusin-β was initially predicted from bioinformatic analyses and later immunologically detected in human biofluids. However, elucidation of salusin-β bioactivity has faced enormous challenges because of its unique physicochemical characteristics that cause it to strongly adhere to laboratory apparatus materials. In the strictest sense, the discovery of bioactive peptides is not complete until their exact native sequences have been confirmed in the peripheral circulation. In this study, we determined the plasma molecular form and levels of free salusin-β to determine its pathophysiological significance. Ultra-high-yield enrichment and preseparation of non-tryptic human plasma was followed by LC-MS/MS, and full-length salusin-β and seven different endogenous fragment sequences were identified. We established a new ELISA that specifically detects plasma free salusin-β without cross-reacting with any of its identified endogenous fragments. Free salusin-β levels exhibited a profound early morning nadir and rapidly decreased in response to parasympathetic nervous augmentation. Our technical advance in plasma native peptide analysis successfully identified a hard-to-detect bioactive peptide, salusin-β, together with its formerly unrecognized fragments, and further suggests that conventional immunological measurements of target peptides may not be fully representative.",2017 Aug 15,"Identification and quantification of plasma free salusin-β, an endogenous parasympathomimetic peptide",Scientific Reports

Methods: Pakistani adults with T2DM were recruited from the outpatient departments of two hospitals in Lahore. Semistructured interviews were conducted and audiorecorded until thematic saturation was reached. Two researchers thematically analyzed the data independently using NVivo® software with differences resolved by a third researcher.
Results: Thirty-two Pakistani adults (aged 35–75 years, 62% female) participated in the study. Six themes were identified from qualitative analysis: role of family and friends, role of doctors and healthcare, patients' understanding about diabetes, complication of diabetes and other comorbidities, burden of self care, and life circumstances. A variable experience was observed with education and healthcare. Counseling by healthcare providers, family support, and fear of diabetes-associated complications are the key enablers that encourage study participants to adhere to diabetes-related self-care practices. Major barriers to self care are financial constraints, physical limitations, extreme weather conditions, social gatherings, loving food, forgetfulness, needle phobia, and a hectic job.
Conclusion: Respondents identified many barriers to diabetes self care, particularly related to life situations and diabetes knowledge.

826,PMC8101242,"Scleroedema adultorum of Buschke is a rare disorder characterized by fibromucinous thickening of the dermis that manifests mainly at the nape of the neck and on the upper back and shoulders. This study screened patients with diabetes mellitus for skin hardening caused by scleroedema adultorum of Buschke and characterized the clinical and laboratory findings in patients with newly identified cases, with a focus on lipid metabolism abnormalities and vascular complications.
Out of 113 consecutive patients with diabetes, 11 (9.7%) new scleroedema patients, all with type 2 diabetes, were found. Their clinical and laboratory data were compared to those of the rest of the screened patients and to those of a cohort of 15 patients with scleroedema and diabetes who were already being treated in a tertiary clinical centre at the University of Pécs.
Higher proportions of patients with dyslipidaemia, hypertriglyceridemia (P < 0.05) and increased mean levels of non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) were found (P < 0.01) in both scleroedema groups than in the group without scleroedema. Stroke and venous thromboembolism (VTE) were more frequently found in the histories of both the newly identified scleroedema group (each 3/11; 27.3%) and the treated cohort (each 6/15; 40.0%) than in the group without scleroedema (6/102; 5.9% in cases of stroke P = 0.021, P < 0.001; and 14/102; 13.7%; P < 0.05 in cases of VTE, respectively). Based on binary logistic regression, a high non-HDL-C level (odds ratio (OD): 3.338, confidence interval (CI): 1.77–6.28; P < 0.001) and insulin treatment (OR 7.64, CI 1.9–29.3; P = 0.003) were independent predictors of scleroedema in patients with diabetes mellitus.
Diabetes patients with scleroedema had more severe dyslipidaemia and higher occurrence of vascular complications compared to those without scleroedema. In addition to poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus requiring insulin treatment, high non-HDL-C levels may be another contributing factor to the development of scleroedema.

We investigated the effects of experimentally induced diabetes (streptozotocin model) in Wistar female rats on the inflammatory status of the hippocampi of their offspring. Additionally, the impact of antidiabetic drugs (metformin and glyburide) on inflammatory processes was evaluated. Organotypic hippocampal cultures (OHCs) were prepared from the brains of the 7-day-old rat offspring of control and diabetic mother rats. On the 7th day in vitro, the cultures were pretreated with metformin (3 μM) or glyburide (1 μM) and then stimulated for 24 h with lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 1 μg/ml). The OHCs obtained from the offspring of diabetic mothers were characterized by the increased mortality of cells and an enhanced susceptibility to damage caused by LPS. Although we showed that LPS stimulated the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α) in the control and diabetic cultures, the levels of IL-1β and IL-6 in the OHC medium obtained from the offspring of diabetic mothers were more pronounced. In the diabetic cultures, enhanced levels of TLR-4 and the overactivation of the NLRP3 inflammasome were demonstrated. Metformin and glyburide pretreatment normalized the LPS-induced IL-1β secretion in the control and diabetic cultures. Furthermore, glyburide diminished both: LPS-induced IL-6 and TNF-α secretion in the control and diabetic cultures and increased NF-κB p65 subunit phosphorylation. Glyburide also diminished the levels of the NLRP3 subunit and caspase-1, but only in the diabetic cultures. The results showed that maternal diabetes affected inflammatory processes in the offspring brain and increased hippocampal sensitivity to the LPS-induced inflammatory response.

FoxO transcription factors are suppressed by insulin and thus are key mediators of insulin action. To study their role in diabetic muscle wasting, we created mice with muscle-specific triple knockout of FoxO1/3/4 and induced diabetes in these M-FoxO-TKO mice with streptozotocin (STZ). Muscle mass and myofiber area were decreased 20–30% in STZ-Diabetes mice due to increased ubiquitin-proteasome degradation and autophagy alterations, characterized by increased LC3-containing vesicles, and elevated levels of phosphorylated ULK1 and LC3-II. Both the muscle loss and markers of increased degradation/autophagy were completely prevented in STZ FoxO-TKO mice. Transcriptomic analyses revealed FoxO-dependent increases in ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis pathways in STZ-Diabetes, including regulation of Fbxo32 (Atrogin1), Trim63 (MuRF1), Bnip3L, and Gabarapl. These same genes were increased 1.4- to 3.3-fold in muscle from humans with type 1 diabetes after short-term insulin deprivation.

This is a population study, based on information derived between 2007–2011, from the electronic database of the largest health fund in Israel, among Arabs and Jews. Prevalence, 4-year-incidence and diabetes hazard ratios [HRs], adjusted for sex and the metabolic-syndrome [MetS]-components, were determined in 3 age groups (<50 years, 50–59 years, and ≥60 years).
The study cohort included 17,044 Arabs (males: 49%, age: 39.4±17.3) and 16,012 Jews (males: 50%, age: 40.5 ±17.6). The overall age and sex-adjusted diabetes prevalence rates were much higher among Arabs 18.4% (95%CI: 17.6–19.1); and 10.3% (95%CI: 9.7–10.9) among Jews. Arab females had higher prevalence rates 20.0% (95%CI: 19–21) than Arab males 16.7% (95%CI: 15.7–17.8). Annual incidence rates were also significantly higher among Arabs 2.9% (95%CI: 2.7–3.1) than among Jews 1.7% (95%CI: 1.6–1.8). This held true across all age and sex subgroups.

In young people, type 1 diabetes can interfere with psychosocial development and hamper school performance. In adulthood, it can interfere with work life, relationships and parenting. A substantial minority of adults with type 1 diabetes experience coping difficulties and high diabetes‐related distress. In youth and adulthood, type 1 diabetes is related to mild cognitive decrements as well as affective disorders, such as depression and anxiety. There is limited literature available that explores the interaction between cognitive and psychological comorbidity and underlying mechanisms. The aims of the present narrative review were to summarize the current state of the literature regarding both cognitive and psychological comorbidities in type 1 diabetes across the lifespan, and to explore potential links between the two domains of interest to make suggestions for future research and clinical practice.
Cognitive decrements are found in people with type 1 diabetes across the lifespan in functions such as attention, information processing speed, and executive functions. Also across the lifespan, type 1 diabetes is related to a higher prevalence of depression, anxiety and distress, and a lower quality of life.

This ability to bypass Vp-mediated water reabsorption in kidney implicates SCT’s potential to treat nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI). Research on NDI in the past has largely been focused on the searching for mutations in vasopressin receptor 2 (AVPR2), while the functional relationship between SCTR, AVPR2 and NDI remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate the interaction between SCTR and AVPR2 to modulate cellular signaling in vitro. Interestingly, we show in this report that upon heteromer formation with SCTR, R137H, a NDI-causing AVPR2 mutant that is defective in trafficking to cell surface, can functionally be rescued. Our data may provide an explanation for this clinically mild case of NDI, and insights into the pathological development of NDI in the future.",2016 Sep 20,Signaling Modification by GPCR Heteromer and Its Implication on X-Linked Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus,PLoS ONE
837,PMC5376273,"Recent studies highlight a negative association between total bilirubin concentrations and albuminuria in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Our study evaluated the relationship between bilirubin concentrations and the prevalence of diabetic nephropathy (DN) in Chinese patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM).
A total of 258 patients with T1DM were recruited and bilirubin concentrations were compared between patients with or without diabetic nephropathy. Multiple stepwise regression analysis was used to examine the relationship between bilirubin concentrations and 24 h urinary microalbumin. Binary logistic regression analysis was performed to assess independent risk factors for diabetic nephropathy. Participants were divided into four groups according to the quartile of total bilirubin concentrations (Q1, 0.20–0.60; Q2, 0.60–0.80; Q3, 0.80–1.00; Q4, 1.00–1.90 mg/dL) and the chi-square test was used to compare the prevalence of DN in patients with T1DM.
The median bilirubin level was 0.56 (interquartile: 0.43–0.68 mg/dL) in the DN group, significantly lower than in the non-DN group (0.70 [interquartile: 0.58–0.89 mg/dL], P < 0.001). Spearman’s correlational analysis showed bilirubin concentrations were inversely correlated with 24 h urinary microalbumin (r = -0.13, P < 0.05) and multiple stepwise regression analysis showed bilirubin concentrations were independently associated with 24 h urinary microalbumin. In logistic regression analysis, bilirubin concentrations were significantly inversely associated with nephropathy. In addition, in stratified analysis, from the first to the fourth quartile group, increased bilirubin concentrations were associated with decreased prevalence of DN from 21.90% to 2.00%.

838,PMC5440022,"Despite decades of research in humans and mouse models of disease, substantial gaps remain in our understanding of pathogenic mechanisms underlying the development of type 1 diabetes. Furthermore, translation of therapies from preclinical efforts capable of delaying or halting β-cell destruction has been limited. Hence, a pressing need exists to identify alternative animal models that reflect human disease. Canine insulin deficiency diabetes is, in some cases, considered to follow autoimmune pathogenesis, similar to NOD mice and humans, characterized by hyperglycemia requiring lifelong exogenous insulin therapy. Also similar to human type 1 diabetes, the canonical canine disorder appears to be increasing in prevalence. Whereas islet architecture in rodents is distinctly different from humans, canine pancreatic endocrine cell distribution is more similar. Differences in breed susceptibility alongside associations with MHC and other canine immune response genes parallel that of different ethnic groups within the human population, a potential benefit over NOD mice. The impact of environment on disease development also favors canine over rodent models. Herein, we consider the potential for canine diabetes to provide valuable insights for human type 1 diabetes in terms of pancreatic histopathology, impairment of β-cell function and mass, islet inflammation (i.e., insulitis), and autoantibodies specific for β-cell antigens.",2017 May 15,"Comparative Pathogenesis of Autoimmune Diabetes in Humans, NOD Mice, and Canines: Has a Valuable Animal Model of Type 1 Diabetes Been Overlooked?",Diabetes
839,PMC8165422,"Diabetes mellitus is a group of metabolic diseases characterized by hyperglycemia resulting from defects in insulin secretion or insulin action. It can be caused by the consumption of carbohydrate meals or medication side effects. Depression as a comorbid condition in an individual with diabetes is accountable for increased disability, mortality, and significant health problem in patients. As a continent, Africa does not have an overall estimation of depression prevalence among diabetes mellitus patients at a regional level. Consequently, this study's purpose was to use the meta-analysis method to summarize estimates of extant studies that have reported depression prevalence among patients with diabetes mellitus in Africa. The literature search method was executed to classify studies with reported depression prevalence with evidently designed inclusion and exclusion criteria. In total, 20 studies from sundry screened articles were appropriate for ultimate inclusion in the meta-analysis. Since substantial heterogeneity was expected, a random-effects meta-analysis was carried out using the number of cases with a total sample size to estimate the prevalence of diabetes mellitus at a regional level. The residual amount of heterogeneity was found to be high according to the statistics of τ2 = 0.06; I2 = 99.10%, chi-square = 2184.85, degree of freedom = 19 and P =< 0.001. The pooled depression prevalence was 40% within a 95% confidence interval of 29%–51%. The meta-regression analysis result showed that none of the included moderators contributed to the heterogeneity of studies. The result of effect size estimates against its standard error showed publication bias with a P-value of 0.001. The meta-analysis findings of this study have indicated that depression prevalence in Africa is still high. Reporting on numerous risk factors like socio-demographic characteristics were not possible in this study because of a lack of completeness in the included articles. Consequently, screening diabetes patients for comorbid depression with its associated risk factors is highly recommended.

840,PMC8541526,"Background and Objectives: Hyperbaric oxygen is a recognised treatment for a range of medical conditions, including treatment of diabetic foot disease. A number of studies have reported an impact of hyperbaric oxygen treatment on glycaemic control in patients undergoing treatment for diabetic foot disease. There has been no systematic review considering the impact of hyperbaric oxygen on glycaemia in people with diabetes. Materials and Methods: A prospectively PROSPERO-registered (PROSPERO registration: CRD42021255528) systematic review of eligible studies published in English in the PUBMED, MEDLINE, and EMBASE databases, based on the following search terms: hyperbaric oxygen therapy, HBO2, hyperbaric oxygenation, glycaemic control, diabetes, diabetes Mellitus, diabetic, HbA1c. Data extraction to pre-determined piloted data collection form, with individual assessment of bias. Results: In total, 10 eligible publications were identified after screening. Of these, six articles reported a statistically significant reduction in blood glucose from hyperbaric oxygen treatment, while two articles reported a statistically significant increase in peripheral insulin sensitivity. Two articles also identified a statistically significant reduction in HbA1c following hyperbaric oxygen treatment. Conclusions: There is emerging evidence suggesting a reduction in glycaemia following hyperbaric oxygen treatment in patients with diabetes mellitus, but the existing studies are in relatively small cohorts and potentially underpowered. Additional large prospective clinical trials are required to understand the precise impact of hyperbaric oxygen treatment on glycaemia for people with diabetes mellitus.",2021 Oct 19,A Systematic Review to Assess the Impact of Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy on Glycaemia in People with Diabetes Mellitus,Medicina
841,PMC6546688,"Dysregulated arousal often accompanies neurodevelopmental disorders such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism spectrum disorder. Recently, we have found that adolescent homozygous Brattleboro (Hom) rats, which contain a mutation in the arginine vasopressin (AVP) gene, exhibit lower behavioral arousal than their heterozygous (Het) littermates in the open field test. This hypoaroused phenotype could be due to loss of AVP in magnocellular cells that supply AVP to the peripheral circulation and project to limbic structures or parvocellular cells that regulate the stress axis and other central targets. Alternatively, hypoarousal could be a side effect of diabetes insipidus – polydipsia and polyuria seen in Hom rats due to loss of AVP facilitation of water reabsorption in the kidney. We developed a viral-rescue approach to “cure” magnocellular AVP cells of their Brattleboro mutation. Infusion of a recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) containing a functional Avp gene and promoter (rAAV-AVP) rescued AVP within magnocellular cells and fiber projections of the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) of male and female adolescent Hom rats. Furthermore, water intake was markedly reduced, ameliorating the symptoms of diabetes insipidus. In contrast, open field activity was unaffected. These findings indicate that the hyporaoused phenotype of adolescent Hom rats is not due to the loss of AVP function in magnocellular cells or a side effect of diabetes insipidus, but favors the hypothesis that central, parvocellular AVP mechanisms underlie the regulation of arousal during adolescence.",2019 Jun 3,"Viral rescue of magnocellular vasopressin cells in adolescent Brattleboro rats ameliorates diabetes insipidus, but not the hypoaroused phenotype",Scientific Reports
842,PMC7351865,"The aim of this work was to determine how weight patterns together with blood glucose, BP and lipids vary at diagnosis of diabetes by age, sex and ethnicity.
Using the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink, we identified people with type 2 diabetes (n = 187,601) diagnosed in 1998–2015 and compared their weights, HbA1c, BP and lipid levels at diagnosis with age-matched people without diabetes (n = 906,182), by sex and ethnic group.
Younger age at diagnosis was associated with greater adjusted mean difference (95% CI) in weight between those with vs without type 2 diabetes: 18.7 (18.3, 19.1) kg at age 20–39 years and 5.3 (5.0, 5.5) kg at age ≥ 80 years. Weight differentials were maximal in white women, and were around double in white people compared with South Asian and black people. Despite lower absolute values, BP differences were also greater at younger age of diabetes onset: 7 (6, 7) mmHg at age 20–39 years vs −0.5 (−0.9, −0.2) at age ≥ 80 years. BP differences were greatest in white people, and especially in women. Triacylglycerol level differences were greatest in younger men. Finally, HbA1c levels were also higher with younger onset diabetes, particularly in black people.
At diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, when compared with people without diabetes, weight and BP differentials were greater in younger vs older people, in women vs men and in white vs South Asian and black people. These differences were observed even though South Asian and black people tend to develop diabetes a decade earlier with either similar or greater dysglycaemia. These striking patterns may have implications for management and prevention.

Diagnosis of CDI is challenging, and clinical data and guidelines for management are lacking. We aim to characterize clinical and radiological characteristics of a cohort of pediatric patients with CDI.
A chart review of 35 patients with CDI followed at North Carolina Children’s Hospital from 2000 to 2015 was undertaken. The frequencies of specific etiologies of CDI and characteristic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings were determined. The presence of additional hormone deficiencies at diagnosis and later in the disease course was ascertained. Patient characteristics and management strategies were evaluated.
The cohort included 14 female and 21 male patients with a median age of 4.7 years (range, less than 1 month to 16 years) at diagnosis. Median duration of follow-up was 5 years (range, 2 months to 16 years). The cause of CDI was intracranial mass in 13 patients (37.2 %), septo-optic dysplasia in 9 patients (25.7 %), holoprosencephaly in 5 patients (14.2 %), Langerhans cell histiocytosis in 3 patients (8.6 %), isolated pituitary hypoplasia in 2 patients (5.7 %), and encephalocele in 1 patient (2.9 %). Patients were symptomatic for a mean of 6.3 months (range, less than 1 month to 36 months) prior to diagnosis of CDI. Growth hormone (GH), thyrotropin (TSH), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), and gonadotropin deficiencies were present at diagnosis in 34, 23, 23, and 6 % of patients, respectively. GH, TSH, ACTH, and gonadotropin deficiencies were diagnosed during follow-up in 23, 40, 37, and 14 % of patients, respectively. In patients with structural CNS abnormalities, development of additional hormone deficiencies occurred anywhere from 2 months to 13 years after the time of initial presentation.

Medullary volume is decreased in older Wfs1-ex5-KO232 rats, with the largest decreases at the level of the inferior olive. Finally, older Wfs1-ex5-KO232 rats show retinal gliosis and optic nerve atrophy at 15 months of age. Electron microscopy revealed axonal degeneration and disorganization of the myelin in the optic nerves of older Wfs1-ex5-KO232 rats.

847,PMC8829706,"The urine concentrating function of the kidney is essential to maintain the water homeostasis of the human body. It is mainly regulated by the arginine-vasopressin (AVP), which targets the type 2 vasopressin receptor (V2R) in the kidney. The inability of V2R to respond to AVP stimulation leads to decreased urine concentration and congenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI). NDI is characterized by polyuria, polydipsia, and hyposthenuria. In this study, we identified a point mutation (S127F) in the AVPR2 gene of an NDI patient, and we characterized the impaired function of the V2R mutant in HEK293 cells. Based on our data, the S127F-V2R mutant is almost exclusively located intracellularly in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and very few receptors were detected at the cell surface, where the receptor can bind to AVP. The overexpressed S127F-V2R mutant receptor has negligible cAMP generation capability compared to the wild-type receptor in response to AVP stimulation. Since certain misfolded mutant proteins, that are retained in the ER, can be rescued by pharmacological chaperones, we examined the potential rescue effects of two pharmacochaperones on the S127F-V2R. We found that pretreatment with both tolvaptan (an established V2R inverse agonist) and MCF14 compound (a cell-permeable high-affinity agonist for the V2R) were capable of partially restoring the cAMP generating function of the receptor in response to vasopressin stimulation. According to our data, both cell permeant agonists and antagonists can function as pharmacochaperones, and serve as the starting compounds to develop medicines for patients carrying the S127F mutation.",2022 Jan 25,Functional Rescue of a Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus Causing Mutation in the V2 Vasopressin Receptor by Specific Antagonist and Agonist Pharmacochaperones,Frontiers in Pharmacology
848,PMC6944832,"Although increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation is a major mechanism leading to cardiac remodeling in diabetes mellitus, research into the effects of anti‐oxidation on diabetic cardiac remodeling remains scarce and controversial. Glucagon‐like peptide‐1 (GLP‐1) shows potential anti‐oxidative effects besides lowering blood glucose. The objective of this research was to investigate the effects of GLP‐1 on cardiac remodeling and the molecular mechanism involved in diabetes mellitus.
Streptozotocin‐induced diabetic rats received exenatide treatment for 3 months. Cardiac function, cardiac weight index and myocardial interstitial fibrosis were measured. Cardiomyocytes were cultured in high‐glucose medium with GLP‐1 treatment. The ROS production, apoptosis and the levels of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1/p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase protein expression in cardiomyocytes were analyzed.
Experimental diabetes mellitus showed impaired cardiac diastolic function, increased brain natriuretic peptide expression and increased interstitial collagen deposition in the myocardium, which were ameliorated by exenatide treatment. Exenatide reduced myocardial ROS production and apoptosis in diabetes mellitus. Also, high glucose‐induced ROS generation and apoptosis in cardiomyocytes were inhibited by GLP‐1, as well as the levels of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1/p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase phosphorylation. Furthermore, GLP‐1 treatment upregulated adenosine monophosphate‐activated protein kinase activity in high‐glucose‐induced cardiomyocyte.
Glucagon‐like peptide‐1 protects the cardiomyocytes from oxidative stress and apoptosis in diabetes mellitus, which might contribute to the improvement of cardiac remodeling. The cardiac protection of GLP‐1 might be dependent on inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1/p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase, through an adenosine monophosphate‐activated protein kinase‐mediated pathway.

849,PMC8771544,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic systemic disease with increasing prevalence globally. An important aspect of diabetic pathogenesis is cellular crosstalk and information exchange between multiple metabolic organs and tissues. In the past decade, increasing evidence suggested that extracellular vesicles (EVs), a class of cell-derived membrane vesicles that transmit information and perform inter-cellular and inter-organ communication, are involved in the pathological changes of insulin resistance (IR), inflammation, and endothelial injury, and implicated in the development of DM and its complications. The biogenesis and cargo sorting machinery dysregulation of EVs may mediate their pathogenic roles under diabetic conditions. Moreover, the biogenesis of EVs, their ubiquitous production by different cells, their function as mediators of inter-organ communication, and their biological features in body fluids have generated great promise as biomarkers and clinical treatments. In this review, we summarize the components of EV generation and sorting machinery and highlight their role in the pathogenesis of DM and associated complications. Furthermore, we discuss the emerging clinical implications of EVs as potential biomarkers and therapeutic strategies for DM and diabetic complications.

Serum specimens were collected from 1,024 Japanese children (426 boys and 598 girls) in 2013. The median age at diagnosis was 7 years (0–18 years). The blood specimens were obtained at a median age of 13 years (2–22 years).
Among the 628 children whose serum specimens were collected within 5 years after diagnosis, the rate of GADAb positivity was 47.9% using RIA and 69.4% using ELISA. The participants were divided into four groups according to their RIA and ELISA results for GADAb as follows: group I (RIA+/ELISA+), group II (RIA+/ELISA−), group III (RIA−/ELISA+) and group IV (RIA−/ELISA−). The clinical and genetic characteristics of group I and group III were quite similar in terms of age at diagnosis, male/female ratio, relatively high positive rates for both autoantibody to protein tyrosine phosphatase IA‐2 and autoantibody to the cation efflux transporter zinc transporter 8, and human leukocyte antigen genotype. Group II contained just five patients, and was characterized by a younger age at diagnosis, low positive rates for both autoantibody to protein tyrosine phosphatase IA‐2 and autoantibody to the cation efflux transporter zinc transporter 8, and a unique human leukocyte antigen genotype. If the positive rates of either autoantibody to protein tyrosine phosphatase IA‐2 or autoantibody to the cation efflux transporter zinc transporter 8 or both were added to the GADAb results using RIA, the percentage of autoimmune type 1 diabetes increased from 47.9% to 78.5%.

We conducted a cross‐sectional analysis of data from an ethnically diverse sample of 588 408 individuals aged ≥18 years, registered to 98% of general practices (primary care) in London, UK. The outcome of interest was prevalent Type 2 diabetes.
Relative to people without severe mental illness, the relative risk of Type 2 diabetes in people with severe mental illness was greatest in the youngest age groups. In the white British group the relative risks were 9.99 (95% CI 5.34, 18.69) in those aged 18–34 years, 2.89 (95% CI 2.43, 3.45) in those aged 35–54 years and 1.16 (95% CI 1.04, 1.30) in those aged ≥55 years, with similar trends across all ethnic minority groups. Additional adjustment for anti‐psychotic prescriptions only marginally attenuated the associations. Assessment of estimated prevalence of Type 2 diabetes in severe mental illness by ethnicity (absolute measures of effect) indicated that the association between severe mental illness and Type 2 diabetes was more marked in ethnic minorities than in the white British group with severe mental illness, especially for Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi individuals with severe mental illness.
The relative risk of Type 2 diabetes is elevated in younger populations. Most associations persisted despite adjustment for anti‐psychotic prescriptions. Ethnic minority groups had a higher prevalence of Type 2 diabetes in the presence of severe mental illness. Future research and policy, particularly with respect to screening and clinical care for Type 2 diabetes in populations with severe mental illness, should take these findings into account.
There is limited evidence of the association of severe mental illness with Type 2 diabetes mellitus in ethnic minorities.
Using data from >500 000 people, we established that: (1) risk of Type 2 diabetes was increased up to 10‐fold in people with severe mental illness compared with groups without severe mental illness, irrespective of ethnicity, and was greatest in the youngest age groups; (2) prevalence of Type 2 diabetes was highest in Bangladeshi people with severe mental illness but was also high in all other South Asian, black African and black Caribbean groups; and (3) most associations persisted despite adjustment for anti‐psychotic prescriptions.",2017 Jan 30,Type 2 diabetes mellitus in people with severe mental illness: inequalities by ethnicity and age.

854,PMC7834928,"High levels of psychosocial distress are correlated with worse glycemic control as measured by glycosylated hemoglobin levels (HbA1c). Some interventions specifically targeting diabetes distress have been shown to lead to lower HbA1c values, but the underlying mechanisms mediating this improvement are unknown. In addition, while type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) disproportionately affects low-income racial and ethnic minority populations, it is unclear whether interventions targeting distress are differentially effective depending on participants’ baseline characteristics.
Our objective was to evaluate the mediators and moderators that would inform interventions for improvements in both glycemic control and diabetes distress.
Our target population included 290 Veterans Affairs patients with T2D enrolled in a comparative effectiveness trial of peer support alone versus technology-enhanced peer support with primary and secondary outcomes including HbA1c and diabetes distress at 6 months. Participants in both arms had significant improvements in both HbA1c and diabetes distress at 6 months, so the arms were pooled for all analyses. Goal setting, perceived competence, intrinsic motivation, and decisional conflict were evaluated as possible mediators of improvements in both diabetes distress and HbA1c. Baseline patient characteristics evaluated as potential moderators included age, race, highest level of education attained, employment status, income, health literacy, duration of diabetes, insulin use, baseline HbA1c, diabetes-specific social support, and depression.
Among the primarily African American male veterans with T2D, the median age was 63 (SD 10.2) years with a baseline mean HbA1c of 9.1% (SD 1.7%). Improvements in diabetes distress were correlated with improvements in HbA1c in both bivariate and multivariable models adjusted for age, race, health literacy, duration of diabetes, and baseline HbA1c. Improved goal setting and perceived competence were found to mediate both the improvements in diabetes distress and in HbA1c, together accounting for 20% of the effect of diabetes distress on change in HbA1c. Race and insulin use were found to be significant moderators of improvements in diabetes distress and improved HbA1c.
Prior studies have demonstrated that some but not all interventions that improve diabetes distress can lead to improved glycemic control. This study found that both improved goal setting and perceived competence over the course of the peer support intervention mediated both improved diabetes distress and improved HbA1c. This suggests that future interventions targeting diabetes distress should also incorporate elements to increase goal setting and perceived competence. The intervention effect of improvements in diabetes distress on glycemic control in peer support may be more pronounced among White and insulin-dependent veterans. Additional research is needed to understand how to better target diabetes distress and glycemic control in other vulnerable populations.",2021 Jan 11,Diabetes Distress and Glycemic Control in Type 2 Diabetes: Mediator and Moderator Analysis of a Peer Support Intervention,JMIR Diabetes
855,PMC8504906,"We aimed to examine the association between diabetes‐related parameters and hippocampal and parahippocampal gyrus atrophy (HPGA) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus to elucidate the risk factors for HPGA, which is often accompanied by Alzheimer’s disease.
A total of 137 patients aged ≥50 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus (mean age 67.8 ± 9.8 years) underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging scans and comprehensive health examinations. We measured the volume of interest – a portion of the inner temporal lobe that includes the hippocampus, amygdala and entorhinal cortex (frontal part of the parahippocampal gyrus) – using the voxel‐based specific regional analysis system for Alzheimer’s disease in each patient. The diabetes‐related parameters included glycated hemoglobin, fasting plasma glucose, C‐peptide (CPR) index (serum CPR / fasting plasma glucose × 100) and duration of diabetes.
The mean glycated hemoglobin was 9.3 ± 2.2%, the median CPR index was 1.29 (interquartile range 0.85–1.74) and the median duration of diabetes was 10 years (interquartile range 3–20 years). The severity score of volume of interest atrophy was >1.0 in 36 patients. Using multivariate logistic regression analysis, we found that age (odds ratio 1.09, 95% confidence interval 1.02–1.15) and CPR index (odds ratio 0.451, 95% confidence interval 0.216–0.940) were significantly associated with HPGA.
Lower insulin secretion was significantly associated with HPGA in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The results of this study support the hypothesis that insulin‐signaling abnormalities are involved in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer’s disease.

856,PMC8582904,"In Myanmar, the escalating prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and impaired glucose tolerance among adults was recently reported, with the highest prevalence in the Yangon Region. The aim of the present study was to identify the risk factors in dietary habits and their relationship with T2DM in urban Myanmar residents. We conducted a case–control study recruiting 300 individuals aged 25–74 years living in the Yangon Region, consisting of 150 newly diagnosed cases attending a diabetes clinic, and 150 controls, who were community residents and free of diabetes. The case group had a significantly higher consumption of noodles, fish, beans, fermented food and pickles, dried food, topping seasonings, and non-dairy milk products than the control group, whereas they had a lower vegetable intake (more than three servings/day) and fruit intake (more than three servings/day) than the control group. Furthermore, the case group exhibited a higher frequency of some dietary behaviors than the control group, such as (1) having meals with family, (2) skipping breakfast, and (3) eating out. The final model showed that topping seasonings (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 11.23, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.08–40.90), more than three servings/day of vegetable intake (aOR 0.18, 95% CI 0.05–0.67), and having meals with family (aOR 2.23, 95% CI 1.05–4.71) were associated with diabetes. The study suggests that Myanmar’s characteristic dietary culture of topping their meals with salty seasonings and sauces and eating multiple dishes together as a family are risk factors associated with T2DM. Our findings may contribute recommendations and opportunities for the primary prevention of T2DM in urban Myanmar.",2021 Oct 21,"Association between Dietary Habits and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Yangon, Myanmar: A Case–Control Study",International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health
857,PMC6391302,"Objective: Gestational diabetes mellitus is the most common metabolic and endocrine perinatal complication and is a growing health problem worldwide. Considering the fetal programming and its contribution as one of the evolutionary origins of human diseases, it is very important to improve the glucose metabolism in pregnant women, determination of other nutrients, preventing excessive accumulation of fetal fats, emphasis on weight loss measures before pregnancy, dietary intake with low-fat healthy food and prevention of abundant weight loss. In this paper, we have provided a brief review on dietary intake and dietary interventions in GDM from the perspective of nutrition science attending the physiopathology and etiology of the disease. 
 Materials and methods: Electronic search for English and Persian articles has been perform in databases, including Google Scholar, PubMed ,Scopus, Cochrane central ,Science direct, ISC, SID, Magiran, Iran Medex, and Med Libby key words: gestational diabetes, gestational diabetes mellitus, nutrition, macronutrient, micronutrient, Diabetes. All available articles (cross-sectional, descriptive-analytic, and clinical studies with desirable design and review quality studies were used. Reference books including Krause's Food and the Nutrition Care, The Williams Obstetrics editions of the 14th (2017) and the 24th edition (2014) were also reviewed.
 Results: Nutrition therapy and physical activity are the initial treatment of GDM. Proper and flexible methods of nutrition therapy that successfully regulate maternal glycaemia while improving expected fetal growth have extensive concepts. Meanwhile, dietary supplements with proven beneficial effects can play an important role in improving deficiencies and improving the metabolic profile of patients.

858,PMC8156444,"The global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic was associated with multiple organ failure and comorbidities, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Risk factors, such as age, gender, and obesity, were associated with COVID-19 infection. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is known to use several host receptors for viral entry, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) in the lung and other organs. However, ACE2 could be shed from the surface to be soluble ACE2 (sACE2) in the circulation. The epigenetic factors affecting ACE2 expression include a type of small non-coding RNAs called microRNAs (miRNAs). In this study, we aimed at exploring the status of the sACE2 as well as serum levels of several upstream novel miRNAs as non-invasive biomarkers that might have a potential role in T2DM patients. Serum samples were collected from 50 T2DM patients and 50 healthy controls, and sACE2 levels were quantified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Also, RNA was extracted, and TaqMan miRNA reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was performed to measure serum miRNA levels. Our results revealed that sACE2 is decreased in the T2DM patients and is affected by age, gender, and obesity level. Additionally, 4 miRNAs, which are revealed by in silico analysis to be potentially upstream of ACE2 were detectable in the serum. Among them, miR-421 level was found to be decreased in the serum of diabetic patients, regardless of the presence or absence of diabetic complications, as well as being differential in various body mass index (BMI) groups. The other 3 miRNAs (miR-3909, miR-212-5p, and miR-4677-3p) showed associations with multiple factors including age, gender, BMI, and serum markers, in addition to being correlated to each other. In conclusion, our study reveals a decline in the circulating serum levels of sACE2 in T2DM patients and identified 4 novel miRNAs that were associated with T2DM, which are influenced by different clinical and demographic factors.",2021 May 17,Circulating Soluble ACE2 and Upstream microRNA Expressions in Serum of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients,International Journal of Molecular Sciences

860,PMC4020724,"Diabetes mellitus is a group of diseases associated with various metabolic disorders, the main feature of which is chronic hyperglycemia due to insufficient insulin action. Its pathogenesis involves both genetic and environmental factors. The long‐term persistence of metabolic disorders can cause susceptibility to specific complications and also foster arteriosclerosis. Diabetes mellitus is associated with a broad range of clinical presentations, from being asymptomatic to ketoacidosis or coma, depending on the degree of metabolic disorder.
Note: Those that cannot at present be classified as any of the above are called unclassifiable.
The occurrence of diabetes‐specific complications has not been confirmed in some of these conditions.
The occurrence of diabetes‐specific complications has not been confirmed in some of these conditions.
 A scheme of the relationship between etiology (mechanism) and patho‐physiological stages (states) of diabetes mellitus. Arrows pointing right represent worsening of glucose metabolism disorders (including onset of diabetes mellitus). Among the arrow lines,  indicates the condition classified as ‘diabetes mellitus’. Arrows pointing left represent improvement in the glucose metabolism disorder. The broken lines indicate events of low frequency. For example, in type 2 diabetes mellitus, infection can lead to ketoacidosis and require temporary insulin treatment for survival. Also, once diabetes mellitus has developed, it is treated as diabetes mellitus regardless of improvement in glucose metabolism, therefore, the arrow lines pointing left are filled in black. In such cases, a broken line is used, because complete normalization of glucose metabolism is rare.
The classification of glucose metabolism disorders is principally derived from etiology, and includes staging of pathophysiology based on the degree of deficiency of insulin action. These disorders are classified into four groups: (i) type 1 diabetes mellitus; (ii) type 2 diabetes mellitus; (iii) diabetes mellitus due to other specific mechanisms or diseases; and (iv) gestational diabetes mellitus. Type 1 diabetes is characterized by destruction of pancreatic β‐cells. Type 2 diabetes is characterized by combinations of decreased insulin secretion and decreased insulin sensitivity (insulin resistance). Glucose metabolism disorders in category (iii) are divided into two subgroups; subgroup A is diabetes in which a genetic abnormality has been identified, and subgroup B is diabetes associated with other pathologic disorders or clinical conditions. The staging of glucose metabolism includes normal, borderline and diabetic stages depending on the degree of hyperglycemia occurring as a result of the lack of insulin action or clinical condition. The diabetic stage is then subdivided into three substages: non‐insulin‐ requiring, insulin‐requiring for glycemic control, and insulin‐dependent for survival. The two former conditions are called non‐insulin‐dependent diabetes and the latter is known as insulin‐dependent diabetes. In each individual, these stages may vary according to the deterioration or the improvement of the metabolic state, either spontaneously or by treatment.
*Casual plasma glucose ≥200 mg/dL (≥11.1 mmol/L) and HbA1c≥6.5% are also regarded as to indicate diabetic type.
Even for normal type, if 1‐h value is 180 mg/dL (10.0 mmol/L), the risk of progression to diabetes mellitus is greater than for <180 mg/dL (10.0 mmol/L) and should be treated as with borderline type (follow‐up observation, etc.). Fasting plasma glucose level of 100–109 mg/dL (5.5–6.0 mmol/L) is called ‘high‐normal’: within the range of normal fasting plasma glucose.
Plasma glucose level after glucose load in oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is not included in casual plasma glucose levels. The value for HbA1c (%) is indicated with 0.4% added to HbA1c (JDS) (%).

Categories of the State of Glycemia:  Confirmation of chronic hyperglycemia is essential for the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. When plasma glucose levels are used to determine the categories of glycemia, patients are classified as having a diabetic type if they meet one of the following criteria: (i) fasting plasma glucose level of ≥126 mg/dL (≥7.0 mmol/L); (ii) 2‐h value of ≥200 mg/dL (≥11.1 mmol/L) in 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT); or (iii) casual plasma glucose level of ≥200 mg/dL (≥11.1 mmol/L). Normal type is defined as fasting plasma glucose level of <110 mg/dL (<6.1 mmol/L) and 2‐h value of <140 mg/dL (<7.8 mmol/L) in OGTT. Borderline type (neither diabetic nor normal type) is defined as falling between the diabetic and normal values. According to the current revision, in addition to the earlier listed plasma glucose values, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) has been given a more prominent position as one of the diagnostic criteria. That is, (iv) HbA1c≥6.5% is now also considered to indicate diabetic type. The value of HbA1c, which is equivalent to the internationally used HbA1c (%) (HbA1c [NGSP]) defined by the NGSP (National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program), is expressed by adding 0.4% to the HbA1c (JDS) (%) defined by the Japan Diabetes Society (JDS).
Subjects with borderline type have a high rate of developing diabetes mellitus, and correspond to the combination of impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) noted by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and WHO. Although borderline cases show few of the specific complications of diabetes mellitus, the risk of arteriosclerosis is higher than those of normal type. When HbA1c is 6.0–6.4%, suspected diabetes mellitus cannot be excluded, and when HbA1c of 5.6–5.9% is included, it forms a group with a high risk for developing diabetes mellitus in the future, even if they do not have it currently.
 If any of the criteria for diabetic type (i) through to (iv) is observed at the initial examination, the patient is judged to be ‘diabetic type’. Re‐examination is conducted on another day, and if ‘diabetic type’ is reconfirmed, diabetes mellitus is diagnosed. However, a diagnosis cannot be made only by the re‐examination of HbA1c alone. Moreover, if the plasma glucose values (any of criteria [i], [ii], or [iii]) and the HbA1c (criterion [iv]) in the same blood sample both indicate diabetic type, diabetes mellitus is diagnosed based on the initial examination alone. If HbA1c is used, it is essential that the plasma glucose level (criteria [i], [ii] or [iii]) also indicates diabetic type for a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. When diabetes mellitus is suspected, HbA1c should be measured at the same time as examination for plasma glucose.
 If the plasma glucose level indicates diabetic type (any of [i], [ii], or [iii]) and either of the following conditions exists, diabetes mellitus can be diagnosed immediately at the initial examination.
 The presence of typical symptoms of diabetes mellitus (thirst, polydipsia, polyuria, weight loss)
 The presence of definite diabetic retinopathy
 If it can be confirmed that the above conditions 1 or 2 existed in the past, diabetes mellitus can be diagnosed or suspected regardless of the current test results.
 If the diagnosis of diabetes cannot be established by these procedures, the patient is followed up and re‐examined after an appropriate interval.
 The physician should assess not only the presence or absence of diabetes, but also its etiology and glycemic stage, and the presence and absence of diabetic complications or associated conditions.
Clinical Diagnosis:   
Epidemiological Study:  For the purpose of estimating the frequency of diabetes mellitus, ‘diabetes mellitus’ can be substituted for the determination of ‘diabetic type’ from a single examination. In this case, HbA1c≥6.5% alone can be defined as ‘diabetes mellitus’.
Health Screening:  It is important not to misdiagnose diabetes mellitus, and thus clinical information such as family history and obesity should be referred to at the time of screening in addition to an index for plasma glucose level.
Gestational Diabetes Mellitus:  There are two hyperglycemic disorders in pregnancy: (i) gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM); and (ii) diabetes mellitus. GDM is diagnosed if one or more of the following criteria is met in a 75 g OGTT during pregnancy:
 Fasting plasma glucose level of ≥92 mg/dL (5.1 mmol/L)
 1‐h value of ≥180 mg/dL (10.0 mmol/L)
 2‐h value of ≥153 mg/dL (8.5 mmol/L)
However, diabetes mellitus that is diagnosed by the clinical diagnosis of diabetes mellitus defined earlier is excluded from GDM.

We investigated their associations with chronic complications, determinants of biomarker levels and effects of fenofibrate in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) from Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes study.
Plasma NE and PR3 levels were quantified at baseline (n = 2000), and relationships with complications over 5-years assessed. Effects of fenofibrate on biomarker levels (n = 200) were determined at four follow-up visits.
Higher waist-to-hip ratio, homocysteine and C-reactive protein and lower apoA-II were determinants of higher NE and PR3 levels. Higher NE levels were associated with on-trial stroke and cardiovascular mortality, and higher PR3 levels with on-trial stroke, but associations were not significant after adjustment for confounding factors. Although higher NE and PR3 levels were associated with baseline total microvascular disease, only NE levels were associated with on-trial neuropathy or amputation. These associations were not significant after adjusting for multiple comparisons. NE and PR3 levels did not change with fenofibrate.
In T2DM plasma NE and PR3 levels are associated with vascular risk factors, and total microvascular disease at baseline, but on rigorous analyses were not associated with on-trial complications.

862,PMC2694244,"Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is characterized by a lack of response in the distal nephron to the antidiuretic hormone arginine vasopressin. Manifestations include polyuria, polydipsia, hyposthenuria, recurrent episodes of dehydration and fever and growth failure. Most cases are caused by mutations in the AVPR2 gene. The mutant receptors are trapped intracellularly.
We studied five boys using clinical, laboratory and molecular data. The mean age at diagnosis was 14.6 months (range 6 to 24) and 12.2 years (7.8 to 19) after the follow-up period. The mean period of follow-up was 132.2 ± 50.9 months.
The geometric means of the z-scores of weight and stature were −4.5 and −3.6, respectively, at diagnosis. At the last medical appointment, the z-scores of weight and stature were −0.3 and −0.9, respectively. Three patients were diagnosed with ureterohydronephrosis and exhibited increased post-void urine volume. Mutations in the AVPR2 gene were found in all patients, and the carrier status was confirmed in four of five cases. Two unrelated children presented identical mutations (S167L) in arginine vasopressin R2. Two of the patients had a mutation that has already been described in other Brazilian families (R337X), and one patient showed a de novo mutation (Y128D) in arginine vasopressin R2, since his mother’s molecular analysis was normal. The recurrence risk for this family was significantly reduced.

863,PMC7467518,"Diabetes mellitus is common and growing in prevalence, and an increasing proportion of people with diabetes are living to older age. Frailty is, therefore, becoming an important concept in diabetes. Frailty is associated with older age and describes a state of increased susceptibility to decompensation in response to physiological stress. A range of measures have been used to quantify frailty. This systematic review aims to identify measures used to quantify frailty in people with diabetes (any type); to summarise the prevalence of frailty in diabetes; and to describe the relationship between frailty and adverse clinical outcomes in people with diabetes.
Three electronic databases (Medline, Embase and Web of Science) will be searched from 2000 to November 2019 and supplemented by citation searching of relevant articles and hand searching of reference lists. Two reviewers will independently review titles, abstracts and full texts. Inclusion criteria include: (1) adults with any type of diabetes mellitus; (2) quantify frailty using any validated frailty measure; (3) report the prevalence of frailty and/or the association between frailty and clinical outcomes in people with diabetes; (4) studies that assess generic (eg, mortality, hospital admission and falls) or diabetes-specific outcomes (eg, hypoglycaemic episodes, cardiovascular events, diabetic nephropathy and diabetic retinopathy); (5) cross-sectional and longitudinal observational studies. Study quality will be assessed using the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale for observational studies. Clinical and methodological heterogeneity will be assessed, and a random effects meta-analysis performed if appropriate. Otherwise, a narrative synthesis will be performed.

864,PMC7170456,"To conduct a comprehensive review of studies of glycaemic deterioration in type 2 diabetes and identify the major factors influencing progression.
We conducted a systematic literature search with terms linked to type 2 diabetes progression. All the included studies were summarized based upon the factors associated with diabetes progression and how the diabetes progression was defined.
Our search yielded 2785 articles; based on title, abstract and full‐text review, we included 61 studies in the review. We identified seven criteria for diabetes progression: ‘Initiation of insulin’, ‘Initiation of oral antidiabetic drug’, ‘treatment intensification’, ‘antidiabetic therapy failure’, ‘glycaemic deterioration’, ‘decline in beta‐cell function’ and ‘change in insulin dose’. The determinants of diabetes progression were grouped into phenotypic, ethnicity and genotypic factors. Younger age, poorer glycaemia and higher body mass index at diabetes diagnosis were the main phenotypic factors associated with rapid progression. The effect of genotypic factors on progression was assessed using polygenic risk scores (PRS); a PRS constructed from the genetic variants linked to insulin resistance was associated with rapid glycaemic deterioration. The evidence of impact of ethnicity on progression was inconclusive due to the small number of multi‐ethnic studies.
We have identified the major determinants of diabetes progression—younger age, higher BMI, higher HbA1c and genetic insulin resistance. The impact of ethnicity is uncertain; there is a clear need for more large‐scale studies of diabetes progression in different ethnic groups.
The aim of this comprehensive review was to identify the determinants of type 2 diabetes progression.

865,PMC1657029,"Congenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) is a rare X-linked inherited disorder characterized by the excretion of large volumes of diluted urine and caused by mutations in arginine vasopressin receptor 2 (AVPR2) gene. To investigate the mutation of AVPR2 gene in a Chinese family with congenital NDI, we screened AVPR2 gene in two NDI patients and eight family members by PCR amplification and direct sequencing.
Five specific fragments, covering entire coding sequence and their flanking intronic sequences of AVPR2 gene, were not observed in both patients, while those fragments were all detected in the control subjects. Several different fragments around the AVPR2 locus were amplified step by step. It was revealed that a genomic fragment of 5,995-bp, which contained the entire AVPR2 gene and the last exon (exon 22) of the C1 gene, was deleted and a 3-bp (GAG) was inserted. Examination of the other family members showed that the mothers and the grandmother were carriers for this deletion.

Retrospective multicenter cohort study including 56 patients with IIH and 60 patients with PH.
All patients underwent extensive endocrine testing. Data on age, gender, symptoms, endocrine dysfunction, MRI, immunotherapeutic agents and autoimmune diseases were collected.
Median time of follow-up was 18 months in IIH and 69 months in PH. The median time from initiation of immunotherapy to IIH diagnosis was 3 months. IIH affected males more frequently than PH (p < 0.001) and led to more impaired pituitary axes in males (p < 0.001). The distribution of deficient adenohypophysial axes was comparable between both entities, however, central hypocortisolism was more frequent (p < 0.001) and diabetes insipidus considerably less frequent in IIH (p < 0.001). Symptoms were similar except that visual impairment occurred more rarely in IIH (p < 0.001). 20 % of IIH patients reported no symptoms at all. Regarding MRI, pituitary stalk thickening was less frequent in IIH (p = 0.009). Concomitant autoimmune diseases were more prevalent in PH patients before the diagnosis of hypophysitis (p = 0.003) and more frequent in IIH during follow-up (p = 0.002).

It has been estimated to represent around 1% to 6% of all diabetes. With the advances in genome sequencing technology, it is possible to diagnose more monogenic diabetes cases than ever before. In Korea, 11 studies have identified several monogenic diabetes cases, using Sanger sequencing and whole exome sequencing since 2001. The recent largest study, using targeted exome panel sequencing, found a molecular diagnosis rate of 21.1% for monogenic diabetes in clinically suspected patients.

869,PMC4333328,"Objective. This study investigates the association of homocysteine and cortisol with psychological factors in type 2 diabetic patients. Method. Homocysteine, cortisol, and psychological variables were analyzed from 131 diabetic patients. Psychological factors were assessed with the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQ), Hostility and Direction of Hostility Questionnaire (HDHQ), the Symptom Checklist 90-R (SCL 90-R), the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (ZDRS), and the Maudsley O-C Inventory Questionnaire (MOCI). Blood samples were taken by measuring homocysteine and cortisol in both subgroups during the initial phase of the study (T0). One year later (T1), the uncontrolled diabetic patients were reevaluated with the use of the same psychometric instruments and with an identical blood analysis. Results. The relation of psychoticism and homocysteine is positive among controlled diabetic patients (P value = 0.006 < 0.05) and negative among uncontrolled ones (P value = 0.137). Higher values of cortisol correspond to lower scores on extraversion subscale (r p = −0.223, P value = 0.010). Controlled diabetic patients showed a statistically significant negative relationship between homocysteine and the act-out hostility subscale (r sp = −0.247, P = 0.023). There is a statistically significant relationship between homocysteine and somatization (r sp = −0.220, P = 0.043). Conclusions.

Using patients with neither coronary artery disease nor diabetes as reference (cumulative myocardial infarction incidence 2.6%), the risk of myocardial infarction was low and not substantially increased for patients with diabetes alone (3.2%; hazard ratio 1.202, 95% confidence interval 0.996−1.451), was increased for patients with coronary artery disease alone (9.3%; hazard ratio 2.75, 95% confidence interval 2.52−3.01) and was highest for patients with both coronary artery disease and diabetes (12.3%; hazard ratio 3.79, 95% confidence interval 3.43−4.20). Similar associations were observed for cardiac death and coronary revascularization.
Diabetes patients without coronary artery disease by coronary angiography have a low risk of myocardial infarction, not substantially increased compared to patients with neither coronary artery disease nor diabetes. In the presence of coronary artery disease, however, diabetes increases the risk of myocardial infarction.",2020 Jul 28,Diabetes is not a risk factor for myocardial infarction in patients without coronary artery disease: A study from the Western Denmark Heart Registry,Diabetes & Vascular Disease Research
871,PMC3789687,"Using bioinformatics analysis, we previously identified salusin-β, an endogenous bioactive peptide with diverse physiological activities. Salusin-β is abundantly expressed in the neuroendocrine system and in systemic endocrine cells/macrophages. Salusin-β acutely regulates hemodynamics and chronically induces atherosclerosis, but its unique physicochemical characteristics to tightly adhere to all types of plastic and glassware have prevented elucidation of its precise pathophysiological role. To quantitate plasma total salusin-β concentrations, we produced rabbit and chicken polyclonal antibodies against the C- and N-terminal end sequences, circumvented its sticky nature, and successfully established a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Salusin-β was abundantly present in the plasma of healthy volunteers, ranging from 1.9 to 6.6 nmol/L. Reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography analysis showed that a single immunoreactive salusin-β peak coincided with synthetic authentic salusin-β. Plasma salusin-β concentrations were unaffected by postural changes and by potent vasopressin release stimuli, such as hypertonic saline infusion or smoking. However, salusin-β concentrations showed significant circadian variation; concentrations were high during the daytime and reached the lowest concentrations in the early morning. Plasma salusin-β levels in subjects with diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, and cerebrovascular disease showed distinctly higher levels than healthy controls. Patients with panhypopituitarism combined with complete central diabetes insipidus also showed significantly higher plasma salusin-β levels. Therefore, the ELISA system developed in this study will be useful for evaluating circulating total salusin-β levels and for confirming the presence of authentic salusin-β in human plasma. The obtained results suggest a limited contribution of the neuroendocrine system to peripheral total salusin-β concentrations and a role for plasma total salusin-β concentrations as an indicator of systemic vascular diseases.",2013 Oct 3,"Circulating Levels of Human salusin-β,a Potent Hemodynamic and Atherogenesis Regulator",PLoS ONE
872,PMC7547417,"Disorders of water and sodium balance can occur after brain injury. Prolonged polyuria resulting from central diabetes insipidus and cerebral salt wasting complicated by gradient washout and a type of secondary nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, however, has not been described previously, to the best of our knowledge. We report an unusual case of an infant with glioblastoma who, after tumor resection, was treated for concurrent central diabetes insipidus and cerebral salt wasting complicated by secondary nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.
A 5-month-old Hispanic girl was found to have a large, hemorrhagic, suprasellar glioblastoma causing obstructive hydrocephalus. Prior to mass resection, she developed central diabetes insipidus. Postoperatively, she continued to have central diabetes insipidus and concurrent cerebral salt wasting soon after. She was managed with a vasopressin infusion, sodium supplementation, fludrocortisone, and urine output replacements. Despite resolution of her other major medical issues, she remained in the pediatric intensive care unit for continual and aggressive management of water and sodium derangements. Starting on postoperative day 18, her polyuria began increasing dramatically and did not abate with increasing vasopressin. Nephrology was consulted. Her blood urea nitrogen was undetectable during this time, and it was thought that she may have developed a depletion of inner medullary urea and osmotic gradient: a “gradient washout.” Supplemental dietary protein was added to her enteral nutrition, and her fluid intake was decreased. Within 4 days, her blood urea nitrogen increased, and her vasopressin and fluid replacement requirements significantly decreased. She was transitioned soon thereafter to subcutaneous desmopressin and transferred out of the pediatric intensive care unit.
Gradient washout has not been widely reported in humans, although it has been observed in the mammalian kidneys after prolonged polyuria. Although not a problem with aquaporin protein expression or production, gradient washout causes a different type of secondary nephrogenic diabetes insipidus because the absence of a medullary gradient impairs water reabsorption. We report a case of an infant who developed complex water and sodium imbalances after brain injury. Prolonged polyuria resulting from both water and solute diuresis with low enteral protein intake was thought to cause a urea gradient washout and secondary nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. The restriction of fluid replacements and supplementation of enteral protein appeared adequate to restore the renal osmotic gradient and efficacy of vasopressin.",2020 Oct 10,Gradient washout and secondary nephrogenic diabetes insipidus after brain injury in an infant: a case report,Journal of Medical Case Reports
873,PMC2992517,"Diabetes Mellitus is a global health problem. Scientific knowledge on the genetics of diabetes is expanding and is more and more utilised in clinical practice and primary prevention strategies. Health consumers have become increasingly interested in genetic information. In the Netherlands, the National Genetic Research and Information Center provides online information about the genetics of diabetes and thereby offers website visitors the opportunity to ask a question per email. The current study aims at exploring people's need of (additional) information about the role of inheritance in diabetes. Results may help to tailor existing clinical and public (online) genetic information to the needs of an increasing population at risk for diabetes.
A data base with emailed questions about diabetes and inheritance (n = 172) is used in a secondary content analysis. Questions are posted in 2005-2009 via a website providing information about more than 600 inheritable disorders, including all diabetes subtypes. Queries submitted were classified by contents as well as persons' demographic profiles.
Questions were received by diabetes patients (49%), relatives (30%), and partners (21%). Questioners were relatively young (54.8% ≤ 30 years) and predominantly female (83%). Most queries related to type 1 diabetes and concerned topics related to (future) pregnancy and family planning. Questioners mainly asked for risk estimation, but also clarifying information (about genetics of diabetes in general) and advice (mostly related to family planning) was requested. Preventive advice to reduce own diabetes risk was hardly sought.
Genetic information on diabetes provided by professionals or public health initiatives should address patients, as well as relatives and partners. In particular women are receptive to genetic information; they worry about the diabetes related health of (future) offspring. It seems important that information on the contribution of genetics to type 1 diabetes is more readily available. Considering the high prevalence of type 2 diabetes with strong evidence for a genetic predisposition, more effort seems needed to promote awareness around familial clustering and primary prevention.",2010 Nov 10,"""I am pregnant and my husband has diabetes.

We aimed to determine the relationship between diabetes mellitus and tooth extraction due to periodontal disease and dental caries. Japan’s second nationwide survey data collected from 4 June to 10 June 2018 was used to identify reasons for tooth extraction among patients aged > 40 years. General dentists collected information on patients who underwent tooth extraction procedures, and the presence of diabetes mellitus was determined through interviews. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to investigate the relationship between diabetes mellitus and the reasons for tooth extraction, including periodontal disease and dental caries. In total, 2345 dentists responded to the survey (response rate 44.8%). We analyzed data on 4625 extracted teeth from 3750 patients (1815 males and 1935 females). Among patients with self-reported diabetes mellitus, 55.4% had extractions due to periodontal disease compared to 46.7% of such extractions among those without self-reported diabetes mellitus. Self-reported diabetes mellitus was significantly associated with tooth extraction due to periodontal disease. No significant differences were observed in dental caries according to self-reported diabetes mellitus status.

The classically described presentation is of insulin-dependent diabetes, followed by optic atrophy, central diabetes insipidus, and sensory neural deafness. Also included are less well-described presentations of Wolframs syndrome. We here present three cases of atypical presentation of this syndrome.
A 15-year-old boy with insulin-dependent diabetes was presented for evaluation of depressive symptoms associated with suicidal tendency. Neuropsychiatric manifestations are described with Wolframs syndrome, and wolframin gene, in recessive inheritance, is associated with psychiatric illnesses without other manifestations of Wolframs syndrome.

876,PMC2896346,"Recently, several genome-wide and candidate gene association studies have identified many novel genetic loci for type 2 diabetes (T2D); among these genes, CDKAL1, IGF2BP2, SLC30A8, CDKN2A/B, HHEX, FTO, TCF2, KCNQ1, and WFS1 are the most important. We aimed to determine the effects of these genetic loci associated with T2D in the Chinese Han population of China.
Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in or near CDKAL1, IGF2BP2, SLC30A8, CDKN2A/B, HHEX, FTO, TCF2, KCNQ1, and WFS1 genes were genotyped in a case-control Chinese Han sample living in Beijing, China involving 1024 patients with T2D and 1005 control subjects.
In Chinese Han, we replicated the associations between 7 genetic loci and T2D, with risk allele-specific odds ratios (ORs) as follows: 1.27 (95% CI, 1.11-1.45; p = 0.0008) for CDKAL1-rs10946398, 1.26 (95% CI, 1.08-1.47; p = 0.003) for IGF2BP2-rs4402960, 1.19 (95% CI, 1.04-1.37; p = 0.009) for SLC30A8-rs13266634, 1.22 (95% CI, 1.06-1.41; p = 0.005) for CDKN2A/B-rs10811661, 1.20 (95% CI, 1.01-1.42; p = 0.03) for HHEX-rs5015480, 1.37 (95% CI, 1.19-1.69; p = 1.0 × 10-4) for KCNQ1-rs2237892, and 1.24 (95% CI, 1.01-1.52; p = 0.046) for FTO-rs8050136 after adjustment for age, gender, and body mass index. Not only did an association between WFS1-rs6446482 and early-onset T2D exist in the subgroup analysis, but TCF2-rs7501939 and WFS1-rs6446482 were also confirmed to confer risk for T2D in this meta-analysis. Moreover, the relationship between FTO-rs8050136 and body mass index, together with the effect of CDKAL1-rs10946398 on beta cell function, was also observed in the control individuals.

878,PMC6019415,"Insulin analog glargine (GLA) has been available as one of the therapeutic options for patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus to enhance glycemic control. Studies have shown that a decrease in the frequency of hypoglycemic episodes improves the quality of life (QoL) of diabetic patients. However, there are appreciable acquisition cost differences between different insulins. Consequently, there is a need to assess their impact on QoL to provide future guidance to health authorities.
A systematic review of multiple databases including Medline, LILACS, Cochrane, and EMBASE databases with several combinations of agreed terms involving randomized controlled trials and cohorts, as well as manual searches and gray literature, was undertaken. The primary outcome measure was a change in QoL. The quality of the studies and the risk of bias was also assessed.
Eight studies were eventually included in the systematic review out of 634 publications. Eight different QoL instruments were used (two generic, two mixed, and four specific), in which the Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (DTSQ) was the most used. The systematic review did not consistently show any significant difference overall in QoL scores, whether as part of subsets or combined into a single score, with the use of GLA versus neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin. Only in patient satisfaction measured by DTSQ was a better result consistently seen with GLA versus NPH insulin, but not using the Well-being Inquiry for Diabetics (WED) scale. However, none of the cohort studies scored a maximum on the Newcastle–Ottawa scale for quality, and they generally were of moderate quality with bias in the studies.
There was no consistent difference in QoL or patient-reported outcomes when the findings from the eight studies were collated. In view of this, we believe the current price differential between GLA and NPH insulin in Brazil cannot be justified by these findings.

880,PMC6686481,"Wolfram Syndrome (WFS) is a rare autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disease which has a wide spectrum of manifestations including diabetes insipidus, diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy and deafness. WFS1 and CISD2 are two main causing genes of WFS. The aim of this study was to illustrate the ophthalmologic manifestations and determine the genotype of Chinese WFS patients.
Completed ophthalmic examinations and family investigations were performed on 4 clinically diagnosed WFS patients from 4 unrelated families. Genetic testing was done by the next generation sequencing of candidate genes. One patient carried a homozygous mutation (c.272_273del) in CISD2, two patients carried compound heterozygous mutations (c.1618 T > G + c.2020G > A and c.1048 T > A + c.2020G > A) in WFS1, and one patient carried a heterozygous mutation (c.937C > T) in WFS1. Three of them were novel mutations.
Our study indicated WFS in Chinese is a neurodegenerative disease with both wide spectrum of clinical features and genetic heterogeneity. We found three novel mutations in WFS patients, and to our best knowledge, this is the first report of Chinese WFS patient with mutation in CISD2.

882,PMC4268805,"Multipotent mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSC) including adipose-derived stromal cells (ADSC) have been successfully applied for cardiovascular diseases treatment. Their regenerative potential is considered due to the multipotency, paracrine activity and immunologic privilege. However, therapeutic efficacy of autologous MSC for myocardial ischemia therapy is modest. We analyzed if ADSC properties are attenuated in patients with chronic diseases such as coronary artery disease (CAD) and diabetes mellitus type 2 (T2DM).
ADSC were isolated from subcutaneous fat tissue of patients without established cardiovascular diseases and metabolic disorders (control group, n = 19), patients with CAD only (n = 32) and patients with CAD and T2DM (n = 28). ADSC phenotype (flow cytometry) was CD90+/CD73+/CD105+/CD45−/CD31− and they were capable of adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation. ADSC morphology and immunophenotype were similar for all patients, but ADSC from patients with CAD and T2DM had higher proliferation activity and shorter telomeres compared to control patients.
ADSC conditioned media stimulated capillary-like tubes formation by endothelial cells (EA.hy926), but this effect significantly decreased for patients with CAD (p = 0.03) and with CAD + T2DM (p = 0.017) compared to the control group. Surprisingly we revealed significantly higher secretion of some pro-angiogenic factors (ELISA) by ADSC: vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) for patients with CAD and HGF and placental growth factor (PlGF) for patients with CAD + T2DM. Among angiogenesis inhibitors such as thrombospondin-1, endostatin and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) level of PAI-1 in ADSC conditioned media was significantly higher for patients with CAD and CAD + T2DM compared to the control group (p < 0.01). Inhibition of PAI-1 in ADSC conditioned media by neutralizing antibodies partially restored ADSC angiogenic activity (p = 0.017).
ADSC angiogenic activity is significantly declined in patients with CAD and T2DM, which could restrict the effectiveness of autologous ADSC cell therapy in these cohorts of patients. This impairment might be due to the disturbance in coordinated network of pro- and anti-angiogenic growth factors secreted by ADSC. Changes in ADSC secretome differ between patients with CAD and T2DM and further investigation are necessary to reveal the MSC-involved mechanisms of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases and develop novel approaches to their correction using the methods of regenerative medicine.

883,PMC8762284,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been one of the deadliest pandemics in recent decade. The virus has specifically targeted the comorbid population in terms of mortality. The present systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to determine the overall mortality and diabetes-associated mortality in COVID-19 patients.
To obtain the related data, six databases, including Pubmed, Embase, MEDLINE, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and DOAJ, were searched. The full-texts of articles presenting the data of COVID-19 mortality and diabetes-associated mortality were screened and retrieved. Statistical analysis was performed using the Stata (version 13). The odds ratio (OR) of mortality in diabetic patients was calculated with 95% confidence interval (CI). Random-effects model was used to synthesize data for the relevant outcomes. Heterogeneity was evaluated using I2 statistic. Forest plots visually showed the effect estimates of the included studies. We used funnel plots to evaluate potential publication bias. A two tailed P < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.
A total of 35 studies with 25,934 patients were finally included for meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of diabetes mellitus in patients with COVID-19 was 16.8% (n = 4381). The overall mortality seen in all the studies was 12.81% (n = 3159), and diabetes-associated mortality was 22.14% (n = 970). The pooled analysis of included studies showed that diabetes mellitus had a significantly higher mortality rate (22.14% vs. 12.81%, P < 0.05) with higher odds of death (pooled OR 1.83, 95% CI: 1.61 - 2.05). The funnel plot was symmetric, thereby indicating a low risk of publication bias.

885,PMC3973212,"Familial neurohypophysial diabetes insipidus (FNDI) characterized by progressive polyuria is mostly caused by mutations in the gene encoding neurophysin II (NPII), which is the carrier protein of the antidiuretic hormone, arginine vasopressin (AVP). Although accumulation of mutant NPII in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) could be toxic for AVP neurons, the precise mechanisms of cell death of AVP neurons, reported in autopsy studies, remain unclear. Here, we subjected FNDI model mice to intermittent water deprivation (WD) in order to promote the phenotypes. Electron microscopic analyses demonstrated that, while aggregates are confined to a certain compartment of the ER in the AVP neurons of FNDI mice with water access ad libitum, they were scattered throughout the dilated ER lumen in the FNDI mice subjected to WD for 4 weeks. It is also demonstrated that phagophores, the autophagosome precursors, emerged in the vicinity of aggregates and engulfed the ER containing scattered aggregates. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that expression of p62, an adapter protein between ubiquitin and autophagosome, was elicited on autophagosomal membranes in the AVP neurons, suggesting selective autophagy induction at this time point. Treatment of hypothalamic explants of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) transgenic mice with an ER stressor thapsigargin increased the number of GFP-LC3 puncta, suggesting that ER stress could induce autophagosome formation in the hypothalamus of wild-type mice as well. The cytoplasm of AVP neurons in FNDI mice was occupied with vacuoles in the mice subjected to WD for 12 weeks, when 30–40% of AVP neurons are lost. Our data thus demonstrated that autophagy was induced in the AVP neurons subjected to ER stress in FNDI mice. Although autophagy should primarily be protective for neurons, it is suggested that the organelles including ER were lost over time through autophagy, leading to autophagy-associated cell death of AVP neurons.",2014 Mar 27,Arginine vasopressin neuronal loss results from autophagy-associated cell death in a mouse model for familial neurohypophysial diabetes insipidus,Cell Death & Disease

In 2016, he was operated for a shoulder melanoma. In February 2018, imaging evaluation demonstrated metastases in lung, liver, and femur. Therefore, treatment with pembrolizumab (anti-programmed death 1) was scheduled in May 2018, but, before starting this therapy, a brain computed tomography performed for a sudden loss of consciousness detected a sellar mass of 17 × 12 mm, which extended to the pituitary stalk and compressed the optic chiasma. Focused magnetic resonance imaging confirmed the size and characteristics of the lesion, while emergency evaluation of the hormonal profile demonstrated an impairment of adrenal and thyroid function. The pituitary lesion demonstrated a remarkable shrinkage (8 × 6 mm), which was confirmed by subsequent imaging evaluations.
This is the first case reporting on effectiveness of immune checkpoint inhibitors in a patient with pituitary metastasis from a melanoma.",2021 Nov 11,Shrinkage of a pituitary metastasis of melanoma induced by pembrolizumab: a case report,Journal of Medical Case Reports
889,PMC6505246,"The rising prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) is a serious global health concern. The world is experiencing type 2 diabetes epidemics and prevalence differs by gender, regions, and level of socioeconomic development. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in men increased at a faster rate and numbers are continuing to rise in some regions of the world. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of T2DM among men in the Middle East countries. Seventy-four research articles were identified through search engines including Web of Science, Medline, PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and Ovid databases by using keywords “epidemiology,” “prevalence,” “diabetes mellitus,” and individual names of the Middle East states. Finally, 17 studies were included for the assessment of prevalence of T2DM among men in the Middle East. In the Middle East, high prevalence of T2DM among men was identified in Bahrain (33.60%), Saudi Arabia (29.10%), United Arab Emirates (UAE; 25.83%), and Kuwait (25.40%), whereas low prevalence was reported in Iran (9.90%) and Yemen (9.80%). The random pooled prevalence in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states was (24.0%) compared to non-GCC states (16.0%), and in both GCC and non-GCC countries combined, it was 19%. The prevalence was significantly associated with the gross domestic product of these states (p = .0005). Despite different socioeconomic and cultural settings in the Middle East, the rising T2DM prevalence among men was identified in Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Kuwait. These states must incorporate future diabetes defensive strategies targeting the Middle East population to minimize the burden of DM from the region.",2019 May 5,Prevalence of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Among Men in the Middle East: A Retrospective Study,American Journal of Men's Health
890,PMC7955378,"Severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) is characterized by a proinflammatory state with high mortality. Statins have anti‐inflammatory effects and may attenuate the severity of COVID‐19.
An observational study of all consecutive adult patients with COVID‐19 admitted to a single center located in Bronx, New York, was conducted from March 1, 2020, to May 2, 2020. Patients were grouped as those who did and those who did not receive a statin, and in‐hospital mortality was compared by competing events regression. In addition, propensity score matching and inverse probability treatment weighting were used in survival models to examine the association between statin use and death during hospitalization. A total of 4252 patients were admitted with COVID‐19. Diabetes mellitus modified the association between statin use and in‐hospital mortality. Patients with diabetes mellitus on a statin (n=983) were older (69±11 versus 67±14 years; P<0.01), had lower inflammatory markers (C‐reactive protein, 10.2; interquartile range, 4.5–18.4 versus 12.9; interquartile range, 5.9–21.4 mg/dL; P<0.01) and reduced cumulative in‐hospital mortality (24% versus 39%; P<0.01) than those not on a statin (n=1283). No difference in hospital mortality was noted in patients without diabetes mellitus on or off statin (20% versus 21%; P=0.82). Propensity score matching (hazard ratio, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.83–0.94; P<0.01) and inverse probability treatment weighting (HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.84–0.92; P<0.01) showed a 12% lower risk of death during hospitalization for statin users than for nonusers.
Statin use was associated with reduced in‐hospital mortality from COVID‐19 in patients with diabetes mellitus. These findings, if validated, may further reemphasize administration of statins to patients with diabetes mellitus during the COVID‐19 era.",2020 Dec 11,Statin Use and In‐Hospital Mortality in Patients With Diabetes Mellitus and COVID‐19,Journal of the American Heart Association: Cardiovascular and Cerebrovascular Disease
891,PMC5536559,"Polyuria and polydipsia are the characteristics of congenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (CNDI). Approximately 90% of all patients with CNDI have X-linked hereditary disease, which is due to a mutation of the arginine vasopressin receptor 2 (AVPR2) gene. This case report describes a 54-year-old male with polyuria and polydipsia and several male members of his pedigree who had the same symptoms. The proband was diagnosed with diabetes insipidus using a water-deprivation and arginine vasopressin stimulation test. Genomic DNA from the patient and his family members was extracted and the AVPR2 gene was sequenced. A novel missense mutation of a cytosine to guanine transition at position 972 (c.972C > G) was found, which resulted in the substitution of isoleucine for methionine at amino acid position 324 (p.I324M) in the seventh transmembrane domain of the protein. The proband’s mother and daughter were heterozygous for this mutation.

We performed a retrospective review of patients with WS seen in the Peking Union Medical College Hospital from 2002 to 2017. Data including demographic data, clinical presentations, examination results, family history, and genetic analysis were described.
Six patients with WS were identified, meeting the diagnostic criteria of the coincidence of DM and OA before 15 years old or the existence of two WFS1 mutations. All were male, with the median age of 14.5 years (range 10–19 years). Blood glucose impairment, OA, and diabetes insipidus were present in all (100%), hearing impairment in four (66.7%), urological abnormalities in four (66.7%), neurological abnormalities in one (16.7%), and endocrine disorder in one (16.7%). Rare presentation includes cataract, glaucoma, and spina bifida occulta. Diabetes was insulin-dependent and not ketosis onset, with antibody to glutamic acid decarboxylase and islet cell negative. Genetic analysis revealed mutations in WFS1 in three patients. A novel frameshift mutation (p.Asp151Glufs*93) was identified in exon 4 of WFS1.

893,PMC8232956,"Obesity affects large numbers of patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) across their lifetime, with rates ranging between 2.8% and 37.1%. Patients with T1D and obesity are characterized by the presence of insulin resistance, of high insulin requirements, have a greater cardiometabolic risk and an enhanced risk of developing chronic complications when compared to normal-weight persons with T1D. Dual treatment of obesity and T1D is challenging and no specific guidelines for improving outcomes of both glycemic control and weight management have been established for this population. Nevertheless, although evidence is scarce, a comprehensive approach based on a balanced hypocaloric diet, physical activity and cognitive behavioral therapy by a multidisciplinary team, expert in both obesity and diabetes, remains as the best clinical practice. However, weight loss responses with lifestyle changes alone are limited, so in the “roadmap” of the treatment of obesity in T1D, it will be helpful to include anti-obesity pharmacotherapy despite at present there is a lack of evidence since T1D patients have been excluded from anti-obesity drug clinical trials. In case of severe obesity, bariatric surgery has proven to be of benefit in obtaining a substantial and long-term weight loss and reduction in cardiovascular risk. The near future looks promising with the development of new and more effective anti-obesity treatments and strategies to improve insulin resistance and oxidative stress. Advances in precision medicine may help individualize and optimize the medical management and care of these patients. This review, by gathering current evidence, highlights the need of solid knowledge in all facets of the treatment of patients with obesity and T1D that can only be obtained through high quality well-designed studies.",2021 Jun 21,"Obesity in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes: Links, Risks and Management Challenges","Diabetes, Metabolic Syndrome and Obesity: Targets and Therapy"
894,PMC4725320,"Wolfram syndrome type 1 is a rare, autosomal recessive, neurodegenerative disorder that is diagnosed when insulin-dependent diabetes of non-auto-immune origin and optic atrophy are concomitantly present. Wolfram syndrome is also designated by DIDMOAD that stands for its most frequent manifestations: diabetes insipidus, diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy and deafness. With disease progression, patients also commonly develop severe neurological and genito-urinary tract abnormalities. When compared to the general type 1 diabetic population, patients with Wolfram Syndrome have been reported to have a form of diabetes that is more easily controlled and with less microvascular complications, such as diabetic retinopathy.
We report a case of Wolfram syndrome in a 16-year-old male patient who presented with progressive optic atrophy and severe diabetes with very challenging glycemic control despite intensive therapy since diagnosis at the age of 6. Despite inadequate metabolic control he did not develop any diabetic microvascular complications during the 10-year follow-up period. To further investigate potential causes for this metabolic idiosyncrasy, we performed genetic analyses that revealed a novel combination of homozygous sequence variants that are likely the cause of the syndrome in this family. The identified genotype included a novel sequence variant in the Wolfram syndrome type 1 gene along with a previously described one, which had initially been associated with isolated low frequency sensorineural hearing loss (LFSNHL). Interestingly, our patient did not show any abnormal findings with audiometry testing.",2015 Jun,A Challenging Form of Non-autoimmune Insulin-Dependent Diabetes in a Wolfram Syndrome Patient with a Novel Sequence Variant,Journal of diabetes & metabolism
895,PMC8209869,"Coronavirus‐19 (COVID‐19) is a disease caused by the SARS‐CoV‐2 virus, the seventh coronavirus identified as causing disease in humans. The SARS‐CoV‐2 virus has multiple potential pathophysiologic interconnections with endocrine systems, potentially causing disturbances in glucose metabolism, hypothalamic and pituitary function, adrenal function and mineral metabolism. A growing body of data is revealing both the effects of underlying endocrine disorders on COVID‐19 disease outcome and the effects of the SARS‐CoV‐2 virus on endocrine systems. However, comprehensive assessment of the relationship to endocrine disorders in children has been lacking.
In this review, we present the effects of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection on endocrine systems and review the current literature on complications of COVID‐19 disease in underlying paediatric endocrine disorders. We provide recommendations on management of endocrinopathies related to SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in this population.
With the surge in COVID‐19 cases worldwide, it is important for paediatric endocrinologists to be aware of the interaction of SARS‐CoV‐2 with the endocrine system and management considerations for patients with underlying disorders who develop COVID‐19 disease. While children and adults share some risk factors that influence risk of complications in SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, it is becoming clear that responses in the paediatric population are distinct and outcomes from adult studies cannot be extrapolated. Evidence emerging from paediatric studies provides some guidance but highlights the need for more research in this area.

896,PMC3441254,"Infants with diabetes insipidus (DI), especially those with impaired thirst mechanism or hypothalamic hyperphagia, are prone to severe sodium fluctuations, often requiring hospitalization. We aimed to avoid dangerous fluctuations in serum sodium and improve parental independence.
A 16-month old girl with central DI, absent thirst mechanism and hyperphagia following surgery for hypothalamic astrocytoma had erratic absorption of oral DDAVP during chemotherapy cycles. She required prolonged hospitalizations for hypernatremia and hyponatremic seizure. Intensive monitoring of fluid balance, weight and clinical assessment of hydration were not helpful in predicting serum sodium. Discharge home was deemed unsafe. Oral DDAVP was switched to subcutaneous (twice-daily injections, starting with 0.01mcg/dose, increasing to 0.024mcg/dose). The parents adjusted daily fluid allocation by sliding-scale, according to the blood sodium level (measured by handheld i-STAT analyser, Abbott). We adjusted the DDAVP dose if fluid allocation differed from maintenance requirements for 3 consecutive days.
After 2.5 months, sodium was better controlled, with 84% of levels within reference range (135-145 mmol/L) vs. only 51% on the old regimen (p = 0.0001). The sodium ranged from 132-154 mmol/L, compared to 120–156 on the old regimen. She was discharged home.

897,PMC6627358,"Glucoregulatory diseases, such as type 2 diabetes are currently a key public health priority. Public health messages have started to include the addition of water in their dietary guidelines. Such guidelines however are not based on causal evidence pertaining to the health effects of increased water intake, but rather more heavily based upon non-causal or mechanistic data. One line of thinking linking fluid intake and health is that hypohydration induces elevated blood concentrations of arginine vasopressin (AVP). Research in the 1970s and 1980s implicated AVP in glucoregulation, supported by observational evidence. This important area of research subsequently appeared to stop until the 21st century during which interest in hypertonic saline infusion studies, animal AVP receptor knockout models, dietary and genetic associations, and human interventions manipulating hydration status have resurged. This narrative review briefly describes and critically evaluates the usefulness of the current AVP-glucoregulatory research. We offer suggestions on how to test the independent glucoregulatory effects of body water changes compared to elevated circulating AVP concentrations, such as investigating hydration manipulations using 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine. Whilst much research is still needed before making firm conclusions, the current evidence suggests that although AVP may be partially implicated in glucoregulation, more ecologically valid models using human participants suggests this effect might be independent of the hydration status. The key implication of this hypothesis if confirmed in future research is that manipulating the hydration status to reduce circulating AVP concentrations may not be an effective method to improve glucoregulatory health.",2019 May 28,"Hydration, Arginine Vasopressin, and Glucoregulatory Health in Humans: A Critical Perspective",Nutrients

899,PMC7210169,"Latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) is characterized by autoimmunity, late-onset and intermediate beta-cell deprivation rate between type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Herein, we investigated proinsulin (PI) secretion patterns and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) dysfunction biomarker, PI-to-C-peptide (PI:CP) ratio, to elucidate beta-cell intrinsic pathogenesis mechanisms in different types of diabetes.
Total serum fasting PI (FPI) were measured in adult-onset and newly-diagnosed diabetes patients, including 60 T1DM, 60 LADA and 60 T2DM. Thirty of each type underwent mixed meal tolerance tests (MMTTs), and hence 120 min postprandial PI (PPI) were detected. PI:CP ratio = PI (pmol/L) ÷ CP (pmol/L) × 100%. PI-related measurements among types of diabetes were compared. Correlation between PI-related measurements and beta-cell autoimmunity were analyzed. The possibility of discriminating LADA from T1DM and T2DM with PI-related measurements were tested.
FPI and PPI were significantly higher in LADA than T1DM (P<0.001 for both comparisons), but lower than those in T2DM (P<0.001 and P=0.026, respectively). Fasting PI:CP ratio was significantly higher in T1DM than both LADA and T2DM (median 3.25% vs. 2.13% and 2.32%, P=0.011 and P=0.017, respectively). In LADA, positive autoantibody numbers increased by both fasting and postprandial PI:CP ratio (P=0.007 and P=0.034, respectively). Areas under receiver operation characteristic curves (AUCROC) of FPI and PPI for discriminating LADA from adult-onset T1DM were 0.751 (P<0.001) and 0.838 (P<0.001), respectively. Between LADA and T2DM, AUCROC of FPI and PPI were 0.685 (P<0.001) and 0.741 (P=0.001), respectively.
In the development of autoimmune diabetes, interplays between ER stress and beta-cell autoimmunity are potentially responsible for severer beta-cell destruction.

900,PMC8115416,"We report a male infant with congenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) who presented with hypercalcemia and hyperphosphatemia since birth. Serum sodium started to increase at 39 days. Although there was no polyuria, urine osmolality was 71 mOsm/kg, when serum osmolality was 296 mOsm/kg with plasma arginine vasopressin 22.5 pg/mL. He was thus diagnosed as NDI. An undetectable level of urine calcium and unsuppressed intact parathyroid hormone suggested hyperparathyroidism including calcium-sensing receptor mutations that could cause hypercalcemia-induced NDI. Polyuria became apparent after the initiation of i.v. infusion for the treatment of hypernatremia. Low calcium and low sodium formula with hypotonic fluid infusion did not correct hypernatremia, hypercalcemia, or hyperphosphatemia. Hydrochlorothiazide and subsequently added celecoxib effectively decreased urine output and corrected electrolytes abnormalities. Normal serum electrolytes were maintained after the discontinuation of low calcium formula. The genetic analysis revealed a large deletion of the arginine vasopressin receptor-2 (AVPR2) gene but no pathogenic variant in the calcium-sensing receptor (CASR) gene. Whether hypercalcemia and hyperphosphatemia were caused by dehydration alone or in combination with other mechanisms remains to be clarified. 
Congenital NDI can present with neonatal hypercalcemia and hyperphosphatemia.

901,PMC6104264,"A diagnosis of diabetes or hyperglycemia should be confirmed prior to ordering, dispensing, or administering insulin (A).
Insulin is the primary treatment in all patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) (A).
Typically, patients with T1DM will require initiation with multiple daily injections at the time of diagnosis. This is usually short-acting insulin or rapid-acting insulin analogue given 0 to 15 min before meals together with one or more daily separate injections of intermediate or long-acting insulin. Two or three premixed insulin injections per day may be used (A).
The target glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) for all children with T1DM, including preschool children, is recommended to be < 7.5% (< 58 mmol/mol). The target is chosen aiming at minimizing hyperglycemia, severe hypoglycemia, hypoglycemic unawareness, and reducing the likelihood of development of long-term complications (B).
For patients prone to glycemic variability, glycemic control is best evaluated by a combination of results with self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) (B).
Indications for exogenous insulin therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) include acute illness or surgery, pregnancy, glucose toxicity, contraindications to or failure to achieve goals with oral antidiabetic medications, and a need for flexible therapy (B).
In T2DM patients, with regards to achieving glycemic goals, insulin is considered alone or in combination with oral agents when HbA1c is ≥ 7.5% (≥ 58 mmol/mol); and is essential for treatment in those with HbA1c ≥ 10% (≥ 86 mmol/mol), when diet, physical activity, and other antihyperglycemic agents have been optimally used (B).
The preferred method of insulin initiation in T2DM is to begin by adding a long-acting (basal) insulin or once-daily premixed/co-formulation insulin or twice-daily premixed insulin, alone or in combination with glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) or in combination with other oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs) (B).
If the desired glucose targets are not met, rapid-acting or short-acting (bolus or prandial) insulin can be added at mealtime to control the expected postprandial raise in glucose. An insulin regimen should be adopted and individualized but should, to the extent possible, closely resemble a natural physiologic state and avoid, to the extent possible, wide fluctuating glucose levels (C).
Blood glucose monitoring is an integral part of effective insulin therapy and should not be omitted in the patient’s care plan. Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) values should be used to titrate basal insulin, whereas both FPG and postprandial glucose (PPG) values should be used to titrate mealtime insulin (B).
Metformin combined with insulin is associated with decreased weight gain, lower insulin dose, and less hypoglycemia when compared with insulin alone (C).
Oral medications should not be abruptly discontinued when starting insulin therapy because of the risk of rebound hyperglycemia (D).
Analogue insulin is as effective as human insulin but is associated with less postprandial hyperglycemia and delayed hypoglycemia (B).
The shortest needles (currently the 4-mm pen and 6-mm syringe needles) are safe, effective, and less painful and should be the first-line choice in all patient categories; intramuscular (IM) injections should be avoided, especially with long-acting insulins, because severe hypoglycemia may result; lipohypertrophy is a frequent complication of therapy that distorts insulin absorption, and therefore, injections and infusions should not be given into these lesions and correct site rotation will help prevent them (A).
Many patients in East Africa reuse syringes for various reasons, including financial. This is not recommended by the manufacturer and there is an association between needle reuse and lipohypertrophy. However, patients who reuse needles should not be subjected to alarming claims of excessive morbidity from this practice (A).
Health care authorities and planners should be alerted to the risks associated with syringe or pen needles 6 mm or longer in children (A).",2018 Mar 5,EADSG Guidelines: Insulin Therapy in Diabetes,Diabetes Therapy

The index case presented at 3 months with polydipsia. He was diagnosed with familial CDI based on a positive family history combined with what was considered to be suspicious symptomatology and biochemistry. He was treated with desmopressin (DDAVP) but re-presented at 5 months of age with hyponatraemia and the DDAVP was stopped. Gene sequencing of the vasopressin gene in father and his offspring was undertaken to establish the underlying molecular defect.
Both father and daughter were found to have the pathogenic mutation c.242T>C (p.Leu81Pro) in exon 2 of the AVP gene consistent with a diagnosis of familial diabetes insipidus. The index case did not have the pathogenic mutation and the family could be reassured that he would not require intervention with DDAVP.
Gene sequencing of AVP gene can have a valuable role in predicting whether or not a child is at risk of developing CDI in future. This can help to prevent family uncertainty and unnecessary treatment with its associated risks.
Differentiating patients with familial cranial diabetes insipidus from those with primary polydipsia is not always straightforward.

903,PMC3251553,"Wolfram Syndrome (WS) is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by Diabetes Insipidus, Diabetes Mellitus, Optic Atrophy, and Deafness identified by the acronym “DIDMOAD”. The WS gene, WFS1, encodes a transmembrane protein called Wolframin, which recent evidence suggests may serve as a novel endoplasmic reticulum calcium channel in pancreatic β-cells and neurons. WS is a rare disease, with an estimated prevalence of 1/550.000 children, with a carrier frequency of 1/354.
The aim of our study was to determine the genotype of WS patients in order to establish a genotype/phenotype correlation.
We clinically evaluated 9 young patients from 9 unrelated families (6 males, 3 females). Basic criteria for WS clinical diagnosis were coexistence of insulin-treated diabetes mellitus and optic atrophy occurring before 15 years of age. Genetic analysis for WFS1 was performed by direct sequencing.
Molecular sequencing revealed 5 heterozygous compound and 3 homozygous mutations. All of them were located in exon 8, except one in exon 4. In one proband only an heterozygous mutation (A684V) was found. Two new variants c.2663 C>A and c.1381 A>C were detected.
Our study increases the spectrum of WFS1 mutations with two novel variants. The male patient carrying the compound mutation [c.1060_1062delTTC]+[c.2663 C>A] showed the most severe phenotype: diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy (visual acuity 5/10), deafness with deep auditory bilaterally 8000 Hz, diabetes insipidus associated to reduced volume of posterior pituitary and pons.

904,PMC5696758,"Early diagnosis and treatment of congenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (CNDI) are essential due to the risk of intellectual disability caused by repeated episodes of dehydration and rapid rehydration. Timely genetic testing for disease-causing variants in the arginine vasopressin receptor 2 (AVPR2) gene is possible in at-risk newborns with a known family history of X-linked CNDI. In this study, a Swedish male with no family history was diagnosed with CNDI at 6 months of age during an episode of gastroenteritis. We analyzed the coding regions of AVPR2 by PCR and direct DNA sequencing and identified an 80-bp duplication in exon 2 (GenBank NM_000054.4; c.800_879dup) in the proband. This variant leads to a frameshift and introduces a stop codon four codons downstream (p.Ala294Profs*4). The variant gene product either succumbs to nonsense-mediated decay or is translated to a truncated nonfunctional vasopressin V2 receptor. This variant was absent in four unaffected family members, including his parents, as well as in 100 alleles from healthy controls, and is thus considered a novel de novo disease-causing variant. Identification of the disease-causing variant facilitated precise diagnosis of CNDI in the proband. Furthermore, it allows future genetic counseling in the family. This case study highlights the importance of genetic testing in sporadic infant cases with CNDI that can occur due to de novo variants in AVPR2 or several generations of female transmission of the disease-causing variant.",2017 Sep 27,Novel de novo AVPR2 Variant in a Patient with Congenital Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus,Case Reports in Nephrology and Dialysis
905,PMC8091036,"Mutations in the WFS1 gene, encoding wolframin (WFS1), cause endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and are associated with a rare autosomal-recessive disorder known as Wolfram syndrome (WS). WS is clinically characterized by childhood-onset diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy, deafness, diabetes insipidus and neurological signs. We identified two novel WFS1 mutations in a patient with WS, namely, c.316-1G > A (in intron 3) and c.757A > T (in exon 7). Both mutations, located in the N-terminal region of the protein, were predicted to generate a truncated and inactive form of WFS1. We found that although the WFS1 protein was not expressed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of the proband, no constitutive ER stress activation could be detected in those cells. In contrast, WS proband’s PBMCs produced very high levels of proinflammatory cytokines (i.e. TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6) in the absence of any stimulus. WFS1 silencing in PBMCs from control subjects by means of small RNA interference also induced a pronounced proinflammatory cytokine profile. The same cytokines were also significantly higher in sera from the WS patient as compared to matched healthy controls. Moreover, the chronic inflammatory state was associated with a dominance of proinflammatory T helper 17 (Th17)-type cells over regulatory T (Treg) lymphocytes in the WS PBMCs. The identification of a state of systemic chronic inflammation associated with WFS1 deficiency may pave the way to innovative and personalized therapeutic interventions in WS.",2021 Mar 9,Novel mutations in the WFS1 gene are associated with Wolfram syndrome and systemic inflammation,Human Molecular Genetics

This resulted in a corrected serum sodium of 202 mmol/L. He was treated with fluid and electrolyte replacement in the intensive care unit, and had returned to essentially normal function by hospital discharge. The aetiology was believed to be due to severe dehydration and a new diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. Extreme hypernatraemia (serum sodium level greater than 190 mmol/L) is rare and associated with a high mortality. The mainstay of treatment is careful fluid and electrolyte management. Most recommendations advise to reduce the serum sodium by 0.5 mmol/L/hour, due to concerns over cerebral oedema; however, there are reports that slower correction is associated with higher mortality. In this case, the initial corrected sodium of 202 mmol/L was steadily corrected to 160 mmol/L over 91 hours, at a rate of 0.46 mmol/L/hour. This demonstrates the safety of the recommended approach.",2019 Dec 12,Survival Following Extreme Hypernatraemia Associated with Severe Dehydration and Undiagnosed Diabetes Mellitus,Case Reports in Endocrinology
907,PMC8573270,"Diabetes insipidus (DI) can be classified into 2 types: central/neurogenic DI and nephrogenic DI. Most cases of central DI occur after brain surgery, trauma, tumor, or infection. Here we report a rare case of familial central DI due to a heterozygous AVP gene mutation.
A case of familial neurogenic DI has been described with thorough clinical, laboratory, and genetic workup. PubMed and Google scholar databases were used for literature discussion.
A 22-year-old man presented with polyuria and polydipsia. He drank about 4 gallons of water everyday and urinated large volumes very frequently. His physical examination was unremarkable. After 2 hours of water-deprivation, his serum sodium level was 147 mmol/L, serum osmolality was 302 mOsm/kg with concurrent urine osmolality of 78 mOsm/kg, vasopressin level was <0.8 pg/mL, and copeptin level was <2.8 pmol/L, suggesting neurogenic DI. His brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed the absence of the posterior pituitary bright spot but a normal anterior pituitary gland. Genetic analysis revealed a nonfunctional heterozygous mutation in the AVP gene. Further questioning revealed that his mother also had the disease and that he had been treated with desmopressin as a child; however, it was later self-stopped. The patient was reinitiated on desmopressin, which improved his symptoms.
Genetic mutations in the AVP gene represent a very rare etiology of DI, and patients with DI respond well to desmopressin treatment.",2020 Nov 27,A Rare Case of Familial Neurogenic Diabetes Insipidus in a 22-Year-Old Man,AACE Clinical Case Reports

Here we report a 11-year-old Chinese boy who presented with visual loss, was suspected with optic neuritis (ON) or neuromyelitis optica (NMO) and referred to our department for further diagnosis. Finally he was diagnosed with WS because of diabetes mellitus (DM) and optic atrophy (OA). Eight exons and flanking introns of WFS1 gene were analyzed by sequencing. A novel mutation c.1760G > A in WFS1 gene of exon 8 was identified.
This report reviews a case of WS associated with a novel mutation, c.1760G > A in WFS1 gene of exon 8, and emphasizes that WS should be taken into account for juveniles with visual loss and diabetes mellitus.",2018 Mar 17,A novel mutation of WFS1 gene in a Chinese patient with Wolfram syndrome: a case report,BMC Pediatrics
909,PMC8067029,"Dipsogenic diabetes insipidus (DDI) is a subtype of primary polydipsia (PP), which occurs mostly in healthy people without psychiatric disease. In contrast, PP is characterized by a polyuria polydipsia syndrome (PPS) associated with psychiatric illness. However, the pathogenesis of DDI is not well established and remains unexplored. In order to diagnose DDI, the patient should exhibit excessive thirst as the main symptom, in addition to no history of psychiatric illness, polyuria with low urine osmolality, and intact urine concentrating ability. Treatment options for DDI remain scarce. On this front, there have been two published case reports with successful attempts at treating DDI patients. The noteworthy commonalities in these reports are that the patient was diagnosed with frequent excessive intake of water due to a belief that drinking excess water would have pathologic benefits. It could therefore be hypothesized that the increasing trend of excessive fluid intake in people who are health conscious could also contribute to DDI. Hence, this review provides an overview of the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment, with a special emphasis on habitual polydipsia and DDI.",2021 Apr 1,"A Subset of Primary Polydipsia, “Dipsogneic Diabetes Insipidus”, in Apparently Healthy People Due to Excessive Water Intake: Not Enough Light to Illuminate the Dark Tunnel",Healthcare
910,PMC2779314,"Congenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (CNDI) is a rare inherited disorder characterized by insensitivity of the kidney to the antidiuretic effect of vasopressin. There are three inheritance patterns of CNDI: the X-linked recessive form associated with vasopressin V2 receptor gene mutations, and the autosomal recessive and dominant forms associated with aquaporin-2 gene (AQP2) mutations. The evaluation for polyuria and polydipsia in a one-month-old Korean girl revealed no response to vasopressin and confirmed the diagnosis of CNDI. Because the child was female without family history of CNDI, her disease was thought to be an autosomal recessive form. We analyzed the AQP2 gene and detected a compound heterozygous missense point mutation: 70Ala (GCC) to Asp (GAC) in exon 1 inherited from her father and 187Arg (CGC) to His (CAC) in exon 3 inherited from her mother. The first mutation is located within the first NPA motif of the AQP2 molecule and the second one right after the second NPA motif. This is the first report to characterize AQP2 mutations in Korean patients with autosomal recessive CNDI, and expands the spectrum of AQP2 mutations by reporting two novel mutation, 70Ala (GCC) to Asp (GAC) and 187Arg (CGC) to His (CAC).",2005 Dec 31,Two Novel Mutations in the Aquaporin 2 Gene in a Girl with Congenital Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus,Journal of Korean Medical Science
911,PMC7054786,"The purpose of this study was to examine the association between baseline serum gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) and incident diabetes mellitus and to explore their dose-response relationship in a cohort of Japanese adults. Patients and Methods. Data were drawn from the NAGALA (NAfld in the Gifu Area, Longitudinal Analysis) study between 2004 and 2015, including hierarchical information on participants ≥18 years of age without diabetes mellitus, preexisting diabetes mellitus, heavy alcohol drinking, or other liver diseases (e.g., hepatitis B/C). The final analytic sample included 15464 participants, 373 of who were diagnosed as diabetes mellitus with a maximum 13-year follow-up. The risk of incident diabetes mellitus according to baseline serum GGT was estimated using multivariable Cox proportional hazards models and a two-piecewise linear regression model was developed to find out the threshold effect. 
 Being in the highest quintile versus the lowest quintile of GGT levels was associated with an almost twofold increased risk of incident diabetes mellitus (hazard ratio 1.83 (95% CI 1.06, 3.15)), independent of age, gender, smoking status, alcohol intake, BMI, SBP, triglycerides, fatty liver, ALT, AST, and fasting plasma glucose. Further analysis revealed a positive curvilinear association between GGT and incident diabetes mellitus, with a saturation effect predicted at 24 IU/L. When serum GGT level was less than 24 IU/L, the risk of developing diabetes mellitus increased significantly with an increase in serum GGT levels (HR 1.04 (1.02, 1.07), P=0.0017). Besides, the association was more significant in nonsmoking participants than ex- or current-smokers (P=0.0017). Besides, the association was more significant in nonsmoking participants than ex- or current-smokers (P for interaction = 0.0378).

912,PMC7846622,"Diabetes mellitus is a global health concern associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Inadequate control of diabetes leads to chronic complications and higher mortality rates, which emphasizes the importance of achieving glycemic targets. Although glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) is the gold standard for measuring glycemic control, it has several limitations. Therefore, in recent years, along with the emergence of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) technology, glycemic control modalities have moved beyond HbA1c. They encompass modern glucometrics, such as glycemic variability (GV) and time-in-range (TIR). The key advantage of these newer metrics over HbA1c is that they allow personalized diabetes management with person-centric glycemic control. Basal insulin analogues, especially second-generation basal insulins with properties such as longer duration of action and low risk of hypoglycemia, have demonstrated clinical benefits by reducing GV and improving TIR. Therefore, for more effective and accurate diabetes management, the development of an integrated approach with second-generation basal insulin and glucometrics involving GV and TIR is the need of the hour. With this objective, a multinational group of endocrinologists and diabetologists reviewed the existing recommendations on TIR, provided their clinical insights into the individualization of TIR targets, and elucidated on the role of the second-generation basal insulin analogues in addressing TIR.",2020 Dec 26,Individualizing Time-in-Range Goals in Management of Diabetes Mellitus and Role of Insulin: Clinical Insights From a Multinational Panel,Diabetes Therapy
913,PMC3314357,"Recently, missense mutations upstream of preproinsulin’s signal peptide (SP) cleavage site were reported to cause mutant INS gene-induced diabetes of youth (MIDY). Our objective was to understand the molecular pathogenesis using metabolic labeling and assays of proinsulin export and insulin and C-peptide production to examine the earliest events of insulin biosynthesis, highlighting molecular mechanisms underlying β-cell failure plus a novel strategy that might ameliorate the MIDY syndrome. We find that whereas preproinsulin-A(SP23)S is efficiently cleaved, producing authentic proinsulin and insulin, preproinsulin-A(SP24)D is inefficiently cleaved at an improper site, producing two subpopulations of molecules. Both show impaired oxidative folding and are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Preproinsulin-A(SP24)D also blocks ER exit of coexpressed wild-type proinsulin, accounting for its dominant-negative behavior. Upon increased expression of ER–oxidoreductin-1, preproinsulin-A(SP24)D remains blocked but oxidative folding of wild-type proinsulin improves, accelerating its ER export and increasing wild-type insulin production. We conclude that the efficiency of SP cleavage is linked to the oxidation of (pre)proinsulin. In turn, impaired (pre)proinsulin oxidation affects ER export of the mutant as well as that of coexpressed wild-type proinsulin. Improving oxidative folding of wild-type proinsulin may provide a feasible way to rescue insulin production in patients with MIDY.",2012 Mar 14,Impaired Cleavage of Preproinsulin Signal Peptide Linked to Autosomal-Dominant Diabetes,Diabetes
914,PMC6304089,"Congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI) is the most common cause of persistent hypoglycaemia in infancy that leads to unfavourable neurological outcome if not treated adequately. In patients with severe diffuse CHI it remains under discussion whether pancreatic surgery should be performed or intensive medical treatment with the acceptance of recurrent episodes of mild hypoglycaemia is justified. Near-total pancreatectomy is associated with high rates of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. Little is known about the management and long-term glycaemic control of CHI patients with diabetes after pancreatic surgery. We searched the German/Austrian DPV database and compared the course of 42 CHI patients with diabetes to that of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Study groups were compared at diabetes onset and after a follow-up period of 6.1 [3.3–9.7] (median [interquartile range]) years.
The majority of CHI patients with diabetes were treated with insulin (85.2% [70.9–99.5] at diabetes onset, and 90.5% [81.2–99.7] at follow-up). However, compared to patients with T1DM, significantly more patients in the CHI group with diabetes were treated with conventional insulin therapy (47.8% vs. 24.4%, p = 0.03 at diabetes onset, and 21.1% vs. 6.4% at follow-up, p = 0.003), and only a small number of CHI patients were treated with insulin pumps. Daily insulin dose was significantly lower in CHI patients with diabetes than in patients with T1DM, both at diabetes onset (0.3 [0.2–0.5] vs. 0.6 IE/kg/d [0.4–0.8], p = 0.003) and follow-up (0.8 [0.4–1.0] vs. 0.9 [0.7–1.0] IE/kg/d, p = 0.02), while daily carbohydrate intake was comparable in both groups. Within the first treatment year, HbA1c levels were significantly lower in CHI patients with diabetes (6.2% [5.5–7.9] vs. 7.2% [6.5–8.2], p = 0.003), but increased to a level comparable to that of T1DM patients at follow-up. Interestingly, in CHI patients, the risk of severe hypoglycaemia tends to be higher only at diabetes onset (14.8% vs. 5.8%, p = 0.1).
In surgically treated CHI patients insulin treatment needs to be intensified in order to achieve good glycaemic control.

915,PMC6790894,"Patients treated with immunosuppressive drugs, especially methotrexate (MTX), rarely develop lymphoproliferative disorders (LPDs), known as MTX-related LPD (MTX–LPD). The primary site of MTX–LPD is often extranodal. This is the first reported case of MTX–LPD in the pituitary. A 65-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with symptoms of oculomotor nerve palsy and multiple subcutaneous nodules. She had been treated with MTX for 11 years for rheumatoid arthritis. Computed tomography showed multiple masses in the orbit, sinuses, lung fields, anterior mediastinum, kidney, and subcutaneous tissue. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed a sellar mass. She was diagnosed with hypopituitarism and central diabetes insipidus based on endocrine examination. Although pituitary biopsy could not be performed, we concluded that the pituitary lesion was from MTX–LPD, similar to the lesions in the sinuses, anterior mediastinum, and subcutaneous tissue, which showed polymorphic LPD on biopsy. MTX was discontinued, and methylprednisolone was administered to improve the neurologic symptoms. After several weeks, there was marked improvement of all lesions, including the pituitary lesion, but the pituitary function did not improve. When pituitary lesions are caused by MTX–LPD, the possibility of anterior hypopituitarism and central diabetes insipidus needs to be considered. Further studies are needed to investigate the effectiveness of early diagnosis and treatment of MTX–LPD in restoring pituitary dysfunction.
Pituitary lesions from MTX–LPD may cause hypopituitarism and central diabetes insipidus.
Pituitary metastasis of malignant lymphoma and primary pituitary lymphoma, which have the same tissue types with MTX–LPD, have poor prognosis, but the lesions of MTX–LPD can regress only after MTX discontinuation. 
In cases of pituitary lesions alone, a diagnosis of MTX–LPD may be difficult, unless pituitary biopsy is performed. This possibility should be considered in patients treated with immunosuppressive drugs.
Pituitary hypofunction and diabetes insipidus may persist, even after regression of the lesions on imaging due to MTX discontinuation.",2019 Oct 12,Methotrexate-associated lymphoproliferative disorder with hypopituitarism and central diabetes insipidus,"Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism Case Reports"
916,PMC4734855,"Diabetes insipidus (DI) is a rare disease in humans and animals, which is caused by the lack of production, malfunction or dysfunction of the distal nephron to the antidiuretic effect of the antidiuretic hormone (ADH). Diagnosis requires a thorough medical history, clinical examination and further laboratory confirmation. This case report describes the appearance of DI in five Duroc boars in Switzerland.
Two purebred intact Duroc boars at the age of 8 months and 1.5 years, respectively, with a history of polyuric and polydipsic symptoms had been referred to the Swine Clinic in Berne. Based on the case history, the results of clinical examination and the analysis of blood and urine, a tentative diagnosis of DI was concluded. Finally, the diagnosis was confirmed by findings from a modified water deprivation test, macroscopic examinations and histopathology. Following the diagnosis, three genes known to be involved in inherited DI in humans were analyzed in order to explore a possible genetic background of the affected boars.
The etiology of DI in pigs is supposed to be the same as in humans, although this disease has never been described in pigs before. Thus, although occurring only on rare occasions, DI should be considered as a differential diagnosis in pigs with polyuria and polydipsia. It seems that a modified water deprivation test may be a helpful tool for confirming a diagnosis in pigs. Since hereditary forms of DI have been described in humans, the occurrence of DI in pigs should be considered in breeding programs although we were not able to identify a disease associated mutation.",2016 Jan 29,Diagnosis of diabetes insipidus observed in Swiss Duroc boars,BMC Veterinary Research

We describe the clinical features of fourteen patients from seven different families followed in our Diabetes Center. The mean age at Wolfram syndrome 1 diagnosis was 12.4 years. Diabetes mellitus was the first clinical manifestation, in all patients. Sensorineural hearing impairment and central diabetes insipidus were present in 85.7% of patients. Other endocrine findings included hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (7.1%), hypergonadotropic hypogonadism (7.1%), and Hashimoto’s thyroiditis (21.4%).

921,PMC5283734,"Early detection of diabetes and prediabetic states is beneficial for patients, but may be delayed by patients´ being overly optimistic about their own health. Therefore, we assessed how persons without known diabetes perceive their risk of having or developing diabetes, and we identified factors associated with perception of diabetes risk.
1,953 participants without previously known diabetes from the population-based, German KORA FF4 Study (59.1 years, 47.8% men) had an oral glucose tolerance test. They estimated their probability of having undiagnosed diabetes mellitus (UDM) on a six category scale, and assessed whether they were at risk of developing diabetes in the future. We cross-tabulated glycemic status with risk perception, and fitted robust Poisson regression models to identify determinants of diabetes risk perception.
74% (95% CI: 65–82) of persons with UDM believed that their probability of having undetected diabetes was low or very low. 72% (95% CI: 69–75) of persons with prediabetes believed that they were not at risk of developing diabetes. In people with prediabetes, seeing oneself at risk of diabetes was associated with self-rated poor general health (prevalence ratio (PR) = 3.1 (95% CI: 1.4–6.8), parental diabetes (PR = 2.6, 1.9–3.4), high educational level (PR = 1.9 (1.4–2.5)), lower age (PR = 0.7, 0.6–0.8, per 1 standard deviation increase), female sex (PR = 1.2, 0.9–1.5) and obesity (PR = 1.5, 1.2–2.0).

922,PMC7653781,"Current and projected increases in global temperatures and extreme climate events have led to heightened interest in the impact of climate factors (i.e. ambient temperature, season/seasonality, and humidity) on human health. There is growing evidence that climate factors may impact metabolic function, including insulin sensitivity. Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a common pregnancy complication, with an estimated global prevalence of up to 14%. While lifestyle and genetic risk factors for GDM are well established, environmental factors may also contribute to GDM risk. Previous reviews have summarized the growing evidence of environmental risk factors for GDM including endocrine disrupting chemicals and ambient air pollution. However, studies of the effects of climate factors on GDM risk have not been systematically evaluated. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review to summarize and evaluate the current literature on the associations of climate factors with GDM risk.
We conducted systematic searches in PubMed and EMBASE databases for original research articles on associations of climate factors (i.e. ambient temperature, season/seasonality, and humidity) with GDM and/or related glycemic outcomes for all publication dates through September 20th, 2020.
Our search identified 16 articles on the associations of ambient temperature and/or season with GDM and maternal glycemic outcomes during pregnancy, which were included in this review. Despite inconsistencies in exposure and outcome assessment, we found consistent evidence of a seasonal effect on GDM risk, with higher prevalence of GDM and higher pregnancy glucose levels in summer months. We found suggestive evidence of an association between higher ambient temperature and elevated glucose levels from GDM screening tests.

925,PMC8088871,"Globally, the prevalence of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is rising. In 2020, a total of 124,652 Australians had T1DM. Maintaining optimal glycemic control (hemoglobin A1c ≤7.0%, ≤53 mmol/mol) on a standard carbohydrate diet can be a challenge for people living with T1DM. The Diabetes Complications and Control Trial established that macrovascular and microvascular complications could be reduced by improving glycemic control. Recent studies have found that a very low or low carbohydrate diet can improve glycemic control. However, the overall evidence relating to an association between a very low or low carbohydrate diet and glycemic control in people living with T1DM is both limited and mixed. In addition, research has suggested that a reduced quality of life due to anxiety and depression adversely influences glycemic control. Despite a potential link between a very low or low carbohydrate diet and optimal glycemic control, to our knowledge, no research has examined an association between a low carbohydrate diet, quality of life, and glycemic control, making this study unique in its approach.
The study aims to develop a validated diabetes-specific quality of life questionnaire for use in Australian adults with T1DM and to determine if an association exists between a low carbohydrate diet, quality of life, and glycemic control in Australian adults living with T1DM.
This cross-sectional study will be conducted in a tertiary hospital outpatient setting and will consist of 3 phases: phase 1, online Australian diabetes-specific quality of life questionnaire development and piloting (25-30 adults with T1DM); phase 2, questionnaire validation (364 adults with T1DM); and phase 3, a 12-week dietary intervention to determine if an association exists between a low carbohydrate diet, quality of life, and glycemic control in adults with T1DM (16-23 adults with T1DM). The validation of the study-developed Australian diabetes-specific quality of life questionnaire, and changes in hemoglobin A1c and quality of life in adults with T1DM while undertaking a low carbohydrate diet over 12 weeks will be the primary outcomes of this study.
Phase 1 of the study is currently open for recruitment and has recruited 12 participants to date. It is anticipated that the first results will be submitted for publication in November 2021. Presently, no results are available.
This study is the first of its kind in that it will be the first to generate a new validated instrument, which could be used in evidence-based practice and research to understand the quality of life of Australian adults with T1DM. Second, the low carbohydrate dietary intervention outcomes could be used to inform clinicians about an alternative approach to assist T1DM adults in improving their quality of life and glycemic control. Finally, this study could warrant the development of an evidence-based low carbohydrate dietary guideline for adults living with T1DM with the potential to have a profound impact on this population.

926,PMC6224079,"Our aim was to identify serum microRNAs (miRNAs) in healthy humans which associate with future onset of both diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease. We performed global profiling of 753 mature human miRNAs in serum of 12 pilot subjects followed by measurement of 47 consistently expressed miRNAs in fasting serum of 553 healthy subjects from the baseline exam (1991–1994) of the population based Malmö Diet and Cancer Study Cardiovascular Cohort (MDC-CC), of whom 140 developed diabetes, and 169 cardiovascular diseases during follow-up. We used multivariate logistic regression to test individual miRNAs for association with incident diabetes and cardiovascular disease as compared to control subjects (n = 259). After Bonferroni correction and adjustment for age and sex, each SD increment of log-transformed miR-483-5p was significantly associated with both incident diabetes (OR = 1.48; 95% CI 1.18–1.84, P = 0.001) and cardiovascular disease (OR = 1.40; 95% CI 1.15, 1.72, P = 0.001). In cross sectional analysis, miR-483-5p was correlated with BMI (r = 0.162, P = 0.0001), fasting insulin (r = 0.156, P = 0.0002), HDL (r = -0.099, P = 0.02) and triglycerides (r = 0.11, P = 0.01). Adjustment for these metabolic risk factors, as well as traditional risk factors attenuated the miR-483-5p association with incident diabetes (OR = 1.28 95% CI 1.00–1.64, P = 0.049) whereas its association with incident cardiovascular disease remained virtually unchanged (OR = 1.46 95% CI, 1.18–1.81, P = 0.0005). In conclusion, miR-483-5p associates with both diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The association with diabetes seems partly mediated by obesity and insulin resistance, whereas the association with incident cardiovascular disease is independent of these metabolic factors and traditional cardiovascular disease risk factors.",2018 Nov 8,miR-483-5p associates with obesity and insulin resistance and independently associates with new onset diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease,PLoS ONE
927,PMC8685651,"Wolfram syndrome (WFS) is a rare disorder characterised by childhood-onset diabetes mellitus and progressive optic atrophy. Most patients have variants in the WFS1 gene. We undertook functional studies of WFS1 variants and correlated these with WFS1 protein expression and phenotype.
9 patients with a clinical diagnosis of WFS were studied with quantitative PCR for markers of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and immunoblotting of fibroblast protein extracts for WFS1 protein expression. Luciferase reporter assay was used to assess ATF-6 dependent unfolded protein response (UPR) activation.
6 patients with compound heterozygous nonsense mutations in WFS1 had no detectable WFS1 protein expression; 3 patients with missense variants had 4%, 45% and 48% WFS1 protein expression. One of these also had an OPA1 mutation and was reclassified as autosomal dominant optic atrophy-plus syndrome. There were no correlations between ER stress marker mRNA and WFS1 protein expression. ERSE-luciferase reporter indicated activation of the ATF6 branch of UPR in two patients tested. Patients with partial WFS1 expression showed milder visual acuity impairment (asymptomatic or colour blind only), compared with those with absent expression (registered severe vision impaired) (p=0.04). These differences remained after adjusting for duration of optic atrophy.
Patients with WFS who have partial WFS1 protein expression present with milder visual impairment. This suggests a protective effect of partial WFS1 protein expression on the severity and perhaps progression of vision impairment and that therapies to increase residual WFS1 protein expression may be beneficial.",2021 May 18,WFS1 protein expression correlates with clinical progression of optic atrophy in patients with Wolfram syndrome,Journal of Medical Genetics
928,PMC5721780,"The impact of diabetes mellitus on the clinical presentation and noninvasive test (NIT) results among stable outpatients presenting with symptoms suggestive of coronary artery disease (CAD) has not been well described.
The PROMISE (Prospective Multicenter Imaging Study for Evaluation of Chest Pain) trial enrolled 10 003 patients with known diabetic status, of whom 8966 were tested as randomized and had interpretable NIT results (1908 with diabetes mellitus, 21%). Differences in symptoms and NIT results were evaluated using logistic regression. Patients with diabetes mellitus (versus without) were similar in age (median 61 versus 60 years) and sex (female 54% versus 52%), had a greater burden of cardiovascular comorbidities, and had a similar likelihood of nonchest pain symptoms (29% versus 27%). The Diamond‐Forrester/Coronary Artery Surgery Study score predicted that patients with diabetes mellitus (versus without) had similar likelihood of obstructive CAD (low 1.8% versus 2.7%; intermediate 92.3% versus 92.6%; high 5.9% versus 4.7%). Physicians estimated patients with diabetes mellitus to have a higher likelihood of obstructive CAD (low to very low: 28.3% versus 40.1%; intermediate 63.9% versus 55.9%; high to very high 7.8% versus 4.0%). Patients with diabetes mellitus (versus without) were more likely to have a positive NIT result (15% versus 11%; adjusted odds ratio, 1.23; P=0.01).
Stable chest pain patients with and without diabetes mellitus have similar presentation and pretest likelihood of obstructive CAD; however, physicians perceive that patients with diabetes mellitus have a higher pretest likelihood of obstructive CAD, an assessment supported by increased risk of a positive NIT. Further evaluation of diabetes mellitus's influence on CAD assessment is required.

929,PMC8270651,"Pancreatic beta (β)-cell dysfunction and reduced mass play a central role in the development and progression of diabetes mellitus. Conventional histological β-cell mass (BCM) analysis is invasive and limited to cross-sectional observations in a restricted sampling area. However, the non-invasive evaluation of BCM remains elusive, and practical in vivo and clinical techniques for β-cell-specific imaging are yet to be established. The lack of such techniques hampers a deeper understanding of the pathophysiological role of BCM in diabetes, the implementation of personalized BCM-based diabetes management, and the development of antidiabetic therapies targeting BCM preservation and restoration. Nuclear medical techniques have recently triggered a major leap in this field. In particular, radioisotope-labeled probes using exendin peptides that include glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonist and antagonist have been employed in positron emission tomography and single-photon emission computed tomography. These probes have demonstrated high specificity to β cells and provide clear images accurately showing uptake in the pancreas and transplanted islets in preclinical in vivo and clinical studies. One of these probes, 111indium-labeled exendin-4 derivative ([Lys12(111In-BnDTPA-Ahx)]exendin-4), has captured the longitudinal changes in BCM during the development and progression of diabetes and under antidiabetic therapies in various mouse models of type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus. GLP-1R-targeted imaging is therefore a promising tool for non-invasive BCM evaluation.

The COVID-19 pandemic has put on hold routine medical care for hundreds of millions of patients around the globe, while many pituitary patients' evaluations cannot be delayed for too long. Furthermore, the majority of patients with pituitary tumours have co-morbidities potentially impacting the course and management of COVID-19 (e.g. hypopituitarism, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obesity and cardiovascular disease). Here, we summarize some of the diagnostic and management dilemmas encountered, and provide guidance on safe and as effective as possible delivery of care in the COVID-19 era. We also attempt to address how pituitary services should be remodelled in the event of similar crises, while maintaining or even improving patient outcomes. Regular review of these recommendations and further adjustments are needed, depending on the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic status. We consider that the utilization of successful models of pituitary multidisciplinary care implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic should continue after the crisis is over by using the valuable and exceptional experience gained during these challenging times.",2020 Jul 1,"Endocrinology in the time of COVID-19: Management of pituitary tumours This manuscript is part of a commissioned series of urgent clinical guidance documents on the management of endocrine conditions in the time of COVID-19.

931,PMC7829049,"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a potential risk factor for both maternal and foetal complications during pregnancy. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and factors associated with GDM among pregnant women in Southern Tanzania.
A cross-sectional study was conducted among 612 randomly selected pregnant women attending routine antenatal clinics in Southern Tanzania from September to October 2017. Detailed medical and gynaecological history was taken using pre-tested questionnaires. Blood samples were collected for fasting and oral glucose tolerance tests. We diagnosed GDM using the World Health Organization 2013 diagnostic criteria for diabetes mellitus. We performed statistical analysis using SPSS v24.0. Possible associations and statistical significance were measured using odds ratio at 95% confidence interval, and p-values of <0.05 were considered statistically significant.
The mean age and standard deviation of the study subjects was 24.5±6.9 years. The prevalence of GDM was 4.3%. GDM was significantly associated with: being overweight or obese (p<0.001), past history of pre-term delivery (p<0.001), past history of stillbirths (p<0.001), history of macrosmia (p<0.001), alcohol consumption (p=0.001), and having a first degree relative with diabetes mellitus (p<0.001).
Prevalence of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus is low in this study setting. We recommend close attention to at risk women to prevent development of GDM.

932,PMC8481775,"Solitary intracranial hypothalamic mass occurs rarely. The etiological diagnosis of solitary hypothalamus lesion is challenging and often unachievable. Although previous studies indicated that lesions affecting the hypothalamus often cause significant metabolic disorders, few reports about the metabolic disturbances of patients with solitary hypothalamic mass have been reported.
Twenty-five patients with solitary hypothalamus lesions who had been evaluated and treated in Huashan Hospital from January 2010 to December 2020 were retrospectively enrolled. The clinical manifestations, radiological features, endocrine and metabolic disorders, and pathology were analyzed.
The male to female ratio was 5/20. The median age of onset was 22 (19, 35) years old. The most common initial symptom was polydipsia/polyuria (19/25, 76.0%) and amenorrhea (9/20, 45.0%). A high prevalence of hypopituitarism of different axes was found, with almost all no less than 80%. Central hypogonadism (21/22, 95.5%) and central diabetes insipidus (19/21, 90.5%) were the top two pituitary dysfunctions. Conclusive diagnoses were achieved by intracranial surgical biopsy/resection or stereotactic biopsy in 16 cases and by examining extracranial lesions in 3 cases. The pathological results were various, and the most common diagnoses were Langerhans cell histiocytosis (7/19) and hypothalamitis (5/19). The mean timespan from onset to diagnosis in the 19 cases was 34 ± 26 months. Metabolic evaluations revealed remarkable metabolic disorders, including hyperlipidemia (13/16, 81.3%), hyperglycemia (10/16, 62.5%), hyperuricemia (12/20, 60%), overweight/obesity (13/20, 65.0%), and hepatic adipose infiltration (10/13, 76.6%).
Either surgical or stereotactic biopsy will be a reliable and relatively safe procedure to help to confirm the pathological diagnosis of solitary hypothalamic mass. Metabolic disorders were severe in patients with solitary hypothalamic mass.

933,PMC6201432,"Mechanistic studies suggest that aldosterone impairs glucose metabolism. We investigated the cross‐sectional associations of aldosterone and plasma renin activity with fasting plasma glucose, insulin resistance (IR), β‐cell function, and longitudinal association with incident diabetes mellitus among adults in MESA (the multiethnic study of atherosclerosis) prospective cohort study.
Homeostatic model assessment of IR (HOMA2‐IR) and HOMA2‐β were used to estimate IR and β‐cell function, respectively. Incident diabetes mellitus was defined as fasting plasma glucose ≥126 mg/dL or anti‐diabetic medication use at follow‐up. Linear regression was used to examine cross‐sectional associations of aldosterone with fasting plasma glucose, HOMA2‐IR and HOMA2‐β; Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) for incident diabetes mellitus with multivariable adjustment. There were 116 cases of incident diabetes mellitus over 10.5 years among 1570 adults (44% non‐Hispanic white, 13% Chinese American, 19% Black, 24% Hispanic American, mean age 64±10 years, 51% female). A 100% increase in log‐aldosterone was associated with a 2.6 mg/dL higher fasting plasma glucose, 15% higher HOMA2‐IR and 6% higher HOMA2‐β (P<0.01). A 1‐SD increase in log‐aldosterone was associated with a 44% higher risk of incident diabetes mellitus (P<0.01) with the greatest increase of 142% (P<0.01) observed in Chinese Americans (P for interaction=0.09 versus other ethnicities). Similar cross‐sectional findings for log‐plasma renin activity existed, but log‐plasma renin activity was not associated with incident diabetes mellitus after full adjustment.

934,PMC8264408,"To investigate and forecast type 2 diabetes mellitus epidemic, its related risk factors and cost in Oman by 2050.
An age‐structured mathematical model was used to characterize type 2 diabetes mellitus epidemiology and trends in Oman between 1990 and 2050. The model was parametrized using current and quality data, including six nationally representative population‐based epidemiological surveys for type 2 diabetes mellitus and its key risk factors.
The projected type 2 diabetes mellitus prevalence increased from 15.2% in 2020 to 23.8% in 2050. The prevalence increased from 16.8 and 13.8% in 2020 among women and men to 26.3 and 21.4% in 2050, respectively. In 2020, 190,489 Omanis were living with type 2 diabetes mellitus compared with 570,227 in 2050. The incidence rate per 1,000 person‐years changed from 8.3 in 2020 to 12.1 in 2050. Type 2 diabetes mellitus’ share of Oman’s national health expenditure grew by 36% between 2020 and 2050 (from 21.2 to 28.8%). Obesity explained 56.7% of type 2 diabetes mellitus cases in 2020 and 71.4% in 2050, physical inactivity explained 4.3% in 2020 and 2.7% in 2050, whereas smoking accounted for <1% of type 2 diabetes mellitus cases throughout 2020–2050. Sensitivity and uncertainty analyses affirmed these predictions.
The type 2 diabetes mellitus epidemic in Oman is expected to increase significantly over the next three decades, consuming nearly one‐third of the national health expenditure. The type 2 diabetes mellitus burden is heavily influenced by obesity. Interventions targeting this single risk factor should be a national priority to reduce and control the burden of type 2 diabetes mellitus in Oman.
The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus in Oman was projected to grow by 57% by 2050, whereas the incidence was projected to grow by 200% by 2050. By 2050, type 2 diabetes mellitus will consume 30% of Oman’s health expenditure.

935,PMC8076178,"A significant number of studies invoked diabetes as a risk factor for virus infections, but the issue remains controversial. We aimed to examine whether non-autoimmune diabetes mellitus enhances the risk of virus infections compared with the risk in healthy individuals without non-autoimmune diabetes mellitus. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we assessed case-control and cohort studies on the association between non-autoimmune diabetes and viruses. We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Science with no language restriction, to identify articles published until February 15, 2021. The main outcome assessment was the risk of virus infection in individuals with non-autoimmune diabetes. We used a random-effects model to pool individual studies and assessed heterogeneity (I2) using the χ2 test on Cochrane’s Q statistic. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42019134142. Out of 3136 articles identified, we included 68 articles (90 studies, as the number of virus and or diabetes phenotype varied between included articles). The summary OR between non-autoimmune diabetes and virus infections risk were, 10.8(95% CI: 10.3–11.4; 1-study) for SARS-CoV-2; 3.6(95%CI: 2.7–4.9, I2 = 91.7%; 43-studies) for HCV; 2.7(95% CI: 1.3–5.4, I2 = 89.9%, 8-studies;) for HHV8; 2.1(95% CI: 1.7–2.5; 1-study) for H1N1 virus; 1.6(95% CI: 1.2–2.13, I2 = 98.3%, 27-studies) for HBV; 1.5(95% CI: 1.1–2.0; 1-study) for HSV1; 3.5(95% CI: 0.6–18.3 , I2 = 83.9%, 5-studies) for CMV; 2.9(95% CI: 1–8.7, 1-study) for TTV; 2.6(95% CI: 0.7–9.1, 1-study) for Parvovirus B19; 0.7(95% CI: 0.3–1.5 , 1-study) for coxsackie B virus; and 0.2(95% CI: 0–6.2; 1-study) for HGV. Our findings suggest that, non-autoimmune diabetes is associated with increased susceptibility to viruses especially SARS-CoV-2, HCV, HHV8, H1N1 virus, HBV and HSV1.

936,PMC6577206,"The kidney collecting duct (CD) is a tubular segment of the kidney where the osmolality and final flow rate of urine are established, enabling urine concentration and body water homeostasis. Water reabsorption in the CD depends on the action of arginine vasopressin (AVP) and a transepithelial osmotic gradient between the luminal fluid and surrounding interstitium. AVP induces transcellular water reabsorption across CD principal cells through associated signaling pathways after binding to arginine vasopressin receptor 2 (AVPR2). This signaling cascade regulates the water channel protein aquaporin-2 (AQP2). AQP2 is exclusively localized in kidney connecting tubules and CDs. Specifically, AVP stimulates the intracellular translocation of AQP2-containing vesicles to the apical plasma membrane, increasing the osmotic water permeability of CD cells. Moreover, AVP induces transcription of the Aqp2 gene, increasing AQP2 protein abundance. This review provides new insights into the transcriptional regulation of the Aqp2 gene in the kidney CD with an overview of AVP and AQP2. It summarizes current therapeutic approaches for X-linked nephrogenic diabetes insipidus caused by AVPR2 gene mutations.",2019 Jun 30,New insights into the transcriptional regulation of aquaporin-2 and the treatment of X-linked hereditary nephrogenic diabetes insipidus,Kidney Research and Clinical Practice
937,PMC7214161,"Mitochondrial function is critical in energy metabolism. To fully capture how the mitochondrial function changes in metabolic disorders, we investigated mitochondrial function in liver and muscle of animal models mimicking different types and stages of diabetes. Type 1 diabetic mice were induced by streptozotocin (STZ) injection. The db/db mice were used as type 2 diabetic model. High‐fat diet‐induced obese mice represented pre‐diabetic stage of type 2 diabetes. Oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) of isolated mitochondria was measured with Clark‐type oxygen electrode. Both in early and late stages of type 1 diabetes, liver mitochondrial OXPHOS increased markedly with complex IV‐dependent OXPHOS being the most prominent. However, ATP, ADP and AMP contents in the tissue did not change. In pre‐diabetes and early stage of type 2 diabetes, liver mitochondrial complex I and II‐dependent OXPHOS increased greatly then declined to almost normal at late stage of type 2 diabetes, among which alteration of complex I‐dependent OXPHOS was the most significant. In contrast, muscle mitochondrial OXPHOS in HFD, early‐stage type 1 and 2 diabetic mice, did not change. In vitro, among inhibitors to each complex, only complex I inhibitor rotenone decreased glucose output in primary hepatocytes without cytotoxicity both in the absence and presence of oleic acid (OA). Rotenone affected cellular energy state and had no effects on cellular and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production. Taken together, the mitochondrial OXPHOS of liver but not muscle increased in obesity and diabetes, and only complex I inhibition may ameliorate hyperglycaemia via lowering hepatic glucose production.",2020 Apr 6,Enhanced liver but not muscle OXPHOS in diabetes and reduced glucose output by complex I inhibition,Journal of Cellular and Molecular Medicine
938,PMC3552944,"Wolfram syndrome (WFS) is a rare, neurodegenerative disease that typically presents with childhood onset insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, followed by optic atrophy, diabetes insipidus, deafness, and neurological and psychiatric dysfunction. There is no cure for the disease, but recent advances in research have improved understanding of the disease course. Measuring disease severity and progression with reliable and validated tools is a prerequisite for clinical trials of any new intervention for neurodegenerative conditions. To this end, we developed the Wolfram Unified Rating Scale (WURS) to measure the severity and individual variability of WFS symptoms. The aim of this study is to develop and test the reliability and validity of the Wolfram Unified Rating Scale (WURS).
A rating scale of disease severity in WFS was developed by modifying a standardized assessment for another neurodegenerative condition (Batten disease). WFS experts scored the representativeness of WURS items for the disease. The WURS was administered to 13 individuals with WFS (6-25 years of age). Motor, balance, mood and quality of life were also evaluated with standard instruments. Inter-rater reliability, internal consistency reliability, concurrent, predictive and content validity of the WURS were calculated.
The WURS had high inter-rater reliability (ICCs>.93), moderate to high internal consistency reliability (Cronbach’s α = 0.78-0.91) and demonstrated good concurrent and predictive validity. There were significant correlations between the WURS Physical Assessment and motor and balance tests (rs>.67, p<.03), between the WURS Behavioral Scale and reports of mood and behavior (rs>.76, p<.04) and between WURS Total scores and quality of life (rs=-.86, p=.001). The WURS demonstrated acceptable content validity (Scale-Content Validity Index=0.83).

Twenty-five subjects from seven families with NDI in a department (Beijing, PUMCH) were screened for AQP2 mutations. Clinical characteristics were described and genotype-phenotype correlation analysis was performed.
We identified 9 AQP2 mutations in 13 patients with NDI, including 3 novel AQP2 mutations (p.G165D, p.Q255RfsTer72 and IVS3-3delC). Missense mutations were the most common mutation type, followed by splicing mutations, and frameshift mutations caused by small deletion or insertion. The onset-age in our patients was younger than 1 year old. Common manifestations included polydipsia, polyuria (7/7) and intermittent fever (6/7). Less common presentations included short stature (3/7) and mental impairment (1/7). High osmotic hypernatremia and low osmotic urine were the main biochemical features. Dilation of the urinary tract was a common complication of NDI (3/6). Level of serum sodium in NDI patients with compound het AQP2 mutations was higher than non-compound het mutations.
In the first and largest case series of NDI caused by AQP2 mutation in Chinese population, we identified 9 AQP2 mutations, including 3 novel mutations. Phenotype was found to correlate with genotypes, revealed by higher level of serum sodium in patients with compound het AQP2 mutations than non-compound het mutations.

Furthermore, impaired metabolism of glycoprotein components plays the main role in the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus. The aim of this study is to investigate the influence of glycoprotein levels in the treatment of diabetes mellitus.
All relevant papers in the English language were compiled by searching electronic databases, including Scopus, PubMed and Cochrane library. The keywords of glycoprotein, diabetes mellitus, glycan, glycosylation, and inhibitor were searched until January 2019.
Glycoproteins are pivotal elements in the regulation of cell proliferation, growth, maturation and signaling pathways. Moreover, they are involved in drug binding, drug transportation, efflux of chemicals and stability of therapeutic proteins. These functions, structure, composition, linkages, biosynthesis, significance and biological effects are discussed as related to their use as a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of diabetes mellitus and its complications.
The findings revealed several chemical and natural compounds have significant beneficial effects on glycoprotein metabolism.

942,PMC8198467,"Aquaporin‐2 (AQP2) is a homotetrameric water channel responsible for the final water reuptake in the kidney. Disease‐causing AQP2 mutations induce nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI), a condition that challenges the bodily water balance by producing large urinary volumes. In this study, we characterize three new AQP2 mutations identified in our lab from NDI patients (A120D, A130V, T179N) along the previously reported A47V variant. Using Xenopus oocytes, we compared the key functional and biochemical features of these mutations against classical recessive (R187C) and dominant (R254Q) forms, and once again found clear functional recovery features (increased protein stability and function) for all mutations under study. This behaviour, attributed to heteromerization to wt‐AQP2, challenge the classical model to NDI which often depicts recessive mutations as ill‐structured proteins unable to oligomerize. Consequently, we propose a revised model to the cell pathophysiology of AQP2‐related NDI which accounts for the functional recovery of recessive AQP2 mutations.
Mutations to AQP2 induce nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI), where low/inactive water channels cause large urinary waste of possible fatal outcome. Our past studies have shown that several AQP2 mutations could be functionally recovered by associating to wild‐type AQP2 (wt‐AQP2) into the protein complex (tetramer). This study presents the characterization of three new AQP2 mutations from actual case‐studies in regard to recovery capacities, and conclude by proposing a revised pathophysiological model to NDI, one where AQP2 mutations are now presented as mostly recoverable through wt‐AQP2 association into functional water channels.",2021 Jun 13,Further evidence for functional recovery of AQP2 mutations associated with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus,Physiological Reports

Type 2 diabetes mellitus is defined as a fasting plasma glucose ≥ 7.0 mmol/l and/or on medication. Obesity is defined as BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2. Random effects meta‐regression was employed to assess time trends following logit transformation. Poisson regression from strata was used to assess the effects of mean BMI changes on Type 2 diabetes mellitus period trends.
Over 1978–2013, Type 2 diabetes mellitus prevalence increased from 1.2% to 19.6% in men (2.3% per 5 years), and from 2.2% to 19.5% in women (2.2% per 5 years). Obesity prevalence increased from 27.7% to 53.1% in men (3.6% per 5 years) and from 44.4% to 76.7% (4.5% per 5 years) in women. Type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity prevalences increased in all age groups. From period trends, Type 2 diabetes mellitus prevalence in 2020 is projected to be 26% in men and women. Projected obesity prevalence is projected to be 59% in men and 81% in women. Type 2 diabetes mellitus period trends attributable to BMI increase are estimated as 31% (men) and 16% (women), after adjusting for age.
This is the first study to produce trends of Type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity in Samoa based on standardized data from population surveys. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is equally prevalent in both sexes, and obesity is widespread. Type 2 diabetes mellitus prevalence in Samoa is likely to continue to increase in the near future.
This is the first study to standardize previously conducted, disparate population‐based measures of Type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity from unit records of empirical surveys to produce period trends in Samoa.
Prevalences of Type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity have increased over 35 years (1978–2013), and are projected to continue to increase in the near future.
The increase in Type 2 diabetes mellitus is partially attributed to the rise in obesity and effective interventions to reduce obesity are urgently required.",2016 Aug 25,"Trends in diabetes and obesity in Samoa over 35 years, 1978–2013",Diabetic Medicine

Diabetes mellitus can cause bone metabolic disorders in patients, leading to osteoporosis, a higher risk of traumatic fracture, and other bone diseases. Bone metabolic disorders in the oral cavity principally manifest as periodontitis, loss of alveolar bone, and failure of implant osseointegration. In recent years, numerous studies have shown that there is a complex interaction between bone metabolic disorders and diabetes mellitus. This paper reviews the adverse effects of diabetes on oral bone metabolism disorders such as alveolar osteoporosis and bone loss in patients with periodontitis, discusses the potential mechanisms of diabetic bone loss, and suggests potential ways to prevent and treat oral bone loss in patients with diabetes mellitus.",2020 Aug 7,Current Knowledge Regarding the Interaction Between Oral Bone Metabolic Disorders and Diabetes Mellitus,Frontiers in Endocrinology
946,PMC5421170,"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is associated with both short- and long-term adverse health consequences for both the mother and her offspring. The aim was to study the prevalence and risk factors for GDM in Beijing.
The study population consisted of 15,194 pregnant women attending prenatal care in 15 hospitals in Beijing, who delivered between June 20, 2013, and November 30, 2013, after 28 weeks of gestation. The participants were selected by cluster sampling from the 15 hospitals identified through random systematic sampling based on the number of deliveries in 2012. A questionnaire was designed to collect information.
A total of 2987 (19.7%) women were diagnosed with GDM and 208 (1.4%) had diabetes in pregnancy (DIP). Age (OR: 1.053, 95% CI: 1.033–1.074, P < 0.01), family history of diabetes mellitus (OR: 1.481, 95% CI: 1.254–1.748, P < 0.01), prepregnancy body mass index (BMI) (OR: 1.481, 95% CI: 1.254–1.748, P < 0.01), BMI gain before 24 weeks (OR: 1.126, 95% CI: 1.075–1.800, P < 0.01), maternal birth weight (P < 0.01), and fasting plasma glucose at the first prenatal visit (P < 0.01) were identified as risk factors for GDM. In women with birth weight <3000 g, GDM rate was significantly higher.
One out of every five pregnant women in Beijing either had GDM or DIP and this constitutes a huge health burden for health services. Prepregnancy BMI and weight gain before 24th week are important modifiable risk factors for GDM. Ensuring birth weight above 3000 g may help reduce risk for future GDM among female offsprings.",2017 May 5,High Prevalence of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus in Beijing: Effect of Maternal Birth Weight and Other Risk Factors,Chinese Medical Journal
947,PMC7078079,"The aim of the present study was to compare the clinical and genetic characteristics between people with type 1 diabetes who were positive and negative for autoantibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GADA) measured by enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with low‐titer GADA measured by radioimmunoassay.
Among Japanese people with type 1 diabetes in whom GADA were measured by both ELISA and radioimmunoassay, those who had low titers of GADA measured by radioimmunoassay (1.5–10 U/mL), regardless of positivity for GADA measured by ELISA, were studied. There were 65 participants with acute‐onset type 1 diabetes and 30 participants with slowly progressive insulin‐dependent diabetes mellitus. Clinical characteristics and human leukocyte antigen types were compared in ELISA‐positive (≥5 U/mL) and ELISA‐negative participants. Endogenous insulin secretion was evaluated by C‐peptide index.
Among participants with slowly progressive insulin‐dependent diabetes mellitus, postprandial C‐peptide index was significantly higher in ELISA‐negative participants than in ELISA‐positive participants (r = 0.619, P = 0.002). Among 52 participants whose human leukocyte antigen typing was carried out, all of the participants with slowly progressive insulin‐dependent diabetes mellitus who had DRB1*09:01 were positive by GADA‐ELISA (P = 0.021). In acute‐onset type 1 diabetes participants, there were no significant differences for the C‐peptide index and human leukocyte antigen genotypes.
The difference in the positivity for GADA‐ELISA might reflect cytotoxicity toward pancreatic β‐cells and preservation of endogenous insulin secretion in people with slowly progressive insulin‐dependent diabetes mellitus. We also suggest that the difference in the GADA‐ELISA‐specific epitope depends on the human leukocyte antigen genotype.
Boxplots of p‐CPI of SPIDDM participants who were GADA‐ELISA‐positive (left) and GADA‐ELISA‐negative (right) are shown. Central lines show medians; the upper and lower boxes represent the 25th and 75th percentiles, respectively; whiskers indicate minimum and maximum values, respectively. p‐CPI of GADA‐ELISA‐negative SPIDDM participants was significantly higher (p=0.0008, Mann‐Whitney U test).",2019 Aug 1,Clinical and genetic characteristics of people with type 1 diabetes who have discrepancies in titers of anti‐glutamic acid decarboxylase antibody measured by radioimmunoassay and enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay,Journal of Diabetes Investigation
948,PMC8182305,"Aquaporins (AQPs) are part of the family of the integral membrane proteins. Their function is dedicated to the transport of water, glycerol, ammonia, urea, H2O2, and other small molecules across the biological membranes. Although for many years they were scarcely considered, AQPs have a relevant role in the development of many diseases. Recent discoveries suggest, that AQPs may play an important role in the process of fat accumulation and regulation of oxidative stress, two crucial aspects of insulin resistance and type-2 diabetes (T2D).
Insulin resistance (IR) and T2D are multi-faceted systemic diseases with multiple connections to obesity and other comorbidities such as hypertension, dyslipidemia and metabolic syndrome. Both IR and T2D transcends different tissues and organs, creating the maze of mutual relationships between adipose fat depots, skeletal muscle, liver and other insulin-sensitive organs. AQPs with their heterogenous properties, distinctive tissue distribution and documented involvement in both the lipid metabolism and regulation of the oxidative stress appear to be feasible candidates in the search for the explanation to this third-millennium plague. A lot of research has been assigned to adipose tissue AQP7 and liver tissue AQP9, clarifying their relationship and coordinated work in the induction of hepatic insulin resistance. Novel research points also to other aquaporins, such as AQP11 which may be associated with the induction of insulin resistance and T2D through its involvement in hydrogen peroxide transport.
In this review we collected recent discoveries in the field of AQP's involvement in the insulin resistance and T2D. Novel paths which connect AQPs with metabolic disorders can give new fuel to the research on obesity, insulin resistance and T2D - one of the most worrying problems of the modern society.

949,PMC6031504,"Maturity‐onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a form of diabetes classically characterized as having autosomal dominant inheritance, onset before the age of 25 years in at least one family member and partly preserved pancreatic β‐cell function. The 14 responsible genes are reported to be MODY type 1~14, of which MODY 2 and 3 might be the most common forms. Although MODY is currently classified as diabetes of a single gene defect, it has become clear that mutations in rare MODYs, such as MODY 5 and MODY 6, have small mutagenic effects and low penetrance. In addition, as there are differences in the clinical phenotypes caused by the same mutation even in the same family, other phenotypic modifying factors are thought to exist; MODY could well have characteristics of type 2 diabetes mellitus, which is of multifactorial origin. Here, we outline the effects of genetic and environmental factors on the known phenotypes of MODY, focusing mainly on the examples of MODY 5 and 6, which have low penetrance, as suggestive models for elucidating the multifactorial origin of type 2 diabetes mellitus.",2018 Mar 23,Maturity‐onset diabetes of the young as a model for elucidating the multifactorial origin of type 2 diabetes mellitus,Journal of Diabetes Investigation
950,PMC8331361,"We sought to investigate whether individuals with diabetes have a higher likelihood of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, as a proxy for infection risk, than individuals without diabetes.
We conducted a cross-sectional study of publicly available data among a Mexican population, totaling 2,314,022 adults ≥ 18 years who underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing between March 1 and December 20, 2020. We used 1:1 nearest neighborhood propensity score matching by diabetes status to account for confounding among those with and without diabetes.
In the overall study population, 1,057,779 (45.7%) individuals tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 270,486 (11.7%) self-reported diabetes. After propensity score matching, patient characteristics were well-balanced, with 150,487 patients in the diabetes group (mean [SD] age 55.9 [12.7] years; 51.3% women) and 150,487 patients in the no diabetes group (55.5 [13.3] years; 50.3% women). The strictest matching algorithm (1:1 nearest neighbor) showed that compared to individuals without diabetes, having diabetes was associated with 9.0% higher odds of having a positive SARS-CoV-2 test (OR 1.09 [95% CI: 1.08–1.10]).
Presence of diabetes was associated with higher odds of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, which could have important implications for risk mitigation efforts for people with diabetes at risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.",2021 Jul 21,Diabetes mellitus as a risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 test positivity in Mexico: A propensity score matched study,Diabetes Research and Clinical Practice
951,PMC5605732,"Pancreatic β cell dysfunction and death are central in the pathogenesis of most if not all forms of diabetes. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying β cell failure is important to develop β cell protective approaches.
Here we review the role of endoplasmic reticulum stress and dysregulated endoplasmic reticulum stress signaling in β cell failure in monogenic and polygenic forms of diabetes. There is substantial evidence for the presence of endoplasmic reticulum stress in β cells in type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Direct evidence for the importance of this stress response is provided by an increasing number of monogenic forms of diabetes. In particular, mutations in the PERK branch of the unfolded protein response provide insight into its importance for human β cell function and survival. The knowledge gained from different rodent models is reviewed. More disease- and patient-relevant models, using human induced pluripotent stem cells differentiated into β cells, will further advance our understanding of pathogenic mechanisms. Finally, we review the therapeutic modulation of endoplasmic reticulum stress and signaling in β cells.
Pancreatic β cells are sensitive to excessive endoplasmic reticulum stress and dysregulated eIF2α phosphorylation, as indicated by transcriptome data, monogenic forms of diabetes and pharmacological studies. This should be taken into consideration when devising new therapeutic approaches for diabetes.",2017 Jul 12,Endoplasmic reticulum stress and eIF2α phosphorylation: The Achilles heel of pancreatic β cells,Molecular Metabolism
952,PMC8125192,"Background: To test the feasibility of benchmarking the care of women with pregnancies complicated by hyperglycaemia. Methods: A retrospective audit of volunteer diabetes services in Australia and New Zealand involving singleton pregnancies resulting in live births between 2014 and 2020. Ranges are shown and compared across services. Results: The audit included 10,144 pregnancies (gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) = 8696; type 1 diabetes (T1D) = 435; type 2 diabetes (T2D) = 1013) from 11 diabetes services. Among women with GDM, diet alone was used in 39.4% (ranging among centres from 28.8–57.3%), metformin alone in 18.8% (0.4–43.7%), and metformin and insulin in 10.1% (1.5–23.4%); when compared between sites, all p < 0.001. Birth was by elective caesarean in 12.1% (3.6–23.7%) or emergency caesarean in 9.5% (3.5–21.2%) (all p < 0.001). Preterm births (<37 weeks) ranged from 3.7% to 9.4% (p < 0.05), large for gestational age 10.3–26.7% (p < 0.001), admission to special care nursery 16.7–25.0% (p < 0.001), and neonatal hypoglycaemia (<2.6 mmol/L) 6.0–27.0% (p < 0.001).

Epidemiological cohort studies established short sleep duration as a risk factor for developing obesity and T2DM. In addition, small studies suggested that short sleep duration was associated with less weight loss following lifestyle interventions or bariatric surgery.

These patients, due to the glycemic conditions, realize during their life multiorgan changes, in different body districts. Moreover, this condition obliges them to undertake hypoglycemic therapies. Diabetes is a risk factor for many diseases, including those concerning the oral district with immunological implications.
 A comprehensive review of the literature was conducted according to PRISMA guidelines accessing the NCBI PubMed database. Authors conducted the search of articles in English language. The results of the last 10 years have been considered, which present useful information regarding the oral conditions. A total of 17 relevant studies were included in the review. The study evaluated only papers with specific inclusion criteria regarding oral health. The works initially taken into consideration were 782; subsequently applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, there were 42 works.

We report a rare case of a 37-year-old man who complained of general weakness and polyuria. He was diagnosed with aldosterone-producing adrenal adenoma and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Aldosterone enhances the secretion of potassium in the collecting duct, which can lead to hypokalemia. By contrast, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, which manifests as polyuria and polydipsia, can occur in several clinical conditions such as acquired tubular disease and those attributed to toxins and congenital causes. Among them, hypokalemia can also damage tubular structures in response to vasopressin. The patient’s urine output was >3 L/d and was diluted. Owing to the ineffectiveness of vasopressin, we eventually made a diagnosis of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Laparoscopic adrenalectomy and intraoperative kidney biopsy were subsequently performed.

Canadian National Population Health Survey (NPHS) longitudinal study was used. A subsample of the initial NPHS sample (n = 4845), free of depression or diabetes mellitus at baseline was tracked over a 10-year period. Univariate and multivariate modified Poisson regression models were used to estimate the relative risk (RR). Stratified analyses by sex were conducted to measure its moderating role. The goodness-of-fit of the various models was tested.
The cumulative incidence rate of major depressive disorder and incident diabetes mellitus at 10-year follow-up were 4.1% and 10.1% respectively. Hypertension, daily smoking, physical inactivity and being overweight or obese were shared risk factors for major depressive episode and diabetes mellitus. Being female, family stress, traumatic events, having any chronic disease or heart disease were uniquely associated with depression while increasing age and ethnicity (non-white) were unique risk factors for diabetes mellitus. Also, underweight, family stress, chronic disease, and heart disease were risk factors for major depressive disorder in both sexes. Six risk factors, age, ethnicity (non-white), high blood pressure, daily smoking, physical inactivity, and body mass index were associated with incident diabetes mellitus in both sexes.

959,PMC8319565,"Congenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (CNDI) is a rare hereditary tubular dysfunction caused mainly by X-linked recessive inheritance of AVPR2 gene mutations. Pathogenic genes are a result of mutations in AVPR2 on chromosome Xq28 and in AQP2 on chromosome 12q13. The clinical manifestations of CNDI include polyuria, compensatory polydipsia, thirst, irritability, constipation, developmental delay, mental retardation, persistent decrease in the specific gravity of urine, dehydration, and electrolyte disorders (hypernatremia and hyperchloremia). Herein, we report a rare case of CNDI caused by an AVPR2 mutation in a 2-year-old Chinese boy who had sustained polyuria, polydipsia, and irritability for more than 20 months. Laboratory examinations showed no obvious abnormality in blood sodium and chloride levels but decreased urine osmolality and specific gravity. Imaging findings were also normal. However, genetic analysis revealed a C > T transition leading to T273M missense mutations in AVPR2. We provided the boy a low-sodium diet and administered oral hydrochlorothiazide and indomethacin for 1 month, after which his clinical symptoms significantly improved. This case report suggests that CNDI is characterized by pathogenic T273M missense mutations alone and expands our understanding of the pathogenesis of CNDI.",2021 Jul 15,Case Report: A Case of Congenital Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus Caused by Thr273Met Mutation in Arginine Vasopressin Receptor 2,Frontiers in Pediatrics

However, lithium may be an exception due to its potential for causing nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, but clinical data are largely absent. The objective of this investigation was to study the association between lithium therapy and hospitalization due to hyponatraemia.
This study was a register-based case–control investigation of the general Swedish population. Patients hospitalized with a principal diagnosis of hyponatraemia (n=11,213) were compared with matched controls (n=44,801). Analyses using multivariable logistic regression adjusting for co-medication, diseases, previous hospitalizations and socioeconomic factors were deployed to calculate the association between severe hyponatraemia and the use of lithium. Additionally, newly initiated (⩽90 days) and ongoing lithium therapy was studied separately.
Compared with controls, the unadjusted odds ratio (OR) (95% confidence interval (CI)) for hospitalization due to hyponatraemia was 1.07 (0.70–1.59) for lithium. However, after adjustment for confounding factors the risk was reduced (adjusted OR: 0.53 (0.31–0.87)). Newly initiated lithium therapy was not significantly associated with hyponatraemia (adjusted OR 0.73 (0.35–5.38)). In contrast, for ongoing therapy the corresponding adjusted OR was significantly reduced (adjusted OR: 0.52 (0.30–0.87)).

961,PMC8079163,"Diabetes has been identified as a risk factor for poor prognosis of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). The aim of this study is to identify high-risk phenotypes of diabetes associated with COVID-19 severity and death.
This is the first edition of a living systematic review and meta-analysis on observational studies investigating phenotypes in individuals with diabetes and COVID-19-related death and severity. Four different databases were searched up to 10 October 2020. We used a random effects meta-analysis to calculate summary relative risks (SRR) with 95% CI. The certainty of evidence was evaluated by the GRADE tool.
A total of 22 articles, including 17,687 individuals, met our inclusion criteria.

Similar, but generally weaker and less precise associations were observed between risk phenotypes of diabetes and severity of COVID-19.
Individuals with a more severe course of diabetes have a poorer prognosis of COVID-19 compared with individuals with a milder course of disease. To further strengthen the evidence, more studies on this topic that account for potential confounders are warranted.

962,PMC8756302,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus is caused by a relative imbalance between insulin secretion and sensitivity related to the body mass index (BMI). Seven categories of oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs) are available in Japan. It is important to assess the OAD utilization patterns based on patients’ BMI levels.
OAD prescribing patterns from 2002 to 2019 were analyzed using the data collected in the computerized diabetes care database provided by the Japan Diabetes Clinical Data Management Study Group; OAD utilization patterns in 25,751 OAD‐treated type 2 diabetes mellitus patients registered in 2019 were analyzed after classifying them into five categories of BMI.
Comparing OAD usage between 2002 and 2019, sulfonylureas decreased from 44.5 to 23.2%, and biguanides (BGs) increased from 19.3 to 50.3%. Dipeptidyl peptidase‐4 inhibitors (DPP4is) increased to 56.9% in 2019. Sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) increased to 23.6% in 2019. About 90% of type 2 diabetes mellitus patients had BMI < 30 kg/m2. DPP4is were the most used OADs in 2019. When BMI exceeded 30 kg/m2, use of BGs and sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors increased, and use of sulfonylureas and DPP4is decreased. Although DPP4is were the most used OADs for patients with BMI <30 kg/m2, they were the third most prescribed OADs for patients with BMI >35 kg/m2 after BGs and sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors .
DPP4i usage was as high as that of BG in the analysis of Japanese type 2 diabetes mellitus patients with relatively low BMI. This was considered to be a treatment option appropriate for the pathophysiology in Japanese patients.

Management includes the correction of any water deficit and the use of specific pharmacological agents, including desmopressin, thiazides, and amiloride.",2021 Jan 5,Diabetes Insipidus: A Pragmatic Approach to Management,Cureus
964,PMC5720739,"To examine the characteristics of community health workers (CHWs) involved in diabetes prevention programmes (DPPs) and their contributions to expected outcomes.
Electronic databases including PubMed-MEDLINE, EBSCOHost, and SCOPUS/EMBASE were searched for studies published between January 2000 and March 2016. All studies that used CHWs to implement DPP in ≥18-year-old participants without diabetes but at high risk for developing the condition, irrespective of the study design, setting or outcomes measured, were included. Results were synthesized narratively.
Forty papers of 30 studies were identified. Studies were mainly community-based and conducted in minority populations in USA. Sample sizes ranged from 20 participants in a single community to 2369 participants in 46 communities. Although CHWs were generally from the local community, their qualifications, work experience and training received differed across studies. Overall the training was culturally sensitive and/or appropriate, covering topics such as the importance of good nutrition and the benefits of increased physical activity, communication and leadership. CHWs delivered a variety of interventions and also screened or recruited participants. The shared culture and language between CHWs and participants likely contributed to better programme implementation and successful outcomes.
The complexity of DPPs and the diverse CHW roles preclude attributing specific outcomes to CHW involvement. Nevertheless, documenting potential CHW roles and the relevant training required may optimise CHW contributions and facilitate their involvement in DPPs in the future.",2017 Dec 7,"Roles, responsibilities and characteristics of lay community health workers involved in diabetes prevention programmes: A systematic review",PLoS ONE
965,PMC5900797,"The combination of hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state and central diabetes insipidus is unusual and poses unique diagnostic and therapeutic challenges for clinicians. In a patient with diabetes mellitus presenting with polyuria and polydipsia, poor glycaemic control is usually the first aetiology that is considered, and achieving glycaemic control remains the first course of action. However, severe hypernatraemia, hyperglycaemia and discordance between urine-specific gravity and urine osmolality suggest concurrent symptomatic diabetes insipidus. We report a rare case of concurrent manifestation of hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state and central diabetes insipidus in a patient with a history of craniopharyngioma.
In patients with diabetes mellitus presenting with polyuria and polydipsia, poor glycaemic control is usually the first aetiology to be considered.
However, a history of craniopharyngioma, severe hypernatraemia, hyperglycaemia and discordance between urine-specific gravity and osmolality provide evidence of concurrent diabetes insipidus.
Therefore, if a patient with diabetes mellitus presents with severe hypernatraemia, hyperglycaemia, a low or low normal urinary-specific gravity and worsening polyuria despite correction of hyperglycaemia, concurrent diabetes insipidus should be sought.",2018 Apr 11,One too many diabetes: the combination of hyperglycaemic hyperosmolar state and central diabetes insipidus,"Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism Case Reports"
966,PMC8773111,"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is characterized by a set of metabolic complications arising from adaptive failures to the pregnancy period. Estimates point to a prevalence of 3 to 15% of pregnancies. Its etiology includes intrinsic and extrinsic aspects of the progenitress, which may contribute to the pathophysiogenesis of GDM. Recently, researchers have identified that inflammation, oxidative stress, and the gut microbiota participate in the development of the disease, with potentially harmful effects on the health of the maternal-fetal binomial, in the short and long terms. In this context, alternative therapies were investigated from two perspectives: the modulation of the intestinal microbiota, with probiotics and prebiotics, and the use of natural products with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, which may mitigate the endogenous processes of the GDM, favoring the health of the mother and her offspring, and in a future perspective, alleviating this critical public health problem.",2022 Jan 7,"Gestational Diabetes Mellitus: The Crosslink among Inflammation, Nitroxidative Stress, Intestinal Microbiota and Alternative Therapies",Antioxidants
967,PMC4477446,"The importance of short membrane sequence motifs has been shown in many works and emphasizes the related sequence motif analysis. Together with specific transmembrane helix-helix interactions, the analysis of interacting sequence parts is helpful for understanding the process during membrane protein folding and in retaining the three-dimensional fold. Here we present a simple high-throughput analysis method for deriving mutational information of interacting sequence parts. Applied on aquaporin water channel proteins, our approach supports the analysis of mutational variants within different interacting subsequences and finally the investigation of natural variants which cause diseases like, for example, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. In this work we demonstrate a simple method for massive membrane protein data analysis. As shown, the presented in silico analyses provide information about interacting sequence parts which are constrained by protein evolution. We present a simple graphical visualization medium for the representation of evolutionary influenced interaction pattern pairs (EIPPs) adapted to mutagen investigations of aquaporin-2, a protein whose mutants are involved in the rare endocrine disorder known as nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, and membrane proteins in general. Furthermore, we present a new method to derive new evolutionary variations within EIPPs which can be used for further mutagen laboratory investigations.",2015 May 28,Evolutionary Influenced Interaction Pattern as Indicator for the Investigation of Natural Variants Causing Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus,Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine
968,PMC6198430,"Diabetic patients, during the course of the disease, are most likely to experience depressive symptoms that might ultimately lead to suicidal ideation or suicide. The size of literature in diabetes depression/suicide is a good indicator of national and international efforts to address psychological co-morbidities associated with diabetes mellitus (DM). Therefore, the objective of this study was to give a comprehensive analysis, both quantitative and qualitative, of scientific literature in diabetes depression/suicide.
SciVerse Scopus was used to retrieve relevant literature up to 2016.
In total, 1664 journal documents were retrieved with an average of 26.9 citations per article and an h-index of 98. Publications started in 1949 but showed a steep and noticeable increase after 2001. Retrieved articles were published in 641 different journals with Diabetes Care journal being the top productive one with a total of 130 (7.8%) articles. Researchers from 83 different countries participated in retrieved publications. Researchers from the United States of America participated in publishing 685 articles. There was a strong and positive correlation between research output and Gross Domestic Product (r = 0.083; p < 0.001) but not with prevalence or mortality caused by DM. Researchers from 4870 different institutions/organizations participated in publishing retrieved articles. Publications from the University of Washington, Seattle, USA had the highest h-index (38), while “VA medical centers” had the highest number of publications (75; 4.5%). In total, 5715 authors appeared in retrieved articles giving an average of 3.4 authors per article. Top cited articles focused on prevalence, impact of depression on glycemic control, and potential risk of diabetic complications. The total number of publications in depression/suicide in diabetic patients was lesser than that in cardiac (1938) or in cancer (1828) patients. However, publications in diabetes depression/suicide exceeded those in cardiac and cancer in the last 2 years of the study period.
The current study showed a noticeable growth of publications indicative of the importance of this topic. Research focusing on the psychiatric component of diabetes mellitus needs to be strengthened and encouraged. At the practical level, screening for depression/suicide among patients attending primary healthcare clinics is needed to optimize health and quality of life of diabetic patients.

969,PMC7644753,"Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) occurs in approximately 20–40% of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Patients with DKD have a higher risk of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers and antihyperglycemic drugs form the mainstay of DKD management and aim to restrict progression to more severe stages of DKD. Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) control hyperglycemia by blocking renal glucose reabsorption in addition to preventing inflammation, thereby improving endothelial function and reducing oxidative stress; consequently, this class of prescription medicines is emerging as an important addition to the therapeutic armamentarium. The EMPA-REG OUTCOME, DECLARE TIMI 58, and CANVAS trials demonstrated the renoprotective effects of SGLT2i, such as restricting decline in glomerular filtration rate, in the progression of albuminuria, and in death due to renal causes. The renoprotection provided by SGLT2i was further confirmed in the CREDENCE study, which showed a 30% reduction in progression of chronic kidney disease, and in the DELIGHT study, which demonstrated a reduction in albuminuria with dapagliflozin compared with placebo (− 21.0%, confidence interval [CI] − 34.1 to − 5.2, p = 0.011). Furthermore, a meta-analysis demonstrated a reduced risk of dialysis, transplantation, or death due to kidney disease (relative risk 0.67; 95% CI 0.52–0.86; p = 0.0019) and a 45% risk reduction in worsening of renal function, end-stage renal disease, or renal death (hazard ratio 0.55, CI 0.48–0.64, p < 0.0001) with SGLT2i, irrespective of baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate. Thus, there is emerging evidence that SGLT2i may be used to curb the mortality and improve the quality of life in patients with DKD. However, clinicians need to effectively select candidates for SGLT2i therapy. In this consensus statement, we have qualitatively synthesized evidence demonstrating the renal effects of SGLT2i and proposed recommendations for optimal use of SGLT2i to effectively manage and delay progression of DKD.",2020 Oct 6,Kidney Disease in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Benefits of Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter 2 Inhibitors: A Consensus Statement,Diabetes Therapy
970,PMC4900976,"The use of insulin analogs for the treatment of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is widespread; however, the therapeutic benefits still require further evaluation given their higher costs. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of analog insulin glargine compared to recombinant DNA (rDNA) insulin in patients with T1DM in observational studies, building on previous reviews of randomized controlled trials comparing neutral protamine Hagedorn insulin and insulin glargine.
A systematic review with a meta-analysis was performed. The review included cohort studies and registries available on PubMed, LILACS, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), as well as manual and gray literature searches. The meta-analysis was conducted in Review Manager 5.3 software. The primary outcomes were glycated hemoglobin (Hb1Ac), weight gain, and hypoglycemia. Methodological quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale.
Out of 796 publications, 11 studies were finally included. The meta-analysis favored insulin glargine in HbA1c outcomes (adult patients) and hypoglycemic episodes (P < 0.05), but without reaching glycemic control (Hb1Ac to approximately 7%). The methodological quality of the studies was moderate, noting that 45% of studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies.
Given the high heterogeneity of the studies, the discrete value presented by the estimated effect on effectiveness and safety, potential conflicts of interest of the studies, and the appreciable higher cost of insulin glargine, there is still no support for recommending first-line therapy with analogs. The role of analogs in the treatment of T1DM could be better determined by further observational studies of good methodological quality to assess their long-term effectiveness and safety, as well as their cost-effectiveness.",2016 Apr 5,Clinical Effectiveness and Safety of Analog Glargine in Type 1 Diabetes: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,Diabetes Therapy

973,PMC6659178,"Type 1 and type 2 diabetes are increasing in prevalence and diabetes complications are common. Diabetes complications are rarely studied in youth, despite the potential onset in childhood. Microvascular complications of diabetes include retinopathy, diabetic kidney disease or nephropathy, and neuropathy that may be somatic or autonomic. Macrovascular disease is the leading cause of death in patients with type 1 diabetes. Strict glycaemic control will reduce microvascular and macrovascular complications; however, they may still manifest in youth. This article discusses the diagnosis and treatment of complications that arise from type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus in youth. Screening for complications is paramount as early intervention improves outcome. Screening should commence from 11 years of age depending on the duration of type 1 diabetes or at diagnosis for patients with type 2 diabetes. Diabetic retinopathy may require invasive treatment such as laser therapy or intravitreal antivascular endothelial growth factor therapy to prevent future blindness. Hypertension and albuminuria may herald diabetic nephropathy and require management with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition. In addition to hypertension, dyslipidaemia must be treated to reduce macrovascular complications. Interventional trials aimed at examining the treatment of diabetes complications in youth are few. Statins, ACE inhibitors and metformin have been successfully trialled in adolescents with type 1 diabetes with positive effects on lipid profile, microalbuminuria and measures of vascular health. Although relatively rare, complications do occur in youth and further research into effective treatment for diabetes complications, particularly therapeutics in children in addition to prevention strategies is required.",2019 Jul 25,Management of diabetes complications in youth,Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism

976,PMC6392655,"We assessed the association between diabetes mellitus and the risk of pleural empyema in Taiwan.
A population-based retrospective cohort study was conducted using the database of the Taiwan National Health Insurance Program. There were 28,802 subjects aged 20 to 84 years who were newly diagnosed with diabetes mellitus from 2000 to 2010 as the diabetes group and 114,916 randomly selected subjects without diabetes mellitus as the non-diabetes group. The diabetes group and the non-diabetes group were matched by sex, age, comorbidities, and the year of index date. The incidence of pleural empyema at the end of 2011 was estimated. A multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for pleural empyema associated with diabetes mellitus.
The overall incidence of pleural empyema was 1.65-fold higher in the diabetes group than that in the non-diabetes group (1.58 vs 0.96 per 10,000 person-years, 95% CI 1.57–1.72). After adjusting for confounders, a multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression model revealed that the adjusted HR of pleural empyema was 1.71 in subjects with diabetes mellitus (95% CI 1.16–2.51), compared with those without diabetes mellitus. In further analysis, even in the absence of any comorbidity, the adjusted HR was 1.99 for subjects with diabetes mellitus alone (95% CI 1.18–3.38).

977,PMC7195762,"Xylitol is an approved food additive that is widely used as a sweetener in many manufactured products. It is also used in pharmaceuticals. Secondary oxalosis resulting from high dietary oxalate has been reported. However, reported cases of oxalosis following xylitol infusion are rare.
A 39-year-old man with a 16-year history of organic psychiatric disorder was hospitalized for a laparoscopic cholecystectomy because of cholecystolithiasis. He had been treated with several antipsychotics and mood stabilizers, including lithium. The patient had polyuria (> 4000 mL/day) and his serum sodium levels ranged from 150 to 160 mmol/L. Urine osmolality was 141 mOsm/L, while serum arginine vasopressin level was 6.4 pg/mL. The patient was diagnosed with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI), and lithium was gradually discontinued. Postoperative urine volumes increased further to a maximum of 10,000 mL/day, and up to 10,000 mL/day of 5% xylitol was administered. The patient’s consciousness level declined and serum creatinine increased to 4.74 mg/dL. This was followed by coma and metabolic acidosis. After continuous venous hemodiafiltration, serum sodium improved to the upper 140 mmol/L range and serum creatinine decreased to 1.25 mg/dL at discharge. However, polyuria and polydipsia of approximately 4000 mL/day persisted. Renal biopsy showed oxalate crystals and decreased expression of aquaporin-2 (AQP2) in the renal tubules. Urinary AQP2 was undetected. The patient was discharged on day 82 after admission.
Our patient was diagnosed with lithium-induced NDI and secondary oxalosis induced by excess xylitol infusion. NDI became apparent perioperatively because of fasting, and an overdose of xylitol infusion led to cerebrorenal oxalosis. Our patient received a maximum xylitol dose of 500 g/day and a total dose of 2925 g. Patients receiving lithium therapy must be closely monitored during the perioperative period, and rehydration therapy using xylitol infusion should be avoided in such cases.",2020 May 1,Secondary oxalosis induced by xylitol concurrent with lithium-induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus: a case report,BMC Nephrology
978,PMC3349710,"To test the hypothesis that a microalbuminuria (MA) threshold can help predict the risk for the development of diabetic retinopathy (DR) in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)_ patients.
We conducted a cross-sectional study of 4739 subjects with T2DM and a prospective study of 297 subjects with T2DM in China respectively.
Clinical and laboratory data were collected and biologic risk factors associated with any DR were analysed.
In the cross-sectional study, we found that MA was an independent risk factor for DR development; further, when the patients were divided into MA deciles, odds ratio (ORs) of DR for the patients in the sixth MA decile (10.7 mg/24 h) was 1.579-fold (1.161–2.147) compared to that for patients in the first MA decile. Furthermore, the OR of DR increased with a gradual increase in MA levels. Similarly, in the prospective study, during a mean follow-up of 4.5 years, we found that 51 patients (29.0%) of the 176 subjects with high MA level (10.7–30 mg/24 h) developed DR, while 17 patients (14.1%) of the 121 subjects with lower MA (<10.7 mg/24 h) developed DR, and the relative risk ratio of the development of DR is 2.13(95% CI, 1.58–3.62, P<0.001).

979,PMC5751142,"The kidney plays a central role in the regulation of the body water balance. The process of targeting the water channel aquaporin-2 (AQP2) on the apical plasma membrane of the collecting duct (CD) principal cells is mainly regulated by the antidiuretic peptide hormone arginine vasopressin (AVP), which is responsible for the maintenance of water homeostasis. Recently, much attention has been focused on the local factors modulating renal water reabsorption by AQP2 in the collecting ducts, especially prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). PGE2 is a lipid mediator involved in a variety of physiological and pathophysiological processes in the kidney. The biological function of PGE2 is mainly mediated by four G-protein-coupled receptors, namely EP1-4, which couple to drive separate intracellular signaling pathways. Increasing evidence demonstrates that PGE2 is essential for renal water transport regulation via multiple mechanisms. Each EP receptor plays a unique role in regulating water reabsorption in renal collecting ducts. This brief review highlights the role of PGE2 in the regulation of water reabsorption and discusses the involvement of each EP receptor subtype in renal collecting duct. A better understanding of the role of PGE2 in renal water transport process may improve disease management strategies for water balance disorders, including nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.",2017 Nov 27,Prostaglandin E2 in the Regulation of Water Transport in Renal Collecting Ducts,International Journal of Molecular Sciences
980,PMC8706563,"Rare genetic diseases are a group of pathologies with often unmet clinical needs. Even if rare by a single genetic disease (from 1/2000 to 1/more than 1,000,000), the total number of patients concerned account for approximatively 400 million peoples worldwide. Finding treatments remains challenging due to the complexity of these diseases, the small number of patients and the challenge in conducting clinical trials. Therefore, innovative preclinical research strategies are required. The zebrafish has emerged as a powerful animal model for investigating rare diseases. Zebrafish combines conserved vertebrate characteristics with high rate of breeding, limited housing requirements and low costs. More than 84% of human genes responsible for diseases present an orthologue, suggesting that the majority of genetic diseases could be modelized in zebrafish. In this review, we emphasize the unique advantages of zebrafish models over other in vivo models, particularly underlining the high throughput phenotypic capacity for therapeutic screening. We briefly introduce how the generation of zebrafish transgenic lines by gene-modulating technologies can be used to model rare genetic diseases. Then, we describe how zebrafish could be phenotyped using state-of-the-art technologies. Two prototypic examples of rare diseases illustrate how zebrafish models could play a critical role in deciphering the underlying mechanisms of rare genetic diseases and their use to identify innovative therapeutic solutions.",2021 Dec 12,Use of Zebrafish Models to Boost Research in Rare Genetic Diseases,International Journal of Molecular Sciences
981,PMC8274870,"Double disease burden such as Tuberculosis and Diabetes mellitus comorbidity is evident and on rising especially in high burden settings such as Tanzania. There is limited information about the availability of tuberculosis/diabetes integrated healthcare services in Tanzania. Therefore, this study explored the availability and examined the readiness of healthcare facilities with tuberculosis services to manage diabetes mellitus in Tanzania.
We abstracted data from the 2014–2015 Tanzania Service Provision Assessment Survey datasets. The service availability was assessed by calculating the proportion of tuberculosis facilities reported to manage diabetes mellitus. There were four domains; each domain with some indicators for calculating the readiness index. High readiness was considered if the tuberculosis facilities scored at least half (≥50%) of the indicators listed in each of the four domains (staff training and guideline, diagnostics, equipment, and medicines) as is recommended by the World Health Organization-Service Availability and Readiness Assessment manual while low readiness for otherwise.
Out of 341 healthcare facilities with tuberculosis services included in the current study, 238 (70.0%) reported providing management for diabetes mellitus. The majority of the facilities were dispensaries and clinics 48.1%; publicly owned 72.6%; and located in rural 62.6%. Overall, the readiness of tuberculosis facilities to manage diabetes was low (10.8%). Similarly, the readiness was low based on the domain-specific readiness of trained staff and guidelines.
Although the majority of the healthcare facilities with tuberculosis services had diabetes mellitus services the overall readiness was low. This finding provides a piece of evidence to inform the policymakers in high burden and low resource countries to strengthen the co-management of tuberculosis and diabetes.",2021 Jul 12,Readiness of healthcare facilities with tuberculosis services to manage diabetes mellitus in Tanzania: A nationwide analysis for evidence-informed policy-making in high burden settings,PLoS ONE
982,PMC6985429,"Background and Objectives: Congenital or primary nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) is a rare genetic disorder that severely impairs renal concentrating ability, resulting in massive polyuria. There is limited information about prognosis or evidence guiding the management of these patients, either in the high-risk period after diagnosis, or long-term. We describe the clinical presentation, genetic etiology, treatment and renal outcomes in a large group of children <21 years with NDI.
Design: A multi-center retrospective chart review.
Results: We report on 66 subjects from 16 centers. They were mainly male (89%) and white (67%). Median age at diagnosis was 4.2 months interquartile range (IQR 1.1, 9.8). A desmopressin acetate loading test was administered to 46% of children at a median age of 4.8 months (IQR 2.8, 7.6); only 15% had a water restriction test. Genetic testing or a known family history was present in 70% of the patients; out of those genetically tested, 89 and 11% had mutations in AVPR2 and AQP2, respectively. No positive family history or genetic testing was available for 30%. The most common treatments were thiazide diuretics (74%), potassium-sparing diuretics (67%) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (42%). At the time of first treatment, 70 and 71% of children were below −2 standard deviations (SD) for weight and height, respectively. At last follow-up, median age was 72.3 months (IQR 40.9, 137.2) and the percentage below −2 SD improved to 29% and 38% for weight and height, respectively. Adverse outcomes included inpatient hospitalizations (61%), urologic complications (37%), and chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 2 or higher in 23%.
Conclusion: We found the majority of patients were treated with thiazides with either a potassium sparing diuretic and/or NSAIDs. Hospitalizations, urologic complications, short stature, and CKD were common.

A total of 107 participants aged ≥18 years with diabetes and psychiatric disorders treated at psychiatric outpatient clinics in Denmark were recruited from August 2018 to June 2019. This descriptive cross-sectional study includes data from medical records on quality of diabetes care (eg, level and annual examination of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)) and questionnaires on diabetes management (measured on items from the Summary of Diabetes Self-Care Activities Scale and diabetes distress based on Problem Areas in Diabetes Scale (PAID-5)), diabetes support (no, some or high support from eight potential support persons and experience of care actions measured on items from Patient Assessment of Chronic Illness Care) and well-being (WHO 5-Item Scale and self-rated general health).
The mean age was 52 years, 56% were men, the mean body mass index was 31.9 kg/m2, the median HbA1c was 53 mmol/mol (7.0%) and the mean blood pressure was 131/83 mm Hg. The proportion with annual measurements of HbA1c was 93%, blood pressure 80%, cholesterol 93%, foot examination 77% and eye examination 75%.

Its definitive diagnosis requires a pituitary biopsy, which is an invasive procedure. Recently, anti-rabphilin-3A antibody has been reported as a potential diagnostic marker for LINH in adults; however, only a few cases have been reported in children. Here, we present a case of childhood-onset LINH in a 10-yr-old boy identified as anti-rabphilin-3A antibody positive during chronic phase, 9 yr post-onset of central diabetes insipidus (CDI). T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed pituitary stalk thickening and absence of posterior pituitary bright signal spot, and the hormonal responses of the adenohypophysis to GHRH, TRH, CRH, and LHRH revealed no abnormalities during the first admission. MRI at 5 mo post-onset indicated reduced stalk swelling; however, replacement treatment with intranasal desmopressin was continued to counter unimproved CDI. Additionally, GH replacement therapy was also initiated to counter its deficiency.

985,PMC6854535,"The present study reports on the frequency and the spectrum of genetic variants causative of monogenic diabetes in Russian children with non-type 1 diabetes mellitus. The present study included 60 unrelated Russian children with non-type 1 diabetes mellitus diagnosed before the age of 18 years. Genetic variants were screened using whole-exome sequencing (WES) in a panel of 35 genes causative of maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) and transient or permanent neonatal diabetes. Verification of the WES results was performed using PCR-direct sequencing. A total of 38 genetic variants were identified in 33 out of 60 patients (55%). The majority of patients (27/33, 81.8%) had variants in MODY-related genes: GCK (n=19), HNF1A (n=2), PAX4 (n=1), ABCC8 (n=1), KCNJ11 (n=1), GCK+HNF1A (n=1), GCK+BLK (n=1) and GCK+BLK+WFS1 (n=1). A total of 6 patients (6/33, 18.2%) had variants in MODY-unrelated genes: GATA6 (n=1), WFS1 (n=3), EIF2AK3 (n=1) and SLC19A2 (n=1). A total of 15 out of 38 variants were novel, including GCK, HNF1A, BLK, WFS1, EIF2AK3 and SLC19A2. To summarize, the present study demonstrates a high frequency and a wide spectrum of genetic variants causative of monogenic diabetes in Russian children with non-type 1 diabetes mellitus. The spectrum includes previously known and novel variants in MODY-related and unrelated genes, with multiple variants in a number of patients. The prevalence of GCK variants indicates that diagnostics of monogenic diabetes in Russian children may begin with testing for MODY2. However, the remaining variants are present at low frequencies in 9 different genes, altogether amounting to ~50% of the cases and highlighting the efficiency of using WES in non-GCK-MODY cases.",2019 Oct 16,Whole-exome sequencing in Russian children with non-type 1 diabetes mellitus reveals a wide spectrum of genetic variants in MODY-related and unrelated genes,Molecular Medicine Reports
986,PMC4014912,"Neonatal diabetes mellitus (NDM) is the term commonly used to describe diabetes with onset before 6 months‐of‐age. It occurs in approximately one out of every 100,000–300,000 live births. Although this term encompasses diabetes of any etiology, it is recognized that NDM diagnosed before 6 months‐of‐age is most often monogenic in nature. Clinically, NDM subgroups include transient (TNDM) and permanent NDM (PNDM), as well as syndromic cases of NDM. TNDM often develops within the first few weeks of life and remits by a few months of age. However, relapse occurs in 50% of cases, typically in adolescence or adulthood. TNDM is most frequently caused by abnormalities in the imprinted region of chromosome 6q24, leading to overexpression of paternally derived genes. Mutations in KCNJ11 and ABCC8, encoding the two subunits of the adenosine triphosphate‐sensitive potassium channel on the β‐cell membrane, can cause TNDM, but more often result in PNDM. NDM as a result of mutations in KCNJ11 and ABCC8 often responds to sulfonylureas, allowing transition from insulin therapy. Mutations in other genes important to β‐cell function and regulation, and in the insulin gene itself, also cause NDM. In 40% of NDM cases, the genetic cause remains unknown. Correctly identifying monogenic NDM has important implications for appropriate treatment, expected disease course and associated conditions, and genetic testing for at‐risk family members. Early recognition of monogenic NDM allows for the implementation of appropriate therapy, leading to improved outcomes and potential societal cost savings.

988,PMC6961406,"Mutations of the WFS1 gene are responsible for most cases of Wolfram syndrome (WS), a rare, recessively inherited neurodegenerative disorder characterized by juvenile-onset non-autoimmune diabetes mellitus and optic atrophy. Variants of WFS1 are also associated with non-syndromic hearing loss and type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Our study adds to literature significant associations between WS and T2DM.
In this study, we analyzed the clinical and genetic data of two families with high prevalence of WS and T2DM. Genetic linkage analysis and DNA sequencing were exploited to identify pathogenic variants. One novel pathogenic variant (c.2243-2244insC) and one known pathogenic (c.1232_1233delCT) (frameshift) variant were identified in exon eight of WFS1 gene.
The mutational and phenotypic spectrum of WS is broadened by our report of novel WFS1 mutation. Our results reveal the value of molecular analysis of WFS1 in the improvement of clinical diagnostics for WS.

989,PMC6400173,"Diabetes mellitus often causes high economic burden on the patients and their households. The present study aimed to assess the incidence and intensity of catastrophic health expenditure (CHE) relating to type 2 diabetes mellitus care, and to explore its determinants in China.
A total of 1,948 type 2 diabetes patients were included in the analysis. CHE for type 2 diabetes mellitus was defined as out‐of‐pocket payments for diabetes care that were ≥40% of the non‐food expenditure of a household. The Chi‐square‐test was used to identify the factors associated with CHE. Multivariate logistic regression was used to assess the effects of explanatory analysis variables.
The incidence of CHE for type 2 diabetes mellitus care was 13.8%. An association was observed between CHE incidence and household income level, and the poorest group was more likely to experience CHE as a result of diabetes mellitus care. The type 2 diabetes mellitus patients with complications were found to be more likely to experience CHE. Diabetes patients who experienced outpatient or inpatient services increased the likelihood of CHE, and those who experienced inpatient services were more likely to incur CHE.
Type 2 diabetes mellitus has a significantly catastrophic effect on patients and their households in China. Early screening for type 2 diabetes mellitus patients among the high‐risk groups and effective management of the detected cases should be priorities to reduce the overall healthcare expenditure for type 2 diabetes mellitus.",2018 Aug 25,"Catastrophic health expenditure among type 2 diabetes mellitus patients: A province‐wide study in Shandong, China",Journal of Diabetes Investigation
990,PMC8278840,"To create and compare survival models from admission laboratory indices in people hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with and without diabetes.
Retrospective observational study of patients with COVID-19 with or without diabetes admitted to Sheffield Teaching Hospitals from 29 February to 01 May 2020. Predictive variables for in-hospital mortality from COVID-19 were explored using Cox proportional hazard models.
Out of 505 patients, 156 (30.8%) had diabetes mellitus (DM) of which 143 (91.7%) had type 2 diabetes. There were significantly higher in-hospital COVID-19 deaths in those with DM [DM COVID-19 deaths 54 (34.6%) vs. non-DM COVID-19 deaths 88 (25.2%): P < 0.05]. Activated partial thromboplastin time (APPT) > 24 s without anticoagulants (HR 6.38, 95% CI: 1.07–37.87: P = 0.04), APTT > 24 s with anticoagulants (HR 24.01, 95% CI: 3.63–159.01: P < 0.001), neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio > 8 (HR 6.18, 95% CI: 2.36–16.16: P < 0.001), and sodium > 136 mmol/L (HR 3.27, 95% CI: 1.12–9.56: P = 0.03) at admission, were only associated with in-hospital COVID-19 mortality for those with diabetes.
At admission, elevated APTT with or without anticoagulants, neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio and serum sodium are unique factors that predict in-hospital COVID-19 mortality in patients with diabetes compared to those without. This novel finding may lead to research into haematological and biochemical mechanisms to understand why those with diabetes are more susceptible to poor outcomes when infected with Covid-19, and contribute to identification of those most at risk when admitted to hospital.",2021 Jul 14,"Higher admission activated partial thromboplastin time, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, serum sodium, and anticoagulant use predict in-hospital COVID-19 mortality in people with Diabetes: Findings from Two University Hospitals in the U.K",Diabetes Research and Clinical Practice
991,PMC8001638,"Diabetes mellitus is a major healthcare problem. It is not only characterized by hyperglycemia and chronic complications, but in longer lasting diabetes and a longer living population, it is also associated with accelerated arterial ageing, which importantly contributes to cardiovascular complications. The accelerated arterial ageing in patients with diabetes should be considered separately from arterial ageing in patients without diabetes. Basic and clinical research have allowed better insight into the mechanisms of arterial ageing. In a simplified mechanistic way, it could be considered that the three tightly connected cornerstone characteristics of arterial ageing in patients with diabetes are: phenotypic presentation as endothelial dysfunction and arterial stiffness, and the underlying basic ageing-facilitating mechanism represented as the impaired expression of genetic longevity pathways. Currently, specific drugs for preventing/treating arterial ageing are not available. Therefore, we aimed to review the capacity of available drugs, particularly antidiabetic drugs, to interfere with the arterial ageing process. In the near future, these characteristics could help to guide therapy in patients with diabetes. Overall, it appears that arterial ageing could become a new target in diabetes. The expanding knowledge regarding the capability of antidiabetic drugs and other available drugs to inhibit/delay arterial aging is therefore essential.",2021 Mar 10,Treating Arterial Ageing in Patients with Diabetes: From Mechanisms to Effective Drugs,International Journal of Molecular Sciences
992,PMC6818125,"Atypical presentations of diabetes mellitus (DM) have been reported in non-European ethnic populations under various names. It is unclear whether those names are used for the same or different clinical phenotypes. Unclear terminology may lead to inappropriate treatment and an underestimation of the burden caused by atypical diabetes phenotypes overlapping with classic types of diabetes. This review aimed to describe the terms used for atypical forms of diabetes and to investigate whether the terms are used for similar or different phenotypes.
PubMed and Scopus were searched for relevant publications in French or English available before 15 September 2015 using the terms: ”Atypical diabetes”, “Malnutrition Related Diabetes Mellitus (MRDM)”, “Fibro-calculus pancreatic diabetes (FCPD)”, Protein deficient Pancreatic Diabetes (PDPD)”, “African diabetes”, “Ketosis prone-type 2 diabetes”, “tropical diabetes”, “Flatbush diabetes”, “J-type diabetes”. Titles, abstracts screening and quality assessment were performed by two independent authors. Observational studies addressing atypical diabetes in humans aged 14 years and above were included. One author extracted data from selected articles.
22 articles among 350 identified articles were retained for data extraction. Two atypical diabetes phenotypes were identified, each of them with a variety of names but similar definitions. One phenotype occurred in very thin people less than 30 years of age, typically from poor socio-economic backgrounds and requires insulin for life. It differs from type 1 diabetes in the tolerance of high blood glucose without ketosis in the absence of exogenous insulin. The second phenotype resembles type1 diabetes as it presents with ketosis at onset but responds well, as type2 diabetes, to oral hypoglycemic drugs after initial stabilization with insulin. It occurs in individuals who are usually over 30 years of age, with normal or overweight and absence of auto antibodies mainly found in type 1 diabetes.
The scarce existing literature used various terms for similar diabetes phenotypes. Agreement on nomenclature for the various forms of diabetes using the above reported characteristics are needed in populations where atypical forms of diabetes exist as well as better characterization of phenotypes and genotypes to inform evidence based treatment.",2019 Jul 21,Atypical forms of diabetes mellitus in Africans and other non-European ethnic populations in low- and middle-income countries: a systematic literature review,Journal of Global Health
993,PMC6013691,"Cranial diabetes insipidus (CDI) is a treatable chronic condition that can potentially develop into a life-threatening medical emergency. CDI is due to the relative or absolute lack of the posterior pituitary hormone vasopressin (AVP), also known as anti-diuretic hormone. AVP deficiency results in uncontrolled diuresis. Complete deficiency can lead to polyuria exceeding 10 L/24 h. Given a functioning thirst mechanism and free access to water, patients with CDI can normally maintain adequate fluid balance through increased drinking. Desmopressin (DDAVP, a synthetic AVP analogue) reduces uncontrolled water excretion in CDI and is commonly used in treatment. Critically, loss of thirst perception (through primary pathology or reduced consciousness) or limited access to water (through non-availability, disability or inter-current illness) in a patient with CDI can lead to life-threatening dehydration. This position can be further exacerbated through the omission of DDAVP. Recent data have highlighted serious adverse events (including deaths) in patients with CDI. These adverse outcomes and deaths have occurred through a combination of lack of knowledge and treatment failures by health professionals. Here, with our guideline, we recommend treatment pathways for patients with known CDI admitted to hospital. Following these guidelines is essential for the safe management of patients with CDI.",2018 May 8,SOCIETY FOR ENDOCRINOLOGY CLINICAL GUIDANCE: Inpatient management of cranial diabetes insipidus,Endocrine Connections
994,PMC8395426,"The importance of the psychological impact of diabetes is globally well-documented. Evidence suggests that there is a high level of psychosocial burden of diabetes in India. Moreover, there is a lack of relevant knowledge among the patients and caregivers regarding the psychological impact of diabetes and how to cope with it, as compared to the majority of other countries. “Happiness of the patient” is an essential component of diabetes management, which potentially affects the treatment outcome, treatment adherence, self-care, and lifelong management of diabetes. Although several validated tools and scales exist for measuring psychological outcomes both in patients and physicians, tools to assess “happiness in diabetes care” are still lacking. With this background, an expert group meeting was held in India in September 2019, involving nine expert diabetologists and endocrinologists across the country to discuss the concept of “glycemic happiness”. This article summarizes the expert opinion on the factors affecting psychological outcomes in diabetes, introduces the concept of glycemic happiness, describes available scales and tools to measure general happiness, and delineates the five sets of questionnaires developed with questions that may help correlate with “glycemic happiness”. The questionnaires are based on a five-point Likert method. The experts also discussed and decided upon the study design for a proposed observational survey to assess glycemic happiness of persons with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) based on the developed five sets of questionnaires. Given the huge burden of diabetes in India, the introduction of the concept of glycemic happiness will help in the optimization of diabetes care in the country.",2021 Aug 20,An Expert Opinion on “Glycemic Happiness”: Delineating the Concept and Determinant Factors for Persons with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus,Clinics and Practice

996,PMC5860263,"Variants in HNF1A encoding hepatocyte nuclear factor 1α (HNF-1A) are associated with maturity-onset diabetes of the young form 3 (MODY 3) and type 2 diabetes. We investigated whether functional classification of HNF1A rare coding variants can inform models of diabetes risk prediction in the general population by analyzing the effect of 27 HNF1A variants identified in well-phenotyped populations (n = 4,115). Bioinformatics tools classified 11 variants as likely pathogenic and showed no association with diabetes risk (combined minor allele frequency [MAF] 0.22%; odds ratio [OR] 2.02; 95% CI 0.73–5.60; P = 0.18). However, a different set of 11 variants that reduced HNF-1A transcriptional activity to <60% of normal (wild-type) activity was strongly associated with diabetes in the general population (combined MAF 0.22%; OR 5.04; 95% CI 1.99–12.80; P = 0.0007). Our functional investigations indicate that 0.44% of the population carry HNF1A variants that result in a substantially increased risk for developing diabetes. These results suggest that functional characterization of variants within MODY genes may overcome the limitations of bioinformatics tools for the purposes of presymptomatic diabetes risk prediction in the general population.",2016 Nov 29,Functional Investigations of HNF1A Identify Rare Variants as Risk Factors for Type 2 Diabetes in the General Population,Diabetes
997,PMC6670179,"Wolfram syndrome is a rare genetic, progressive, neurodegenerative disorder characterised by childhood-onset diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, optic atrophy and deafness. To date, the economic burden of Wolfram syndrome has not been well-studied or reported. The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost of illness (COI) of all people with Wolfram syndrome in the UK and to identify major determinants of cost from a service provider perspective (National Health Service, NHS).
A prevalence-based approach was used to model the UK Wolfram syndrome specialist service. Model inputs were informed by a pragmatic literature review and UK reference costs, in conjunction with patient interviews and expert opinion. A deterministic sensitivity analysis (DSA) was run at 10% to identify major cost drivers.
The total COI of all people with Wolfram syndrome to the NHS was £1,055,899 per year, with an average annual cost per person with Wolfram syndrome of £16,498. Costs associated with diabetes mellitus care, late-stage diabetes mellitus complications and hearing impairment contributed most to the COI (18.9, 21.4 and 15.8% of the COI, respectively). The DSA identified costs associated with hearing impairment, diabetes mellitus care and end-stage renal disease (a diabetes mellitus complication) as major model drivers.
The annual cost of Wolfram syndrome to the NHS was found to be substantial, with areas of potential cost savings identified, such as diabetes mellitus management.

998,PMC6343255,"Since 2011 six immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have been approved to treat patients with many advanced solid tumor and hematological malignancies to improve their prognosis. Case reports of their endocrine immune-related adverse events [irAEs]) are increasingly published as more real-world patients with these malignancies are treated with these drugs. They alert physicians of a drug’s AEs (which may change during a drug’s life cycle) and contribute to post-marketing safety surveillance. Using a modified framework of Arksey and O’Malley, we conducted a scoping review of the spectrum and characteristics of ICI-induced endocrinopathies case reports before and after ICIs are marketed.
In July 2017, we searched, without date and language restrictions, 4 citation databases for ICI-induced endocrinopathies. We also hand-searched articles’ references, contents of relevant journals, and ran supplemental searches to capture recent reports through January 2018. For this study, a case should have information on type of cancer, type of ICI, clinical presentation, biochemical tests, treatment plus temporal association of ICI initiation with endocrinopathies. Two endocrinologists independently extracted the data which were then summarized and categorized.
One hundred seventy nine articles reported 451 cases of ICI-induced endocrinopathies - 222 hypopituitarism, 152 thyroid disorders, 66 diabetes mellitus, 6 primary adrenal insufficiencies, 1 ACTH-dependent Cushing’s syndrome, 1 hypoparathyroidism and 3 diabetes insipidus cases. Their clinical presentations reflect hormone excess or deficiency. Some were asymptomatic and others life-threatening. One or more endocrine glands could be affected. Polyglandular endocrinopathies could present simultaneously or in sequence. Many occur within 5 months of therapy initiation; a few occurred after ICI was stopped. Mostly irreversible, they required long-term hormone replacement. High dose steroids were used when non-endocrine AEs coexisted or as therapy in adrenal insufficiency. There was variability of information in the case reports but all met the study criteria to make a diagnosis.
The spectrum of ICI-induced endocrinopathies is wide (5 glands affected) and their presentation varied (12 endocrinopathies). Clinical reasoning integrating clinical, biochemical and treatment information is needed to properly diagnose and manage them. Physicians should be vigilant for their occurrence and be able to diagnose, investigate and manage them appropriately at onset and follow-up.
