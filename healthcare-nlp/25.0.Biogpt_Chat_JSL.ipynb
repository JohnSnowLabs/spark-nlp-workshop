commonly used to treat emphysema ? answer: Hello, There are two types of medications to treat emphysema: 1. Alpha agonists ( like albuterol or albuterol / levosalbutamol ) are used to treat symptoms of shortness of breath ( SOB ) and tightness in the chest ( tightness in chest ). These meds cause a mild to moderate increase in heart rate ( tachycardia ). 2. Beta blockers ( like propranolol or metoprolol ) are used to treat or to prevent symptoms of heart failure ( ejection fraction is 20 % or less ). These medications cause or worsen shortness of breath, tightness in chest, heart rate. You can take a combination of these medications. The combination that you will work best is a two - pill combination of albuterol and propranolol ( half tablet twice a day ). This will reduce or eliminate the need for albuterol and albuterol / levosalbutamol in your case.
