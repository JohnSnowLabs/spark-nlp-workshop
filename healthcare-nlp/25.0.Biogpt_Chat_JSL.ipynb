commonly used to treat emphysema? answer: Hello, There are two types of medications to treat emphysema: 1. Alpha agonists ( like albuterol or albuterol / levosalbutamol ) are used to treat symptoms of shortness of breath ( SOB ) and tightness in the chest ( tightness in chest ). These meds cause a mild to moderate increase in heart rate ( tachycardia ). 2. Beta blockers ( like propranolol or metoprolol ) are used to treat or to prevent symptoms of heart failure ( ejection fraction is 20 % or less ). These medications cause or worsen shortness of breath, tightness in chest, heart rate. You can take a combination of these medications. The combination that you will work best is a two - pill combination of albuterol and propranolol ( half tablet twice a day ). This will reduce or eliminate the need for albuterol and albuterol / levosalbutamol in your case. The other medications are used in consultation with your physician., {score -> 0.6554512}, []}]|\n","+------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n","\n"]}],"source":["TEXT = \"What medications are commonly used to treat emphysema?\"\n","\n","data = spark.createDataFrame([[TEXT]]).toDF(\"text\")\n","\n","result = model.transform(data)\n","\n","result.show(truncate=False)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":30896,"status":"ok","timestamp":1712739762312,"user":{"displayName":"Akar √ñzt√ºrk","userId":"07602883577262601067"},"user_tz":-120},"id":"s9vKgjtjIjLA","outputId":"1b6f9b9b-e72d-4c87-a183-0b3aa4925b67"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n","|result                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n","+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n","|[question: What medications are commonly used to treat emphysema? answer: Hello, There are two types of medications to treat emphysema: 1.
