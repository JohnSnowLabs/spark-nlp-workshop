With the integration of a state-of-the-art LLM, this annotator opens new possibilities for enhanced data retrieval and manipulation, streamlining your workflow and boosting efficiency.\n","\n","Also we have a new text2sql_mimicsql model that is specifically finetuned on MIMIC-III dataset schema for enhancing the precision of SQL queries derived from medical natural language queries on MIMIC dataset.\n","\n","In addition, we introduced a model can generate SQL queries from natural questions and custom database schemas with a single table.
