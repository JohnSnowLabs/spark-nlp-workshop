cholangiopancreatography with brush cytology and biopsy.\\n(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\\nPROCEDURE: Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with brush cytology and biopsy.INDICATION FOR THE PROCEDURE: Patient with a history of chronic abdominal pain and CT showing evidence of chronic pancreatitis, with a recent upper endoscopy showing an abnormal-appearing ampulla.MEDICATIONS: General anesthesia.The risks of the procedure were made aware to the patient and consisted of medication reaction, bleeding, perforation, aspiration, and post ERCP pancreatitis.DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: After informed consent and appropriate sedation, the duodenoscope was inserted into the oropharynx, down the esophagus, and into the stomach. The scope was then advanced through the pylorus to the ampulla. The ampulla had a markedly abnormal appearance, as it was enlarged and very prominent. It extended outward with an almost polypoid shape. It had what appeared to be adenomatous-appearing mucosa on the tip. There also was ulceration noted on the tip of this ampulla. The biliary and pancreatic orifices were identified. This was located not at the tip of the ampulla, but rather more towards the base. Cannulation was performed with a Wilson-Cooke TriTome sphincterotome with easy cannulation of the biliary tree. The common bile duct was mildly dilated, measuring approximately 12 mm. The intrahepatic ducts were minimally dilated. There were no filling defects identified. There was felt to be a possible stricture within the distal common bile duct, but this likely represented an anatomic variant given the abnormal shape of the ampulla. The patient has no evidence of obstruction based on lab work and clinically. Nevertheless, it was decided to proceed with brush cytology of this segment. This was done without any complications. There was adequate drainage of the biliary tree noted throughout the procedure. Multiple efforts were made to access the pancreatic ductal anatomy; however, because of the shape of the ampulla, this was unsuccessful. Efforts were made to proceed in a long scope position, but still were unsuccessful. Next, biopsies were obtained of the ampulla away from the biliary orifice. Four biopsies were taken. There was some minor oozing which had ceased by the end of the procedure. The stomach was then decompressed and the endoscope was withdrawn.\\nFINDINGS:1. Abnormal papilla with bulging, polypoid appearance, and looks adenomatous with ulceration on the tip; biopsies taken.2. Cholangiogram reveals mildly dilated common bile duct measuring 12 mm and possible distal CBD stricture, although I think this is likely an anatomic variant; brush cytology obtained.3. Unable to access the pancreatic duct.RECOMMENDATIONS:1. NPO except ice chips today.2. Will proceed with MRCP to better delineate pancreatic ductal anatomy.3. Follow up biopsies and cytology.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n","|#66927    |Urology                  |Urology_103.txt                 |\\nMedical Specialty:Urology\\nSample Name: Orchiopexy & Herniorrhaphy - 1\\nDescription: Right undescended testicle.

Right orchiopexy.2. Right herniorrhaphy.ANESTHESIA:  LMA.\\nESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:  Minimal.SPECIMEN:  Sac.BRIEF HISTORY:  This is a 10-year-old male who presented to us with his mom with consultation from Craig Connor at Cottonwood with right undescended testis. The patient and mother had seen the testicle in the right hemiscrotum in the past, but the testicle seemed to be sliding. The testis was identified right at the external inguinal ring. The testis was unable to be brought down into the scrotal sac. The patient could have had sliding testicle in the past and now the testis has become undescended as the child has grown. Options such as watchful waiting and wait for puberty to stimulate the descent of the testicle, HCG stimulation, orchiopexy were discussed. Risk of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, hernia, etc. were discussed. The patient and parents understood and wanted to proceed with right orchiopexy and herniorrhaphy.PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  The patient was brought to the OR, anesthesia was applied. The patient was placed in supine position. The patient was prepped and draped in the inguinal and scrotal area. After the patient was prepped and draped, an inguinal incision was made on the right side about 1 cm away for the anterior superior iliac spine going towards the external ring over the inguinal canal. The incision came through the subcutaneous tissue and external oblique fascia was identified. The external oblique fascia was opened sharply and was taken all the way down towards the external ring. The ilioinguinal nerve was identified right underneath the external oblique fascia, which was preserved and attention was drawn throughout the entire case to ensure that it was not under any tension or pinched or got hooked in the suture. After dissecting proximally, the testis was identified in the distal end of the inguinal canal. The testis was pulled up. The cremasteric muscle was divided and dissection was carried all the way up to the internal inguinal ring. There was very small hernia, which was removed and was tied at the base. PDS suture was used to tie this hernia sac all the way up to the base. There was a Y right at the vas and cord indicating there was enough length into the scrotal sac. The testis was easily brought down into the scrotal sac. One centimeter superior scrotal incision was made and a Dartos pouch was created. The testicle was brought down into the pouch and was placed into the pouch. Careful attention was done to ensure that there was no torsion of the cord. The vas was medial all the way throughout and the cord was lateral all the way throughout. The epididymis was in the posterolateral location. The testicle was pexed using 4-0 Vicryl into the scrotal sac. Skin was closed using 5-0 Monocryl. The external oblique fascia was closed using 2-0 PDS. Attention was drawn to re-create the external inguinal ring. A small finger was easily placed in the external inguinal ring to ensure that there was no tightening of the cord. Marcaine 0.25% was applied, about 15 mL worth of this was applied for local anesthesia. After closing the external oblique fascia, the Scarpa was brought together using 4-0 Vicryl and the skin was closed using 5-0 Monocryl in subcuticular fashion. Dermabond and Steri-Strips were applied.The patient was brought to recovery room in stable condition at the end of the procedure.\\nPlease note that the testicle was viable. It was smaller than the other side, probably by 50%. There were no palpable testicular masses. Plan was for the patient to follow up with us in about 1 month. The patient was told not to do any heavy lifting for at least 3 months, okay to shower in 48 hours. No tub bath for 2 months. The patient and family understood all the instructions.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n","|#66057    |General_Medicine         |General_Medicine_05.txt         |\\nMedical Specialty:General Medicine\\nSample Name: Airway Compromise & Foreign Body - ER Visit\\nDescription: The patient is a 17-year-old female, who presents to the emergency room with foreign body and airway compromise and was taken to the operating room.

She was intubated and fishbone.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for diabetes, hypertension, asthma, cholecystectomy, and total hysterectomy and cataract.ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Prevacid, Humulin, Diprivan, Proventil, Unasyn, and Solu-Medrol.FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.\\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  Negative for illicit drugs, alcohol, and tobacco.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Please see the hospital chart.LABORATORY DATA:  Please see the hospital chart.HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was taken to the operating room by Dr. X who is covering for ENT and noted that she had airway compromise and a rather large fishbone noted and that was removed. The patient was intubated and it was felt that she should be observed to see if the airway would improve upon which she could be extubated. If not she would require tracheostomy. The patient was treated with IV antibiotics and ventilatory support and at the time of this dictation, she has recently been taken to the operating room where it was felt that the airway sufficient and she was extubated. She was doing well with good p.o.s, good airway, good voice, and desiring to be discharged home. So, the patient is being prepared for discharge at this point. We will have Dr. X evaluate her before she leaves to make sure I do not have any problem with her going home. Dr. Y feels she could be discharged today and will have her return to see him in a week.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n","|#47311    |Emergency_Room_Reports   |Emergency_Room_Reports_71.txt   |\\nMedical Specialty:Emergency Room Reports\\nSample Name: Testicular Pain\\nDescription: The patient has a possibly torsion detorsion versus other acute testicular problem.\\n(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\\nCHIEF COMPLAINT:  Testicular pain.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is a 4-year-old boy with a history of abrupt onset of left testicular pain at 11:30 this morning. He was unable to walk and would not stand upright, and had fairly significant discomfort, so the parents checked his panel because of it. Because of this, they took him to Emergency Department, at which time, he had no swelling noted initially, but very painful. He had no voiding or stooling problems. No nausea, vomiting or fever. Family denies trauma or dysuria. At that time, he was going to get an ultrasound done, but the mother said that all of sudden the patient stated the pain had resolved. He has had hot chocolate this morning at 10:30 in the morning and water around 2:30 in the morning. He has not had any pain since but states that he has had pain in the past, not as long and states there was a twisting sensation. He has no recent cold or flu, although he had rhinorrhea about 3 weeks ago. He is on no medications and he is here for evaluation.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: The patient has no known allergies. He is term delivery via spontaneous vaginal delivery. He has had no problems or hospitalizations with circumcision.PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  He has had no previous surgeries.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: All 14-point review of systems were negative except for the above left testicular pain and the history of possible upper respiratory infection about 2 to 3 weeks ago.\\nIMMUNIZATIONS:  Up-to-date.FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient lives at home with both parents who are Spanish speaking. He is not in school.MEDICATIONS: He is on no medications.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:VITAL SIGNS: On physical exam, weight is 15.9 kg.GENERAL: The patient is a cooperative little boy.HEENT: Normal head and neck exam. No oral or nasal discharge.\\nNECK: Without masses.CHEST: Without masses.LUNGS: Clear.CARDIAC: Without murmurs or gallops.ABDOMEN: Soft. No masses or tenderness. His scrotum did not have any swelling at the present time. There was only minimal discomfort with palpation at the left inguinal area, but no masses were noted. No palpable nodules such as appendix testis and no swelling was noted and he had mild epididymal swelling only. His left testis was slightly harder than the right, but this was not very significant.EXTREMITIES: He had full range of motion in all 4 extremities.SKIN: Warm, pink, and dry.NEUROLOGIC: Grossly intact.LABORATORY DATA:  Ultrasound was obtained today showing no blood flow or poor blood flow on the left except for increased blood flow to the epididymis on the study done at about 1330 hours, and second one done around 1630 hours was normal flow, possible increased flow on the left. This is personally reviewed by me. The right was normal. No masses were appreciated. There was some mild change in echotexture on the left on the initial study, which had apparently resolved on the second, but may be due to the technical aspects of the study.\\nASSESSMENT/PLAN:  The patient has a possibly torsion detorsion versus other acute testicular problem. If the patient has indeed testicular torsion, there is an increased possibility that it may reoccur again, actually within the first 24 to 36 hours and as such is recommended doing a left scrotal exploration with possible detorsion of left testis, possible orchiectomy if the testis is markedly abnormal or nonviable, which probably is not the case, and bilateral testes fixation if the torsion is found. I discussed the pre and postsurgical care with the parents.

Right temporal bone resection; rectus abdominis myocutaneous free flap for reconstruction of skull base defect; right selective neck dissection zones 2 and 3.\\n(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\\nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Squamous cell carcinoma of right temporal bone/middle ear space.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Squamous cell carcinoma of right temporal bone/middle ear space.PROCEDURE:  Right temporal bone resection; rectus abdominis myocutaneous free flap for reconstruction of skull base defect; right selective neck dissection zones 2 and 3.ANESTHESIA:  General endotracheal.DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was brought into the operating room, placed on the table in supine position. General endotracheal anesthesia was obtained in the usual fashion. The Neurosurgery team placed the patient in pins and after they positioned the patient the right lateral scalp was prepped with Betadine after shave as well as the abdomen. The neck was prepped as well. After this was performed, I made a wide ellipse of the conchal bowl with the Bovie and cutting current down through the cartilage of the conchal bowl. A wide postauricular incision well beyond the mastoid tip extending into the right neck was then incised with the Bovie with the cutting current and a postauricular skin flap developed leaving the excise conchal bowl in place as the auricle was reflected over anterior to the condyle. After this was performed, I used the Bovie to incise the soft tissue around the temporal bone away from the tumor on to the mandible. The condyle was skeletonized so that it could be easily seen. The anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid was dissected out and the spinal accessory nerve was identified and spared. The neck contents to the hyoid were dissected out. The hypoglossal nerve, vagus nerve, and spinal accessory nerve were dissected towards the jugular foramen. The neck contents were removed as a separate specimen. The external carotid artery was identified and tied off as it entered the parotid and tied with a Hemoclip distally for the future anastomosis. A large posterior facial vein was identified and likewise clipped for later use. I then used the cutting and diamond burs to incise the skull above the external auditory canal so as to expose the dura underneath this and extended it posteriorly to the sigmoid sinus, dissecting or exposing the dura to the level of the jugular bulb. It became evident there was two tumor extending down the eustachian tube medial to the condyle and therefore I did use the router, I mean the side cutting bur to resect the condyle and the glenoid fossa to expose the medial extent of the eustachian tube. The internal carotid artery was dissected out of the parapharyngeal space into the carotid canal and I drilled carotid canal up until it made. I dissected the vertical segment of the carotid out as it entered the temporal bone until it made us turn to the horizontal portion. Once this was dissected out, Dr. X entered the procedure for completion of the resection with the craniotomy. For details, please see his operative note.\\nAfter Dr. X had completed the resection, I then harvested the rectus free flap. A skin paddle was drawn out next to the umbilicus about 4 x 4 cm. The skin paddle was incised with the Bovie and down to the anterior rectus sheath. Sagittal incisions were made up superiorly and inferiorly to the skin paddle and the anterior rectus sheath dissected out above and below the skin paddle. The sheath was incised to the midline and a small ellipse was made around the fascia to provide blood supply to the overlying skin. The skin paddle was then sutured to the fascia and muscle with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl. The anterior rectus sheath was then reflected off the rectus muscle, which was then divided superiorly with the Bovie and reflected out of the rectus sheath to an inferior direction. The vascular pedicle could be seen entering the muscle in usual fashion. The muscle was divided inferior to the pedicle and then the pedicle was dissected to the groin to the external iliac artery and vein where it was ligated with two large Hemoclips on each vessel. The wound was then packed with saline impregnated sponges. The rectus muscle with attached skin paddle was then transferred into the neck. The inferior epigastric artery was sutured to the end of the external carotid with interrupted 9-0 Ethilon with standard microvascular technique. Ischemia time was less than 10 minutes. Likewise, the inferior epigastric vein was sutured to the end of the posterior facial vein with interrupted 9-0 Ethilon as well. There was excellent blood flow through the flap and there were no or any issues with the vascular pedicle throughout the remainder of the case. The wound was irrigated with copious amounts of saline. The eustachian tube was obstructed with bone wax. The muscle was then laid into position with the skin paddle underneath the conchal bowl. I removed most the skin of the conchal bowl de-epithelializing and leaving the fat in place. The wound was closed in layers overlying the muscle, which was secured superiorly to the muscle overlying the temporal skull. The subcutaneous tissues were closed with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl. The skin was closed with skin staples. There was small incision made in the postauricular skin where the muscle could be seen and the skin edges were sewn directly to the muscle as to the rectus muscle itself. The skin paddle was closed with interrupted 4-0 Prolene to the edges of the conchal bowl.The abdomen was irrigated with copious amounts of saline and the rectus sheath was closed with #1 Prolene with the more running suture, taking care to avoid injury to the posterior rectus sheath by the use of ribbon retractors. The subcutaneous tissues were closed with interrupted 2-0 Vicryl and skin was closed with skin staples. The patient was then turned over to the Neurosurgery team for awakening after the patient was appropriately awakened. The patient was then transferred to the PACU in stable condition with spontaneous respirations, having tolerated the procedure well.\\n|\n","|#50036    |SOAP_Chart_Progress_Notes|SOAP_Chart_Progress_Notes_46.txt|\\nMedical Specialty:SOAP / Chart / Progress Notes\\nSample Name: Dietary Consult - Hyperlipidemia\\nDescription: Followup dietary consultation for hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and possible metabolic syndrome\\n(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\\nSUBJECTIVE: This is a followup dietary consultation for hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and possible metabolic syndrome. The patient reports that she has worked hard for a number of weeks following the meal plan prescribed, but felt like she was gaining weight and not losing weight on it. She is not sure that she was following it accurately. She is trying to walk 1-1/2 to 2 miles every other day, but is increasing her time in the garden and doing other yard work as well. Once she started experiencing some weight gain, she went back to her old South Beach Diet and felt like she was able to take some of that weight off. However she realizes that the South Beach Diet is not a healthy diet for her and so is coming back for better instruction on safe weight loss and low-fat eating.OBJECTIVE: Weight is 275 pounds. Food records were reviewed.ASSESSMENT: The patient experienced a weight gain of 2 pounds since our last consultation which was two months ago. I did carefully review her food records and evaluated calories consumed. While she was carefully tracking the volume of protein and carbohydrates, she was getting some excess calories from the fatty proteins selected. Thus we rearranged her meal plan a little bit and talked about how to track her fat calories as well. She was more open to reducing the amount of protein from the previous meal plan and increasing slightly the amount of carbohydrates. While this still is not as much carbohydrate as I would normally recommend, I am certainly willing to work with her on how she feels her body best handles weight reduction. We also discussed a snack that could be eliminated in the morning because she really is not hungry at that time.PLAN: A new 1500 calorie meal plan was developed based on 35% of the calories coming from protein, 40% of the calories from carbohydrate, and 25% of the calories from fat. This translates in to 10 servings at 15 grams a piece of carbohydrates throughout the day dividing them in to groups of two servings per meal and per snack. This also translates in to 2 ounces of protein at breakfast, 6 ounces at lunch, 2 ounces in the afternoon snack, 6 ounces at supper, and 2 ounces in the evening snack. We have eliminated the morning snack. The patient will now track the grams of fat in her meats as well as added fats. Her goal for total fats over the course of the day is no more than 42 grams of fat per day. This was a half hour consultation. We will plan to see the patient back in one month for support.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n","|#15209    |Cardiovascular_Pulmonary |Cardiovascular_Pulmonary_44.txt |\\nMedical Specialty:Cardiovascular / Pulmonary\\nSample Name: Bronchoscopy & Foreign Body Removal\\nDescription:  Plastic piece foreign body in the right main stem bronchus.

The patient had a chest x-ray and based on that there is concern by the Radiology it could be a foreign body in the right main stem. The patient has been taken to the operating room for rigid bronchoscopy and foreign body removal.DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was taken to the operating room, placed supine, put under general mask anesthesia. Using a 3.5 rigid bronchoscope we visualized between the cords into the trachea. There were some secretions but that looked okay. Got down at the level of the carina to see a foreign body flapping in the right main stem. I then used graspers to grasp to try to pull into the scope itself. I could not do that, I thus had to pull the scope out along with the foreign body that was held on to with a grasper. It appeared to be consisting of some type of plastic piece that had broke off some different object. I took the scope and put it back down into the airway again. Again, there was secretion in the trachea that we suctioned out. We looked down into the right bronchus intermedius. There was no other pathology noted, just some irritation in the right main stem area. I looked down the left main stem as well and that looked okay as well. I then withdrew the scope. Trachea looked fine as well as the cords. I put the patient back on mask oxygen to wake the patient up. The patient tolerated the procedure well.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n","|#46409    |Surgery                  |Surgery_450.txt                 |\\nMedical Specialty:Surgery\\nSample Name: Esophagogastroduodenoscopy - 8\\nDescription: Chronic abdominal pain and heme positive stool, antral gastritis, and duodenal polyp. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy with photos and antral biopsy.\\n(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\\nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Chronic abdominal pain and heme positive stool.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:1. Antral gastritis.2. Duodenal polyp.PROCEDURE PERFORMED: Esophagogastroduodenoscopy with photos and antral biopsy.ANESTHESIA:  Demerol and Versed.\\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:  Consent was obtained after all risks and benefits were described. The patient was brought back into the Endoscopy Suite. The aforementioned anesthesia was given. Once the patient was properly anesthetized, bite block was placed in the patient's mouth. Then, the patient was given the aforementioned anesthesia. Once he was properly anesthetized, the endoscope was placed in the patient's mouth that was brought down to the cricopharyngeus muscle into the esophagus and from the esophagus to his stomach. The air was insufflated down. The scope was passed down to the level of the antrum where there was some evidence of gastritis seen. The scope was passed into the duodenum and then duodenal sweep where there was a polyp seen. The scope was pulled back into the stomach in order to flex upon itself and straightened out. Biopsies were taken for CLO and histology of the antrum. The scope was pulled back. The junction was visualized. No other masses or lesions were seen. The scope was removed. The patient tolerated the procedure well. We will recommend the patient be on some type of a H2 blocker.

Radical Retropubic\\nDescription: Radical retropubic prostatectomy with pelvic lymph node dissection due to prostate cancer.\\n(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\\nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Prostate cancer.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Prostate cancer.OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:  Radical retropubic prostatectomy with pelvic lymph node dissection.ANESTHESIA: General epiduralESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:  800 cc.\\nCOMPLICATIONS:  None.INDICATIONS FOR SURGERY:  This is a 64-year-old man with adenocarcinoma of the prostate confirmed by needle biopsies. He has elected to undergo radical retropubic prostatectomy with pelvic lymph node dissection. Potential complications include, but are not limited to:1. Infection.2. Bleeding.3. Incontinence.4. Impotence.5. Deep venous thrombosis.6. Recurrence of the cancer.\\nPROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  Epidural anesthesia was administered by the anesthesiologist in the holding area. Preoperative antibiotic was also given in the preoperative holding area. The patient was then taken into the operating room after which general LMA anesthesia was administered. The patient was shaved and then prepped using Betadine solution. A sterile 16-French Foley catheter was inserted into the bladder with clear urine drain. A midline infraumbilical incision was performed. The rectus fascia was opened sharply. The perivesical space and the retropubic space were developed bluntly. Bookwalter retractor was then placed. Bilateral obturator pelvic lymphadenectomy was performed. The obturator nerve was identified and was untouched. The margin for the resection of the lymph node bilaterally were the Cooper's ligament, the medial edge of the external iliac artery, the bifurcation of the common iliac vein, the obturator nerve, and the bladder. Both hemostasis and lymphostasis was achieved by using silk ties and Hemo clips. The lymph nodes were palpably normal and were set for permanent section. The Bookwalter retractor was then repositioned and the endopelvic fascia was opened bilaterally using Metzenbaum scissors. The puboprostatic ligament was taken down sharply. The superficial dorsal vein complex over the prostate was bunched up by using the Allis clamp and then tied by using 2-0 silk sutures. The deep dorsal vein complex was then bunched up by using the Allis over the membranous urethral area. The dorsal vein complex was ligated by using 0 Vicryl suture on a CT-1 needle. The Allis clamp was removed and the dorsal vein complex was transected by using Metzenbaum scissors. The urethra was then identified and was dissected out. The urethral opening was made just distal to the apex of the prostate by using Metzenbaum scissors. This was extended circumferentially until the Foley catheter could be seen clearly. 2-0 Monocryl sutures were then placed on the urethral stump evenly spaced out for the anastomosis to be performed later. The Foley catheter was removed and the posteriormost aspect of urethra and rectourethralis muscle was transected. The lateral pelvic fascia was opened bilaterally to sweep the neurovascular bundles laterally on both sides. The plane between Denonvilliers' fascia and the perirectal fat was developed sharply. No tension was placed on the neurovascular bundle at any point in time. The prostate dissected off the rectal wall easily. Once the seminal vesicles were identified, the fascia covering over them were opened transversely. The seminal vesicles were dissected out and the small bleeding vessels leading to them were clipped by using medium clips and then transected. The bladder neck was then dissected out carefully to spare most of the bladder neck muscles. Once all of the prostate had been dissected off the bladder neck circumferentially the mucosa lining the bladder neck was transected releasing the entire specimen. The specimen was inspected and appeared to be completely intact. It was sent for permanent section. The bladder neck mucosa was then everted by using 4-0 chromic sutures. Inspection at the prostatic bed revealed no bleeding vessels. The sutures, which were placed previously onto the urethral stump, were then placed onto the bladder neck. Once the posterior sutures had been placed, the Foley was placed into the urethra and into the bladder neck. A 20-French Foley Catheter was used. The anterior sutures were then placed. The Foley was then inflated. The bed was straightened and the sutures were tied down sequentially from anteriorly to posteriorly. Mild traction of the Foley catheter was placed to assure the anastomosis was tight. Two #19-French Blake drains were placed in the perivesical spaces. These were anchored to the skin by using 2-0 silk sutures. The instrument counts, lab counts, and sponge counts were verified to be correct, the patient was closed. The fascia was closed in running fashion using #1 PDS. Subcutaneous tissue was closed by using 2-0 Vicryl suture. Skin was approximated by using metallic clips. The patient tolerated the operation well.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n","|#83920    |Hematology_Oncology      |Hematology_Oncology_58.txt      |\\nMedical Specialty:Hematology - Oncology\\nSample Name: Mesothelioma - Pleural Biopsy\\nDescription: Right pleural effusion and suspected malignant mesothelioma.\\n(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\\nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Right pleural effusion and suspected malignant mesothelioma.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Right pleural effusion, suspected malignant mesothelioma.PROCEDURE:  Right VATS pleurodesis and pleural biopsy.ANESTHESIA: General double-lumen endotracheal.DESCRIPTION OF FINDINGS:  Right pleural effusion, firm nodules, diffuse scattered throughout the right pleura and diaphragmatic surface.\\nSPECIMEN:  Pleural biopsies for pathology and microbiology.ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS:  Minimal.FLUIDS:  Crystalloid 1.2 L and 1.9 L of pleural effusion drained.INDICATIONS:  Briefly, this is a 66-year-old gentleman who has been transferred from an outside hospital after a pleural effusion had been drained and biopsies taken from the right chest that were thought to be consistent with mesothelioma. Upon transfer, he had a right pleural effusion demonstrated on x-ray as well as some shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion. The risks, benefits, and alternatives to right VATS pleurodesis and pleural biopsy were discussed with the patient and his family and they wished to proceed.PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: After informed consent was obtained, the patient was brought to the operating room and placed in supine position. A double-lumen endotracheal tube was placed. SCDs were also placed and he was given preoperative Kefzol. The patient was then brought into the right side up, left decubitus position, and the area was prepped and draped in the usual fashion. A needle was inserted in the axillary line to determine position of the effusion. At this time, a 10-mm port was placed using the knife and Bovie cautery. The effusion was drained by placing a sucker into this port site. Upon feeling the surface of the pleura, there were multiple firm nodules. An additional anterior port was then placed in similar fashion. The effusion was then drained with a sucker. Multiple pleural biopsies were taken with the biopsy device in all areas of the pleura. Of note, feeling the diaphragmatic surface, it appeared that it was quite nodular, but these nodules felt as though they were on the other side of the diaphragm and not on the pleural surface of the diaphragm concerning for a possibly metastatic disease. This will be worked up with further imaging study later in his hospitalization. After the effusion had been drained, 2 cans of talc pleurodesis aerosol were used to cover the lung and pleural surface with talc. The lungs were then inflated and noted to inflate well. A 32 curved chest tube chest tube was placed and secured with nylon. The other port site was closed at the level of the fascia with 2-0 Vicryl and then 4-0 Monocryl for the skin. The patient was then brought in the supine position and extubated and brought to recovery room in stable condition.\\nDr. X was present for the entire procedure which was right VATS pleurodesis and
