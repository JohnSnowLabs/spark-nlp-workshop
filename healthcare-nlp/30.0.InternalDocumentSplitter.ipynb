at nighttime that comes and goes, radiates from her buttocks to her legs, sometimes in her ankle.\\n(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\\nCHIEF COMPLAINT: Leg pain.HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 56-year-old female who has pain in her legs at nighttime and when she gets up it comes and goes, radiates from her buttocks to her legs, sometimes it is her ankle. She has noticed it since she has been on Lipitor. She has had some night sweats occasionally. She has had a little bit of fever and nausea. She has noticed her blood sugars have been low. She has lost over 30 pounds after exercising doing water aerobics at Genesis in Wichita. She has noticed her fasting blood sugars have been ranging from 100 to 120. Blood sugars one and a half hours after meals have been 185. She is coming in for a diabetic checkup in one month and wants lab prior to that time. She has been eating more meat recently and has not been on a diet for cholesterol.CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Include Lipitor 80 mg q.d. discontinued today, Vioxx 25 mg q.d., Maxzide 37/25 q.d., Protonix 40 mg q.d., hydroxyzine pamoate 50 mg at h.s., aspirin 81 mg q.d., Glucovance 1.25/250 b.i.d. decreased to one a day today, Monopril 20 mg q.d., estradiol one mg q.d., and glucosamine 1000 mg q.d.ALLERGIES: Cipro, sulfa, Bactrim, and Demerol.OBJECTIVE:Vital Signs: Weight is 248 pounds which is a 12-pound drop from January. Blood pressure 120/70. Pulse 68.\\nGeneral: This is a well-developed adult female, awake, alert, and in no acute distress.HEENT: Oropharynx and HEENT are within normal limits.Lungs: Clear.Heart: Regular rhythm and rate.Abdomen: Soft, nontender, and nondistended without organomegaly.GU: Palpation of femurs do not cause pain, rotation of hips do not cause pain, and compression of the hips do not cause pain.Neurologic: Deep tendon reflexes are normal.Extremities: Pulses in lower extremities are normal. Straight leg lifts are normal.ASSESSMENT/PLAN:\\n1. Leg pain/bone pain, I am going to check her CMP. I think this possibly is a side effect from Lipitor. We will stop Lipitor, have her follow up in one month which she has already got planned for diabetes appointment and check symptoms at that time. Certainly if her pain improves might consider something like Crestor, which is more water soluble, which may cause less adverse effects. We will check her comprehensive metabolic panel to make sure the alkaline phosphatase is okay, may need an x-ray of back, hip, and legs at that time if symptoms are not gone.2. Hypercholesterolemia, this is somewhat bothersome as she is a diabetic. Did discuss with her that we need to stick to the diet especially after going off of Lipitor. We will see how she does with her bone pain/leg pain off of Lipitor. If she has improvement may consider Crestor in one month. I am going to check her lipid panel and a CMP. Apparently, she is going to get this at a different site, Mapleridge in Wichita.3. Type II diabetes. We will decrease her Glucovance because she is having frequent low blood sugars. Her previous hemoglobin A1c was 5.6 so we will see if this improves her symptoms. I am also going to check a hemoglobin A1c at Mapleridge in Wichita and have a followup here in one month for that diabetes appointment.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n","|#41818    |Surgery                  |Surgery_984.txt                 |\\nMedical Specialty:Surgery\\nSample Name: Teeth Extraction & I&D - 1\\nDescription: Extraction of teeth #2 and #19 and incision and drainage (I&D) of intraoral and extraoral of left mandibular dental abscess.\\n(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\\nPREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES:  Carious teeth #2 and #19 and left mandibular dental abscess.POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES: Carious teeth #2 and #19 and left mandibular dental abscess.PROCEDURES: Extraction of teeth #2 and #19 and incision and drainage of intraoral and extraoral of left mandibular dental abscess.ANESTHESIA:  General, oral endotracheal.COMPLICATIONS:  None.\\nDRAINS:  Penrose 0.25 inch intraoral and vestibule and extraoral.CONDITION: Stable to PACU.DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: Patient was brought to the operating room, placed on the table in the supine position and after demonstration of an adequate plane of general anesthesia via the oral endotracheal route, patient was prepped and draped in the usual fashion for an intraoral procedure. In addition, the extraoral area on the left neck was prepped with Betadine and draped accordingly. Gauze throat pack was placed and local anesthetic was administered in the left lower quadrant, total of 3.4 mL of lidocaine 2% with 1:100,000 epinephrine and Marcaine 1.7 mL of 0.5% with 1:200,000 epinephrine. An incision was made with #15 blade in the left submandibular area through the skin and blunt dissection was accomplished with curved mosquito hemostat to the inferior border of the mandible. No purulent drainage was obtained. The 0.25 inch Penrose drain was then placed in the extraoral incision and it was secured with 3-0 silk suture. Moving to the intraoral area, periosteal elevator was used to elevate the periosteum from the buccal aspect of tooth #19. The area did not drain any purulent material. The carious tooth #19 was then extracted by elevator and forceps extraction. After the tooth was removed, the 0.25 inch Penrose drain was placed in a subperiosteal fashion adjacent to the extraction site and secured with 3-0 silk suture. The tube was then repositioned to the left side allowing access to the upper right quadrant where tooth #2 was then extracted by routine elevator and forceps extraction. After the extraction, the throat pack was removed. An orogastric tube was then placed by Dr. X, and stomach contents were suctioned. The pharynx was then suctioned with the Yankauer suction. The patient was awakened, extubated, and taken to the PACU in stable condition. \\n

Specialty:Consult - History and Phy.\\nSample Name: Orthopedic Consult - 2\\nDescription: Degenerative disk disease of the right hip, low back pain with lumbar scoliosis post laminectomy syndrome, lumbar spinal stenosis, facet and sacroiliac joint syndrome, and post left hip arthroplasty.\\n(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\\nSUBJECTIVE: The patient comes back to see me today. She is a pleasant 77-year-old Caucasian female who had seen Dr. XYZ with right leg pain. She has a history of prior laminectomy for spinal stenosis. She has seen Dr. XYZ with low back pain and lumbar scoliosis post laminectomy syndrome, lumbar spinal stenosis, and clinical right L2 radiculopathy, which is symptomatic. Dr. XYZ had performed two right L2-L3 transforaminal epidural injections, last one in March 2005. She was subsequently seen and Dr. XYZ found most of her remaining symptoms are probably coming from her right hip. An x-ray of the hip showed marked degenerative changes with significant progression of disease compared to 08/04/2004 study. Dr. XYZ had performed right intraarticular hip injection on 04/07/2005. She was last seen on 04/15/2005. At that time, she had the hip injection that helped her briefly with her pain. She is not sure whether or not she wants to proceed with hip replacement. We recommend she start using a cane and had continued her on some pain medicines.The patient comes back to see me today. She continues to complain of significant pain in her right hip, especially with weightbearing or with movement. She said she had made an appointment to see an orthopedic surgeon in Newton as it is closer and more convenient for her. She is taking Ultracet or other the generic it sounds like, up to four times daily. She states she can take this much more frequently as she still has significant pain symptoms. She is using a cane to help her ambulate.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Essentially unchanged from her visit of 04/15/2005.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:General: Reveals a pleasant Caucasian female.Vital Signs: Height is 5 feet 4 inches. Weight is 149 pounds. She is afebrile.HEENT: Benign.\\nNeck: Shows functional range of movements with a negative Spurling's.Musculoskeletal: Examination shows some mild degenerative joint disease of both knees with grade weakness of her right hip flexors and half-grade weakness of her right hip adductors and right quadriceps, as compared to the left. Straight leg raises are negative bilaterally. Posterior tibials are palpable bilaterally.Skin and Lymphatics: Examination of the skin does not reveal any additional scars, rashes, cafe au lait spots or ulcers. No significant lymphadenopathy noted.Spine: Examination shows lumbar scoliosis with surgical scar with no major tenderness. Spinal movements are limited but functional.Neurological: She is alert and oriented with appropriate mood and affect. She has normal tone and coordination. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical. Sensations are intact to pinprick.FUNCTIONAL EXAMINATION: Gait has a normal stance and swing phase with no antalgic component to it.IMPRESSION:1. Degenerative disk disease of the right hip, symptomatic.\\n2. Low back syndrome, lumbar spinal stenosis, clinically right L2 radiculopathy, stable.3. Low back pain with lumbar scoliosis post laminectomy syndrome, stable.4. Facet and sacroiliac joint syndrome on the right, stable.5. Post left hip arthroplasty.6. Chronic pain syndrome.RECOMMENDATIONS: The patient is symptomatic primarily on her right hip and is planning on seeing an orthopedic surgeon for possible right hip replacement. In the interim, her Ultracet is not quite taking care of her pain. I have asked her to discontinue it and we will start her on Tylenol #3, up to four times a day. I have written a prescription for this for 120 tablets and two refills. The patient will call for the refills when she needs them. I will plan further follow up in six months, sooner if needed. She voiced understanding and is in agreement with this plan. Physical exam findings, history of present illness and recommendations were performed with and in agreement with Dr. Goel's findings.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n","|#99145    |Discharge_Summary        |Discharge_Summary_09.txt        |\\nMedical Specialty:Discharge Summary\\nSample Name: Chest Pain & Respiratory Insufficiency\\nDescription: A lady was admitted to the hospital with chest pain and respiratory insufficiency.

This demonstrated patent vein grafts and patent internal mammary vessel and so there was no obvious new disease.She may continue in the future to have angina and she will have nitroglycerin available for that if needed.Her blood pressure has been elevated and so instead of metoprolol, we have started her on Coreg 6.25 mg b.i.d. This should be increased up to 25 mg b.i.d. as preferred antihypertensive in this lady's case. She also is on an ACE inhibitor.So her discharge meds are as follows:1. Coreg 6.25 mg b.i.d.\\n2. Simvastatin 40 mg nightly.3. Lisinopril 5 mg b.i.d.4. Protonix 40 mg a.m.5. Aspirin 160 mg a day.6. Lasix 20 mg b.i.d.7. Spiriva puff daily.8. Albuterol p.r.n. q.i.d.9. Advair 500/50 puff b.i.d.10. Xopenex q.i.d. and p.r.n.\\nI will see her in a month to six weeks. She is to follow up with Dr. X before that.\\n

Pulmonary\\nSample Name: Lexiscan Nuclear Scan\\nDescription: Lexiscan Nuclear Myocardial Perfusion Scan. Chest pain. Patient unable to walk on a treadmill. Nondiagnostic Lexiscan. Normal nuclear myocardial perfusion scan.\\n(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\\nEXAM: Lexiscan Nuclear Myocardial Perfusion Scan.INDICATION: Chest pain.TYPE OF TEST: Lexiscan, unable to walk on a treadmill.INTERPRETATION:  Resting heart rate of 96, blood pressure of 141/76. EKG, normal sinus rhythm, nonspecific ST-T changes, left bundle branch block. Post Lexiscan 0.4 mg injected intravenously by standard protocol. Peak heart rate was 105, blood pressure of 135/72. EKG remains the same. No symptoms are noted.SUMMARY:1. Nondiagnostic Lexiscan.\\n2. Nuclear interpretation as below.NUCLEAR MYOCARDIAL PERFUSION SCAN WITH STANDARD PROTOCOL: Resting and stress images were obtained with 10.4, 32.5 mCi of tetrofosmin injected intravenously by standard protocol. Myocardial perfusion scan demonstrates homogeneous and uniform distribution of the tracer uptake. There is no evidence of reversible or fixed defect. Gated SPECT revealed mild global hypokinesis, more pronounced in the septal wall possibly secondary to prior surgery. Ejection fraction calculated at 41%. End-diastolic volume of 115, end-systolic volume of 68.IMPRESSION:1. Normal nuclear myocardial perfusion scan.2. Ejection fraction 41% by gated SPECT.\\n

Specialty:Consult - History and Phy.\\nSample Name: Consult - Alzheimer disease\\nDescription: Patient with a history of mesothelioma and likely mild dementia, most likely Alzheimer type.\\n(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\\nThe patient states that she has been having some problems with her memory for maybe the past year or two. She states that they have been slowly progressive. She had a consultation with an outside neurologist and was told that she likely has Alzheimer disease and was prescribed Aricept and was told that she should not drive. Per the dictation that is available to us in clinic, it appears that she was before a DMV. It appears that the patient wanted a second opinion, so she now presents for consultation on possible Alzheimer disease.The patient states that she has been doing fairly well at home. She balances her own checkbook. She does not do her own taxes, but she has never done so in the past. She states that she has no problems with cooking meals, getting her own meals, and she is still currently driving. She denies burning any dishes because she forgot them on the stove or forgetting what she is doing in the middle of a task or getting lost while she is driving around or getting lost in her own home. She states that she is very good remembering the names of her family members and does not forget important birthdays such as the date of birth of her grandchildren. She is unfortunately living alone, and although she seems to miss her grandchildren and is estranged from her son, she denies any symptoms of frank depression. There is unfortunately no one available to us to corroborate how well she is doing at home. She lives alone and takes care of herself and does not communicate very much with her brother and sister. She also does not communicate very much with her son who lives in Santa Cruz or her grandchildren. She denied any sort of personality change, paranoid ideas or hallucinations. She does appear to have headaches that can be severe about four times a month and have primarily photophobia and some nausea and occasionally emesis associated with it. When these headaches are very severe, she goes to the emergency room to get a single shot. She is unclear if this is some sort of a migraine medication or just a primary pain medication. She takes Fiorinal for these headaches and she states that this helps greatly. She denies visual or migraine symptoms.REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Negative for any sort of focal neurologic deficits such as weakness, numbness, visual changes, dysarthria, diplopia or dysphagia. She also denies any sort of movement disorders, tremors, rigidities or clonus. Her personal opinion is that some of her memory problems may be due to simply to her age and/or nervousness. She is unclear as if her memory is any worse than anyone else in her age group.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for mesothelioma, which was diagnosed seemingly more than 20 to 25 years ago. The patient was not sure of exactly when it was diagnosed. This has been treated surgically by debulking operations for which she states that she has undergone about 10 operations. The mesothelioma is in her abdomen. She does not know of any history of having lung mesothelioma. She states that she has never gotten chemotherapy or radiation for her mesothelioma. Furthermore, she states that her last surgical debulking was more than 10 years ago and her disease has been fairly stable. She does have a history of three car accidents that she says were all rear-enders where she was hit while essentially in a stopped position. These have all occurred over the past five years. She also has a diagnosis of dementing illness, possibly Alzheimer disease from her previous neurology consultation. This diagnosis was given in March 2006.MEDICATIONS: Fiorinal, p.r.n. aspirin, unclear if baby or full sized, Premarin unclear of the dose.\\nALLERGIES: NONE.SOCIAL HISTORY: Significant for her being without a companion at this point. She was born in Munich, Germany. She immigrated to of America in 1957 after her family had to move to Eastern Germany, which was under Russian occupation at that time. She is divorced. She used to work as a secretary and later worked as a clerical worker at IBM. She stopped working more than 20 years ago due to complications from her mesothelioma. She denies any significant tobacco, alcohol or illicit drugs. She is bilingual speaking, German and English. She has known English from before her teens. She has the equivalent of a high school education in Germany. She has one brother and one sister, both of whom are healthy and she does not spend much time communicating with them. She has one son who lives in Santa Cruz. He has grandchildren. She is trying to contact with her grandchildren.FAMILY HISTORY:  Significant for lung, liver, and prostate cancer. Her mother died in her 80s of \"old age,\" but it appears that she may have had a mild dementing illness at that time. Whatever that dementing illness was, appears to have started mostly in her 80s per the patient. No one else appears to have Alzheimer disease including her brother and sister.PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her blood pressure is 152/92, pulse 80, and weight 80.7 kg. She is alert and well nourished in no apparent distress. She occasionally fumbles with questions of orientation, missing the day and the date. She also did not know the name of the hospital, she thought it was O'Connor and she thought she was in Orange County and also did not know the floor of the hospital that we are in. She lost three points for recall. Even with prompting, she could not remember the objects that she was given to remember. Her Mini Mental Score was 22/30. There were no naming problems or problems with repetition. There were also no signs of dysarthria. Her pupils were bilaterally reactive to light and accommodation. Her extraocular movements were intact. Her visual fields were full to confrontation. Her sensations of her face, arm, and leg were normal. There were no signs of neglect with double simultaneous stimulation. Tongue was midline. Her palate was symmetric. Her face was symmetric as well. Strength was approximately 5/5. She did have some right knee pain and she had a mildly antalgic gait due to her right knee pain. Her reflexes were symmetric and +2 except for her toes, which were +1 to trace. Her plantar reflexes were mute. Her sensation was normal for pain, temperature, and vibration. There were no signs of ataxia on finger-to-nose and there was no dysdiadochokinesia. Gait was narrow and she could toe walk briefly and heel walk without difficulty.SUMMARY: Ms. A is a pleasant 72-year-old right-handed woman with a history of mesothelioma that appears stable at this time and likely mild dementia, most likely Alzheimer type. We tactfully discussed the patient's diagnosis with her, and she felt reassured. We told her that this most likely was in the earlier stages of disease and she would benefit from trying Aricept. She stated that she did not have the prescription anymore from her outpatient neurology consult for the Aricept, so we wrote her another prescription for Aricept. The patient herself seemed very concerned about the stigma of the disease, but our lengthy discussion, expressed genuine understanding as to why her outpatient physician had reported her to DMV. It was explicitly told to not drive by her outpatient neurologist and we concur with this assessment. She will follow up with us in the next six months and will call us if she has any problems with the Aricept. She was written for Aricept to start at 5 mg for three weeks, and if she has no side effects which typically are GI side effects, then she can go up to 10 mg a day. We also reviewed with Ms. A the findings for outpatient MRI, which showed some mild atrophy per report and also that her metabolic workup, which included an RPR, TSH, and B12 were all within normal limits.\\n|\n","|#87166    |Consult_History_and_Phy. |Consult_History_and_Phy._489.txt|\\nMedical Specialty:Consult - History and Phy.\\nSample Name: Tongue Swelling\\nDescription: A 54-year-old patient, here for evaluation of new-onset swelling of the tongue.\\n(Medical Transcription Sample Report)\\nREASON FOR ADMISSION:  A 54-year-old patient, here for evaluation of new-onset swelling of the tongue.PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:1.
